Have going here for 4years. The new venue is very nice.  Dennis has risen to the occasion. As he says :\"cooking is his passion\", The items on the menu prove it.  The lamb has wonderful flavor, crisp bark, and very ample size. The presentation and colour enhance the taste.\nPork chops ar ed not dry, the accompanin g garlic noodle complement the me as l.  Like the lamb the presentation is very nice.\nWe just love this place.
