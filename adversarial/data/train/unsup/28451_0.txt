I called then because I saw they had a coupon that they would honor any competitors coupon and offer 5% less. So I had a coupon from a competitor for a 49.95 wheel alignment. And the man said yea I'm aware of your coupon and our 5% off coupon but I can't give it to you for less then 89.95? So he basically told me were not honoring our own coupon and take your business elsewhere. So I am!.
