My experience was that of an excellent education tainted by bullying and intolerance.\n\nIn the 1990s I was the son of a poor single mother in the inner city of Cleveland.  St. Ignatius admitted me and gave me enough financial aid to attend, for which I am deeply grateful.  Today, partly due to the excellent education they provided me, I have earned my Ph. D. and lead a successful and happy life on the other side of the country.\n\nHowever, their kindness does not excuse the harmful behavior that often took place and which seemed to be part of the fabric of the school's culture.  For example, while I was a student several of my classmates were bullied to the point of committing suicide, such as an acquaintance of mine named Owen French.   Once, when news hit of a different student committing suicide because he was gay and bullied we had an all-school assembly.  Administration did not address bullying at this meeting, but instead warned the students against talking to the press about the school's culture.  I am still in shock today that this was how the school responded to the suicide of a gay student.\n\nI also had a close friend named David Snyder who had a visible medical condition.  The word \"teased\" does not capture the malice and abuse he suffered because of this.  Four years of ostracism and abuse took its toll on him and not too long after graduation he would also be dead.\n\nThese are just some extreme examples, but I can say that in my experience, homophobia, racism, elitism, and general xenophobia against anyone different were rampant, daily phenomena.  At best this mindset was tacitly approved by the school's power structure, at worst, encouraged by it.  \n\nTo my knowledge, there was no mention of the students who committed suicide in our yearbook or any admission on the part of the school of failure to protect these kids.  \n\nI would call on Saint Ignatius to take responsibility for bullying and intolerance. I have since been back and I saw a plaque that honors another student in my class who died of natural causes.  Someday I hope to tour the school and see a plaque with names like David Snyder and Owen French conspicuously displayed saying, \"Bullying contributed to the deaths of these students, and we will never let that happen again.\"\n\nUpdate 10\/31\/14.  If you view the other posts you will see the \"nothing is wrong\" attitude which is really the root of the problem.  One 5 star reviewer admits, \"No, it is not for everyone\" which is all too true- perhaps much more true than he intended to admit.  Not everyone is welcome.  He goes on to completely dismiss bullying and intolerance saying, \"There is no 'boys will be boys' attitude in the culture of the school\".  Another 5 star reviewer implies that bulling is everywhere so St. Ignatius should not be held responsible.  This is the viewpoint of the powerful majority; of those who fit in and do not face the stigma of being \"the other\".  I'd encourage everyone who denies a problem to ask an actual student to count how many times a day they hear the word \"f-g\" (homophobic slur).  When I attended, I counted it in the dozens.  Blindness to the problem is the luxury of privilege.
