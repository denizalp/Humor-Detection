Be a \"Yes (Wo)Man\" when someone asks you to go to Yes Cafe!\n\nIt's been a minute since I've been here.  Like, so long that I didn't even realize they had a minimum to use your debit card.  So let me take the time out and thank Lord Fugu, Adam A., for buying me my drink and not having me count some quarters at the register.  :x  Thanks, Adam!\n\nI had a Royal Milk Tea with Pudding.  It was pretty standard and run-of-the-mill and the pudding was sweet and smooth.  It's nothing I can't find at a more favored boba shop closer to home.  I did manage to swipe an egg puff from Karen W.'s egg waffle and that was pretty fantastic.  It was a dense memory foam pillow [sounds so delicious, right?] that tasted like Chinese steamed egg sponge cake [Ji Dan Gao 鸡蛋糕].  I like the more airy kind of egg puff but this hit the spot!  I can see myself ordering these puffs again!\n\nAll in all, Yes Cafe is a decent spot with free wi-fi and a wide variety of food and drinks.  I wouldn't mind stopping in but I wouldn't go out of my way --- especially with the $10 minimum to use your debit\/credit card!  [insert heartbreak emoji]
