Wow! What a beautiful studio. I normally frequent another studio in town and I was invited by a friend to check out FSY with a free 2 class pass! \n\nI went to a 9:30 cycle class taught by Sam and she really brings the energy! The music was on point and her choreography on the bike was to the beat of the music which helped you forget that you were sweating your a$$ off on a bike that goes nowhere. ;)\n\nThe studio is incredibly spacious and clean and the locker rooms are well appointed with lockers and two showers.  \n\nI did bring a personal towel along but no need because both inside the locker rooms and on your bike they provided you with one. \n\nThey have shoe rentals there that are free for your first class and a dollar after that. \n\nThe room for cycling is a dedicated room for it and they turn off all the lights except for some candles that light up the instructor platform.\n\nI loved the dark room. I didn't think i would like it, but it really helped you to focus on you and not everyone else around you. \n\nPlus if you're \"choreography impaired\" like I am you don't have to worry about it being obvious that you're off beat. ;) \n\nCheck this studio out!
