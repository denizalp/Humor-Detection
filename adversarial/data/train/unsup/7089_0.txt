Okay, everyone, step aside and let the Cupcake connoisseur of Cleveland give her official review.\n\nHUGE, MONSTROUS, MONGO, SUPERSIZED.  Yep, these cupcakes are as big as your head.  Since I only eat filled cupcakes (which they don't have many of...boo hiss) I chose the Strawberry French Toast cupcake.  It came with a fork.  In a cup.  You get the picture.  It was sweet.  It was sugary.  It was...large and in charge.  Was it the best cupcake I've had in Cleveland?  Nope.  That designation belongs to Great Scott Bakery in Rocky River.  But the preponderance of pink in this cupcake shop delivers a fun environment in which to enjoy a massive sugar shock (before you decide to run home 20 miles to burn off that cupcake).
