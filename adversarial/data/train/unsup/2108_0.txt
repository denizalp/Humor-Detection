A cute little place overly-crowded with odds and ends from grandma's attic.  It's easy to find located next to a charming art glass gallery.  Oddly enough, every time I've stopped into Quintealia's - there were only a handful of patrons.  Why?   Today, during the pancake breakfast events, I stopped in and was snarled at by the owner saying, \"We ARE CLOSED!\"   Not such great customer service.  I'll take my guests to a more friendly establishment ... not wanting to get indigestion over 'tea\".
