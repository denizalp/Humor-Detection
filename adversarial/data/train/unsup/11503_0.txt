It must be different in the day time.  At 8:30 pm it's really quite an interesting crowd.  At one of the tables there was a pennies and nickles poker game going on with a few guys.  Some woman arrived and got some food and joined the game.  I think it's sort of a community gathering of people.  Some came with their shopping cart.   A nice crazy guy was making flowers out of palm fronds and giving them to a few of the women.  \n\nI ordered the quarter pound bacon and cheeseburger and fries.  The burger shrank down to something quite tiny, but the food was fresh and the fries were good.
