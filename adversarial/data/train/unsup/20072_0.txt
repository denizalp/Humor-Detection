\"Raunchy\" is the most accurate description. Absinthe means \"strong and bitter.\"\n\nAfter seeing this, we were shocked by the ratings of 4 & 5. The four of us agreed this was the raunchiest of shows and the humor was mean-spirited to the point that it was not enjoyable. My husband and I have seen many shows; the two people we attended with have seen most of the shows (as they live in LV). \n\nThe \"humor' was a lot about body parts and body fluids. We could not understand why the ratings were so high. We then realized that for the 20's, young, juvenile humor, drinking crowd this was great. (Look at the photos that accompany the ratings . . most very young.) The acrobatics were good, not great. The seats were uncomfortable, wood, folding-type chairs. \n\nPay attention to the reviews, the term 'adult humor' words is not used because it is too mild of a term. Terms 'perverted' and 'dirty humor' were used for good reason. If you enjoy okay acrobatics, the lowest form of reality television, raunchiness, and humor based on ethnicity, sexual orientation, degrading others, and race, this is the show for you. If you expect great talent and an adult humor, burlesque-like show, pass on Absinthe.\n\nI should have looked up the meaning of the word before attending, \"Absinthe:  a green alcoholic drink that has a very strong and bitter flavor; green liqueur which is flavored with wormwood, anise, and other aromatic herbs and commercial production of which is banned in many countries for health concerns.\"  \n\nThe show is \"strong and bitter\". Even if we did enjoy the humor, the tickets would have been over-priced based on the talent levels.
