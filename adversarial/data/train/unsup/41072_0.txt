First timer always wanted to go because everyone talks about how great the food is. Now I understand. Superior service from Zach. He went above and beyond my expectations. I'm not big on pasta but he told me to try the Alfredo as a side and it was phenomenal!!!!. By far the best I've had here in Charlotte. I'm from Chicago and we know good food, comfort food. It's like home.... The pictures speak for themself. Ya gotta try it. Bringing family here next visit. They will love it!!!! Check out my pics.
