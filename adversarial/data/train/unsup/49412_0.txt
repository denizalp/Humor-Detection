Double Take is slightly classier than the Sally Ann and Goodwill, but not as upscale as Value Village. I don't think I've ever bought anything to wear here. Once I found a nice shirt, but it didn't have a price tag on it so they wouldn't sell it to me. Their books are incredibly cheap. I think 50 cents for a paperback. So that's something I guess.
