Needed to use up an Applebee's gift card before it expired, so brought my 7 year old grandson and 3 year old granddaughter here for lunch following an active morning at the natural history museum. The place looks clean and parking is close to the door. We were seated immediately at 11:30am. There is a mixture of tables and chairs and booths. I noted that we were seated in a booth section with other families with infants and children and that most of the adult-only parties were seated apart from us. Probably a good idea.\nI had the lunch combo ($6.99) for which I selected soup and a turkey sandwich. The soup was very tasty and properly seasoned. The turkey was not the pressed lunch meat variety you get at the deli or someplace like Paradise Bakery, but rather a large chunk of real turkey breast. The lettuce and tomatoes were very fresh. The focaccia bread had a nice chew and held up well to the veggies and turkey.\nThe kids both had the chicken fingers and fries ($4.49). They each had 3 medium sized, perfectly cooked slabs of chicken breasts and the fries were the large chunk size, not shoestring, but the kids really liked them. They had some mild seasoning on them.\nCons: The chicken fingers and fries were just warm, not hot. It took quite a while for the food to come out. I heard several parents trying to distract their hungry kids during the delay. They do provide some crayons and coloring sheets to occupy the kids, but the delay in getting the food is far longer than it takes the kids to complete the coloring. \nOverall, it was better than I expected from this chain, but they certainly do have some opportunities for improvement in speed of service and making sure that all the hot foods come to the table actually hot.
