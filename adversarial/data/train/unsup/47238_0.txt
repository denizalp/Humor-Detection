I go down here alot when I am with my aunt, every time we go in, no one is at the counter. When they see you they ask what you are looking for. One day we decided to get a hamster. We were questioned so much. I know they are doing it for safety reasons but be real. Some of the questions were ridiculous. The first question asked was \" Do you abuse animals or have ?\" This automatically made me angry. Ya, like a 14 year old girl likes abusing animals! Not. It was also ridiculous that if you bought for example a rabbit , they make you buy the cage and everything else! They want $150 for a rabbit and a inadequate cage? Absolutely not! I would never pay that much. I have 1 rabbit and other big cages perfect for another rabbit. But I'm not wasting my money on a small, cheap cage. Staff is also INCREDIBLY rude! They know nothing about animals. I asked what type of rabbit that they had there was go see if they knew, and they said Flemish giant. The one I was asking about was a French Lop. Obviously not a Flemish giant. This store is awful and should be shut down!
