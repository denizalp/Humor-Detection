Moving can be about as stressful as that time period between getting an STD test and receiving the results so I gotta give Dependable Auto Shippers a shout out for lowering my anxiety level a few notches during a recent relocation. \n\nI moved from San Diego to Chicago, and it's been about the easiest part of the whole process. Just call, give them the transfer info, and they send you a quote. When you book they come to you and even drop off directly to your new address. In total it probably took about 20 minutes of my time. \n\nThe price was under 800 bucks which if you factor in gas, and lodging you'll need if traveling alone it's actually cheaper then driving it yourself. \n\nIf you're moving and want to relieve yourself of some of the hassle I'd definitely recommend giving these guys a call.
