Excellent food and service. We were back last night for the fourth or fifth time. Our only criticism is that it's too noisy. Every surface is hard and the sound just bounces everywhere. We couldn't hear the music, just the boom from all the voices.\n\nI'm not sure what they can do about it and I'm sure we'll go back but I do think the noise level is an issue that needs to be addressed.
