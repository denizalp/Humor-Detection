Big disappointment. I felt like I have walked into a different restaurant than other yelpers.\n\nJay recommended a bottle of red wine but it was horrible, so bad that it shouldn't even be listed on the wine menu at this venue. I checked online and it has 1.5 star in three well-known wine sites, that can tell you it is definitely not well-loved. Lucky Jay was willing to take it off from our bill.\n\nLet's talk about food. I asked for a medium cooked rib chop but it was beyond medium-rare. I tried to flag down our server but he was always busy with other tables and by the time he came by, I lost appetite looking at the plate of blood.\n\nMy friend's steak was well-prepared though, we ended up sharing that plate of protein since it was a big portion.
