Been wanting to try this place for a while but just never got the chance to make it here. The service is excellent!!\n\nThey also have some really awesome combination mixes. I believe I got the road and shared with my bf. We got the crawfish, shrimp, and muscles. We got their urban mix I believe it was called in spicy. \n\nBOMB!!! I have been to the other places but the wait sometimes sucks and I don't leave the restaurant smelling like what I ate haha. \n\nWe also got Kumamoto oysters. They were yummy! I just had to squeeze a little lemon juice and just eat them. Good stuff!\n\nI also love the concept of it being in tray. A lot of sauce evenly distributed. The only bad thing is it gets cold fast if you eat slow. But otherwise awesome! It also comes out with two potatoes, corn, and 6 sausage.
