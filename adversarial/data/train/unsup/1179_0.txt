We are not owners here. We are owners in Orlando. Currently there about 8 resorts owned by Holiday Inn Vacation Club with most being on the East coast.  A location in Arizona has just been opened in called Zona or something. Las Vegas was opened in 2012 and soon after the building of Linc the Ferris wheel construction began.   \nSo that's HIVC history for now. If you have read my reviews in the past you know that I like to put a lot of information and this will be no different. \nThe staff here is most certainly the most attentive. Any problem small or large they are on it with one quick call to the front desk. My wife really enjoys the ice service. She calls says we need Ice and ten minutes later an employee is knocking with a 7 lb bag of ice. Fantastic! The grounds themselves where not built by HIVC so they are run down a constant service is required to the grounds.   \nThe rooms are what you expect when it comes to furniture with the small upgrades of 50 inch LCD's mounted neatly on the walls in every room.  The master bedrooms have a fantastic four people or two large people size tubs. It's all very clean and initial supply's are plenty. Mom got a soft bed she's not happy. Wife got a hard bed she's not happy.   \nWe have used the a pools so far every night. With these hot days is always best around 6 pm where the pool is still heated from the days sun and the shade is a comfort. No sunscreen needed. \nThey have a very cool activities center that starts off at 8 am with a power walk following a smoothie. Yum. Then several arts and crafts follow throughout the day. There are two gyms which I've used extensively a game room and waterfall at the main pool next to the Goldmine restaurant. Overall HIVC is great. These faculties are old I'm certain if HIVC built new there would be a much better experience.   Really my opinion  is in comparison of our Orlando trip and wish that LV facilities would get up to those standards.
