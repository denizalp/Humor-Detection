This is a wonderful hotel in an otherwise humdrum hotel market.  Elegant and sophisticated, the rooms are spacious and quiet.  The lobby is designer perfect, with a beautiful marble faced fireplace and complimentary wine hour where complimentary quickie chair massages are offered.  The third floor features a nice pool with covered cabanas as well as a rooftop bar.  We dined at The Blue Hound in the hotel and found it very good.  A breakfast place Is immediately next door with quick service.  This would be my go to hotel in Phoenix if only there were more to do downtown - but a great choice if you need to be central.
