Getting into the parking lot from the busy intersection can be difficult. But I would say, the overall experience is worth it.\n\nWhen I first walked in, no one was at the register but someone eventually came out and took our order. It was hard to hear him and it became confusing. However, another cashier came out and was very nice and clear. He was interested in what we thought of the food and was friendly. No one was rude and the overall appearance was very clean and well taken care of.\n\nThe food was very good. I order the Vegetarian Soul burger and the Classic Poutine. They give you a generous amount of toppings and a decent sized poutine. The patty in the soul burger tasted almost like meat and kept together really well.\n\nI would return and recommend this as a great burger place.
