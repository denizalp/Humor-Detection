I have had the same fraudulent experience that Michele B. had in September this year!!!\n\nWe visited this location today because they had a 2016 Ford F-250 Truck Crew Cab that we were interested in purchasing on their website. This vehicle was on THEIR WEBSITE for $64,930 MSRP. On the website after all their rebates, it says we are walking away with a truck at \"After Rebates $55,146\". We viewed the truck and while test driving my mother noticed the \"Manager's Special\" sign on the windshield. We thought \"Great! This is our lucky day\" Boy were we wrong!\n\nTo our dismay, after driving the truck and sitting around for an hour and half, the salesman comes back and tells us not to be alarmed by the $84,000 price tag with $1,787 monthly payments! He explained to us that the price was actually $75,000 MSRP (manager's special???) plus the $8,000 lift job (that he \"can't not charge us for\"). We explained that the website says $55,000 after rebates so we are shocked at the price and that it was illegal to false advertise. He then went to get his Sales Floor Manager. They moved the two other women who were sitting in the cube next to us, purchasing their vehicle, to a \"waiting room\" (see photo below, probably because they didn't want them to hear us talking about the false advertising on their website). He looked around at all the cubes to make sure they're empty before he sat down. After the manager sits down and we explain the situation, he tells us he can show us other trucks that don't have the $8,000 lift. This was NOT the issue. The issue was the MSRP was $10,000 MORE than the Camelback Ford website BEFORE the $8,000 lift job is even added. After going back and forth about how it's illegal to false advertise, he asks us, \"what can we do to make a deal\". So ridiculous! You can start by listing the actual prices of the vehicles correctly on the website! They would have a 100% chance of a sale at the online price. Instead they lost another customer and earned a horrible review.\n\nWe have no complaints with our \"Vehicle Sales Consultant\" Matt Melone, which we would absolutely recommend. He was not pushy AT ALL and very personable.
