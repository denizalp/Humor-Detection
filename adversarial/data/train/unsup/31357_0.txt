This place is a cesspool and probably the worst mall in AZ. Crummy area, crummy mall, crummy people hanging out at the mall. It's really not safe and I would never go alone with my kids or hang around at night. I worked there for a year and there were multiple arrests and gang activity. It's just really disgusting.
