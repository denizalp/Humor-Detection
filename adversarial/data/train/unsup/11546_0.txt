Air conditioned rock climbing. How much more amazing could it get?\n\nThe employees are so good with first time climbers. Very friendly and patient. Once I learned the ropes (HA) there were plenty of easy routes labelled for my weak ass, but also plenty of more difficult ones for my friends who do srs bsns climbing, not to mention the area for bouldering (I love watching people boulder between climbs). \n\nThe areas are well lit and they always have some sort of playlist playing. Definitely a fun place for a date or to meet up with friends. Plus, they give you free climbing for your birthday!
