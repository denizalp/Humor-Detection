Why did I do this to myself??? A weeks worth of cardio gone with just a few bites of this evil little treat.  Poof!!  I was just siting there in one of those nice little rocking chairs in the main atrium minding my own business and the aroma of freshly backed buns drew me in.....what was I thinking?  Obviously with my gut since I just added a roll on top of my existing roll...\n\nThe Cinnabon itself was just ok, a bit stale on the outside.  This is probably a good thing because I didn't finish it and hopefully won't be tempted to try another in the future.  The coffee was good and hit the spot.  The 2 ladies working the shop were absolutely lovely...
