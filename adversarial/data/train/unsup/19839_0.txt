How am I going to review this place?\nDid I actually get tricked into coming here?\nHow... ???\nWhat... ???\nDid I really just see THAT much nudity & debauchery in 2 hours?\nMy life has forever changed...\nWow, I'm going to TRY to write a coherent review. God help me.\nWho knew all it would take to snap me out of any bi-curiousness I may have had was strippers.\n\nPros:\nYou can get drunk on the left & then go watch full nudity on the right.\nEverything was 2 for 1. 2 beers? $4.50. That was awesome. Is that just Wed?\nThe black lights turned my vodka tonic a light colored neon blue. \nThe girls that talked to us were nice.\nThe girl who gave my friend a dance worked hard & deserved her money.\nThe bouncers looked very capable.\nThe music. Heard some stuff I didn't think I'd hear. Major plus!\n\nCons:\nCould the parking lot be any more crowded? Holy hell.\nKind of dingy. Sitting in those chairs freaked me out a little.\nThe locks in the restroom on the left are broken!\nThe bartender watered our White Russians down. It was gross. We complained & it was rectified.\n\nNow, let me say that just because I gave this place 4 stars doesn't mean I ever want to come back. I have had my fill of strip clubs, be it this place or any other.
