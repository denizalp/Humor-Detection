Overall they do the basics okay, the service and atmosphere is their downfall for sure. The waiters are sometimes not the best, food takes awhile, and the food quality is just okay. This place is so close to us and I wish it was a bit better. When someone asks us how this place is, we just say, \"It's okay\". So go here knowing that it's nothing special and you won't be disappointed.
