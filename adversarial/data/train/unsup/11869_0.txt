Wanted to try out this restaurant last night with some friends before some new years celebrations.\nCalled to make a reservation, apparently they are CLOSED new years eve because, ''My staff doesn't want to work tonight, so we're closed''\n\nThat's a direct quote.\nWow..\n\nA business that doesn't want to cash in on new years? \nWhat a shame
