We went to the shack for my birthday dinner last night. This second time at Angry Crab still gave us delicious seafood but the service and preparation was off. We were given our side of rice when our drinks came out, so it was cold and hard by the time we got our food. The traditional boil sauce did not have any flavor this time and our bag of veggies came out raw. When they brought us a new bag of veggies, they were then soggy and overcooked. Bummer. Just like last time, we again had to ask numerous time for the tools to crack open our crab. \n\nWhen we inquired about crackers to get crab open and a tool to devein the shrimp, we were told that they didn't have any available. I would think that a place specializing in seafood would have an over abundance of these tools in stock. On busy nights, hand wash if need be between dishwasher runs of the tools. The scissors we were given didn't quite get the job done. I kept asking different people for crackers four times and finally got a pair from a helpful gentleman who was checking on all of the tables. \n\nOnce we were able to dig into the seafood, it was delicious! Steamed to perfection and the trifecta sauce garlic-tastic and tasty with a kick.  Mild spice still had me reaching for a tissue. The pound of shrimp seemed like an endless bag and quite a few snow crab in a pound as well. Still yummy and we will be back when they are less busy. Bummed about the service and some of the food preparation. :-(  Read my previous review for newbie tips and details about the food.
