I've been here many times.  It's definitely a place where not everything is to my liking. I've heard raves how good their lasagna was and I ordered it one time and it just wasn't good at all.  Could be just my personal preference.\n\nLast I was there I ordered their spaghetti and meatballs and for a simple dish, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was.  Their appetizers are really good and their desserts are pretty great too.   \n\nService is always top notch here.
