The Party Pedaler should come with a warning label because for us couch potatoes it can be hazardous to our health. Party leader Tracy wants you to believe that this is all fun and games but under that infectious attitude lies a drill instructor just itching to get out.\n\nAs she expertly steers the covered pedal bus through the streets, dancing and leading some of the worst karaoke you have ever heard, everyone else is working to make her look good as the spectators snap one shot after another. She isn't the one covered in sweat and gasping for breath after all.\n\nThis nefarious creation hides beneath a sleek exterior that looks much like a bar with wheels and seats attached to the outside. More than one person came up to check it out while it was sitting still and lonely and everyone else tried to recover in time for the next pedaling session.\n\nSeemingly dozens snapped pictures and video while we were in motion - less than 1mph does count as motion, right? The planet moves, so that surely adds in some speed too. One car even stopped at a signal to wait for us to catch up so she could get a shot (as we were headed slightly uphill, she had to wait a while). Yet no one volunteered to help pedal. It's like they were watching the horror movie and we were the dumb coeds headed to the slaughter.\n\nOnce I can move again, I'll show them they were wrong.
