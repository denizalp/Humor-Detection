I'd give it zero stars if it was an option.\n\nSo, I'm at a friends place with my girlfriend, and my friend suggests we order from this place.  Ok, I'm game.  Food arrives.  I opened up my schwarma sandwich...there's a gaping hole in it...so I pretty much couldn't hold it.  I unroll it and pick off the dried up meat that I'm sure was sitting there all day.  Just nasty.  To top it all off I found a nice hair in my wrap, great!\n\nI guess its a good thing it had a huge hole in it, otherwise I may have no noticed the hair.  There's the 1 star well earned.
