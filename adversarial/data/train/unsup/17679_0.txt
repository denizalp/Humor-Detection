Yes, the tacos are pretty pricey. $2 a piece whereas I can find tacos for as little as $0.50 in Orange County.. Is worth it? Hell yeah it is!!!\n\nEverything is prepared fresh in front of you (meat, tortilla). You get in line according to what meat you want on your order (there's carne asada, lengua, cabeza, adobada, buche, and tripa). Lines can get pretty long around lunch time; I recommend you go in the late afternoon or late non-weekend evenings. If you want different meats, best method is to divide and conquer. Have friends order in the other lines while you wait for yours! \n\nCarne asada and al pastor are the meats I always go for. Tortillas are thick to avoid ripping since the meat is so juicy (plus you'll probably be adding tons of salsa). You can choose to add everything to your order; everything meaning guac, onions, and salsa. Radish and lime are at the side bar.\n\nUnique here is what they call \"Campechana Fries\" ($10), which is Carne Asada and Al Pastor added together! Super delicious. Fries were not soggy at all and meat was tender and juicy. Highly recommend this option if you're not into the whole finger food ordeal! *Campechana fries can come with or without chili cheese*
