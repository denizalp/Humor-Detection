So this Denny's on Fremont is a mess late nights. \n\nWe were not greeted when we walked in, it took way too long to be seated.\n\nIt seems that most the servers had been partying, some seem wired etc.\n\nSeveral times I had to ask for a side of the same sauce, twice she brought the wrong drink..\n\nThen waitress openly tells us \"oops, you can tell I drink\" what the what?!?\n\nFood was ok but rushed and looked messy.\n\nI will only eat at this Denny's again if I'm more drunk then I was last time.\n\nGreat spot for cheap drinks (reason for 2nd star)
