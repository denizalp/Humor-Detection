Pizza isn't bad itself. Girl on the phone that I ordered through was very rude. Prices on the to go menu are more expensive then the regular prices. It is not 13.99 for an XL pizza. So don't let that fool you. Also, 2.50 for pepperoni?? And they are small pieces. Idk. Staying at a hotel and just wanted something quick, cheap and easy. Not the greatest place to go. Pizza isn't awful though. I would've enjoyed it warmer. But beggars can't be choosers.
