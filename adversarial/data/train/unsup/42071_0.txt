I specifically came here looking for imported stroopwafels from Holland. I was so sorely disappointed when I found out that they only carry stroopwafels made in Ontario, like the kind you could find at food basics. These don't taste like the real thing....and staff doesn't seem to understand the difference. The ones from Holland taste soo much better - buttery and sweet. The Ontario ones taste like cardboard... something lacking in their recipe. The lady at the register was kind and offered me a complimentary chocolate.
