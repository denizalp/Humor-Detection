This is probably your best bet to get a sit down bite to eat at Pearson Airport. When we went, there were storms overhead, causing many delays. Thus, the restaurant's kitchen was backed up as everybody wanted to stop in for dinner at all once. Our server warned us right away of the delay, and quickly got us drinks to tide us over until our food came. We both had burgers, both quite good. Server was very friendly and took good care of us.
