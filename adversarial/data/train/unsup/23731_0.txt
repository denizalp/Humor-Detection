Michelle M, Ginger O, Amanda B and I walked over here in search of sustenance. We had all just consumed copious amounts of whiskey at the Cocktail Society (I'm assuming they did, anyway, because I did). We needed to eat!\n\nBottled Blonde was the opposite of what I'd call \"my kind of place.\"  It was, in fact, NOT that.  \n\nWaitresses in skimpy clothing, check. \nMusic played just a smidge too loud, check. \nMargarita pizza with rubbery cheese, cardboard-flavored crust and bland sauce, check!\n\nThe service was fine. The tables were clean.  \nI won't be back here, but there was nothing wrong with it. \n\nMeh.
