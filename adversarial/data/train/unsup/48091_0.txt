After 9 years since the last time I ordered from this location due to POOR service, it appears that it has not changed. I thought I would give them another try due to there has been time for correction and nothing has changed. Ordered 2 medium pizza's at 05:31 and was not received until 07:01. Had called the location at 06:31 to find out the status of my order. I was told that it was there and disappeared. Thinking that my order was canceled which it was not. After on hold for approximately 5 minutes, then I was told the order was being delivered. Upon recieving the pizza's, the hand toss dough was not cooked properly (doughy and soggy). The other appear to be alright. I will not be giving my services to Pizza Hut again. I use to eat a lot of Pizza Hut at another location but this location REALLY sucks!! Poor training, poor guidence, poor management, all equals to poor location. Such a shame. Love the vairety that Pizza Hut offers.
