It's the end of the week, I'm tired and I am only food shopping cuz I need to.\n\nArrived at the store before it got too too busy with people cashing their checks on a Friday night....Check\n\nHad my shopping list with me....Check\n\nOnly diverted from the list two times (not bad) so....Check\n\nStore must have been put in some kind of good order because I surprisingly found everything I needed without having to search all over the place...Check\n\nCashier kid was pleasant and not overly chatty...Check\n\nDid not get accosted by anyone looking for change I don't have on the way in or out....Check\n\nI'd say this was a successful shopping trip today.
