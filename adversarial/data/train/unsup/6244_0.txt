Value Village is a great place to score some cheap clothes (and other garage-sale type junk). Although about 90% of their stuff is hideous, if you look around enough, you can stumble onto some great deals: for instance, over the years I've found GAP shorts for $5, and a Benetton (lambswool!) sweater for $10.\n\nThe best deals are to be had during their annual one-day, 50%-off-everything sale, usually around Labour Day. I scored a great suit jacket during one such sale for ten bucks; while I was in line to pay for it, a woman  who was behind me with her boyfriend started scolding him for not finding something like that.\n\nIt's moments like that that make rummaging through all the ugly polyester crap worthwhile.
