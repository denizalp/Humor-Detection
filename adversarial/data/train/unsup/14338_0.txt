Went there recently. Bar service was slow. Food was excellent. Had the Turkey, Swiss, and Mushroom sandwich and La Palloma Margarita. I live in the area, work in the same industry.\n\nDuring the course of my visit there, There was a hockey game on (Canucks vs. Predators) Of all the 40 T.V's there, there were only 2 T.V's that had this game on. (Granted hockey isn't big in AZ) 3 mins left in the third period, they changed it to a DBacks game... WHA??? \n\nAt this point EVERY T.V. had on a basketball, or the diamondbacks game on... I asked why they changed it, and the bartender said, \"They are watching it down there.\" (pointing to a couple opposite end who got there after me.) So, Stanley cup playoffs is less important than a beginning of the season baseball game? HA!\n\nI brought a lot of friends, and some family. I was taking care of the bartenders with great tips all night long, and that was my thanks?\n\nI moved to another bar inside, where there was no bartender, away from my sister, brother in law, room-mate, his girlfriend, my best friend from high school, and some buddies in town to finish this game that now was pushed into overtime. (which i obviously missed.) I expressed my concerns and how I wasn't feeling welcome anymore. No one really cared, except for one bartender Jenna. she was cool about it. Fixed the situation and helped as much as she could. \n\nAs I was getting settled in to the bar opposite of everything, the bartender from the other bar that I was at moments prior, came by and handed me my second drink without me even asking for one. I thought, cool, they know they messed up, a free drink? Sure it's not a big deal. After she handed it to me she asked, \"Want this on a tab or still pay cash?\"\n\nSeriously?\n\nI'll take my family, friends, and our money somewhere else.\n\n And we did.
