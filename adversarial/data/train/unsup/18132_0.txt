I walked in for lunch on a weekday and it was not too busy. The AC was working so it was not hot inside especially at a hot pot place. The meal is slightly more expensive compared to other hot pot restaurants in the area plus there are extras like soup base, special food and drink items.\n\nThe food ordered included sliced angus beef \/ lamb, shrimp, a variety of veggies, dumplings and several seafood balls.  The beef and lamb were excellent with the tomato beef soup based that I picked.The service and the restaurant layout were great. I did not know how bug the restaurant was with several booths plus a few private rooms.\n\nThere are tables with individual hot pots and others with shared pots for larger groups. I sat at a table for 2 and each of us had our own pots. I also ordered a large size of their plum juice which was good and not watered down.  I would go again but likely not in the next few weeks as I tend to over eat. \n\nNote to self: Do not go during lunch and expect not to be able to stay awake.
