Ok time for the good... this is a hotel in the McCarren Las Vegas Airport vicinity, Doubletree, which was a great value and awesome find. I never would've thought of an airport hotel on a Vegas trip, but decided last minute since it was a Saturday I'd be arriving and knew for the most part I just needed a place to crash since I'd be tired after working. Complimentary shuttle picks you up (fast too) from the airport, makes regular stops to and from the Strip, also the outlet shops (South) and back to the airport if you wish. No resort fees, only authorizes your cc ONE DOLLAR for any incidentals, and greets you with free bottles of water and warm cookies. Clean, neat, great customer service! No billing issues, not even a deposit required at time of booking. Perfect if you want to avoid the crowds and lines checking in, a quiet place to sleep, and ideal if you have places other than the Strip to visit, and for those who make frequent trips to Vegas as well. I highly recommend.
