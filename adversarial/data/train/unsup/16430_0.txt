As my lady friends and I descended from our rooms, all tarted up for a bash, we decided to hit Stir for a quick happy hour cocktail and some nibbles. Stir looks quite nice, all sofas and dim lighting, and the happy hour menu posting on the website indicated half off cocktails and apps from 4-8. \n\nUnfortunately, the actual menu was quite a bit smaller and quite a bit less appetizing but again, happy hour, so we figured no big deal and placed our orders. The berry mojito was very tasty but very, very weak on the rum, if indeed it had any. Our burger was a sad grey patty covered in tasteless cheese on a smushy bun, depression in edible form. A friend's hummus was weirdly oily and the pita stale and hard. The beef skewers came with thin, mucousy ranch instead of hoisin as promised. \n\nSo yes, this bar is convenient, and yes, the happy hour prices are compelling. Even so, save your money unless you like to chew on your own disappointment.
