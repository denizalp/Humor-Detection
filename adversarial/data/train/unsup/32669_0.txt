Open late! A pleasant surprise from what otherwise appeared to be a dead city during the week. Came with my mom looking for good dessert with vegan options, and this place more than satisfied. We shared a slice of their vegan chocolate strawberry cake, and an oatmeal cookie sandwich type thing with coffee filling. Both were fantastic, and moist. I could be biased, but neither appeared to lose any flavor or produce any weird aftertaste as a result of being vegan.\n\nOnly complaint would be that they were just a bit too sweet. The frosting was very, very sugary. \n\nWe also had tea along with the dessert, which was a good compliment to the food and the cold weather outside. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to hang out later at night in this city, or looking for good dessert in general.
