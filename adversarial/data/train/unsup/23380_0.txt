I hate American Apparel stores. And this one is one of my least favorite stores. The layout looks cheap and it is very hard to find what you are looking for. If I did not love my girlfriend as much as I do I would not even step foot into one of these stores.\n\nWhy didn't I give this place a 1? Because everything is made in the good ole' US of A. God Bless us and our low quality, yet expensive and trendy clothes.
