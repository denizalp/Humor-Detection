I found this place tucked back in the corner of the parking lot where my bank is.  How have I missed this place for the past 2 years I've been here?  So many good things to choose from on the menu.  I finally went with the Swift Wrap (a chicken salad type wrap).  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a good portion and really filling.  It was a nice day so I chose to sit outside on the patio, which is pretty large considering its compact location for the store front.  I can tell the people who work here genuinely love this place and the customers.  I was asked by 3 separate people how my meal was, 2 of which were on their way out, leaving for the day.  Still they made the effort to turn around and make sure I was doing ok and was enjoying my meal.  Much appreciated!  I'll definitely be back to try more on the menu.
