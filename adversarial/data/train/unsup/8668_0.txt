If you are looking for a little bit 'nicer' place for great pizza, this is your spot.  Be prepared to pay for it though.\n\nWhile I would still tip my hat to full on flavor and freshness for the value to places like Mellow Mushroom, this is a great break from the norm for a bit nicer meal with your special someone.  We had the San Daniele Prosciutto app ($15) (burrata cheese, arugula, basil, aged balsamic (this one also had some fresh cantelope)) and it was fantastic!  We also ordered the Isole e Olena Sangiovese ($55) which was definitely overpriced for the taste.  I would recommend the Ciacci Sangiovese which is almost half the price and has better flavor.  \n\nThe pizza was full of flavor and was thinner than I had expected.  It held together nicely and they were generous with the toppings.  We shared the Roasted Wild Mushroom which has spinach, robiola cheese, mozz and truffle oil.  It was delicious but I would recommend 2 pizzas if you are hungry.  They are full portion for 1 or you can share as we did, if you are having apps and dessert.\n\nMy bride ordered the Chocolate Cake and coffee with Baileys and I ordered the Fresh Berry Cobbler.  This course was a waste and I would recommend sticking to apps and pizza and maybe walking down to Dean & Deluca for a good dessert.  I think the desserts+coffees with one shot of Baileys was around $30.  The total bill was $121 + tip.  I would be choosier with the order next time because while it was fantastic, you could still have a great meal and dodge some of the expense.  For that amount of money, there are nicer meals you could enjoy in Charlotte.  We will return though because if the other pizzas are as good as that one, it's worth trying it and being smarter with the bill.
