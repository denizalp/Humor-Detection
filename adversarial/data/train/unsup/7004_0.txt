What chocolate place has no chocolate?  That would be Chocolat Bistro.....\n\n3pm & we're hankering for a snack but nothing too big since dinner was coming up soon.  Wasn't in the mood for gelato but seeing how many people are raving about it, we may have to give it a try next time\n\nTried to get some truffles but they were sold out of 2 of the sparse 4 varieties they carried & given the 2 available were orange or mint & chocolate - which are against my religion, as I am a chocolate purist - I passed\n\nApparently the items you see in their display case are NOT the items for sale.  They pull everything out of the back so while you may think something is available, it really is not\n\nWe did however luck onto their Chocolate Muffin & it was fantastic - nice deep chocolate flavor & sprinkled w\/ cinnamon on top.  This was the place's only saving grace\n\nSo consider this more of a Just-OK
