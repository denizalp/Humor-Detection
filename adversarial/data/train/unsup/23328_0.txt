Although I'm Terroni on Queen's #1 fan and it gets an undisputed five star review from me, the Adelaide Street location is really hit or miss, or \"dine at your own risk\". While they may have the same menu, quality food, outstanding presentation and a tremendous decor (this is the former Courthouse bar\/lounge), what's really lacking here is consistent service and general organization.\n\nWhat it's missing is the old world charm and vigor that Terroni on Queen has - the servers there are lively, enthusiastic about the menu and seem to all like one another. Things at Terroni on Adelaide are markedly different - the servers are more aloof, less attentive and hardly personable at all.\n\nThe reservation system is flawed - I've gotten so much conflicting information about whether or not they take reservations, WHEN they do (it's only after 7 on certain days I think?) and for how many people that I don't even think the staff themselves know the correct answer. If you arrive after 7:30pm expect to wait a while in the lobby and when you're party is finally called, if it's reallllly busy a hostess will come out with a chalkboard held up over her heard that has your name written on it. \n\nTry to avoid being seated at certain tables in the basement as it's really easy to be constantly in the way as seating is tight and it's a high traffic zone\n\nIf you're looking for the ultimate Terroni experience, head to Terroni on Queen. If you want to wow your guests with beautiful decor, cathedral ceilings and a bustling clientele, head to Terroni on Adelaide. Just don't set your service expectations too high!
