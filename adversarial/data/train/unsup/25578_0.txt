This was my first time visiting SOS Wax and I LOVED it!! Elena was GREAT!! She's very professional and friendly, she made me feel very comfortable and made the process as painless as possible. She's very efficient and fast, I thought it would take longer but she's quick!  I will definitely be returning for maintenance services in the future.
