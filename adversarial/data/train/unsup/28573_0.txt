Had a blast, Patrick was our server A+++ service from him!!!\n\nI highly recommend asking for him as your server. The wings, calamari, thin crust pizza & shrimp salad was just great!\n\nI will be coming back again to this Oreganos. The ambiance is family friendly and as I always say; if the service is great then it's  worth spending your time and $$$ with that restaurant.
