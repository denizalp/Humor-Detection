After the first visit to Crossfit Culmination I was hooked, the classes are taught in a way anyone can understand and apply. Safety is the first priority. Anyone that just has the drive and desire to get into great shape in a controlled, family style, amd fun environment should check it out. Making workouts fun and seeing results...not much to think about....get to a class!!!!
