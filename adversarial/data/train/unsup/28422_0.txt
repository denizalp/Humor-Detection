We were in Vegas a few weeks ago and did not want to order room service.  Thankfully Yardbird was across the street, so we walked there and ordered food and brought it back to the hotel.  It was actually really good.  For someone who does not like fried food very much, the chicken was very crispy and I really enjoyed it! We got the fried chicken breast and fried okra.  The okra was really good, and bite size was great.  Would definitely go back if I'm in Vegas again, or if I find out there are other locations.  Would love to actually have the meal at the spot!
