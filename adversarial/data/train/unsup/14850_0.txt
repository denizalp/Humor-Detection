Great place to hang with the family! They have shops and Restaurants around this giant tree playland. The play land isn't just for kids either, its fun and big enough for adults to be kids again! \n\nGreat spot for everyone, bars for the adults to enjoy a drink, restaurants to feed the hungry and shops to buy some goodies. \n\nDowntown Las Vegas has a spot for every age!
