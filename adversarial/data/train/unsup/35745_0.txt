We had Crostini Sandwiches catered in to work today. It was our first time trying them out. \n\nThe sandwiches, we got an assortment of paninis, were a big hit! They were hot, fresh and delicious!! There was a pretty good selection as well. We ordered cookies and a salad as well. The cookies were warm when we got them - not sure if they were warm from coming out of the oven, or warm because they were packed in the box with the warm sandwiches, but it didn't really matter anyway. They were delicious and gobbled up quickly. The salad was a little wimpy, but then again it wasn't intended to be a meal salad with a ton of fancy stuff, it was a simple side salad, and it was just that: simple. The dressings that came with were very good! \n\nEveryone in the office really seemed to love the sandwiches, though, so we will definitely be ordering from them again!
