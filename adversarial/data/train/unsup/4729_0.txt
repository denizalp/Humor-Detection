-1 *\n\nThe past 2 thru the self car wash tunnel has be disappointing.  Seems like the spot free rinse cycle is just a drizzle ever since they have employees wiping your car off at the end of the tunnel.  So if you missed a wipe down, you'll see hard water spots every where.  And if you do get a wipe down, it's awkward not to tip.  I rather take my car to Clean Freaks & clean it myself.
