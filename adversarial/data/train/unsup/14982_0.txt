Let me preface by making clear that I have tried many, many, many of these different companies at this rental centre. (Read more here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/mccarran-rent-a-car-center-las-vegas?hrid=TM3dwBx0CzEYgU_iH201bA.)\n\nAdvantage is not my go-to, and yes: avoiding this building entirely is probably best. However, sometimes one has to bite the proverbial bullet. Here is my experience ....\n\nThe CES dweebs invaded the valley with their overall awkwardness and terroristic driving. And in doing so, drove the rates for all car hire companies through the roof. Normally Fox is the cheapest, but this time Advantage apparently was the company with most cars remaining so they were the least expensive. \n\nThey will try to up-sell. It is their job to do so, unfortunately. Insurance, the petro, the SUV; a surfboard rack, child seat, and GPS. They would up-sell a camper when you make it clear you are staying in a resort on the strip. They would try up-selling you a fucking space shuttle if they had one back there. They would up-sell you a ...\n\nYou get the fucking point. \n\nI did not fall for any of the nonsense. \n\nIn a bizarre twist, they did accept with no problems my temporary driver's license -- which I gather they do not at every company -- although they insisted on me furnishing an insurance card for my privately owned motor vehicle. It took my fifteen minutes or so to do so on my handset (there was no one in queue that night; relax); and in doing so I learned that one of the dutiful employees at Advantage was previously fired from Fox for assaulting a customer. \n\nPro Tip: Don't mess with the Advantage employee that could probably kick your ass. \n\nIn my case, all of the employees were perfectly polite and overly nice. \n\nThe rate was the following*:\n4.73$ hour\n23.64$ day**\n47.28$ extra day\n\n*Hyundai sedan\n**Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n\nNote: Charges\/Fees at 7135 Gillespie Street are outrageous. 35% on top of the rate. This should be illegal.  \n\nApparently there is no one grace hour period upon return unlike at Fox. (Read: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/fox-rent-a-car-las-vegas-2?hrid=cnbKn7U4slbBTg60M8WLtA.)\n\nAdditionally, they don't even review what damage you have documented before leaving, so if you expect to ding a door ....\n\nAdvantage Rent-A-Car is a solid A-OK in my book.
