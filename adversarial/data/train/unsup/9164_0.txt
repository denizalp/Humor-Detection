A hidden gem in North Las Vegas. Came here on a whim because I was craving seafood but wanted to stay local. Lucky me a friend of mine suggested it. \n\nThe restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside. Typical but charming decor. Remember that Mexican restaurant, Acapulco? Kinda reminds me of that place, minus the balloons. \n\nThe food definitely exceeded my expectations. I ordered the shrimp tacos with rice and beans and a horchata of course. Huge portions, enough to share. Plenty to choose from on the menu. I think I'll try the streak fajitas next time cause that looked amazing. The kid menu had a great selection as well. The staff was very attentive. Refills before we even asked and the chips and salsa kept coming. They were a bit slow on taking our order but no biggie. All in all, good food and great service. 4 solid stars.
