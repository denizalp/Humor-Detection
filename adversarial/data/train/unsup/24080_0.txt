I was quite surprised as the chorizo breakfast burrito I ordered was better than expected, it was delicious. It was warm, had the right amount of spice and blended well with the cheese and beans I added. It was a little greaser than I'm used to for a chorizo burrito but I managed. This restaurant's drive through is open 24\/7 and it's on a major intersection in Chandler so it's convenient for me. The menu is diverse and they sell dishes typical fast food Mexican restaurants don't such as chilaquiles and sopes.
