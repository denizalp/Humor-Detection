Falafel House?  Are you kidding me?  It was downright awful.  I ordered two falafel pitas, lentil soup, and gingerale.  The falafels were not fresh.  After the cook put my falafel pitas together, he tried to press it in an electric grill...  When I sat down to eat them I knew it was not going to be good.  And I was right.  The falafels were cold and mushy.  And not only that it had that \"old\" aftertaste.  The lentil soup was bland.  I threw the second falafel sandwich out.  Yuck!!! And I was up all night because my heart and stomach burned all night. And I almost never get heartburn or stomach burn.YOU WOULD THINK A PLACE CALLED FALAFEL HOUSE WOULD MAKE YOU A FRESH FALAFEL!!!!!
