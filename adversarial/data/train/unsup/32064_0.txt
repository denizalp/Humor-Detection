Liz Nails exceeded my expectations this visit. I'm from Detroit but my boyfriend is from Rocky River, but when we're in town his mom and I usually go out and get our nails done together. We went here once and both got gel manis and after a week both of ours were chipping, which neither of us had ever seen with gel before. So we went else where to her other spots from that point on. Well yesterday, it being my birthday and beautiful weather for the second week of March I had to get a pedi first thing in the morning. So I stopped at Liz Nails considering it's a half mile down the road from my boyfriends family home. I was pleasantly surprised from the beginning considering they opened 10 minutes early! Hell yeah! So I got in, picked out my pedi color (a pretty black from the Hello Kitty OPI line) and was in my chair soaking in the good at 10 AM, the time the doors should be opening. I was given a cute little bottle of ice cold water and had a great younger tech who gave me a great pedi. $32.50 and about 30-45 minutes of pampering later and I was out the door one happy customer eager to leave a solid review. I was pleased to have such a good experience as redemption from my first here and it is worth it. I highly recommend Liz Nails!
