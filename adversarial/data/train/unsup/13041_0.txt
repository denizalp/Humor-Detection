I hear the name \"Mr. Onions\", and I picture a fat, hairy guy that smells like fried onions and BO. I look at the outside of Mr. Onions, and I sort of picture that same fat guy to be eating in there. That being said- I was skeptical, and avoided Mr. Onions for almost a year, after moving to the neighborhood.\n\nWHAT A MISTAKE!\n\nMr. Onions actually smells like delicious breakfast, and the cure to some wicked hangovers! The menu is fairly diverse, with lots of options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Portions are large, tea and coffee are bottomless, and the service is friendly. Don't expect extravagance...just hearty, tasty meals. \n\nA breakfast joint, just isn't a breakfast joint in my books without a vegetarian eggs benny option- and theirs is delicious! Yummy looking waffles, and great fresh fruit as well!  Meat lovers will appreciate that they aren't skimpy on the bacon like many breakfast joints.\n\nI'm SO glad that I opened my mind and was willing to give Mr. Onions a shot. It totally satisfies my need for a neighborhood breakfast locale, and doesn't break the bank either. \n\nI'm not saying that the fat, smelly guy DOESN'T hang out there - but I have yet to see him!
