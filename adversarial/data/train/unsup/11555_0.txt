Dangit this place is good. \n\nWe made a reservation because they were packed on a Friday night. It was last minute so we couldn't eat until 8. We were ready for some food! We both ordered the gnocchi with bacon and truffle oil. \n\nSadly our order got lost after it was taken to the kitchen  and we ended up waiting 40 minutes for food. But the whole time, the waitress was so nice and apologetic and I could tell the kitchen was really embarrassed. When the meal came it was divine. That's the only way to put it. I had died and gone to heaven. \n\nBecause of the mix up they offered us some yummy desserts on the house. The cheese cake was great! I was expecting more dessert options and it was weird that the waitress was kind of complaining about how only some of the desserts are tasty. But whatever. Free dessert!\n\nAt the end even with the free dessert the bill was a little high for us lower class folks but Dangit if we won't be back because the food was insane and the service was friendly.\n\nIf you like real italian food, give this place a try!
