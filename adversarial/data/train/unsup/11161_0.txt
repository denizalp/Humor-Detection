YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(365\/365) \"The Marino-meister\"\n\nI was bummed when Teavana closed up shop at The Fashion Show Mall, but elated when I discovered that they found a new home in Downtown Summerlin! Passing by, This gentleman nicely greets us while handing us free samples of Youthberry\/ Wild Orange Blossom and Maharaja Chai Oolong\/Samurai Chai Mate tea blends which were nice and refreshing. \"Oh we're not done yet, come on inside!\" he says...\n\nStopping at each and every table, explaining to us anything and everything we wanted to know about Teavana-their tea sources, gift packages, assorted teapots, and other cool gadgets(while still offering samples inside...There are about 8-10 more!) at no time did we feel that Marino was that typical pushy salesperson. He was very thorough, informative and very courteous. Up front is where the fun begins with Marino. getting a feel for what flavors we like, he pulls from the 98 different loose leaf teas they have on the wall teas that he thought we may like as well as a few of his favorites, opening each tin and fanning the aroma towards us which was very intoxicating in a good way!\n\nTwo ounces is the minimum for buying any of their loose leaf teas, but prices vary(anywhere from $4 upwards to about $15) just a head's up so you don't get a serious case of sticker shock! No purchases on the wall of teas this time but I got a Iced Raspberry Limeade which I enjoyed while perusing the other shops at DTS.\nGo see Marino for a 5-star experience at Teavana!  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/ 5\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!! WOOOOOHOOO!!!!
