I remember the first time I saw the place right before it opened. I was so excited for such a unique restaurant to open in Oakland. Sadly, it's probably one of the blandest, most unexciting places you can eat in all of Pittsburgh. The food has almost no taste, tends to be very dry, and the menu is tiny. There is almost no seating, so you almost always have to take it to go. The place looks and feels like a run-down, old campus eatery. There's nothing redeeming about this place. Don't waste your quarter on the meter!
