This review is for the world's WORST, most obnoxious bartender! Wish I'd caught his name but he had a scraggly beard and an ugly attitude to match. \n\nWe sat at the bar with every intention of eating and drinking for a couple of hours on a recent Sat night. I smiled and asked this bartender which of the specialty drinks were made with vodka. The reply was a stone-faced, snooty-toned 'none, we are a true tiki bar' and he turned his back on me. Uh, ok. Let me try again. I asked, again with a smile, if any of the drinks are made with light rum. He said 'of course not', again with a really unpleasant manner. My friend and I are looking at each other like WTF! \n\nAnyone who has met me will tell you that I am a very sweet-natured, friendly, happy person who greets everyone with a big smile, and I treat everyone with warmth and kindness, so this was the most uncalled for and bewildering behavior. I also spend a generous amount of money weekly (and tip well) in an establishment that deserves my patronage. We left, and I have no intention of returning. In my opinion, that guy needs to be working in a profession that does not require any interaction with living things.
