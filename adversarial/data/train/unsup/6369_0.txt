One of my favorite prime rib restaurants..you can never go wrong with this one (at least every time I have been there).\nI have been to the square one location a few times and it has never disappointed. Service is excellent and the food comes out quite fast. Be sure you come hungry as they start you with some freshly baked bread with the oh so gooood honey butter!\nI always order medium rare prime rib as my entree and it is spot on- the 6oz portion is just right for me or even  a tad too big but it is cooked to perfection!! The most recent visit was for a team lunch and since it was my first time here for lunch, I thought I would have to go with something else other than my usual- that didn't happen because they had a prime rib sandwich. Instead of the usual onion bread, I opted for sour dough bread and it was an amazing combination. It was so tasty that I was already thinking of my next visit lol! \nWe also ordered a few apps to share, they included edamame, asian nachos, calamari and the Canyon Creek dip. Each of the items were really good although I thought the Asian nachos were a little too spicy for my liking. The portions were just right for 7 people since each of us had an entree. \nOne thing I learned that day was that the square one location was a 'test' restaurant, which meant that this was where they tried out the new dishes before releasing them to the other Canyon Creek restaurant- super cool!\n\nI can't wait to come back for my usuals as well as looking forward to the new items!
