Shop around before buying anything here, their on-shelf merchandise is out-dated and significanly higher priced than places like Future Shop and Best Buy. Even for the convenience of its location, I could not justify spending twice as much for something.\n\nI also approached them for maintenance on my cellphone (a basic operation) and they quoted me 3 times what I could get elsewhere in the city.
