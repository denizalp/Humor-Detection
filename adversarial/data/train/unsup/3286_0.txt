As close as this location is to where I stay, I had never been to it before.  They weren't as fast to prepare as the one at Baseline and Country Club or the one by Chandler Mall.  I got the Italian and my daughter got the  turkey.  Both were fresh and delicious and a good size for the money, $5.95 each. They only cut the sandwich in half if you request it so my torpedo was whole.  They said it had an oil and vinegar dressing but it was so light as to be indiscernible.  If they had pepperocinis I wasn't aware of it.  The roll was wonderful.\n\n All was fine till I decided it needed a little oomph and went up to the counter to ask for pepper since there were no shakers on the tables.  What? No pepper??  I can't fathom that.  I didn't like the loud music either.\n\nWill I go back? Hell yeah.  But I'll take my own pepper.
