Kudos to the Tempe Library staff for being so amazing during the loooonnngggg early voting procedure, which took up their entire first floor on Friday, when I went.\n\nSo, ok, waiting in line for vote for 8 hours sucks. However, at least I was able to do it at this library, which I had never before visited. The place is filled with comfy chairs and great new books! I was able to actually skim through an entire newly-released nonfiction book I've been eyeing at the bookstore while I waited to vote.\n\nNot only that, but the \"connections cafe\" serves up coffee drinks, sandwiches, soup and snacks. They stayed open late for the voters, which was nice. And it was explained to me that it's a nonprofit cafe, which the money going to help fund children's literacy projects. Awesome, again!\n\nFinally, the librarians were so nice about hundreds of loud, impatient voters camping out. Not once were we told to \"shush\" and one of them even passed out Halloween candy for us!\n\nSome of them had to stay really late (I left at 10:30 p.m. and they were still there).\n\nOverall, I just think it's cool the library hosted the polling. It was much better to be there than to be stuck at the Mesa city center, standing in line in the heat with nothing to read.\n\nIf I lived in Tempe, I'd definitely get myself a library card and come back to this place time and time again.
