When in need for some pho in your life kim dins an ok place to go. Small shack that looks clean. Servers are pleasant food comes out quick. \nPho is ok ,spring rolls too. They offer other stuff too but i just stick with these two items. \nAnd the occasional lemongrass proteins\n I just remember kim din slightly better tasting that what it is now.
