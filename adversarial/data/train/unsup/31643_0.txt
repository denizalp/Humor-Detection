This place is one of my favorite  but not this  particular location I came in to get tacos the cashier was friendly kind of busy working drive thru and Frank counter I walk away to go wash my hands could not getting restroom I have to walk back multiple times to get door unlocked when I finally  get in restroom the toilet was clogged so I came out immediately and told the manager which is what some guy he told me would you like me to do something about that so his customer service sucks I will not be returning
