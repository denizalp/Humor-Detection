I finally got my Husband to take me to a Buffet!! He never likes to come to theses because he prefers to be seated and enjoy his meal. We took our children with us and for a family of 4 we paid $150!!! I bit pricey for a buffet but it's Vegas!! I don't eat seafood and either do our children so it wasn't worth it for us. My Husband however enjoyed his crab legs but this wasn't $150 worth of food. I think Ruth Chris would have been a better meal for us and would have been about the same price. At least we tried it and the food was oh kay!!! Nothing special... Your just paying for the fancy hotel your eating at..
