Caffe Boa is about as exciting as bulk trash pickup day.\n\nThe service is so bad it makes the Terminal 4 baggage claim at Sky Harbor look like its staffed by nothing but Jackie Chan clones.  Thats means Boa is slooooooow, folks.\n\nI'm befuddled by the mystery of their menu, trying to discern if what beautiful items I appeared to order are actually what's in front of me.  Ogerp Pasta?  Oh, yeah, i get it.  Its Prego cleverly spelled backwards.  Next on the list Etnom Led Asparagus (apparently, some region in Tuscany).\n\nPeople are always up on their shit about their happy hour, which I makes my eyes roll right out of my head, because:\n\n1)  Their bar is about as big as a Subaru Vivio.\n2)  Their specials ONLY apply when sitting in the Vivio.\n3)  There are certainly no helpful chauffeurs.  \n\nFortunately for me, its pretty far out of the way, which makes it almost certain that I can have some excuse for not driving all the way to Tempe to be spared to death.
