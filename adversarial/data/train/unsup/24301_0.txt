I came here for breakfast on a Saturday with my wife. Upon arrival we saw a vintage car show in the parking lot. It was not associated with the restaurant I'm sure. The restaurant has an upscale ambiance. Once an auto shop, they decided to keep the overhead doors as part of the decor. Modern contemporary music was playing. There is a bar serving drinks with your breakfast. Who doesn't like a bloody Mary with breakfast? From the pictures this one is loaded with all kinds of good stuff. They also offer $2.00 mimosas all day long.\nAfter reviewing the menu I decided on the breakfast burrito with chorizo. Thet charge extra for adding chorizo. This baby was huge. Scrambled eggs, chorizo, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes all wrapped up in a flour tortilla and comes with a side of black beans and salsa. It was good\n What's more is I had enough left over for lunch so it was like getting a two for one deal. \nThe staff was friendly and accomodating. We were greeted and asked about our meal by everyone in the place including the manager. What's Crackin does breakfast right.
