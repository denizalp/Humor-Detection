Food - 1 star\nService - 3 stars \n\nAfter all the years in coming to Vegas, we had never eaten at Peppermill.  Stopped here today before our flight and had the worst (seriously the worst) Bloody Mary I've ever had, plus a very overpriced plate of corned beef hash that was lacking in flavour, texture, etc.  \n\nThere are SO many other good places to eat in Vegas... this may be iconic, but it's certainly not delicious!
