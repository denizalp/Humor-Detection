I thought I liked hot dogs before, but a Nathan's all beef hotdog with relish, mustard, & ketchup doesn't even make the starting lineup here.  14 named dogs, plus a classic, AND a customize your dog option makes for great options.\n\nI have a new admiration and respect for cooks who take the time to do hot dogs right, and Buldogi's does it RIGHT!\n\nI had the Buldogi Chicago dog; gad it is delicious! A great balance of mustard, relish, tomatoes, green onions, peppers, pickle spear, and celery.\n\nWhile dogs are the staple here, they also have a good selection of fries, burgers, tenders\/wings.
