Friday nights are the busiest. Also there are coupons for 3 games that u can get from south point. The coupons for 3 games and 2 pairs of shoe rental was around $17.50. The facility is fairly clean for a location that deals with lots of kids. The drinks at the lounge are little pricy, but late night happy hour rates are pretty cheap, specially for drunk bowling. \n\nI did notice that there were some glitches in the software that was tallying the score, but it only happened for one game. This could be an issue if you a competitive person like me. :-)
