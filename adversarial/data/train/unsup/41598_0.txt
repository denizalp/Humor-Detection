Yelp ratings have almost always been on point but this place is the exception.  Most reviews raved about the huge portions, great value and awesome food.  Those reviews could not be farther from the truth.  Another dead giveaway that this place most likely didn't have great food is the \"Free Wine.\"  I was in town for a bachelor party and this is one of the places they picked to check out.\n\nI live in the suburbs of Philly and we are used to great Italian food due to the large Italian population in the tri state area along with fantastic Italian restaurants.  The only thing I can think is that most people don't get a chance to have Italian food often. \n\nFirst the portions were not huge or even big.  They were average at best.  The highlight of the entire meal was the salad.  I had the Chicken Parm and it wasn't terrible but I would not send anyone there to try it.  The chicken was bland and the sauce wasn't much better.\n\nIn regard to the value...  $30 for a small salad, chicken parm, watered down wine and what they called cappuccino is far from a value.  If it was $12.99 i might agree.\n\nFree wine!  I'm not sure you could even call it wine.  It was more like water with a taste of wine.  \n\nCappuccino... it was closer to powered hot chocolate\n\nThe service was good so they earned two stars.\n\nThere are many other options in Vegas if you are looking for a deal that provide much better food and an atmosphere that doesn't resemble a cluttered basement.
