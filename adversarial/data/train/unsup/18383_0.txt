Wonderland, now that its cold outside I am really missing you, missing the warm weather. I have been a fan of Wonderland for years. I have enjoyed many other parks like Six Flags and such. But Wonderland is our only major park here in Toronto and I must support it. I enjoy the rides, just sad the people I go with never go on the rides like Goliath and Sky Rider. However I am not happy with this new addition of Fast pass. Because,of this I had to wait extra long to ride. Not cool.They need to make fast pass better or completely eliminate it. Love the funnel cake yummmy! It is sooo good. I always get one right before I leave the park. You dont want to eat it before a ride. Check online for deals before going. Never pay regular price.
