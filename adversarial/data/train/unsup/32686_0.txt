Sprinkler Dude did a fantastic job was very professional. I called and left a message and I promptly received a call back...a major plus with me considering most other sprinkler repair places I called never called me back. The owner George showed up when he said he would, diagnosed the problems and supplied me with a verbal & emailed estimate. I had old irrigation lines (most likely from the original installation back in 1996) that were leaking in numerous locations. George ran all new lines for me including rebuilding the main valve (at no additional cost to me) as well as programming the the timer and showing me how to make changes if I wished. All new lines were installed and the rock landscaping was fully returned to it's original appearance. Sidewalks & driveway were fully swept up and hosed down which made it look like nothing had been done at all after the installation was completed!. My wife got home from work and stated that the yard didn't look like anything had been done at all...I was here, I saw what it looked like earlier in the day...the installation was most certainty done and I couldn't be happier with the results! I whole heartily recommend Sprinkler Dude!
