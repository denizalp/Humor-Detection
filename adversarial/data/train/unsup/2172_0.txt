Earl of Sandwich!!! Great prices for GREAT sandwiches! \n\nWe all know that just about anything in Vegas costs an arm and a leg. Even their McDonald's are a bit more expensive than your typical local mickey Ds. \n\nEarl of Sandwich's sandwiches typically costs under $7.00. Like Janice H. mentioned, it is a BARGAIN for LAS VEGAS! \n\nI wish there's an Earl of Sandwich in LA!
