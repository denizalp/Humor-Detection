Love the taste, I would always get heart burn when I eat at hot n juice or boiling crab. I'm just very happy that urban crawfish doesn't have the same effect but their taste is still full of flavor. Also, their $1 blue point quality was better than I expected. Overall, I would start going to urban crawfish before any other places for Louisiana style seafood.
