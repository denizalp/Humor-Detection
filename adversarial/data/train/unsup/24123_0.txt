I'm honestly sad to write this review but here it goes:\nI have never been so upset or dissatisfied with a college before. \nBefore I started here, I thought I would have a good experience because this is what I needed, online classes that I conveniently take since I work full time. There's no communication with the professors, the lessons and material is recycled over and over and over again. One of my teachers is ridiculous, the amount of homework she gives is impossible to finish in a week, and anytime I have a question, it takes her at least 3 days to reply. I'm so upset, and honestly DISGUSTED that the school board hasn't done anything about the lack of communication within the college from the professors, rude staff, and ALL of these complaints from former or current students. Look at all these Yelp reviews. Isn't this a sign? I actually had to drop my classes due to all of this. I'm so upset about it, and I honestly can't believe this school is still around after all the complaints the school has received, SHAME ON YOU RIO SALADO!!!!!!
