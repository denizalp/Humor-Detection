wow love the revamped space! the last time I was here was when it use to be cafe carumba. tommys created a soothing resto with a large & lively patio.\nmeet up with Aileen b. for  a much needed happy hour and i enjoyed that five dollar wine (we both had whites).  i ordered the chicken panino which is on the happy hour menu and comes with fries.  i did like the chicken inside the panino but i didn't care for the bread because it was a little to greasy for my preference. i solved that by removing the top bread of the sandwich. next time if i order this i will ask for a healthier bread option that is not so greasy or just no bread. tasty food and nice place to enjoy HH drink for sure.
