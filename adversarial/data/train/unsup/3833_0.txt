My experience tonight bothered me enough to write my first Yelp review. I eat here regularly, the food quality is decent and the pricing is  reasonably cheap. The service is always quite mediocre (never rude, just slow and inattentive) but is excused due to value.\n\nTonight, I placed a phone order for pick up, was told to it would be a 30 minute wait. I informed them I was in a rush and it was apparently noted. I arrived 35 minutes later and they said \"no problem\" took my money and said the food would be right out. 10 minutes later, the food was nowhere to be seen. I asked again and was told they were just putting the food in a bag. 5 minutes later they informed me they hadn't even made my order. I asked for my money back and left hungry.
