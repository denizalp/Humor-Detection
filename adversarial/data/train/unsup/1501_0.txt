Waited 35 min for appetizers just to receive over fried calamari and bad tomatoes in a Caprese salad. Waited an hour for main dish which actually was alright but overshadowed by the whole bad experience. This is a typical restaurant mistake. Too many seats and not a big enough kitchen allows for unhappy customers.
