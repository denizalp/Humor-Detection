A must try!  Yummy, friendly and affordable.\nLove, love, LOVE this place. Every single server has been super friendly and the sushi and sashimi is mouthwatering!  The Rainbow Roll never disappoints. I am also impressed with the beer selection. They have a rotation local brew and some classics as well. Didn't care for the spicy tuna roll, but every other thing has been great. My absolute favorite is the salmon sashimi.
