My review of 3 stars is really about their gender neutral bathroom in the restaurant.  \n\nWe had a girls birthday luncheon in the main restaurant.  Staffs were very friendly, menu is limited but selective.  Brunch food was tasty, portion is a bit small, however, overall was perfect for girls luncheon.   I find the gender neutral bathroom very uncomfortable with every stall marked W\/M.  Centralized sinks in the middle of the bathroom which men and women could be washing their hands, putting their powder next to each other.  Total lack of privacy!!!!  \n\nThe property is beautiful but the condo construction next to the hotel is taken away the beauty of this hotel.  I hope all will improve soon.  I most likely will not return but wish Hyatt the best!
