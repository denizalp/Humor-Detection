been here on two occasions first time just 2 of us then a group of 16.  Both times the waitress has been very attentive, the food came out correct each time and excellent.  Their Bow Valley Brown Ale was excellent, i did try the Hammerhead Red Ale as well.  I didn't notice but for next time they have a beer sampler available which has i think 8 - 5oz beers for about $7.00. looked like it gives a good representation of its beers.  Some seasonal beers are regulars year round here, blueberry and raspberry.  their menu is on line and worth checking out.
