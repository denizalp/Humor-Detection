Stop bouncing around from barbershop or salons and back. Lawrence at Evo is the one who gets it done. Perfect haircuts every time, and they last until the next appointment. There is nothing worse than having a great haircut for a day, and then it never looks like it did when you leave the barber's chair. Not the case here, you have a great cut until the next appointment. I cannot stress enough how pleased I am that I found Evo and Lawrence. Lawrence has a great personality, and frankly that is really 90% of what you're looking for when someone is cutting your hair! He is officially my lifetime barber.
