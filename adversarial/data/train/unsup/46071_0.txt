This review is long overdo. So long in-fact, that when I first started coming to Taj Mahal's Prescott location over 10 years ago the the first iPhone hadn't even been released. Just let that sink in. When I moved to the Valley a few years ago, I tried to find delicious Indian food near my house. I have probably tried over 10 different restaurants. Nothing cures my craving for Chicken Tikka Marsala like Taj Mahal. \nI am so glad that they opened up a location in Old Town. The Valley needed a healthy dose of delicious Indian food.
