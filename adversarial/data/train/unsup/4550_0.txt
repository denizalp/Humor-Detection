I love this place, I love the theme and decor and the fact that everyone wears kilts. The service is friendly and food comes quick. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often. Their sangria is delicious and their saut√©ed shrimp linguine was to die for. Next time I'm in the NDG I'll definitely try to go back.
