I mean, this is super cool.  It's free.  It starts PROMPTLY on time.  And it's pretty awesome.  \n\nWe were on the hotel side (next to the Mirage) instead of on the street side...  and the view is without a doubt better from Las Vegas Blvd... so try to snag a good spot there instead of near the entrance to the Mirage.\n\nThis is one of those things you walk to and just sit back and ...  enjoy.  The interplay of the fire and water is gorgeous.  Lovely.  Amazing.  Beautiful.  Make sure you put this on your schedule as something to see while in Vegas.   Kids and adults will love this.   Worth it.
