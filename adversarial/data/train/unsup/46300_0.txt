I couldn't afford the dental surgeon the dentist suggested and after a quick Google search I found Simply Wisdom Teeth. I was a little skeptical because of the low price but they were amazing! The extraction is done in a dental sedation surgery center with an anesthesiologist present, you won't get that at the dental surgeons office! The center is clean and well equipped. The extraction was done in an actual Operating Room.\n\n My daughter was extremely anxious and all the staff did everything they could to alleviate her anxiety from the front desk to Dr. Hendricks. Her extraction was quick and we were back home in no time. They gave us all the aftercare instructions and a nurse called the day after surgery to see how she was doing. I highly recommend Wisdom Teeth Only.
