Underdog Challenge 25\/30\n\nI decided to hold a UYE brunch for Melly's after months of raving about it to people who asked \"where can I get some good Filipino food\". On a hole-in-the-wall level, this s the best place in the city. Of course this notion is constantly being challenged as new Filipino restaurants pop up in the city but the truth is, the best is made at home, so unless your significant other\/best friend\/ work subordonate is Filipino. You are SOL\n\nI always had their breakfast dishes and always order one of the handful of dishes they have like Kare-Kare or Menudo. But Melly's is a bakery after all and you can't leave this place without having purchased their baked goods. Don't feel bad dropping a $20 getting pastillas and yemas. \n\nOuuu if you're dining here, I suggest you dive into a halo-halo, especially on a hot summer day. What's a halo-halo? well let me break it down for you:\n\n~*~The Halo-Halo Food Pyramid~*~\n\n                               *                              \n                             \/   \\                              \n                           \/       \\\n                        \/            \\                           \n                      \/   FRUIT  \\\n                   \/                      \\                      \n                 \/  ICE | BEANS \\\n               \/                             \\                 \n             \/  SIN      |   LOVE     \\\n           \/                                      \\            \n         \/    FAT        |   REGRET   \\\n       \/                                              \\\n    \/      SUGAR     |    KARAOKE   \\\n\n\nYeah....for REAL
