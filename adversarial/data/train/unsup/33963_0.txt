Step into what defined classy dining in the 50s and 60s and you entered the 'twilight zone'.  This place reeks of my imaginary world of old money.  Don't get me wrong as I loved this place (I must have arrived in life!). It has great personalized service, extensive wine list, and exceptional first course to dessert was this alive and well in this tired setting.  Needs an upgrade only in the decor.  The rest is perfect.
