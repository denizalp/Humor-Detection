Delicious food and not too exotic for non-adventurous types.  I tell them if they like Greek, they'll find the chicken kabobs, rice and salad a good option. It comes with Afghani naan, only slightly different from Indian naan.  My favourite is the Tikka (beef kabob) dinner. The salsa is delicious for dipping the meat or bread, or even adding to the rice.\nIt's crazy busy on Fridays, so be prepared for a wait or order ahead.
