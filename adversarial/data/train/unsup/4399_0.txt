Food is good. My main complaint is this is Arizona, folks!  It is 91 degrees in February today. I asked for the iced tea in a to go cup and was told they do not have to go cups. What?  Much finer establishments than yours offer those to those of us who try to survive this desert heat with a trusty, ice cold refreshment for our cars.  What snobbery.  How ridicululous. You really need to re think this.  Won't be back until this policy changes.
