All of Steven Wynn's hotels are great. The service at the hotels are spectacular! You order some thing from house keeping it is at your room door within 5-10 mins. Rooms are gorgeous and spacious and so aesthetically pleasing.\n\nStaff is friendly and make you enjoy your stay even more. I love the encore all the clubs are here and it's more of a younger crowd compared to the Wynn.\n\nI really recommend dinner at Andreas or SW both my top two favorite. The spa here is absolutely one of my favorites I've ever been to, I've gotten facials and massages here and have never been disappointed. This place always makes me feel like I'm a queen. \n\nThe casino here is so good, great vibes and everyone is super friendly, I love that it doesn't smell like crazy cigarette smoke like most casinos do. I really recumbent you stay here!
