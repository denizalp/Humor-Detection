We had had a disappointing meal several weeks ago, but they invited us back to give them another try. I ordered the same dishes (steamed mussels, sea bass, and salmon roe sushi) and all were perfectly prepared this time. The Maitre d' and general manager were both very attentive. Jennifer, our server, was excellent. They have redeemed themselves and we will definitely be backed!
