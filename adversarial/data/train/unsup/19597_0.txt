Wow this place is run horribly. Wish I looked up this place before going. There is a reason this has a 1.5 star rating. Run by people who have NO CLUE what they are doing. Waited 2hrs before my 1st race and there was barely anyone there. Long time in between races. You can tell no one here cares and is just wanting to collect their $6hr at the end of the day.
