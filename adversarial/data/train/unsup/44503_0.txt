Overpriced and mediocre soup dumplings and noodles. Hyped place and disappointing food, nothing special. Not even really worth my time to write too much more about it. Doesn't even compare to the real deal you can get for a fraction of the price in NYC's chinatown. Skip, unless you are a hipster with no taste or just desperate for something that kinda resembles soup dumplings for lack of anything better in the area ;)
