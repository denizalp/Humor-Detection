Surprisingly decent for the Douche District! \n\nHated the crowd (except for the people I came with, naturally) and the music was even worse, but the food options were great (a selection of pizzas, sandwiches, killer herbed frites - skip the sweet potato fries - and shared plates) and the rooftop patio with full view of friendly, beautiful, buxom servers was the icing on the cake.
