Absolutely delicious! The fried chicken is the best I have ever had- that coating=wow! \nWe also nibbled on warm olives, duck nuggets, and the soup of the day - all of which were fantastic! Now, it is very pricy so keep that in mind. If you want nice ambiance and to splurge a little , give this place a whirl. You won't be disappointed!
