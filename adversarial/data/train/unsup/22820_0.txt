Helpful and friendly, I brought in a simple package and they weighed it, measured it and gave me a price. I'm sure it would have been cheaper if I'd taken it direct to UPS but the convenience factor here was the winner. And by the time I'd walked out to my car, I had an email confirmation delivered on my phone. Awesome.
