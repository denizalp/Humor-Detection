Well I finally got to try this place. Everyone I know gave it great reviews. The first time I went in there was a waiting list. So I couldn't wait. So the next time I called and made an appt. I still had to wait 15 min. but, I understand they are busy.\nIt is a very clean looking place. I watched them clean out the bowls for your feet. They seem to use some type of disinfectant. It seems good. Better than a lot of places I have been to for certain.\nThe Place is decorated beautifully. Very Tre Chic how they have it all going on. However, that does not mean a thing if they do not do a great job. Well I had a top of the line pedi. Which I did not think the massage was long enough. The girl next to me told me ,\"yes, it is great you should get it\". Well she was getting massaged when I started and she was still getting massage when I was through. Mine was shorter. Anyway, moving on. I liked my manicure as well. You move to a different spot for that.\nIt is just a regular manicure, I do not have fake nails.Nor do I get the Gel polish. However, I was happy with the service and very pleased with the longevity of the mani Pedi itself.\nIt was nice and cool inside. Considering it was 114 outside,it was lovely. They are very busy here. There must of been about 40 people in there getting things done. They also have a spa in the building as well. Though I did not try that out at all this time.\nLots of parking in the lot. it is located right on the corner of Rural and Warner. South West corner.
