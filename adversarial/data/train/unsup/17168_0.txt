Great experience dealing with Logan-- Thank you for making my first car purchase experience wonderful! Logan was friendly, patient and knowledgeable-- Walking into the dealership I felt it was a no pressure environment and the staff was very friendly. I picked a beautiful white Corolla and I am very happy with my choice! I will definitely be back for my next car purchase and I highly recommend going to see Logan at Don Valley North Toyota !
