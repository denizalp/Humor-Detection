I have a lot of favorite 99 cents only stores in the Las Vegas area and this is one of them. Dedicated parking lot so there is always a lot of parking.  Clean and well-kept shelves inside, even though the store is several years old now.  Dollar Tree across the street if this store doesn't have something you swear they used to but are out of stock of now.  McDonald's across the parking lot for dollar hot snacks, too.
