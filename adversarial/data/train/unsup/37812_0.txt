Loved this place!  I love the Southern twist in a relatively modern setting.  Their bloody mary was easily one of the best I have ever had.  I had the ALT, avocado, lettuce and tomato which was served with Duke's mayonaise.  It literally melted in my mouth.  Huge fan of this place.  Provides Vegas quality (and prices) but with a twist and I appreciate that. My only (slight) disappointment were the deviled eggs.  They were good (and I love deviled eggs) but definitely not the best I have ever had.  I'm just not a giant fan of dill...
