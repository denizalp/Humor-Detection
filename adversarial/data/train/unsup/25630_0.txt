although they have them at home in california, i have never been to one. i was dragged out here by a bunch of colleagues right after work for dinner and drinks. the place was loud but that worked out great for my group of cackling ladies. we all had a margarita and let me tell you, they did not skimp on the tequila, we could taste it through the fruity flavor and we were def ok with that. we never got our peanuts, i'm going to assume that'd the appetizer, but we did get baskets of warm delicious bread. i couldnt help but stuff my mouth with a warm greasy roll as soon as they landed on our table. i ended up ordering the three piece catfish meal and wow - after 2 pieces i was already stuffed. our server was great and super attentive and we had a wonderful time.
