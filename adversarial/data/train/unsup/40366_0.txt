I'll maintain the 4-star rating as the burger was a large, tasty, filling sandwich ladened with all the right toppings..lettuce, tomato, onions, cheese...ordered as a combo with garlic fries...very tasty but a burger is a burger is a burger. Yes, I will return to try the other six sandwiches as this first experience was very good but as a burger goes, this was not particularly special. Deserving still, the four stars even if only for the uniqueness ..a good experience! \nGive it a try!
