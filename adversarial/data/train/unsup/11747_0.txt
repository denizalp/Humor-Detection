Small, local shop known for their chicken. \n\nWe came into the shop around 9pm. There was still a line and the place was super stuffy. It was already hot outside, but the heat from the grills made the store even warmer.\n\nCame here to pick up a 1\/2 chicken combo plate. It comes with their famous Portuguese chicken, salad and a ton of fries on top. I really mean a ton of fries. For ~15 CAD it's a ton of food.  The chicken was really good and tender. It had tons of flavor and the sauce\/juice makes for a great dipping sauce for the fries.\n\nOverall a cool place to go to get chicken. Side note, it's cash or debit only!
