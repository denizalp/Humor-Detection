My husband told me to put 2 stars. This show is really 1 star. It was not a WOW factor. Thank goodness for the 40% off coupon in our guest booklet. The best thing about the show was our seat. We had great seats for a decent price but I do want to call that number that was left in another review but it is good to give to charity every once in awhile. \n\nThe show was blah. His jokes were korny. His stage presence was scary. He look like Vegas has gotten best of him. He and his show was tired. I went to sleep after the show.\n\nOh yeah, you can bring your own drinks into the show.
