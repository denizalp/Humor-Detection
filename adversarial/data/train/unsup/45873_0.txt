Konnichiwa is a tiny Japanese place on Baldwin st.  It is nice and cozy with around 8 tables only so it can get packed easily on a busy night.  We were seated at the window table where the table was super tiny and could only fit 2 bowls. We had the ramen here which is good but the soup base was best part which had this sweet and spiciness kick to it.  Quality is very good, I think they make their own noodles in house.  Pricing is on the higher end but I think it was worth it.  Konnichiwa is nicely decorated with Japanese theme from posters to art on the wall.  Service was pretty good and the servers were very polite as well.  Overall, Konnichiwa is a great small authentic Japanese restaurant that provides high quality food.  \n\nRating:\n\nService: 4\/5\nFood Quality: 4\/5\nComfort 3\/5\nDecor  3\/5\nValue: 3\/5\nParking: 2\/5
