So I went to the mirror maze about 2 weeks ago and still wanted to come back and leave a review about the manager who helped my son and I that Sunday we went there. I wish I could remember him for the life of me...because I would go back purely for the customer service on his end. He was great. It's the little things that keep people coming back, and he has perfected that. I appreciate him and the incredible job he is doing for the business. Thank you again and my 5 year old son is ready to go back in an instant.
