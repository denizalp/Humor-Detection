Recently McFadden's has corrected their signature scent that was mentioned in a previous review. I come here because I get a discount. They're pretty fast on to go orders and their Appletini's are pretty good. \n\nIf you get their chicken pot pie be sure to bring your kids, your neighbor's kids and your softball team. This thing is huge and I looked at it with awe when the bartender hefted it in front of me. I took the leftovers to work and fed 2 other people.\n\nBesides an over abundance of peas it was quite pleasant. I'm just not a person that likes a lot of peas. The flaky puff pastry crust was pretty awesome. \n\nI once order the fish and chips and received an entire fish. I feel like the cook is trying to compensate for something, just kidding.
