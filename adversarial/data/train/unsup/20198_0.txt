I've read many reviews on this place.  First off, I'm a completely temporary living person here (corporate apartment in the complex).   From the looks, it's a gated and wonderful apartment community within the heart of Summerlin South.\n\nNever thought that I'd say this, but the Google and other apartment reviews seemed to come into light when they say that the management doesn't care about packages.  In the mere \"three weeks\" that I've been here, I've already had one package from UPS disappear from the office.   They didn't seem to care nor to change their practice of anyone being able to go pick up packages.  My last apartment complex would have you sign for packages and write your apartment down.  Terrible practice, and they don't even sign for packaging which makes them more of a leasing office than a community property office.\n\nThe outer walls are extremely thin.   I'm woken up by kids going to school early in the morning because they're loud and walking down the pathways near my apartment.\n\nStove and oven is like it's from the 70s.  No timer, or digital clock on it, if that gives you an idea.  Not even a thermometer to tell you that pre-heat is ready (just have to guess).\n\nThe looks get a four star.  The management gets a one star for the above due to the ease of fixing a purely simple property management task a complex one.  And one star for the cruddy building materials and a completely looks based living establishment rather than actual comfort.   For the price, this shouldn't happen.\n\nLast off, if you read all of the reviews, take them with a grain of salt.  There is a five star one, but that person has never reviewed anywhere else.  Seems a little fishy if you ask me.
