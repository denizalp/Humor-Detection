I brought my cat there today to be shaved. I made the apt for 1:30. When I got there I was told that the woman who was supposed to groom my cat was across the way getting her hair colored. Originally I was told I would just wait for my cat, but now that the groomer was getting her hair colored, I had to leave my cat there until 3:00.\n\nNow let me preface that my cat does not like to be groomed, to be fair. BUT when I got there, 2 other gals had my cat pinned down. My cats nail was bleeding because it was cut too short, and she had 3 other cuts on her. The groomer was yelling at my cat to \"CUT IT OUT\" because she was trying to get loose. Well, anyone that knows cats would know yelling at them is pointless and only upsets them more.\n\nMy cat then got very upset and peed on herself. My cat scratched or bit the groomer and she threw my cat in her cage, with one leg not even shaved, and said they were done. The groomer said she had to leave to get her hair color rinsed off (oh ya, I forgot to say all this was going on with the groomer having hair color on).\n\nWhen I dropped her off, I left specific instruction NOT to cut her face hair. I don't like how it looks like a pom-pom, but she did cut it that way. The other gal that works there said she had told her not to do it and she did it anyway.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not bring my cat there again, I will bring her somewhere else to get her last leg shaved. It was so traumatic. For me and my cat.
