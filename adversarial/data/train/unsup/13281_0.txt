Spent a few hours here Saturday afternoon bowling and playing video games with my little bro and I'm going to try to not let the fact that I bowled 5 strikes in my best game ever affect my review of the place. 5 strikes. Unbelievable. My little bro was so impressed. I didn't have the heart to tell him I normally suck. \n\nGood:\n-Service was friendly and helpful - had several folks stop by while we were bowling just to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. Also lost some quarters in a video game that wasn't working and were refunded quickly and without question.\n-Family friendly environment - several other groups with kids.\n\nBad:\n-Limited ball selection. I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure my fingers are regular guy size fingers, and it took me a good ten minutes to track down a ball with large enough holes.\n-A little pricy for bowling, I thought - shoes for two and a couple games ran us close to 30 bucks.
