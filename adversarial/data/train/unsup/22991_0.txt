So Thomas gets bored, or whatever, and decides to do another Foodies event just for Yelpers.  Timing wise it crossed over in to the 5-8 pm time for their regular Foodies event.  The end result is a bunch of us get to enjoy his hospitality and some special items not on the regular menu.  I also got the chance to see some of my Yelp friends and meet a few more.\n\nI started off with a Sam Adams summer ale and the first plate of delicious Hummus and bread came out, I had to stop at 3 if I was going to keep going.  Deb and Monica had a really tempting order of sweet potato fries that they kept ooing and aahing over but I resisted.  Then came a spinach salad with raspberries, walnuts, blue cheese and a vinaigrette of some sort. Then came the entree of grilled flat iron steak, mashed red skin potatoes and asparagus all covered over in a sauce.  To Chad's, our server, credit he described in great detail what was on the plates but I am lucky I remembered the main components.  I finished my gluttony off with a slice of cheesecake topped with some sort of sweet stuff.  I was sure I was going to need help getting to my car.\n\nThank you Thomas for throwing another really great UYE\/foodie gathering!\n\n(edited after learning some new things)
