I visited Dr. Standley's office today for the first time since my previous dentist is no longer practicing in town.  I made my appointment a few weeks ago and the receptionist was very nice and helpful.  She let me know what I needed to have sent over from my old dentist to expedite the process.  I arrived about half an hour early to my appointment and the hygienist was ready for me within five minutes.  My hygienist was very friendly and did a great job cleaning my teeth.  Dr. Standley came in to check my x-rays and teeth, mentioned a few problem spots but nothing like the \"critical gum issues\" and the need for my wisdom teeth to come out like I had experienced at another dentist.  Overall, I like the atmosphere and the people in Dr. Standley's office.  I already scheduled my next visit for this fall!
