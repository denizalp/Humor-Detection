Probably the best Yelp Elite event I've been to thus far.  I live really close to High Street and was super excited to come and check out all the different businesses it had to offer, and there was a ton to see and do!  While my fellow Elite friends and I hit every single item on the checklist, I'm only gonna hit on our favorite places here, or I would be typing all day.\n\nGrowler USA probably had the best food options - pretzel balls, chicken, and probably my favorite drink of the night: mead from Superstition Meadery.\n\nThe Nail Bar was another pleasant surprise.  Through the magical motivational powers of peer pressure, I got a scalp massage which was pretty awesome.  They were also giving out $50 off massages and facials, which one of my compatriots took full advantage of.\n\nMellow Mushroom came through with some tequila tasting and tacos.  Both were fantastic, although we didn't stay long as we were in a mad dash to hit everything before the event was over.\n\nHigh & Rye had some pretty tasty berry infused cocktails.  The decor inside was probably the coolest part of the place, and I would definitely be interested in hanging out here again.\n\nAll in all an awesome time.  As usual thanks to Hailey and her entire team for throwing an absolutely rockstar event!
