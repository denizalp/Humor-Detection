This would be one of my favorite places. It opens 24\/7!!!! It is the only place I have discovered so far that it's always open, considering Phoenix is a big city you would think there would be more right?...  Maybe I just haven't done my research.\nYummy chai tea latte with almond milk!\n\nThey also have a bar, so if you feel like getting comfortable (wine, beer, bourbon, bailey's, etc) but at the same time do some work on your lap top totally possible!
