I'm not sure how I feel about this place..overall I really want to like it.. especially the whole French Bistro concept. Much needed in the north lake area. I'm hoping they will change some things and that get ppl to come back.. So here it go! \n \nWhen I first walked in. I'm greeted by a host.. very friendly. 5 stars.. but it start to go down hill.. \n\nIt reminded me of my high school cafeteria.. You get in line with a tray and start ordering the food. I have ordered some food to go for my sick friend. Then ordered the paella. After I paid and sat down. I realized I have to get EVERYTHING myself.. Fork, knife, water, bread slices and even napkins.. The Paella was disappointing.. somewhat bland and mushy.. I have to keep getting up because of course I keep forgetting things.. \nI must have a staff check on me like 4 times to see if I needed something but I felt awkward to ask because I been getting things myself this whole time.. soo no point in having him get stuffs for me.. \nI just feel like if customer service is that one point than they may as well be our waiter\/waitress. I have no problem tipping.. I'm not a fan of going to a high end cafeteria. I can come back for the food if there's food serving but I won't be coming back for food and self serve for the prices I'm paying.
