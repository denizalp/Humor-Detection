Dueling Pianos- are you kidding me!!!! this place gets insanely crowded, but if you can make your way up to the piano for a request you might literally DIE when they play it.  after 75 shots of whatever you get some rando to buy you- that ONE song- might just put you over the edge.  i think i shed a tear when i heard the opening to \"brown eyed girl\" and then sang along at the top of my lungs like a crazy crack head on market street!!  what happens in vegas goes on yelp.
