Johnnycakes ($8.50): Corn and chile cakes, prickly pear maple syrup, sweet rice, and sausage. Omgosh, this is soo good! It's like a pancake, but made with corn and chile. The flavor is amazing and I loved the texture (tender inside like a buttermilk pancake with a crispy exterior). The fresh strawberries and syrup was fantastic with it. The sweet rice was a cinnamon rice pudding that was good, but an odd addition to the cakes.\n\nMexican Benedict ($10.95): Poached eggs, chorizo, tomato, cilantro, hollandaise on sopes with spuds. I just love variations of the traditional benedict and this one really hit the mark for me. The sopes were wonderful and such a great alternative to the English muffin. Obviously, chorizo is always great and it worked really well here; also, its spice was toned down a bit by the hollandaise. The spuds were tasty, too.\n\nYou order and pay at the counter and then grab a table. The menu is fun; I definitely have my eye on other items for another visit, however, those Johnnycakes are a must again! Fantastic service.
