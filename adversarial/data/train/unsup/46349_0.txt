I enjoyed the food. I always take the recommendation when I eat somewhere new, and this time around it was the chicken taco. the chicken was seasoned well and the guacamole paired perfectly with it. I would recommend the rice... the beans not so much. Not at all flavorful. The horchata seemed to be watered down so definitely go with a soft drink. Overall I would eat here again.
