There are few places where 5 grown men can go and eat their fill of absolutely impeccable North Indian cuisine the likes of which I had yet to have tasted outside my home town of Fremont in California, accompanied by a never-ending supply of sweet, cool, creamy mango lassi at no extra charge; throughout, consuming a gut-busting pint of a bright and crisp, wheaty Taj Mahal all while being graced with the type of service I've only experienced traveling abroad - for less than US$100.  \n\nDid I mention they have the cleanest public men's restroom in the entire valley?  With an f-ing chandelier in it?\n\nBasically what I'm saying is: eat there, be merry, and for the love of god please leave a nice tip because I'll die if this place shuts down.
