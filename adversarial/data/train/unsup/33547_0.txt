I must say that it's my first time at this place and I was impressed. My friend said the tacos were great. I was hesitant at first but then I tried the shrimp, bbq chicken and steak tacos. They were good sized and really good. Their chips and salsa with guacamole was also good and their happy hour was excellent. Who can beat half off apps when they're already priced well along with $3 beers?! Outstanding atmosphere, good background music and modern furnishings. Great customer service as well.\n\nDefinitely coming here again! Not your average spot.
