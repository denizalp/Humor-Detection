I have mixed feelings about this hotel.  \n\nOn one hand it has some of the best rooms in Vegas on the other, the customer service is very hit and miss.  \n\nThe hotel is very clean and elegant. Steve spared no expense when he put his name on this venture.  \n\nWe ordered room service the day after my husband decided to go a little nuts because he was feeling a little groggy and eggs and pancakes and coffee and diet coke was $75!  OUCH.\n\nThe European pool was beautiful, but the \"bubbies\" that showed themselves ranged from good plastic surgeons to something out of national geographic.  At around 2pm when people have gotten all nice and drunk you see some pretty interesting things happening at the pool.  I saw everything from guys making out with other guys to girls making out with other girls to swapping.  \n\nThere are pool cabana's that you can rent and the pool beds start at about $500 for the day.  But, you can negotiate the price...\n\nEJ was our \"pool boy\" and the word \"no\" never left his lips.  I love that.  \n\nThe front desk wasn't the most helpful and they seemed annoyed if you have a question.  We had some pretty rowdy neighbors (the walls are very thin) and everynight after the clubs would close, they would bring their party back to their room.  I could hear all about who the boys made out with, who rejected them, blah blah blah.  They must not have done that well because up until last night, I never heard girls in their room!  We called security after the third night of being woken up at 3am until they finally fell asleep at around 6.  And they seemed upset that we called security to ask them to send someone up.  It was the statement of \"what do you want us to do about it\" that kinda sent me over the edge.  Look, don't mess with my sleep!\n\nThe concierge was awesome.  She made reservations at Le Reve for us--which if you get a chance go see it, it's spectacular--and made all our dinner reservations with a smile on her face.  Loved it.  \n\nI think if they could get their staff all trained to be helpful and to really make the guest feel wanted, this would be a five star experience instead of hit and miss.
