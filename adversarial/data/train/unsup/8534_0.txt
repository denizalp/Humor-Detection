This place is amazing if you love good coffee and a great place to people-watch or just bask in a sunny day. It's usually packed and out of the many times I've been there I've been able to sit down at a table once. The best seats are the ones facing the windows though. \n\nIt's also a great place to buy coffee\/tea related products! Overall, it's one of my top cafes.
