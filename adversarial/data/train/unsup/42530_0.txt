Ok so I wasn't expecting the most delicious egg ever but... THATS EXACTLY WHAT I GOT.\n\nA little pricey, but the \"Slut\" special is so delicious and unique. I didn't know you could transform an egg so much. Simple, fast, easy, and not too bad for you. Highly recommend especially if you're staying at the Cosmo
