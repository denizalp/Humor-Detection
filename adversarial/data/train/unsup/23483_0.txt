Buddha Belly is such a promising place with Hawaiian\/Asian influences. I recently went for dinner during the middle of the week for dinner as I've heard only great things about it and while they were sadly out of baguettes to make their po boy and banh mi among other things it still didn't stop me from giving the rest of their menu a try. I was able to try their version of the po boy but as a wrap which was juicy and had a good amount of spice. For sides I tried their dragon fries potato salad and their house made chips which I enjoyed. One minor hitch was their 9th Island pizza which for $10 was kinda skimpy on the toppings. Throughout the entire meal the owners were great in coming over, even coming by and hooking it up with a pumpkin crunch dessert! I'll definitely be back for sure!
