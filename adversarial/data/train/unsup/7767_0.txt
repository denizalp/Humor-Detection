I arrived hungry for dinner. That was the first mistake. After ordering the teriyaki bowl from the huge menu on the screens hanging from the ceiling, I took a buzzer and waited. And waited. And waited. 30 minutes later, I was ready to eat my own hand when the buzzer went off. I went to the register and there was my bowl. There were two problems with that bowl. \n\nFirst, it was salmon. I didn't want salmon, I expected beef or chicken. Turns out that the smaller menu on the counter says in small print, 'salmon', and that I had to specifically order it with chicken or beef. Takeaway lesson for you all -- don't look at the massive menu on the screens; they mislead you. Look at the smaller menus in finer print on the counter by the register. \n\nSecond, the portion size was so small it would be considered perfect for a light lunch, but for dinner it was too small. I'm not a big eater, but I ate that bowl and was still hungry. \n\nNot wanting to wait another 30 minutes, I went to Whole Foods and got some extra food.\n\nI may be back to try it at lunchtime, but if I have to wait 30 minutes like I did for dinner, I will not be going back.\n\nOn a positive note, I thought the food was prepared excellently, and was very flavorful.
