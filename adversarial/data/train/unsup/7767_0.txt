I wasn't impressed. The dancers were attractive, and good at their craft, but the $50 cover seemed outrageous even for Vegas, and the drinks were about $20 apiece. Plus, when we first arrived, two other customers were in the club but we still waited nearly 20 minutes for our drinks. As part of a group, I had a great time, but that had little to do with the Hustler Club. Next time, I will check Yelp and offer suggestions, instead of letting someone else choose where to go.
