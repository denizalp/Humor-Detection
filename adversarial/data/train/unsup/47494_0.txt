Great to amazing breakfast. We had to wait a little while to be seated around 10 AM but that is to be expected. \n\nWe were visiting from out of town and wanted a local breakfast to try and Dick's Diner delivers. We had the eggs benedict (yum) and standard orders of pancakes, overeasy eggs, sausage links (YUM) and french toast. We will skip the french toast next time (dry) and stick with the basics. \n\nWe also indulged on the most amazing piece of coconut cream pie (merengue to die for, really) and the perfect amount of cream. We also tried a piece of the custard pie but do not get it if you do not like nutmeg, it really overpowers the custard and you won't like it. I wish they made a non nutmeg version of the custard pie, it would be a total win for us. \n\nOverall, amazing staff, great eats and your typical diner atmosphere.
