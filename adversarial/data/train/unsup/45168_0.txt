My boyfriend and I go here about once a week or every other week. Their service can be sketchy if they are really busy from time to time but we will always go back since they are right across the street. They have delivery but we usually do the curbside pickup since it's convenience. The slice and a drink is a great deal. We like their pizza, wings and their cheesesteaks are great! We have had many things including some of the sides here and almost all of it is good. However, I wish their salads were better than just iceberg lettuce.
