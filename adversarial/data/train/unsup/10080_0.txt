Major points for having one of the most wicked cool ambiences of any hang out sort of place I've ever been in. Very cool.\nMajor deductions for crappy service, drink purchasing requirements (and frequently being out of the drink you order), and rules limiting when you can sit in the balcony area.\nThe sheesha itself has been of varying quality.\nIf you want hookah, you're better off going to Tempe instead.
