This was an enjoyable show.  I never could quite afford the real Rat Pack when I was a college student and they were in town, so seeing a tribute show later in life may be a pale substitute but was a nice alternative.  The performers were close on in voice, and not too far off in looks.  But the oddest thing the night my group attended is that Sammy Davis wasn't there.  We were told that Sammy was on a trip to San Francisco, but \"a new kid\" who harbored great talent was going to be introduced to us  That \"kid\" turned out to be Elvis!  Two-thirds of the rat pack with an Elvis tribute artist seemed like an unusual juxtaposition of entertainers, but on this particular night the combination worked quite well, and was a refreshing change up!\n\nFor those who like small and not too expensive shows and good singing in an intimate setting, I do recommend this one.
