Delicious burger, all the way from the East Coast! \nThis place is amazing. Cheesy amazingness. I was blown away by these guys. They offer a mouth watering burger at a very fair price. The toppings were all fresh, and the meat was incredibly juicy and just covered in cheese. It's like a East Coast version of the West Coast In-N-Out Burger. \nThe fries were crinkle cut, and fresh. I'd never had fresh crinkle cut, it's always been frozen for me. Yummy. Had their Vanilla shake, which was creamy and delicious. I was amazed to see that they do offer the regular shake flavors, as well as one weird, monthly flavor. This month's flavor was blueberry custard. I wasn't feeling that adventurous at the time... \nThere was hardly a wait to get served, and the food didn't take long at all to arrive. The place was clean and well lit. I enjoyed the fact that you could post a selfie from their photo booth and email it to all your jealous friends!  \nThis burger place is attached to the NY, NY Casino, since it is a Manhattan burger establishment and all.
