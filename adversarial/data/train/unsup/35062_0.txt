Breakfast place but we came in here only because of convenience. It was close to our hotel but food was just ok. Had the egg white omelette with spinach, mushrooms and cheese and tell me how do you forget to put the cheese? It's one of 3 ingredients. The waiter got all of our omelettes mixed up and some of us had to wait to eat while they re fired our omelette. Not very good service although I must say their bloody Mary's were on point. Exactly what you need after a night of drinking too much. \n\nThere was also only 7 of us yet they charged us for 8 entrees. Pay attention to your bill here! They might try to add things that weren't even consumed. Will not be coming back to this place. With so many options for eating there's no reason to return.
