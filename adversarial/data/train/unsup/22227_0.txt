A lot of hype and a little disappointing. While the rolls are cute, it's pretty expensive for essentially made-on-the-spot frozen cream, milk, sugar, and flavor.\n\nThe line is ridiculous. About a 30 minute wait total at 2pm on a Wednesday. There is plenty of room in the store, but instead they limit it to like 5-8 people in the store and have everyone else wait outside. Normally, this isn't a huge deal, but it was really, really hot outside. Can't they just let more people in the store and queue it up along the wall so that people can get some AC? Plus there's no place to sit and eat, so you have to take it back out into the heat and eat it quickly before it melts.\n\nPart of the reason why it's so freaking slow is because there are only 3 iced table tops to make the rolls. One machine is down, because they have to do hourly maintenance defrosting, so you're left with 2 machine and each order taking 3+ minutes.\n\nAt least you can admire the labor that goes into making this dessert. The fruity flavors like strawberry (Love at First Bite) and mango (Takes Two to Mango) require more work because they chop up the fruit and mix it into the base. The non-fruit flavors like black Sesame (Miss Black) or Earl grey (Mr. Grey) have less of a show, since it's just pouring the base down, waiting until it hardens, and then pushing them into rolls.\n\nThere's no customization. All the cups are pre-set with the flavors and toppings for $6.50. We had Miss Black with a black sesame base, grass jelly, and condensed milk. While it was unique, the ice cream itself is much harder\/less creamy than normal ice cream, since you're not whipping air into it. If you have ever made ice cream yourself with the Cuisinart maker, this is almost identical to the harder bits that you scrape off of the bowl at the end. Still good, but not as exciting as you'd expect.\n\nOnly cash or credit.
