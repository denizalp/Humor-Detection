New BBT place in Mississauga!!!!\n\nStumbled upon their instagram page on my feed and ohhh emmm geee you have no idea how excited to see something opening in the hood and not all the way in the far east! \n\nThirstea is opened in the south east corner of Hurontario and dundas. Very hidden in a plaza ive never visited. Parking lot was very busy, I almost couldnt find a spot. But i did see a sign saying theres additional parking at the back. \n\nThe must try is their creamy fruit series!! They use REAL FRUITS and cream. Not the powder drinks that you often get at bbt places. They are also the first in Mississauga that offers 24K gold topping for an extra cost! Loved the cozy environment. High bar tables and comfy bean bags. Board games and TV, lots of plugs if you want to work on your laptop here! Owners designed their cute logo. Come try this place when youre bored of the main chains ;)
