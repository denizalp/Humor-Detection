My original review was almost a year ago, and I think it's time for an update. It appears as though Haru has been listening to their customers, yay!!!  They now have a sign in sheet with a sign stating that you need to sign in when you show up in order to be seated. They are still crowded like usual, however it seems like they've hired a whole new wait staff. There's no longer just one or two people running around trying to keep up, they have enough people there now to make sure you're taken care of and you have refills etc... when you need them. Their sushi is still the same, that is to say good when fresh, if they're not busy I wouldn't go for anything that's supposed to be cooked e.g. gyoza or vegas rolls, they get kind of gross when cold. Overall, the experience here has improved and it doesn't take forever to get your check anymore. Much imporved Haru, I'm proud of you!!
