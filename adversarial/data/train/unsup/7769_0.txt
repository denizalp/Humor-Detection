Dirtiest hotel bar none. Somehow we booked this place for a week's stay during CES, and upon arrival, we were all shocked at the conditions.\n\nEntering the hotel, many overhead lights were broken. A Bug Terminix Log binder sits in the front lobby due to the Claremont's constant battle with Bed Bugs. All bad signs pointing to go out the way you came in. \n\nWe had 3 rooms. The first room was in bad shape. Bed covers were not on the bed and laid in a pile in the corner of the room. There were red stains on the bed. Drinks from previous occupants stood on the tables. Now the bathroom was the worst of it all--just nasty. \n\nThe 2nd room was in better shape, and had a TV. Not all rooms have TVs. The issues with this room was that the walls were falling apart. The fridge was alive with mold. Both rooms had broken lights, so the rooms were very dark. Lastly, the bathroom was just as bad as the first room. \n\nThe best part of the Claremont would be the front lobby staff. They're super nice and try to make the customer happy. Unfortunately, this was not enough for us to stay there, and we left immediately after checking in. The hotel charged us a night's stay. \n\nWe left without looking back!
