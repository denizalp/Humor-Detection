I have been to a lot of salons and had many pedicures along with other services. I went to Body Beautiful for a pedicure and used a gift card. I could have done a better job on my own feet and saved $35. They barely massaged, scrubbed, or treated my feet. I'd say the experience was less than 20 minutes.  I was looking forward to a girls day out and it far below mediocre, it was a rip off. My friend was pretty disappointed too. It was honestly the worst pedicure I have ever had. I basically paid $35 to get my toes painted. I will not go back to this place again.
