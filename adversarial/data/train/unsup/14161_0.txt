OH EM GEE! I love this place! My friend Rachel R. found this place on Yelp! She booked our appointments online and right away we got a confirmation e-mail and text. The day before, we got another text and e-mail reminder and again the day of. Having to make the appointments online, there were 30 minute difference from the three appointments. We walked in and the employee told us we should have just called it in and told them we were going together. Luckily there were three spots available next to each other. Our appointments were at 2 ish and they were super busy. \n\nMy friends and I did the Chocolate and Champagne pedicure ($58). It was perfect!  Your feet are soaked in a warm chocolate aroma bath rich with antioxidants while you're enjoying a glass (or 2) of champagne. All of the hot stone therapy pedicures include plus exfoliation with aromatic chocolate scrub and a paraffin treatment. It was an awesome experience that I would recommend this to my friends who are visiting Vegas. \n\nThe staff were also very friendly.
