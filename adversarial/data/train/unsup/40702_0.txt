My party had a reservation and we were seated immediately. This place is good! I ordered the fiesta bowl and it was huge! I could only eat half and had to take the rest home (always a plus). The waitress was really nice and accommodating.  My friend ordered 3 tacos and she couldn't finish them. The serving sizes are huge. This place also has daily drink specials, but we did not order drinks. I'll definitely be back!
