Soooo! Allow me to be clear, I have never taken the opportunity to use anything that has THC and at almost 50 I continue to choose not to use. So this post is about my customer service experience. My bartender, Eszter@NUWU was the best. She was kind and thoughtful yet able to clearly explain CBD cream and Tincture. How these products work in and on the body and brain. I'm grateful to her warm engagement.
