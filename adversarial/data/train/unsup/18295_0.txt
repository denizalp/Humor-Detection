Okay, as soon as you check in and you hear, \"I went ahead and upgraded you to a one bedroom suite,\" you know it's going to be a great time. The Hilton Elara, formerly PH Westgate, is still pretty much Planet Hollywood, with nearly identical floorplans. There were two of us in a suite that could have easily slept 5 (with the sofa bed)...6 if someone took the jacuzzi tub.\n\nWater pressure is great, housekeeping did a stellar job each of the days we were there, and this was an amazing space to come back to after (or ...to NOT come back to!). Peter Thomas Roth toiletries meant I didn't have to touch my own bottles all weekend. The cost of the room ended up being well worth it.\n\nIt will take a while before taxi drivers will know where the place is, but for now I'm happy we stayed here!
