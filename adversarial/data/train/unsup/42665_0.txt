Matsuda is average as a AYCE. Food and service are both fine.\n\nhighlights: unagi don is really good here. I also liked the matsuda golden shrimp which tasted good but alittle too much mayo for the stomach. Beef sashimi is also good here.\n\nI would still return to matsuda once in a while when i crave some easy sushi and feel lazy.
