Vegas isn't really my cup of tea, except that in Vegas you could probably get a 3 foot cup of piping hot tea with sparkles, glitter and sugar cubes in the shape of boobies or certain lascivious Roman gods. And then it would totally be my cup of tea. \n\nAnyway, Cafe Lago was a lot of style and not a whole lotta substance. We arrived fairly late, around 9, actually, so we assumed that the buffet was depleted because of the hour, but it sounds like there just isn't a whole lot to begin with. They did have shrimp cocktail, so I wasn't complaining. They also had these absolutely gigantic figs at the salad bar. They were seriously the size of apples and really quite delicious. I think my mom had three! \n\nThe service wasn't very good. Our server's shift ended about 30 minutes into our meal and he asked us to pay our bill then. We did, tipped him, and then realized that we didn't get a receipt. So should we tip the new server, too? It still isn't clear to me whether or not she was expecting a tip, but we (are cheap asses) and decided that at a buffet, there is no reason to tip twice. \n\nAll in all, it was a fun time and probably something you want to do if it's your first time in Vegas (it was for me), but it's not Cafe Lago you're going for, it's the experience of a buffet in Vegas.
