I've always been a fan of Boyd and Blair vodka and I knew they were local, but I had no idea HOW local. Went today for a tour, which was quick but very informative. I love that they have a mini bar set up with interesting cocktails that taste absolutely wonderful. I also love that everything about the place is manual and run by 6 people. It really truly is HAND-CRAFTED vodka.\n\nI also learned that they have classes where they are teaching cocktail making techniques, and I definitely plan to take one. I need to hone my mixology skills and they're ready to help.\n\nIt was a lovely afternoon and I will take others there for tours and tastings. I look forward to future visits.
