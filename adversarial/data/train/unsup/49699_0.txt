I went in to Red Robin tonight because it was \"Jim Day\"  to promote the return of the Jim Beam burger and my name just happens to be James. I walked over to the bar and the bartender Amanda came over right away and took my order. The free burger didn't come with fries, but they were offered to me so I added them on. I also ordered a beer while I waited for my food. \n\nThe burger and fries came out pretty fast and was delivered with ranch as well, which is always nice to not have to ask for. Amanda checked on me shortly after it came out to see if I needed anything. While I enjoyed my meal, the manager (didn't catch his name) who was working on various things said hello several times and asked me how the food was and called me by name (apparently he had been told I was taking them up on the free burger promo). Overall I found the staff to be very pleasant and I actually felt like they were glad I participated in the promo and appreciated me coming in as opposed to being treated like a freeloader who just came in for a cheap meal. \n\nTo be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the food at Red Robin, the burgers are good and the fries are okay, but I keep coming back to this location because the staff has always been consistently pleasant at this location. 5\/5 for service, 4\/5 for food, rounding up because I was treated right. Will definitely be returning.
