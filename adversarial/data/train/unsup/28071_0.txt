Eh is all I can say. I lived close to this location, and I mean right behind it lol and I watched it be built. I was so excited to have a close restaurant and I LOVE chicken fingers!! I couldn't wait to try Raising Cane's. When I walked in, I wondered where the rest of the menu was. They only have a few menu items, that are basically the same exact thing. I ordered the 4 count chicken finger combo and ditched the coleslaw for another slice of Texas toast. The food came out pretty quick and looked pretty good. I was shocked and a little disappointed that they only offered one sauce to dip the chicken fingers in, after all I am a hardcore bbq sauce lover, but I decided to give the sauce a fair shake. The sauce was okay, but that's all I can say. I wouldn't reach for it nor would I order it again. The chicken, to my surprise, was basically flavorless, and my batch lacked in crunch. I was so disappointed because I had heard so many good things about this place. The fries were eh - they needed more salt and pepper. The Texas toast saved my taste buds here, it is out of this world delicious! Aside from the Texas toast, I was disappointed. Even the lemonade was too watered down. All-in-all, I'll stick to chick-fil-a as my go to place for chicken fingers.
