Oh my gosh, I'm SO excited for the first Nepali\/ Indian restaurant in Charlotte. King of Spicy is so good and the staff is very friendly! They have a huge vegetarian selection and many meat options. The veggie momo (like dumplings) is delicious! At my table we had the Chicken Biryani, Bhibdu-Do-Piaza, Aloo Gobi, and Vindaloo Lamb, everyone loved their meal! Also with each meal you get to pick your level of spice so even if you don't like spicy food you can get something delicious but if you like super hot, they'll melt your face off! So good I will definitely be back! Long live the King!
