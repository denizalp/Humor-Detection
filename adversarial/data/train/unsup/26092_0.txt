Tasty food but they messed up my order and brought my food cold. (Bento box, so the rice tempura and the beef was cold  ) \nBeef was too thick and very little of it \nI am used to miso soup coming with the bento box too... \nAlso, sat at the front of the restaurant ( view of the road ) and service was very bad
