After nights of begging, BF finally agreed to come here with me. At first I thought he was being the snob that he truly is; who the hell doesn't eat buffet while visiting Vegas? So, we came here on the Christmas day for their \"Holiday Brunch,\" which cost $42 a person. \n\nI was so excited, assuming with $42, there would probably be something fancy inside. But after we were seated, and I circled back and forth of all the offerings, I saw nothing but ordinary food. Sure, some of the plates are served \"tapas style,\" but honestly, they were nothing special. And since we arrived around 10ish, I didn't even see any shrimp nor crab legs! I thought to myself, \"honestly, $42 for brunch items???\" \n\nLuckily, we were taking our time, so when we were about to leave (1130ish,) I heard someone yelled out \"they're started serving crab legs and shrimp!!\" So I finally got to enjoy what I really came here for... except, the crab legs were just ok, not as juicy as I expected, plus, the shrimps weren't even peeled. (and for those of you that are looking for oysters? don't even bother...)\n\nI was going to rate \"wicked spoon\" 2 stars, however, they did serve really good desserts. Unlike any other buffets I had ever tried, \"wicked spoon\" offers an incomparable dessert station like I've never seen. \n\nI think of all the Cosmopolitan restaurant collection, \"Wicked Spoon\" is probably by far the least of my favorite. There is no comparison with \"Jaleo,\" \"China Poblano,\" and most certainly not with \"Rose.Rabbit.Lie,\" which incidentally located just outside of \"Wicked Spoon.\" Overall, I'd say save your $42 and go enjoy something nice, like the Eiffel Tower brunch.
