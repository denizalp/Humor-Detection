I've been going to Jewels Bakery since they opened, and have gotten a lot of free cookies with check-in so I'm finally writing a review...there are pros and cons to Jewels but I continue to go because the pros definitely out weigh. \nPros..the food is delish. Especially the bakery items. Everything is gluten free, since I do not have Celiac I can say the cupcakes and bars are better than some of the white flower filled bakery offers in Phoenix.\nThe place is locally owned and was opened with a purpose to support other families and provide options to the community. I love that.\nThe service is good. I have never had an issue with orders or customer service.\nCons....mostly selfish but it seems like they made their actually food menu smaller since they opened. I really like their food so I wish they had more to choose from, especially vegetarian.\nBe prepared to spend a bit more. It is probably more expensive to run a gluten free bakery so I will continue to support. \nBasically you should go. Especially if you are skeptical of gf food and want to try a good representative.
