Went with family a group of eight. Service was slow which was expected given how busy it was. My first and last time. My food was just okay. I got the nachos. Everything was just bland. No type of seasoning or flavor at all.  Everyone else in my group agreed about their food except my little sister who just happened to get breakfast food. All of us who had appetizers or dinner just wasn't pleased.
