I have a huge food crush on David Chang. I'm pro MSG, no matter how unfashionable it might be. It makes things delicious. \n\nI was at a conference at the Shangri-La hotel, so I wooed my cutie here after his work day for a little happy hour. We snuggled up by the window and watched people coming and going and sipped on spritzes. We then had the pork buns, chicken wings, peanuts and their house ramen. It was all salty goodness and if I was mega wealthy I'd eat here on the regular. On that note, though, if you're just having a snack and not drinking, the price point is actually not at all scary.
