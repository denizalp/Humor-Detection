Stopped in here on Victoria Day - the food and beer selection are fantastic. The pigs head nachos look amazing, and I want to try all the entrees! \n\nDespite quality food and drink, the set up of the patio isn't great. The height of the tables does not align with the chairs.  I found it hurt my back after awhile. \n\nService here was also very slow. They were busy, but we waited almost 25 minutes to get our bill. I recommend off hours or going in a group that can command more attention.
