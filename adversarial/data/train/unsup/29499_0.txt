First of all, parking is a bit of a mess since it shares a lot with in n out.  Sat in the bar area.  Service was attentive but they seemed to keep forgetting things. It was busy but they seemed to be fully staffed so I shouldn't have to ask 2-3 times for something.  Onto the food.  They dropped off chips and 2 kinds of salsa and a bean dip.   Salsa are pretty generic as was the beans.  Ordered a shrimp ceviche that was recommended by waiter but they seemed to forget about it.  Got the fajitas since that's part of the name.  Nice flashy presentation but pretty boring on the follow through.   Lacked flavor.  After asking the runner that we never got our ceviche, it finally showed.  It was okay but again lacked flavor.  Sadly, cucumber was most noticeable part which obviously shouldn't be the stand out ingredient.  All in all, a nice place but more for atmosphere than food.
