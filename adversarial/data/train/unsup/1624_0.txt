I've heard a lot of buzz about this place on Yelp and my hubby loves him a meat pie or pasty so this sounded like the place for us! \n\nIt's located in Commercial Center in a very none disscript building just the name Cornish Pasty above the door. The interior is  awesome. They have reclaimed church pews for benches and a beautiful bar! The walls are covered in old pictures with really cool frames. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly, but the food! Omg the food!!! It was superb! I had the Philly Steak Pasty. It was huge! It was also filled with steak, mushrooms, onions, peppers and cheese all perfectly melted together in a toasty flaky pastry. On the side was a yummy gravy that just made the dish that much better when you spread it over the pasty. My husband had the Chicken Alfredo Pasty. It too was huge!!! It had chicken, ham, onions, cheese and potatoes. It came with a very zesty marinara sauce. We also ordered the Garlic Chips! Oh boy! It had tons of chopped garlic which I love. The fries were crisp yet soft. It was a great balance. It came with a ketchup that I think was house made cause it too was extra yummy! \n\nThey have an excellent selection of beers that I will totally be back to try! Not only is this place delicious it is very inexpensive!! My husband and I ate for $24 not including tip. We left totally full and satisfied. I can not wait to go back!!! What a great new local business!!! I'll be spreading the word for sure!
