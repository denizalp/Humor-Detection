I have never written a review on here before but I have been driven this crazy by a place before. \n\nAs I sit here and write this I can hear the pounding coming through the walls and vent system. Normally at midnight on a Saturday I really wouldn't care since I am 27 and am used to loud music. It is ridiculous that they are 2 ROOMS AWAY and I can still here the 'thud, thud, thud' of their bro music. Do I try to find security? Of course, I do. Can I find them? No. I'm sure they were too busy putting violation stickers on cars that don't come off to bother actually doing what they should be doing. \"Is there a number for security?\" one may ask. Apparently not as I have searched online and called every number given to me when I moved in. \n\nany other complaints? Sure. The place looks great but the walls are made of paper mache and the windows made of saran wrap. Every car that drives by you can hear and EVERY EFFING THUD FROM THE BROS DOWN THE HALL IS CLEAR AS DAY. \n\nI am out in a week and have no intentions of returning or telling others to go to it.
