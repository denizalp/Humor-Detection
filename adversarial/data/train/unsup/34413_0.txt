Much better than one would expect from the name. After a lot of walking around, we settled on this place solely for its convenience, but we enjoyed a surprisingly good meal as well. Though staff was pretty harried when we sat down, we got good service in short time. We ordered the prix-fixe and were served perfectly cooked meals, beautifully presented with interesting flavors. \n\nGiven the name and the location of this place, you'd be right to expect the worst. But the night we went in, we were delighted with a delicious, skillfully prepared meal at an amazing price.
