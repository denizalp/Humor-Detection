Review of \"Just Like Home Doggie Hotel and Grooming\" Tina V. March 6, 2014:\n\nI adopted a rescue in January and wanted to check out doggie daycare in my area. I went to one place, where the staff was nice enough, but I just didn't get a great feeling. I kept searching the internet and soon after found Just Like Home's website. One of the first things that caught my attention was their statement: \"Just Like Home's overnight boarding rates are all inclusive.  We do not ala-cart charge for love and affection, indoor and outdoor play time, medicine administration, belly rubs or treats\". I had noticed that other places really do charge higher rates for belly rubs\/bed tuck-ins! I made arrangements to bring in my dog for a meet and greet.\n\nMy dog has now been to Just Like Home 3 separate times (2 full days and one overnight) and I have been nothing short of thrilled with the service and the Staff! Apparently my dog feels the same, because when I came to pick her up after her overnight visit, she sat down in the lobby as if to say, \"no, I don't wanna' leave yet\"! A little humbling, but I was happy she had such a great time!\n\nA few of the MANY bonuses to Just Like Home are:\n* 24 hour Human interaction\/supervision which can be easily seen on one or more of the 20 plus closed circuit cameras (I can access from my laptop or cell phone 24 hours a day to check in on my dog)!\n* A Splash Park with Water Features and Pools!\n* LOTS of playtime outdoors and resting\/sleeping times are in large rooms with others...not in kennels (I really love this)! Look over their website for many more details.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend http:\/\/www.justlikehomedoggiehotelandgrooming.com to both locals as well as visitors to Las Vegas. The Mother-Daughter team of Pam and Tracey have nailed this business with their very warm, personal and caring touches and that can be seen reflected in the Staff as well. I'll be leaving my new furbaby at Just Like Home when I go for a 2 week vacation soon, and my only real concern is that I may have to bribe her to come home with a Steak or Cheeseburger! LOL
