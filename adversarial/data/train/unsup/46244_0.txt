This was my first time to eat at Pita Jungle and not my last time.  I had thought it was a fast-food place and was surprised to find it's a sit-down restaurant.\n\nThe food was very good.  I ordered the chicken that comes on a bed of mashed potatoes and spinach.  My wife had a gyro.  Both very good.\n\nThe service was also very good.
