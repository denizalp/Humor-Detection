This is one of the banks my folks use and I've recently been more involved in their day to day financials due to unforeseen issues. Dad did quite a bit of research before choosing to add them to their rotation of financial institutions and let me say: he chose well! \n\nStaff is friendly, knowledgeable and recognizes you on sight after a visit. Sheesh, if they gave me a Tootsie Roll, I'd think I was back home at Long Island Savings Bank! \n\nFor being low fee, extra concentrated on customer service and a golf cart ride away from folks: nothing bad to say. Almost expect George Bailey to come out and save Summerlin from Pottersville while Clarence gets his wings. Old School service in a new school world. Swear I've heard Zsu Zsu say \"Teacher says: every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings\" and seen her \"petals\"\nas I've left. That kind of feeling is rare and, dare I say: \"Wonderful...\" \n\n\nYelp 100 Challenge
