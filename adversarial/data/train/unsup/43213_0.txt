Great Shakes, burgers and dogs here.  They finally started taking credit cards 2 years ago which was a welcome change by all.  You order your food togo and get through the drive thru!  I mean let's face it, we are lazy so having that option at a place thats not your everyday fast food thats served billions or insist on doing it your way, is nice :-)
