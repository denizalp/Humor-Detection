I've been there a couple times. Drinks are poured well. Food seems to be pretty good, but I haven't gotten much more than a quesadilla. People are friendly... Sometimes a bit too friendly. Wait staff is pretty hot or miss. I will say that is an area of opportunity. I have friends that have been there quite a bit more. They have their waiter or waitress that they try to get so their service is good.
