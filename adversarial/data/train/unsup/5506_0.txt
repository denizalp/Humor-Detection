Benn an addict for over a month now. One month and nine popcorn flavors later, and I'm trying to think how to convince my girlfriend to swing by so I can get more taffy on the way  home!\n Macaroni and Cheese is my fav, hers is Loaded Baked Potato is gets, the weakest get a low sat to mix with them, and Lite Carmel for later.\n The tins are expensive, but if you need a quick gift.... The bags reasonable. Then the Taffy. I loaded a bag each time, ever changing flavors, one of the stellar is Buttered Popcorn flavor, cute, HUH?\n They also gave fudge. Haven't tied it. They are more than generous with free samples.
