I saw this show with a friend for her birthday and it is my absolute favorite of all the Cirque shows here in Vegas.  Felt like an eye-gasm! ... If you love The Beatles, it is a must. We had great seats, not up by the stage but not in the very back. There is so much going on all over. They cover alot of their songs, my favorite being Blackbird. I also loved the performance of Octopus's Garden. I want to go back and watch it again! \n\nAlso, check out the Revolution lounge before or after the show, We went and got a drink before the show started.
