The Fox Bistro is the restaurant at the Radisson so we were assuming that the food would be fine and gave it a try as we had a coupon for it.\n\nAs you walk in, the first thing you notice is that it is very dated inside, and the bar crowd. We were the only table in the whole place besides some people staying at the hotel watching the world cup and having some drinks at the bar.\n\nThe menu is very simple, not big at all. I wasn't very hungry so I just got a club house while my other got the lasagna. \n\nThe waiter wasn't paying any attention to us at all, he was busy watching the game with the guys at the bar, we had to keep getting his attention. If we were the only table don't you think he should of gave us just a little more attention?\n\nWhen the food finally came, I saw all these yellowish looking stuff on my sandwich, the description said mayonnaise NOT HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE! I dislike mustard and I was shocked to see honey mustard all over my sandwich, I have never seen a club house with mustard on it, so I was very surprised.\n\nThe lasagna looked very portion packed and when we asked about it, the waiter said \"its frozen, we just heat is up\" you would assume for 20 bucks at least could  make their own lasagna. What's the point going to a restaurant to have something heated up when you can do the same thing at home?\n\nI'm glad I had to chance to see what this place was about as I was curious but I will never be going back.
