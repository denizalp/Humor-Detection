Since my initial review I've come back to Khmer Thai a couple times to try more of the dishes. On my most recent visit I brought a group of about 10 people. The group included a wide range of people: some vegetarians; a few that have travelled in Southeast Asian and know a lot about the food from the region; and a couple who are totally inexperience with Thai or Cambodian food. At the end of the night every single person was raving about the place, saying it's the best Southeast Asian food they've had in the city.\n\nThis visit also gave me an opportunity to try some of the vegetarian options. I can now say Khmer Thai gets my vegetarian friendly seal of approval.\n\nWe ordered three soups and 10 mains and our bill came out to $108 including tax. Portions are huge and all dishes come with a heap of rice. An unbelievable deal for this quality and amount of food. Our order:\n\nSoup\nThom Kai Gai ($8.79) - This soup looks like a bowl of milk, i.e. not very promising, but tastes great. A coconut not milk broth flavoured with galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and chillies. Mostly broth with a bit of chicken. Not too spicy.\nCambodiana Soup ($8.79) - See previous review. Still my favourite dish.\nSoup Delight (8.79) - The menu says hot and sour soup but it's nothing like Chinese hot and sour soup. A light and very flavourful broth filled with vegetables and tofu. You can get it with chicken or shrimp instead of tofu. If you do order tofu they make it with a vegetarian broth. Careful, this one's more spicy than it looks.\n\nMeat Mains\nKako Khmer ($7.89) - See previous review. Worth trying for the interesting, sweet flavour.\nPhad Thai Sai Khai ($8.49) - Didn't try this one myself but the guy that ordered it thought it was good.\nGolden Beef ($7.89) - Probably the best main we had. Beef and vegetables in a delicious coconut based red sauce (not red curry though) with peanuts. I only tried the vegetables but the guy that ordered it said the meat was delicious. A little spicy.\nKhmer Pancake ($7.89) - Certainly the most interesting dish. A large rice flour pancake with a yellow colour like a corn tortilla was folded in half over a heap of chicken, shrimp, bean sprouts, lettuce, and cucumber. A little bland compared to the other dishes but unique.\n\nVegetarian Mains\nTofu with Vegetable ($7.50) - Tofu with broccoli and other vegetables in a rich red curry sauce. A little spicy. The best vegetarian option for those that can't handle a lot of spice.\nChow Mein Noodle with Tofu ($7.50) - As you could probably predict this was the only dish that wasn't great. Too salty and not much other flavour. Possibly a good option for those that can't handle any spice at all.\nGreen Curry Tofu ($7.50) - Tofu with bamboo shots and deliciously sweet eggplant in a rich green curry sauce. Very spicy. The best vegetarian option if you dig the heat.
