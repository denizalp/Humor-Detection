Well what I will say first is that the line is very long....even midweek..so prepare yourself for that. When you get in you will find that the atmosphere is nice and they actually have a restroom INSIDE the buffet which is a refreshing change.\n\nThe food is high quality, i was a tad surprised they didn't have more of a selection but none the less the food they did have was good...not spectacular but good. This buffet is VERY crowded so people may be constantly in your way\/walking into you.....typical Strip setback.
