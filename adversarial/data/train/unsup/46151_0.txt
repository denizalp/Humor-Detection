It took me 6 months to find time to take my kids here. They enjoyed it, nice having quite a few options for them to enjoy all while I got to sit down and watch with them nearly always in eyesight. I had high hopes about being able to go in summer for indoor entertainment. Unfortunately the customer service is abysmal. First while there a kid (very young) ran off with my daughters card... we only had one attraction pass left anyway so we just decided to call it quits. \n\nA week later I reviewed my bank statement only to find they charged me twice for the same transaction. I called, the young man who answered tried to transfer me to whom I assumed was a manager... it was a complete stranger who wasn't thrilled to be asked about a duplicate transaction. I was yelled at, then hung up on. I called back only to be asked for my credit card number so they could look into it. I will not give a teenager my card number over the phone. I asked him to just have the manager call me. Which he did at 8 pm at night. He was very disrespectful, reiterated that I needed to provide my card number or come back in  (its 30 minutes from my house. When I said that it was ridiculous that he had no way to reverse his mistake. He said he didn't do anything to me... he was the General Manager and wasn't the one who charged the card twice. Not once was there a \"sorry for the inconvenience\"....
