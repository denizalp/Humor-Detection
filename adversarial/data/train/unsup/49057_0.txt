I've been to this location as well as the one near Concord Mills. They are both slow. If you want fast food to go, I would recommend calling in your order or placing it online. Who knows, maybe it truly takes that long to make flautas? \n\nAs far as the food, I have no complaints. My son loves the Philly cheesesteak flautas. I also love their queso. I will continue to come here, I just know to order ahead if I don't want a long wait.
