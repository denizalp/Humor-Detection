This is a review of the Center Bar at the SLS Hotel and Casino.  I met a friend here for beers one night, and also stopped later in the week to have an after dinner drink with a different group.  Staff are attentive, drinks are well poured and I guess drink prices aren't horribly out of line ($8 for Corona bottles), though this space is really nothing special or out of the ordinary, and the ceiling above the Center Bar which is actually a giant LED screen can actually be annoying at times when it goes from showing graphics and patterns at a normal intensity to all of a sudden displaying a BRIGHT and somewhat blinding display for the next several moments, causing all the patrons at the bar to squint or cover their eyes. Also, while I'm sure this ceiling mounted LED display may have been a great feature back when the SLS was built, technology quickly marches on, and now better and higher resolution displays are now available...This one by comparison seems a bit dated, low resolution and pixilated by modern standards.
