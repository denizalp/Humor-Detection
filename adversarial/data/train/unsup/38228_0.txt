I made an apt for my 18 yr old daughter here on April 5th and got a call that morning leaving me a message that they were cancelling all their patients that day inc my daughters. I rescheduled to April 7th. I called them at 10 am that morning to get an idea of what my OUT OF POCKET cost would be and I was told I would get a call from \"the other office\" after lunch. I got busy and the next phone call I got was from them wanting my card number for a $175.00 charge for ONE VISIT. I explained to the man that I had requested an out of pocket estimate at 10 am that morning and he said \"OK..........\" like I was an idiot! No apology, no compassion- he just acted like a MORON-What a jackass! That was not a small change and MUCH MORE than I expected for one visit with an 'in-network\" chiropractor. I know good help is hard to find but this looser belongs NOWHERE around customer service. He was clueless and apathetic at best! THEY WILL NOT GET ANOTHER PENNY FROM ME! STEAR CLEAR
