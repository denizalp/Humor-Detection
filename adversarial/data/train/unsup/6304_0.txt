Our party of four decided this is definitely a  place you'd want to go for a celebration because it's on the pricey side.  The steaks we had were good.  I was a little disappointed in my filet as it arrived too rare.  When it was returned, the inside was perfect but it no longer looked good... like it was charred but without the char-like flavor.  Our table mate ordered the prime rib.  Texture was nice but it lacked a good prime rib flavor... I have tasted better.  Salad, mushrooms, bernaise were all lovely, as was the Creme brûlée.  For those who enjoy a good cup of coffee after dinner, you won't find it here.  We waited quite awhile for our bill.  While the staff, for the most part were pleasant, we were surprised that they were in jeans.  All in all, an expensive ok dinner.\n\nTo update:  I was asked to send an email, which I did immediately.  It's been almost 7 months and I've heard nothing.  We won't be back.
