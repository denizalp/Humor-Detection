Biggest rip off ever! Never going back again, it cost over $120 for 3 games for 3 people and a pitcher of beer, thanks for charging us for shoes for each game , are you kidding me?  It's no wonder why there is anyone ever there because they take all your money after the first time\nYou are there. It's one thing to charge. 5$ per person per game, but shoes as well??
