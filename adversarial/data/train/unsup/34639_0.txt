Always walked by here and saw a good crowd so figured it was worth checking out before an Indians game. Meh been to better sports bars and there are a ton of better options nearby. It's a decent place to watch the game, they've got a good beer list, and their M-Th specials are pretty solid (50 cent wings, rib specials, etc.) but service is mediocre and the food was unappetizing at best. Wings are decent, but not spicy, even if you order the hot kinds, and the rest of the food was bland, unappealing, and tasted like a low-rent Applebees. I want to love this and be a regular to do their World Beer Tour, but it's just not up to par.
