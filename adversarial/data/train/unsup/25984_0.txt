I first had Azzip Pizza when I was passing by one day and they were offering samples. It was pretty good so I decided to go back and give it a real try! \n\nThis fast casual eatery was pretty quiet and I was impressed by how clean the restaurant was. (I hope that when this place becomes more busy, they keep up with the cleanliness!) \n\nI ordered a \"big zip\" and my friend ordered a \"little zip\". The staff makes the pizza in front of you and adds as much or as little of specific ingredients as you'd like. They are very friendly and will add as many veggies as you want with no extra charge! \n\nThe big zip was easily enough food for two girls and costed only $7.50 before tax (with no meat added). The staff was VERY friendly and seemed to be excited about having customers come in. \n\nThe pizza was pretty good, typical thin crust pizza. As a veggie fan, I really enjoyed the limitless veggies on my pizza! It only took a few minutes to make, which was awesome. My only 2 complaints- the cheese wasn't completely melted. It could've probably used another minute in the oven. Second, I was disappointed that there was no option for whole wheat crust.\n\nRegardless, I was very pleased with the atmosphere, service, and food. I will definitely be back and would recommend you try it too!
