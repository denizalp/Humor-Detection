From our experience last night, I can't understand how this place is not five stars! We started off at the bar, and the bartenders were so friendly and fun that we almost decided to dine there. Unfortunately, sitting side by side doesn't lend for easy conversation with a group. So we moved to a table.\n\nThe ambiance\/decor is hip but comfortable.\n\nWe were greeted by every staff member we passed. Our server was friendly, professional, attentive, and uniquely polite. He would wait a few feet away when he realized we were in a serious point of our conversation instead of bulldozing over just to get what he needed done.\n\nThe menu is varied and interesting that it was difficult to decide what to order, which I love. We started with a 1\/2 dozen east coast oysters and steak tartare. Both of which were absolutely delicious. I could've ordered another steak tartare as my entree. One of us had the fried chicken and two of us had the filet with truffle butter. C'MON. Perfectly cooked and every bite was well seasoned. We shared the sweet potato side, and although I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, I could've licked the bowl clean.\n\nI ordered the John Daly to drink (three to be exact). It was very well balanced and consistent in its delicious taste all three times.\n\nI already plan to go back with several friends for a birthday celebration. Hoping more people give this place a shot so the overall review score can be fixed!
