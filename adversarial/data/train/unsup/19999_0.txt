We haven't been in awhile so I was quite excited to start my day having breakfast at BabyStacks with my hubby on our day off. That was the end of my excitement. \n\nThe place looks nice though so kudos for that but the food is a whole different story. Not worth the $40++ price tag most definitely. My husbands plate was so sad with the corned beef looking so unappetizing, taste was boring. My Portuguese sausage plate wasn't much better either, the egg was slimy and gross. The only saving grace was the garlic fried rice which was pretty good. I order the Lemon Ricotta pancakes on the side with the cream cheese syrup, normally that's my go to but for some odd reason that day it had a weird uncooked batter aftertaste to it. Service was ok, a little bit of a wait as can be expected given the place gets super busy. \n\nI'm rarely impressed with island style breakfast places and this just solidifies it. I'll stick with making my own macadamia nut pancakes, Kimchi fried rice, corned beef, and eggs the way I like it at home. I don't see the appeal of this place anymore, I don't think I'll be back.
