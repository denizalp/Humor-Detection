There are very few bars in Lawrenceville that I have enjoyed to be honest.  Most are just filthy, dingy little rooms.  Belvedere's has the potential to be a great space, but it just looks like somebody's basement.  Having been there for about ten minutes, I had to get involved in a domestic dispute, because some lady spit on her boyfriends(?) face.  If you want to be a filthy dive bar, you should probably have a bouncer, but like I said, this place is just created of fail.  Shitty bartenders that are super full of themselves round out this piece of shit, dirty hole in the wall.  I'm still hoping my trip to the Round Corner Cantina is going to save my Lawrenceville review record.
