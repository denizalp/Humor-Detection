It is a quiet winter morning on a weekend in the desert. The sun outside unfolds through hints of cloud and crisp, refreshing air. Before me rests a mug, two books, a pen. Lifting my eyes, a window opens out to frame the waking human world with all its anxious human pulse.\n\nService here is slow, but not unkind. I blame it on the numbers in this spacious public house - we the crowd of hungry\/thirsty travelers, we the sound of words and thoughts that fill it to the rafters. Twisting my neck I see that nearly every seat is filled.\n\nBefore too long a plate of food arrives and perches just beside me to the left. On it rests an omelet, a clutch of moist potatoes, and reclining halves of toast. A thin film of steam arises from the egg as from my mug. Breathing through the nose, I almost taste it.\n\nVisitors shift past me as I slowly raise a bite. A body ruffles edges of the jacket on my back in apologetic passing. The omelet neatly cut now offers view of steaming contents: wet strings of melted cheese, warm squares of tomato, folded egg, and pebbled scallions.\n\nThe first bite to the last is wrapped in silence, slow breathing, an unpredicted hum of satisfaction. Alternating samples of the toast prove omelet's equal. Another sip of coffee. A stranger exits, smiling. Soon the plate is empty but for scraps.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nFàme Caffe has been calling to me for well over a year now. Sadly, our schedules have refused to sync up until today. I entered Fàme with more than a years' worth of pent up anticipation, and left without the meagerest complaint.\n\nEverything from atmosphere to service to the food was registered a win. In passing, the Caffe seems small and unassuming. Upon entrance, one can't help but be impressed by use of space. Tall ceilings, plentiful seating, and a healthy hum of activity draws you in.\n\nThe menu is surprisingly extensive with primarily health-conscious options. The food does not disappoint. Somewhat restricted hours equal longer lines and greater congestion than other options, but the experience of this place is distinctly worth the wait.\n\nFàme inspires a sense of community and of awareness. Come prepared to stay a little while. Come prepared to eat healthy for a fair price. But do come. You won't be disappointed. I know I'll be back - my spirit and my taste buds have assured me.  ;)\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\n\nI have confirmed that Fàme is, in fact, pronounced Fah-May. This was a source of some confusion for me up until this morning.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDon't miss this hidden gem. Check the hours, work out the scheduling of it, then come by for some really great eats and an inspiring ambiance. The team will likely be busy attending to guests, but they'll be sure to make you feel at home.\n\nFàme Caffe Crew: thank you for the hard work you put in every day. Thank you for the outstanding food and wonderful service, and for creating such a beautiful space and spirit. It's noticed, and it's appreciated. I hope to see you all again very very soon.  :)
