I came here today wanting some good street tacos. I ordered 1 kids quesadilla, 6 tacos and one torta. My bill was $23. I thought it was a bit expensive but i figured it would be a good amount of food. Once I got home I see that the quesadilla is a medium size corn tortilla folded in half. The tacos were small and cold by the time I got home and I live 2 blocks away from this place. I check my receipt and I paid $2.25 per taco, $2.50 for the quesadilla. The only decent thing was the torta, which was $7. I won't be coming back here, I'm highly dissatisfied in the small amount of food you get for the price. It honestly didn't taste that good either, I could have gone to filibertos and had a bigger portion and it would have been cheaper and taste better.
