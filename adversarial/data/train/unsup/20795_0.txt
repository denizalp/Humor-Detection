I was fortunate enough to be invited to a event at the Champion's bar at the racetrack. The restaurant has beautiful view of the track from it's patio. We were given a complementary pre-loaded $2 betting card and a guidebook. We also had the amazing staff of Woodbine racetrack give us tips on how to place our bets and read the book. The betting was very exciting and we had a lot of fun. \n\nLet's get to the food! We got to taste a plethora of appetizers. The tuna tartare was made with fresh herbs and it was delicious. The crab cake sliders were pretty good too, although I didn't like the buns as much and the mustard overpowered the crab a bit. The shrimp cocktail was loaded with shrimp and mayonnaise. Loved the Italian sausage, cheese and fried pineapple skewers as well. \n\nAll the appetizers were very elegantly presented. The waiters were all very professional and friendly. All the delicious savoury foods were not enough, the restaurant also served us a wide array of mouth watering desserts. I had the huge strawberry coated with a layer of rich dark chocolate. I tried the creme brulee which had a perfect hardened crust topped with a blackberry. And then I couldn't help but stuff myself with some heavenly pistachio ice cream sandwich. They were very generous with the pistachios. \n\nI had never imagined a race track would be so much fun. The food and service surpassed my expectations. This is a great place to host a party or an event. They also have a casino and slot machines if you get don't like to watch the horses. I will definitely recommend it to friends and family. They are hosting their Queen's plate event on July 6 this year, which will be a great time to visit this place if you have never been here before.
