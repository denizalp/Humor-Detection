I'm not even done eating and I can already give Lester's five stars. The smoked meat (corned beef I think) is amazing, and the service and environment make lunch a very pleasant experience. The staff have a great rapport with each other; they obviously take a lot of pride in their work, and it adds to an already great experience.
