It's rare that we stay anywhere other than the Palazzo. We had a very last minute event happening at Bally's. We needed to be up and at the event pretty early in the morning, and it seemed to make the most sense to stay there.  The location was perfect and the price was right.\n\nWe booked one of the renovated rooms and, to be honest, it was pretty decent.  We arrived around 9:30pm and were going to be checking out the next day, leaving at the end of the day after our event.  Because of this, we didn't have much in the way of requests (other than non-smoking and a king bed).  That being said, our room on the 7th floor had a view of the big lights they project onto the side of the hotel. Not appealing.  if we were staying for longer, I would have asked to move rooms.\n\nI was glad that they had check-in kiosks and shocked that there were like 30 people in the check-in\/check-out line and hardly anyone using the kiosks!  We used them to check in and then checked out on my phone.  I 100% appreciate Bally's using technology to speed things up! \n\nThe casino itself is pretty small with a lot of the generic type of slots (pandas, flowers, etc). While we didn't have time, the Twilight Zone arcade\/mini-golf area looked pretty cool.  There's a lot of inexpensive options for food, but there is a dearth of breakfast options. Nosh is your best bet.
