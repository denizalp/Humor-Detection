It's a chain restaurant in a local's casino on the bad side of town. It's sufficient and fairly consistent. Hit up this spot for an easy dinner before seeing a movie at the Century theater across the floor. Request indoor seating to avoid casino smoke (open \"patio\" gets the fumes). Service is attentive, with most servers training another employee.\n\nFood on most recent visit was priced a bit higher than I expected but it's been ages since I've been to a TGI. They've added new menu items to try to stay trendy, and I really appreciate that they list their calorie count and nutrition info on the menu- went with a soup\/salad combo instead of other dishes I was eyeing. Food was fresh, friend got a skillet meal that was sizzling and flavorful while mine was as expected. Drink refills were prompt, which is a nice plus.
