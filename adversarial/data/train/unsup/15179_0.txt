Had been longing to try this restaurant.  Went with a friend for dinner and was SO  disappointed.  I did not expect dinner service to be on a polystyrene tray with plastic cutlery.  But I did like the food samples to try.\n\nAs another reviewer mentioned, I did not enjoy any of the spices; also the food was not very hot.  Upon eating dessert, I suddenly found myself crunching on a large piece of hard, jagged and sharp plastic.  I brought it to the attention of the server who looked at it and said 'Oh it is just a piece of broken plastic container!'  I looked at her incredulously, because the unspoken part of her sentence was 'so no big deal!'\n\nI asked her if I could have a second dessert to take home.  She told me 'sure' and went away, only to come back with a plastic container of dessert, which she handed to me and walked away.  There was no apology or concern expressed whatsoever.\n\nAs I paid my bill, I said to the other server,'were you told that I found plastic in my dessert?'  She responded that she had and then charged me full price for the meal.  At the very least they could have comped my dessert.\n\nSadly, I won't be going back.
