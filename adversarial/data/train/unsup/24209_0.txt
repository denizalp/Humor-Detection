Welcome to Las Vegas!\n\nEverybody has seen this iconic sign before whether it was in person, in a magazine, or in a movie.  I've stopped into Vegas well over 12+ times now and while we have driven by the place, we never stopped by for our tourist pictures.  This time changed all that!  After parking in the tiniest lot, the median where this great sign sits basically, we got out and stood in line for five minutes before wandering off-center to the side for a few pictures.  Sorry Elvis impersonator, you weren't enough to keep me standing under sunny skies on Veteran's Day.  Plus, I was hungry for some food and I would rather eat...\n\nWhile yes, it's iconic and holds such significance to the growth and personality of Paradise, Nevada, it's still just a sign.
