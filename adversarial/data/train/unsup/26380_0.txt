2.5 stars. My cheesy chorizo omelette was very delicious but the homefries included, what seemed like, and entire rosemary plant! It was so overpowering even after spending 5 minutes picking out all that I could. Such a bummer! Service was less than mediocre. Never got a refil or a check-in from our waitress besides when she first brought our drinks over. I think I'll give it one more go and make my final review then!
