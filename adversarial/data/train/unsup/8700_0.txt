Get it together!!! Walked in for my first time yesterday,  before walking in I had looked at the menu online.  The menu showed it had been updated a few hours before I arrived.  Once I was checked in, I waited for a lil bit before someone decided to take me back, I was currently the only customer at the time.  The bud tenders didn't seem to wanna help me, I asked bout the price on a full Oz.  they informed me that the price was 380 (extremely high), and then they told me it was 360.....when I looked online, it showed the price being 305.  After showing them the prices on the online menu, I was then told the prices were wrong.  Thrive Cannabis Market has a lot better prices, customer service, and selection.
