I have had similar issues to other people here.  I needed the cleaning to be completed before moving out at the end of the month. I have been rescheduled on three times now, always at the last minute (ex. one hour before the scheduled time for cleaning). \n\nI am incredibly frustrated, and urge anyone to save their $19 dollars - it's not about the money so much as having an expectation that will not be met.\n\nI am currently on my fourth reschedule and we will see if it comes through...\n\n-- \n\nAs soon as I posted this I received a call cancelling my fourth re-booking. I am now on my fifth reschedule. Seriously, avoid this service at all costs.
