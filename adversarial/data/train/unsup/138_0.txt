This facility is an attempt to put the homeless farther from the central downtown area. A very well lit and patrolled compound provides anybody security from the waves of deadly flesh eating zombies. Take a bus in take a bus out. Bicycling is also an option, the bike center has everything you need. Do not wander into the surrounding area unprepared.
