*&$% you Discount Crab. I have been a loyal customer to Sunrise Cab for about 5 years now and they have never let me down. Sometimes I wish they would get there a little more quicker but they will always give you a call when they are on their way and help you out with any bags you might have. I was giving 40-50 bucks to Discount Cab every other week until I learned about Sunrise. So my bill went from 40-50 bucks down to $30 bucks or sometime under. The drivers never give you an attitude if you want them to drive you YOUR way unlike the drivers for Discount. \n\nOne driver I had from Discount cab went the long way one time purposely to make more money because I did not know the directions exactly. Well I made sure that did not happen again and had I directions the next time and did not use them anymore. A lot of drivers I talked to either used to work for Discount or came from a big city. Some of the cars can be old, like 1980's old but they are getting new cars, the fleet they have now used to be police cars. Bud is always great when I call him although he can curt sometimes but that's just his way. He always helped me when I was in some tight spots before. \n\nThey only service Phoenix-mostly the metro area but they will come pick you up if they are driving you out to Chandler or to some other boonie location. Just let them know ahead of time that way you can save some money on your return trip. They will drive you out far from Phoenix because that is worthwhile for them to make the trip.
