Such a great little spot to enjoy ice cream out on their lit up patio. \n\nI wanted to show my mom and brother how Phoenix does ice cream and glad I brought them here. Ended up enjoying our Lemongrass Poppyseed and Fruity Pebbles ice cream out front at 11pm in the warm, Phoenix night.\n\nThe place served up quick ice cream scoops and amused my family with their Chinese take-out boxes and fortune cookie garnish. The ice cream was creamy, had spot on flavors and Melt's patio is lovely. They serve up candies and other kinds of snacks here as well.\n\nStreet parking is easy and there's a couple of great places nearby like Jobot and Songbird Cafe.
