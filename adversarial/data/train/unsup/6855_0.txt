Always wanting to try new and exciting places, we decided to go to Swine & Sow on a Saturday night. I found the hostess to be a bit pretentious but she did take my coat and check it for me, which was nice - (however you could tell she was putting on a show when we were leaving in front of this man who I thought was either the manager or owner, that was thanking us for coming in)\n\nAs she lead us down the restaurant (there was only two other tables\/booths filled at this time) I kept wondering \"how far will they seat us?\" as there was many booths and other tables we were passing by.\n\nWe got sat at a small table in the aisle right across from a booth, which was already occupied. It was uncomfortable- so we asked to be moved to a window booth....that went smoothly with no problems.\n\nAfter looking at the drink menu we ordered some drinks. It was noticeable that our server was very green. She didn't really know anything about what was on tap and couldn't suggest any wines, when I was ready to order my second glass she reached over to remove my existing glass that still had about 1 ounce of wine in it... then asked me if I wanted to \"just chug it back\" haha she was trying though. \n\nWe decided to go with a few shareables: Beef Carpaccio, Farm Salad and Mussels. All came at once. I enjoyed the carpaccio and the farm salad was interesting. I did not really like the mussels, I found them to be a bit bland and kind of fishy (more fishy then usual that is) I also didn't really like the sauce they were in. \n\nThe prices were in the same scale as other downtown restaurants and the interior is nicely done - however I wouldn't come back here again unless I had to, it wasn't special.
