Umm - its ok for pizza. They do have good pricing and great deals. They also deliver which is a plus, since there are a few yummy pizza places near by that do not deliver. \n\nSome of the combos are interesting, but a little too CPK-ish for my liking. I usually end up in the \"build your own\" section. I was not wow-ed by the miracle crust either. \n\nAll in all, if I am really too lazy to drive to the better place down the street, then this delivery is \"a-ok\".
