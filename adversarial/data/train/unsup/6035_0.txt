English food should never be labeled as boring and the Cornish Pasty Company will prove it. They offer all of the pasties your heart may desire. But what is a pasty? No, I am not referring to the coverings worn on women's chests. They are baked pastries that usually have a savory meat filling and its semi-circle shaped. \n\nI have been to this delightful spot on 4 different occasions, so it is about time that I write a review. Yum yum yum, It's my go to main street place and my favorite place to bring people who are not a fan of spicy hot food. I am unable to choose my favorite pasty because I simply have not tried enough, but I definitely suggest getting a pasty with beef. The Guinness Stew and the Beef Pot Roast pasty are the two stand out ones.\n\nI have tried a few appetizers, but I cannot say this is a place that I would go for appetizers. So far they have been unimpressive. The meatballs were a bit bland but had good sauce, the liver pate tasted exactly like what I imagine wet cat food to taste like, and the curry fries were okay. \n\nBut do not fret; you can fill up plenty with the different pasties, awesome beer selection, and the most incredible desert. One of my yelp friends suggested we try the Sticky Toffee pudding and I am so glad we tried it. It's like a caramelized bread pudding that was moist but crunchy and filled with a perfect not too sweet flavor. We had it with a side of ice-cream, but they had a few different choices of sides that go with it.\n\nCome here for pool, conversations, sitting in church pews, good pasties, and beer. I will be back again and again.
