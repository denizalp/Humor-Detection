I'm always skeptical about vegan or vegetarian food , not because I don't like fruits and veggies but just because it's tough to get that wow factor. BUT I tried juicy lotus and I have to say I was impressed ! I've tried their smoothies , and they're fresh and flavourful and definitely give you that boost of vitamins :) two of my favourite items are their samosas and their roasted eggplant salad , both packed with flavour and fresh ingredients. The staff is always friendly and while I wouldn't call this a sit down place , it is very clean inside and there is some seating , although most people seem to take their food to go. They have a variety of salads and desserts as well as pre packaged items you can pick up. They are a tad pricey depending on what you buy but to be fair the ingredients are fresh and the food is tasty and they let you sample the salads before buying so you can see if you like it , which I think is nice.
