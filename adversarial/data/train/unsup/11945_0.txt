On Ontario near St-Denis.  This place , name on a Tintin Album, is one nice place!\nScotch, Single Malt, Whisky. \nCheap Seagram to 50 yr old scotch. passing on the average and the excellent They got ONE impressive list of Whisky\/Scotch\/Whiskey\/ \nLot of Pub also has one of those but hey, they have the best and the cheapest!\na quick example: 1.25 once of Lagavulin 16 yr old is 9$ there and 20$ in another pub I won't quote. \nThey always have a scotch degustation or specials that are pretty neat and not expensive.\n\nWait you don't drink scotch? You're more into classic drinks or Cider or beer? They also have a home-brewed beer which is actually pretty good.\n\nThe place is confy (couches in the corners). The service is friendly and good. They will make a tab for you if you don't want to get for Credit card or interact card all the time. The music is pretty decent even thought it's a jukebox.\n\nNB: If you had too much drink, careful with the step! I almost squashed a group of young Beautiful Women
