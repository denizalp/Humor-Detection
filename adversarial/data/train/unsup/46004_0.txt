The on tap beers leave something to be desired but the service and ambiance makes up for it. Skip the beer and have a nice cocktail instead. Although the bottles have the pour control things on them, the price is low enough that you can just have another drink.\n\nThere's a pool table. There are fat, low to the ground couches. There are seats at the bar, and regular tables. There are regulars and newbies and everyone is left to their own devices. \n\nStaff are attentive without being obtrusive. Great place to kill some time for a while if you're waiting for someone.
