You get what you pay for. You have to call them to come pick you up. They tell you to take a shuttle to the pick up point, then call them again to come get you.  i called them again, 15 minutes later to find out how long it will take and they said he just left and will be there shortly. What does that mean? 15 to 20 minutes more. \n\nNow I'm committed, can't go back, just have to wait. 1 hour and 3 calls have passed :(
