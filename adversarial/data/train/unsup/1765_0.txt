After another company fell thru I turned to Yelp for assistance. I typed in \"knee scooter\" and up popped Scottsdale Medical Equipment.\n\nOne very quick phone call later, Yolanda (the owner) agreed to stay open to wait for me. No credit card, no authorization, nada. Just the tacit agreement my friend and I would be there as soon as humanly possible given rush hour traffic.\n\nVroom, vroom ...\nI have a knee scooter! \n\nYes, in other words, old lady wheels.\n\nAlright, alright. The \"Roscoe Knee Walker\" isn't just for the old. The infirm (ahem - someone with a foot or ankle issue) would be wise to scoop this mobility device. I wanted wheels to increase my speed and distance over crutches.  Knee scooters are great option over wheel chairs as you can steer and propel yourself with very little effort.\n\nYolanda had adjusted the scooter to estimate my height. Once I arrived and tested my new wheels out Yolanda further refined the height.\n\nYes, down. \n(I'm very petite!)\n\nYolanda gave me a demo of how to collapse the knee scooter. Lickity split I handed over my credit card and signed for a month rental. I was very happy with the ease of the transaction.\n\nThey also provide a robust product line of home health care products. Many of the items I had purchased online were available here. (ex: a shower chair)  \n\nDefinite recommend for this business!
