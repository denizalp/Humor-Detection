Healthy meets great taste!\n\nOne of the most tasty stands in the food court at South Park Mall. \n\nAt Crunch they make eating healthy a much more pleasant experience.  Though their food is healthy they don't cut corners when it comes to taste. They are also the only place in the food court that sells alcohol. :) Yall know I love me a good drink! \n\nI can't wait to see what they have in store for this week's Yelp event at the Filmore (Rock City). \n\nP.S.\n\nThe Mo' Chicken wrap is amazing.
