Cute, chic and fun!\n\nThe selection is ecclectic and high end, yet still very reasonably priced.  This place has everything a retro babe needs: vintage Escada and Diane Von Furstenburg, fur wraps and coats, gowns from historic department stores, Jackie Kennedy suits,  all manner of sparkly gewgaws.   My favorite thing had to be the collection of vintage lipstick tubes and perfume bottles.\n\nThere is also a well edited selection of funky furniture, art, framed celebrity pics and household goods.\n\nThe utterly fabulous owner, Cynthia will help you make vintage relevant to your wardrobe.
