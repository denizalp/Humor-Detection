Stopped in here before the Steelers game last night. Overall, nothing special, nothing terrible. The floor was unusually sticky everywhere. They had a nice patio area, and the whole place is very wide open. Next time I go to Pittsburgh I'll take my chances elsewhere. Again, nothing was terrible, but there wasn't anything special about the place, or anything that gives you a reason to want to comeback.
