Met my mom for here during lunch time, which is the only time they have the buffet. Evenings are dine-in or carry-out, no delivery service as of yet.\n\nWe were greeted and invited to take a seat anywhere we like. The offerings are limited to one hot station, one cold station, and a ice cream chest of different flavors of ice cream.\n\nThe hot station contained your standard offerings, fried rice, lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, general Tso's chicken, chicken and broccoli, egg drop soup, hot and sour sour, fried garlic green beans, and more. The portions in the treys are small, however the chef from the kitchen was continuously refilling the goods - keeping everything fresh, we all know there's nothing worst than crispy morsels of fried rice!\n\nThe hot station contained some desserts as well, fried sesame balls and sugar donuts!\n\nThe cold station had seasonal fruit offerings, as well as canned, pre-made desserts, and tapioca pudding, which I had two helpings of.\n\nI really like the offerings of all the different tubs of ice cream, there was cookies and cream, vanilla, chocolate, rocky road, butter pecan, and two others. It's self-serve too!\n\nThere is probably a saying, if you've been to one Chinese buffet, you've been to them all. But I really like the cleanness of Moonstar and of course, the choice of ice cream flavors!
