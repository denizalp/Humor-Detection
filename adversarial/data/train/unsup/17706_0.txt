What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it fro-yo? I've been afflicted by not one, but two of those three...\n\nAnd, for the purposes of this review and not ripping off Mr. West any further, I will talk about this dairy rapture, that ensnares my last dollar every single time, that is Juju Berri. I'm ecstatic with the bang I get with my buck here. I just plop that 16 or 32 oz cup on that scale, and don't even wince at the price that comes up anymore. Money is no object when it comes to satisfying my needs...fro-yo needs that is.\n\nBut whats not a good look, and an automatic star deduction for me, is the fact that they def need to keep certain flavors in stock more than others. I haven't seen Raspberry in over 5 months (happy to see it back) but for how long I ask? Only time will tell. Also, today, the cashier offered me a plastic bag to carry my mom's and I's fro-yos and I was like, you don't have any paper bags back there? Of course I was given that look like, oh G-d one of these people, but I said it anyways, \"Get green with the bags, ditch the plastic, just fyi...\" and thanks but no thanks on the plastic baggie, and dealt with holding two containers the best I could walking out to my car.\n\nAs you've heard me say, time and time again, I'm from Northern Ca. And the fro-yo craze here in AZ is nothing new to me. But I will say this, this lil' shop is about as close as you can get to the places that I grew up getting fro-yo from. And it's not just a summer time treat, I will get this in the dead of winter, and eat it outside! Now that's dedication...or an addiction...\n\nMan, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could but, you make me smile with my heart...ooh~!
