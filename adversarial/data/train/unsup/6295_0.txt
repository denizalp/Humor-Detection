Raise your hand if you've ever booked a 6am flight out of Vegas on a Sunday morning and found yourself sleeping in some random corner at 4am waiting for the check-in stations to open??\n\n*slowly raises hand*\n\nYeah, I know you've done it. I've done it. No trip to Vegas is complete without the shameful airport waiting game. Let's just hope that the guy you took advantage of his $1000 bottle service doesn't end up in the same terminal as you.\n\nOverall, McCarran suffers from the same thing the city does. The new competes with the old. Some sections of the airport is horrendously outdated and needing desperate updating. The newer parts are ultra flashy and mimics the new Vegas.\n\nThere never seems to be enough chairs so you'll find passed out people sprawled out all over the floor. Good luck finding a power outlet.\nFood choices are horrendous and you'll find yourself buying that extra $15 tequila shot just to get make it through the day.\nRideshare pickup is confusing-follow directions on the app, but it is located in the parking garage across the bridge.\nOh and I almost forgot about security. It can take AGES and drug dogs are basically the norm.\n\nSomehow, McCarran makes it work though and I still am able to get in and out of this goddamn city with not too much hassle.\n\nPlus, since I'm a sucker for Vegas, I've probably been to this airport more often than Oakland or San Jose. I'll see ya soon McCarran.
