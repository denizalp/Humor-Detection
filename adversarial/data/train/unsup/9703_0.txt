I sometimes go see an art therapist who has an office here, so my review is pretty much based on that. I like coming here, it's close to Vendome metro on a leafy street and I like the friendly staff in the little cafe inside, I like chatting with the nurses and doctors who all have such sweet, tough tired smiles as they laugh about the wonky elevator and help the old folks find where they are trying to go. \n\nThe building definitely needs work, yeesh, it is crumbling hard, but you can tell that every corner of it is crammed with services that are making a difference in the lives of the local community. I'm super thankful for it.
