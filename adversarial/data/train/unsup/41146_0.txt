Large bakery, with tons of space + wifi.\nThe cakes and pastries are tasty, and as noted in other reviews are pretty inexpensive. The service isn't the best, but if you want to be left alone and are here to work, it isn't a problem. They serve you at your table. They also have a meagre selection of beers and wine.
