It was worth the hunt to track this damn place down! No signage of any kind at this hotel. You just have to know where it's at. At $5 per slice, you get a huge slice that inevitably needs to be folded. This place is very to the point. Pick your slice and pick your toppings if necessary. It's $0.50 per topping. \n\nThey typically have the cheese, pepperoni and white pizza (with different types of white cheese). I'd recommend the white pizza and have them sprinkle some of that mushroom on there! Freaking delicious and worth every penny. Walking in here took me back to NY. You order at the counter and wait for them to reheat it and then enjoy. Make no mistake, the pizza is reheated in their massive pizza oven. Not just some sad microwave. \n\nThere are no tables in this joint. If you intend to eat there then you'll be eating at the counter that's outlined the entire place. They have a couple vintage arcade games in there to keep you entertained. You can watch whatever sports they have on TV. Otherwise, take the pizza and enjoy a nice game of pool just outside in the seating area of the hotel.\n\nI make it a point to get a slice every time I've come to Vegas. Totally worth the trip!
