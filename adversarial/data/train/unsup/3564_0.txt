Dirty.\n\nSo dirty.\n\nHair in the french fries dirty.\n\nCook sitting on the counter dirty.  \n\nUndercoooked hamburger meat, and the server's fingers in my food dirty.\n\nFlies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty.\n\nSomehow these guys think that if you wear gloves you are spared from all contamination.  As if scratching your ass with your gloves on will keep the ass germs from getting in your food.  \n\nI've been there before, and have tried to look past all these things, when eating such delicious food, but really, it's not worth it anymore.
