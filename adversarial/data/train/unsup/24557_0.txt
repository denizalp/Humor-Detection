I recommend going some place else!! There are so many other places to eat that also have decent customer service. (Le Thai just around the corner has great food and amazing service!!) After waiting outside for the restaurant to open, which you could clearly see people (staff) inside by the door and which I had tried to open earlier, no one came to ask if I was waiting or to even acknowledge restaurant was open. I was first in restaurant (with no line at all). The hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar and with no other patrons in there I asked to sit at a table. The manager (man) said they do not seat party's of one. First, no one is at the restaurant and second,  I have seen in past reviews people said sometime multiple parties would have to be seated at a table. I guess I should have known the experience was not going well when there was no line unlike other places close to this one.  The manager did say as I was walking out the door if I was going to leave they could seat me at a table...no thank you I prefer my food with at least decent customer service!!! I will let my local Vegas friends as well as people visiting to go to another place!\nUpdate: I was contacted by Cory who was very gracious and apologetic. I want to thank him for his quick response. Next time when I am in Vegas I will give the restaurant another try, but sometimes you have only one chance to make a good first impression.
