Standard Burrito Boyz quality (which is good) is brought down a bit by the cooking. Had burritos twoce here and both times the filling was not hot enough (i.e. the steak and shrimp). More time on the flat top or just keeping the filling at a hotter temp prior to filling would improve this place a lot.\n\nGreat location though. Supet close to Scotiabank theatre so very convenient to stop in beforw or after a movie.
