The only complaint I have is that the manager who came to help cut fabric was super rude!! We were buying at least $200 worth of fabric as a group, and the manager was pissed off that she apparently had to help cut fabric.  She also didn't cut to the lengths that were needed and didn't offer remnants at the end of the bolt.  That is not proper customer service and it made our experience not enjoyable.  We will not be coming back to this Joann's.
