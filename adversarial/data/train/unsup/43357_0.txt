I went to Starbucks @ 6:02:26 pm reg 4 drive thru, I ordered a serious Strawberry and plain croissant.  The serious strawberry was the worst!  All I got was iced milk with whip cream with not even 1 drop of strawberry.  I ordered a tall.  I should have turned around and took it back it was that bad.  I paid 4.25 for iced milk, could've done that at home.  Won't be back there again.  I agree with the other critical yelps, this is in a bad place with no room to park.  This is the first bad yelp I have written in a while.
