Really the only place left to shop east of Spadina on Queen for clothes and interesting shoes.  They take risks in their buying and showcase new talent and have an eye for quality that is diminishing at that price point.   Maybe I just like the place 'cause the sales staff don't annoy the crap out of me like the effin' over excitable girls at Aritzia (ladies, no matter how loudly you exclaim it, no article of clothing is that cute and if it is, I don't want it) or the intimidated suburban kids that they employ at Get Outside who are aloof 'cause they're too afraid to sell you... or maybe it's just 'cause they know that Converse aren't as cool as their quantity of inventory suggests.  But I digress into bitichiness...I like the stuff at L & S, the staff actually have a sense of style that isn't cut out of a celebrity magazine and they've even mixed in a bit of choice 2nd hand items that shouldn't be overlooked (shoes).   I hope they survive this recession.
