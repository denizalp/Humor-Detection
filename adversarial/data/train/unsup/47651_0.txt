I ordered a petite filet mignon, and my partner ordered Chilean sea bass with spinach, and we shared a side order of asparagus.  The entrees and asparagus were nicely prepared and tasty, but my steak definitely was not tender.  (tasty, yes, tender, no)  Service was excellent and the atmosphere was quiet, pleasant, and classy.  Fleming's is pricier than pricy though and not really worth what you pay for.  Think \"meat on a plate\" with zero accoutrements.  With no appetizers, no alcohol, no desserts, and a single shared side dish, our meal came to just south of $200.
