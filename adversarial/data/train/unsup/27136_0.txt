When we started looking for houses, we had to go through a couple Realtors because none of them were finding us what we wanted. They weren't very attentive and weren't even sending us any listings that looked anything like what we were looking for. Finally I decided to try Aaron and what a difference it made. He immediately found us multiple listings with everything we wanted. He was able to answer all our questions (with us being first time home buyers) no matter what time of day or night we asked. He gets you in to look at houses as soon as you have time to go look. He is able to help you make the best looking deals to get your offer accepted over others. I would definitely recommend him if you're looking for a house and you want a pleasurable experience finding it without being stressed about it. It's his job to stress and do work. It's your job to have fun and find your dream house. We found our perfect house within a couple weeks of switching over to him.
