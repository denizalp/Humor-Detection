It isn't the biggest and it doesn't always the best selection, but Citadelle Plaza Farmers Market is still a great place to shop. It seems like the novelty of when it first opened over the summer has worn off some of the vendors has dropped off. The Plaza itself is beautiful and slowly filling in with some nice businesses. If you're in the area, I'd highly recommend hitting the market. If you're not, there's probably a farmers market near you that'll get the job done.
