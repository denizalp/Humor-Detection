~ I Do Not Care How Sick a Person is...I Will NEVER Recommend Healthcare Partners On Wynn! Worst Place EVER! Send a Bill 10 Months After Being Seen AND Another One for More Then If We Were Cash Patient!....Can You Tell, I Am Really Pissed Off! Not to Mention THIS is My Sons Exam Room After the Previous Patient With Blood On the Floor & Table! How Gross! They Really Need to Be Shut Down! ~
