Oh my good grief.  I was just hurt so good that I wanted to smack my mama.  Ok, in all seriousness, I would have to rank my massage with Bowen in my top three of all time.  Now I'm no connoisseur of massages, but I've had my fair share to quantify a d@mn good one and I think I just got one.  Maybe it was the right timing, maybe it was because I really needed one, and\/or maybe it was because my feet were hurting.  BUT this was so much more than just a foot massage.  When you check in to yelp, you get 1 hour for $34...and that's a one hour face, scalp, neck, back, legs, arms, feet, and ears.  Yes, ears...at first it was kinda' weird having a man's fingers in my ears, but good grief, get over the weirdness and it felt great.  And this was no timid massage - this was a definite deep tissue massage that left me relaxed.  So relaxed, I hit my head on the door on the way out LOL   The lotion they used reminded me of Bath and Body's Plumeria (yes, I'm a smell person) and I would have bathed in it if it wouldn't have seemed awkward.\n\nI have read reviews where there are phone calls and noise and I have to say there was no noise, barely any whispers if at all.  Low relaxing music playing.  I may have started snoring if it weren't for me going ouch, oh wait, no, that feels good keep going (in my head, not out loud).  Bowen's phone did go off once toward the end, but he immediately silenced it.  I can forgive that b\/c who hasn't left their phone on - what I wouldn't have forgiven is if he answered and he definitely did not.  He was very patient, very good, and I'll definitely be going back.
