Popcorn Girl brings up one of the questions that my friends and I have wondered about:  Why do we insist on eating things that taste like other things, instead of eating the real thing?  Coffee flavored beer, dutch apple pie flavored gelato, coconut cream pie popcorn?  Because it makes the original food a little bit more awesome, that's why.  Seriously, get yourself a sample of the coconut cream pie popcorn and tell me that doesn't taste like awesome.\n\nLike many other reviewers, I first made my way down here for the second CMYE.  The popcorn flavors they offer are sure to please anyone in a snacking mood.  Shame on me for waiting so long to review this place, but going off of memory they had flavors such as green candy apple, BBQ wings...and did I mention coconut cream?  Don't let my bad memory and late review give the impression that Popcorn Girl isn't memorable; I personally am not a snacker, so I don't have cookies, chips, popcorn etc. stocked in my pantry.  If I'm hungry and I'm not willing to prepare a meal at home...well then I'm going out to buy something.  \n\nAfter tasting several flavors throughout the CMYE I knew that this place was something special.  Unique flavors of popcorn available for purchase, with the opportunity to taste samples and determine what you really want to buy.  This is what movie theaters should offer.
