The casino was very clean so I have no complaints about that. Also the temperature was comfortable. So that was good. \n\nI won $100 pretty fast that was cool, but I gave it all back after that lol. \n\nThe reason I give it 3 stars is because..\n\n1)  It was almost impossible to sit at a slot machine that was less than $.25 that is annoying\n2) Black Jack at the table was OK. They had $5 black jack table open on a Saturday so that was good BUT I sat there through 4 dealers and none of them were funny or nice.\n3) I only saw 1 cocktail server the entire time I was on the casino floor.\n\nI wish there were more machines and the staff was more friendly.
