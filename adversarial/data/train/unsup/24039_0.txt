So i came to this place when it first opened and it was ok. Cheap beer made my trip worth it. My first experience with the food there was horrible. Waitress kept saying she was checking on the prime rib. finally did 30 min later and brought it out cold. My buddy ordered the patty melt and he straight looked at me and said \"how in the hell do you mess this up\". After 30 more min. Hells Angels walked in and that was our que to leave...\n\nWe tried it again last night after vowing i would never return. Bartender was fast, and courteous, Karaoke was fun. But after being there for a hour, it got hot as hell because 3 out of the 7 fans in the bar were broken, then people around me were talking about how they couldn't believe the owner... They were Saying his wife had just left and how he was taking a female singer to a band he booked to his office to bang her out. This was coming from their \"friends\" and a couple employees..... This was pretty inappropriate for a owner to be doing in his establishment for everyone to know. Owner found out i knew and had a chat with me and bought me a beer. talking about how long he had been married and all... To be honest with you all. It was straight drama filled. complete ridiculousness... I will never step foot in that bar again. Stay away from this place if you wanna have a good time....... I'd rather watch paint dry.... with a beer in my hand of course.
