I tend to be at Mesa Riverview a few times during the week, it's a shopping center with plenty to choose from. From sporting to movies, from eating to getting your hair cut, there is something here for everyone.\n\nMy goto shops, Bed Bath & Beyond, T-Mobile, Sally's Beauty, Marshalls, Chick fil A (don't judge) Taco Bell (son's favorite place) IHop with the grandkids, Rubios, and more.\n\nMesa Riverview has it all! I like that I don't have to go through an entire mall just to get the store I want, parking is always easy, I'm in an out before you know it!
