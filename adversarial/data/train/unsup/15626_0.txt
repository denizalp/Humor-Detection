Hummmmm.. where should I begin!\n\nOh how about that they sold my room. Now I'm stuck in building 25.  Lets do the math.  I only booked it because its across the street from the Hard Rock and I wanted to walk to my room. Now I am 'walking'  a quarter mile..\n\nSo im in a s-it hole of a room. Not remolded. I feel like im visiting someones 90 year old aunt. \n\nIt gets better. Hair in the sink and a used towel. \n\nMy husband went to the vending machine..ya I just said vending machine.   Oh but wait... it wouldn't take his money. When he finally got it to work 5 dollars later he was rewarded with a already opened half drank Dr. Pepper.\n\nLook, I couldn't make this up if I tried. \n\nAnd its directly under the flight path of McCarron airoort.  Planes flying every 30 seconds.. I timed it.\n\nHANDS DOWN, THE WORST PLACE EVER!!!!!!!\n\nThey wont let me give it no stars.. or a -star....
