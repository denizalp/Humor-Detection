Game night with some friends and we were hungry for some pizza and chicken. Lo and behold, my friend happens to have a menu in her menu drawer that is from a place that has both pizza AND chicken in its name....sold!\n\nRight on the front of their menu, they claim that they are famous for their \"broasted\" chicken and their buffalo chicken pizza, so naturally we all decided we wanted to try that. My friend who picked up the goods said that the chicken smelled so delicious that he seriously considered just pulling off to the side of the road and eating it all himself, but luckily, our food made it back to our game night unharmed.\n\nSo I don't exactly know what \"broasting\" is, but I'd like to eat all of my food in broasted form from now on. The chicken was AMAZING. Super juicy, crispy, well-seasoned...everything a good piece of chicken should be. I can definitely see why Franks is famous for their chicken. Now the buffalo chicken pizza? Meh. I mean, it wasn't bad. But I think expectations were high given that they claim that this is their signature pie. The crust was pretty good...nice and chewy. But the pie itself seemed kinda dry. Maybe not enough buffalo sauce? The cheese wasn't particularly gooey, and the chicken strips on the pizza were also a bit dry. Like I said, it wasn't bad, but no one thought it was really all that good either. The homemade ranch sauce that it comes was with quite tasty though. Overall, the consensus among my friends was that the pizza was a 3 and the chicken was an overwhelming 5, yielding a solid 4 overall for Frank.
