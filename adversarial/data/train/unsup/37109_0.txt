On my first visit here, I met my friend on a friday at 4pm. We were the only people until about 20 mins. We were seated upstairs in a long booth which fits 6 people. I love booths, so I was pleased with our seating. There was no explanation about how the all you can eat sushi conveyor belt menu works. You turn on a red light with a switch attached to the wall in order to call your server. Once our waiter came to our table, he was surprised we were not given instructions. I had the geisha cocktail with lychees, it was flavorful. We opted to order straight from the complete menu since we were pressed for time. The food arrived in good time. Overall, I like the look of the space, great location, food and drinks were good. Suggestion would be to explain the sushi belt as clients are seated.
