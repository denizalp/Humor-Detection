The crew that opened SOHO now has this place: sushi, in burritos, with mexican influences. I dig it! Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.\n\nWalk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken\/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.\n\nThe ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is.\nThe MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit.\nThe REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated.\nTARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again. \n\nService is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. They're still in their soft-opening phase and busy as hell. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling. \n\nNOTE: The prices posted on the walk-up menu are a buck or two less than on their takeout menu. Is it foolish to be crossing my fingers that they don't go up?
