Stopped by today to pickup a free license plate holder from Schumacher.  Turns out the information I got over the phone was wrong, they didn't have any in stock was backordered.  Drove 20 mins in the heat to get nothing. But after being told by service they had nothing. Brad in Parts and Accessories made it right! He will ship it to me in CA when he gets them in. Great customer service!
