If you haven't had any treats from Baked Chemistry how are you even living your best life? Months ago we saw that they would be at Danzeisen Dairy and I just had to check them out. So glad I did because now every time I get the chance I have to pick up some of their amazing cinnamon rolls and chocolate chip cookies...More like HUGE chocolate chunks. From the second I met them it was easy to fall in love with the entire company. So friendly and felt like I was talking with friends I've known for years. What I love is if you miss them at the dairy or can't get to them when you want they do sell take and bake dough at the dairy.  So you can stock up. You can order take and bake cinnamon rolls as well. Out of everything though the snickerdoodles are my all time fave! Do yourself a favor and try them yourself.
