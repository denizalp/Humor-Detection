Tapas-style review for Tapas-style restaurant.  \n\nNervously waiting for Lolli to show up, hostess' spider-sense alerts her.  Glass of clear, pristine water arrives.  All should be well.\n\nOrder the Korean BBQ dish at some point.  The music returns - Dvorak's Op. 81(a).\n\nMussels are magical.  Just enough ocean to whisk you away sea-side.  \n\nSteamed buns are space-bound.  That's just fun to say.  I'm listening to Eminem.\n\nDesserts as sweet as Lolli.  I liked everything about the cheesecake and the apple spice ... pie, I think it was.  \n\nDrink orders - perfect.  Timing on second drink - impeccable.  \n\nGreat dining experience due to good food or good company?  In this case, the chicken or the egg?\n\nAll is well.\n\ndmo out.
