Food:  ok but too salty\nEnvironment : clean and open kitchen\nService: servers are nice but we have to constantly ask for things.  We have 6 people and was given 3 napkins and 4 spoons.  \nAlthough we have 6 and service was just ok, we were charged 18% gratuity.  Not happy about this. \nConclusion:  so many pho restaurants nearby. I definitely won't come back.
