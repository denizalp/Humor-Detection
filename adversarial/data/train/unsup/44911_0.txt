Josefa is a very gifted, intuitive and straight forward coach.  She really hears you and works with you to help you help yourself.  You can feel how genuinely she loves her work and she is so comfortable and fun to be around.  The Akashic Records reading I received from her was really quite validating and chock full of information. She records the session for you which is so helpful because there is so much, I had to listen to it multiple times.  I was kind of in awe at how much resonated with me and I would say that the greatest thing I got out of it was a greater sense of self love and  self acceptance.  Can't really explain, you'll just  have to try one for yourself! P.S Did I say she is awesome?  Yes, she is !
