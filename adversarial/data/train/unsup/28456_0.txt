These guys are sneaky. My bill totalled 28.85 but my HST was 5.17. I look at it and think to myself... Wait, this doesn't look like 13%... It's actually 18%.. So they added 5% on my bill but under the HST... as far as I know this is illegal.\n\nService was slow. I had to stand up and ask for the menus after 10 min wait. Waitress was courteous and apologized. Portions were a lot smaller than the price suggested, especially for the shrimp tempura. My girlfriend and I left the place almost hungry (and my girlfriend eats little). Quality was unimpressive. Not horrible, but nothing remarkable. We had udon soup and fried udon noodles.\n\nI went there the other day for lunch and left satisfied. They actually have decent lunch deals.\n\nBut because of the lack of honesty with the bill, lazy service and small portions, I have no option other than suggest you stay away from this place.
