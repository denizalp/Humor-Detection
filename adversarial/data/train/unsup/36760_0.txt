I purchased the least expensive wash which included some basic wipe down & vacuuming inside car.  I then waited as 3 cars were ushered ahead of mine that arrived after I did.  This, after the attendant was extremely dismissive to me when I specified the lowest price wash.  Just because I needed a quick cleaning before transporting family doesn't make me a lower class customer.
