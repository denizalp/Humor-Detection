Let me start by saying I wish I could give it zero stars. Owners\/managers are racist, racist, racist!!  It is blatantly obvious that their \"dress code\" in the lounge is not dependent on what you're wearing but what color your skin is. If you are African American take your money and patronage elsewhere and save yourself the frustration and harassment. \nWe have been here dozens of times over the years and have spent thousands of dollars but we're done!!  Their practice is unacceptable. Shame on them!
