This location is definitely not one of the nicer, new and sparkly gyms in the city.  It's actually a bit drab, with low ceilings on the lower floor.  However, I found that the people who do frequent this location to be generally genuinely nice and down to earth.  Whereas there are some gyms whose clientele make a location seem more like a glorified club or pick up joint, the clientele and staff at this GoodLife actually makes it seem  more like a community of unpretentious people.  So, I would have to say that I would definitely come here again.\n\nIt's not a crowded gym and there is a lot of equipment to go around.  There is a small women's only area which is a bit stuffy with poor circulation, but passable.  The upstairs weight room is definitely well equipped.  The change room is spacious and clean.\n\nBonus - really enjoyed the 2 massage chairs located in the middle of the bottom floor.  A great place to reward yourself after an intense workout!
