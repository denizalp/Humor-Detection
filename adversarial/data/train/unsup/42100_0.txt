Went out for a girl's night and was dying to try this place! The menu didn't have as much selection as I had hoped for but the drinks were tasty but weak. My friend and I ordered the Italian Fondue dippers and she ordered the  Mac 'N Cheese Burger. We were surprised at how quickly all the food came out and once I began eating I realized why. Everything was \"room temperature\" the cheese in the fondue wasn't even hot. For the price tag and Guy Fieri name and reputation I expected more. Will not be returning.
