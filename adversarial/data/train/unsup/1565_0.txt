I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out. \n\nOnce inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!  \n\n$10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.  \n\nIt was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!  \n\nWill I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!
