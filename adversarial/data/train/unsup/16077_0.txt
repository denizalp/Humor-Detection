I am shock! \n\nToday I bought \"Monica - Lapis Surabaya's\" cake. The code is 751160. I sliced it at home and I found the moldy inside. You can't tell without you slice it. I ate 3 slices before I knew about the moldy, I hope I am OK..Lol.. \n\nPoor me! I should checked the expired date before I bought it (I should not forget again next time...LOL). It turned out that there's no expired date printed on the box. \n\nStill, I would like to go back to this place for fresh vegetables, meats, and anything else (as long there's expired date print on it...Lol).
