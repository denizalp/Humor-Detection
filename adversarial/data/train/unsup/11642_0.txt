#JinJuChocoholic is their Hashtag and also what I consider myself when I enter this divine chocolate shop. It is like a Chocoholic Frolic when I come in! Located on Rainbow and Warm Springs and open into the night, this is a great place not only to frolic like a chocoholic but to have a bite of dessert and coffee!\n\nI honestly have stopped purchasing grocery store chocolate because in my book, if I am going to fill myself with candy then I am going to do it right! JinJu is the perfect place to do it right! Their housemade chocolates, caramels, truffles, chocolate bars, etc are spectacular! This place is close to my house so I have no problem coming here on a Truffle Tuesday ($1 Truffles) or dessert with friends on any other day.\n\nIf you want something more than just chocolates, may I suggest having a slice of cake? My favorite is the PB&J Cake. Talk about taking my childhood up a notch! The chocolate croissant is also pretty sinful as it filled with their housemade chocolate ganache. They also serve quality coffee drinks for take away or to sip in store with your JinJu treat!\n\nThis is such a great little chocolate shop because it offers so much more than just delicious chocolate! Yummies!
