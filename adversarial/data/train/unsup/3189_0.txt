United Blood Services\n\nI didn't even know that this location even existed if it wasn't for Terri R's recommendation that we go here.  We were both on our way to the West Charleston location to donate some blood. She pulled up her handy dandy Yelp app and found that there was location closer to us.  Yaass!  Free cookies and pretzels here I come!!\n\nDonating whole blood is easy and only takes about 30 minutes.  It's recommended that you make an appointment, but walk-in's are welcome too.  Regardless if you're on file or not, you will still have to answer the questionnaire. These questions include your travel history, drug history, and even sex history.  Overall, I'm a fan of this location and will be back sooner than later.  \n\nTIP #1:  Staff is great and can hold a convo\nTIP #2:  Plan to spend at least an hour here if you donate platelets or plasma.  They are in need of this stuff.  They're daily goal is 11 donations and they rarely hit it. \nTIP #3:  Address is correct on Yelp.  Building is tucked in the corner. \nTIP #4:  Free Wi-Fi.  \nTIP #5:  You get your own personal iPad to watch movies if you're here to donate platelets or plasma.\nTIP #6:  Free cookies and salty snacks is the prize at the end of your donation.
