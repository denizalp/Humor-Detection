****************** REVIEW 328 ******************\n\n4.5 stars!\n\n           Beside the Bellagio, The Four Season, Wynn is our second favorite place to stay. Got a great deal for my parents anniversary, I couldn't pass up the STEAL offer, but come here for the Thanksgiving week with with parents & my broski family.\n\n           A few minor here and there but overall, the food here is amazing (don't go for the buffet), the service was on point, club Tryst & Encore are great, as if you know someone or have a table RSVP.\n\n          Even for the regular suite of 600 SFT, spacious, clean, strip view, and lots of amenity! The pool & jacuzzi are open even though it was 40 degree outside.\n\n         Expect $20 resort charge on top of your rate, even though we didn't use the service: work out, local phone calls, & Internet (extremely slow)!\n\n         1 more thing, not enough Pai-Gow & Blackjack tables in the late evening, & they don't have non-smoking tables as Bellagio!  & the 195 seats race & sport book, nice, but can't compare to the fever feeling at the Bellagio! I'm just saying!
