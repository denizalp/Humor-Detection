The French toast on my sandwich for lunch was absolutely delicious! However, I cannot say I am a fan of the monte cristo. French toast to me needs to be seperate from eggs. I love me some good french toast. I figured Id give it a shot. Just not my thing all together. I ate everything separate from one another.  My boyfriend loved his pastrami sandwich he said.  I cannot wait to go and try breakfast!
