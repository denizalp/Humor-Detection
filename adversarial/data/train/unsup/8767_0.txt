I know this doesn't matter because you're always busy and my review won't mean much, but my family and I had the worst experience we've ever had in a restaurant today. We are all servers and understand that closing means closing. However, we came in 30 minutes before close and were meeting family who was already sitting down. The employees tried to tell us that we could only order Togo and gave us a bad vibe when we went to sit with our family. We sat down and immediately were rushed. 'We close at 2:30 so you have to hurry' is what our server told us.  We ordered our drinks and not even 90 seconds later she was trying to take our order. She seemed very put off, which is crazy because we had full intentions of leaving her a good tip for serving us so close to close. For food that only took 3 minutes to get out to us, we didn't understand why she was rushing us so much. I didn't even get the opportunity to look over the menu to order my food. So I watched every else eat. She checked on us one time and continued to rush us without even bringing us the check. As it neared 2:30 she started sweeping under our table while we were still sitting there, then contributed to try to make conversation to assure herself a tip. She asked how old my daughter was and when her birthday was. When I told her that she was born on New Year's Eve she then looked at me and said 'wow, that's a nice tax exemption'. SHE CALLED MY DAUGHTER A TAX EXEMPTION. I was completely in shock that she would call my daughter something so awful and demeaning. When I said something to the lady at the register all I got was a half assed apology. It's upsetting that my moms old stomping grounds have been ruined for us by an experience this awful. It's safe to say that we will not be returning until the staff gets a lesson on how to treat their guests.
