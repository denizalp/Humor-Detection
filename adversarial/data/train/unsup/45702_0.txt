I will not be using Gaston Glass again. I initially left my 2015 Silverado there for tint. This went as scheduled so I disregarded the other bad review I had seen. I brought rims and tires there the next week and left it with the assumption that it would be done at 5 when I returned. At noon it was still sitting in the parking lot untouched. At 5, they told me that it needed lugnuts that would have to be ordered and my truck had stay there overnight. Obviously this cost me more money than discussed. Why wouldn't they know they needed lugnuts? The next day I found out late that it needed a leveling kit and the tires had to come back off...2 days without a truck, a bunch of wasted time, money and excuses. I gave them one last chance ordering the leveling kit, making an appointment and dropping it off at 8am. They said it would take 2 hours. I came back at 5 and my truck was not there. I finally figured out it was at Burns Chevrolet and I went to get it. It was not done! They could not align it and Gaston employees were making more excuses of why it was not done after another 8 hours. They told me to bring it back AGAIN on Monday. They expected me to drive the entire weekend with my trucks tire light on and no alignment, causing wear and tear on my brand new truck and tires. On Monday, I heard another round of excuses and had to take it myself to get aligned. There is no reasonable explanation for all the mistakes, wasted time, and money. NO ONE there would take any responsibility for what was going on. They were extremely unorganized, and I will be taking my future business elsewhere and would suggest you do the same.\nJerome T.
