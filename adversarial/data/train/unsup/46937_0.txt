I'm giving it an A-Ok.  \n\nThere was a couple of curry sauces, very spicy - which I know for a lot of people is a great thing. \n\nThere was a potato patty with veggies in it which was good.  The tamarind sauce was good, as well.\n\nI came here with Taste of the World and the owners and staff were very welcoming and friendly and gave us a lot of food to try & I can't remember it all.\n\nIt wasn't to my tastes, but the people I was with were definitely enjoying it and I recommend people try it for themselves.
