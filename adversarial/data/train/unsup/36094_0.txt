We have been going to this establishment for at least 15-years.  NEVER had a bad meal.  We especially like their fish and chips with a side of zucchini to start.  It's important to get there before the lunch crowd or you'll probably be waiting for a while, but it's worth it.  The service is great, and with little ones at the table, they are very gracious.
