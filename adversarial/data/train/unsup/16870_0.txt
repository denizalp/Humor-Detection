Best Chain Coffee Hands Down!! When I moved here from the East Coast and I saw they had not just one, but multiple Dunkin' Donuts, I almost started crying! No, not really, but I was really friggin happy. It was like a beacon, or like a gift from above. They're pretty much non-existent on the West Coast. Their iced coffee is incredible, it's always smooth and delicious. Unlike another coffee shop chain that tastes like an ashtray... Not naming any names, guys...Gross. Their butternut donut Is phenomenal. My little one loves the homer donut (Pink Icing w\/ Sprinkles) They have this veggie egg white wrap that is awesome and the Boston Cream is another favorite.My only issue is: THEY NEED TO OPEN ONE NEAR MY HOUSE!!Please!! It's a far drive, and I need more of you in my life!!
