I came here for a party and drag show of course. The drag show had a 10$ cover the day I came which included a drink (basic beers mostly). The seating situation was a bit uncomfortable...we had a couple tables reserved, but people continuously tried to sit at our table regardless. The show was decent, though it had a bit of a hard push for tips (i understand tipping is customary but that seemed to be the focus of the entire show). Overall, it was a fun experience, but I wouldn't necessarily come here on a regular basis.
