As many of other people here, I thought that this place would be great. I went for shellac manicure, the lady who took care of me was not polite, not even a word, cut my finger with the scissors. My nails were all different shapes. \nThe quality of the products and the property of the place are amazing compared to other places. But I guess that now that hey have a lot of people coming and are known they do no intend to be nice with the customer and pay attention to details.
