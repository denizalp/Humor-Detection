I have come here several times now with various friends. Whenever I have brought a friend here, they ended up loving it! It's a little hard to find because you don't really see it when youre driving along rainbow. So if you see Pot Tea Social House, you've gone too far!! \n\nWhenever I come here, I always get the same thing. I don't really like change obviously. I get the mango thing that has everyting mango in it haha They have shaved ice that is really soft similar to that of Mount Charleston when it gets its first snow of the year - very fluffy and nice. They also add a scoop of mango ice cream that is really delicious - I can't tell if they make it themselves or if they bought it because it tastes like mango heaven. Then they also put mango slices on top of it all!! The mangoes I have gotten so far have never been sour or hard yet, theyre also perfectly ripe and yummy yummy in my tummy!!! \n\nFor a drink, I once again do not deviate from my usual black tea with boba. They actualy tea so it might be bitter for some! The only thing is the boba balls can sometimes be gross, otherwise I would give this place 5 stars!!\n\noh, and they hella play k pop - makes me feel like im drinking in a bar in Korea in gangnam lmao
