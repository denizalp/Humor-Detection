This definitely isn't the best Hobby Lobby location. Inside is a hot mess. The store is overwhelming with piles of merchandise cluttered everywhere. I came across broken Christmas ornaments on several isles. Im sure stuff breaks from time to time but this was in more than one spot and trying to locate a employee to clean up just wasn't happening because the manager, Teylor I spoke with said they were too short staffed to clean it up at the monent. Huh? What will you tell the parent whos kid gets cut on broken Christmas ornements I asked her? She just rolled her eyes and said the store manager left her shorthanded and would get someone to clean it up when she could. \n\nWhen it came time to check out they only had 2 lines open and about 10 customers per line waiting. When it was my turn the cashier says \"gee you must feel like you waited forever just to get this one item\" like I needed to hear that! Gee yes thanks for the reminder that you don't have enough staff to properly run the store.  I went to the location on Rainbow and had a much better experience at that Hobby Lobby. Pass on this one.
