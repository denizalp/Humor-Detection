This is a great Mediterranean restaurant! The service was superb the wait staff was very professional and fast. The lighting in ambience makes for a great dinner any night of the week or even a great lunch. I didn't realize they had a brunch until later in the week but when I'm back in Vegas I definitely will be trying it. I saw sign that said this place was \"Top 100 Hotspot Restaurant in America\"- I would completely agree with this statement. I had the Bone Marrow and it came out and looked even better than the previous photos I had seen and it tasted fantastic. This was my first time trying an item like this and I was extremely glad that I had it here first. It was tender and juicy with the balsamic reduction sauce. A slight bit of fat but that's expected with this type of item. It was perfectly balanced. I also had the pork belly, again a 1st but won't be a last. It again was tender and juicy and the small side picked vegetables was a perfect complement. So now you ask if it was so great why doesn't get five stars well truth be told you go to Vegas for really good food but on the cheap I found the Cleo was slightly pricey. For these two items to be on the appetizer menu they should've been well under $10 instead they're priced during happy hour mind you like the cost of a full meal. For those who will disagree and say it's not a fast food joint so expect to pay more. Wrong answer! I found these items for 1\/3 the cost at other high end places. The Old Fashion was made to perfection!
