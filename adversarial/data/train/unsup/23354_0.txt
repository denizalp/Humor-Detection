Literally located right off the 215 and Durango exit, this place sits among other businesses like a 7-11, a dog grooming place, and other restaurants.\n\nNow for the reason why I came here. Any place that is that has the words Philly Steak in it should be a surefire place to get a good Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich right? Eh, not this place.\n\nI got the Philly Steak Combo ($8.99). Comes with fries and a drink. The sandwich has thinly sliced grilled steak, mushrooms, onions, and cheese. I asked for extra onions and they said ok. When I got my sandwich there were hardly any onions. I was gonna go up and show them but I was already on a time constraint. The sandwich itself is about 6 inches long. The fries were steak fries, you know, the thick kind. They put some kind of seasoning on it which I thought should of been more for that gave the fries way more flavor than the sandwich itself.\n\nService was average. You order, pay, and then pick up your food when called. Everything else you get yourself like napkins, ketchup, etc.\n\nOverall, I was not too impressed. The size and not too much flavor plus the \"extra onions\" that I didnt get really did not wow me here. If I come here next time I think I will get the Burger Combo which is a half pound beef patty which is only $6.99 according to their menu. Hopefully, that will have more flavor than their cheese steak.\n\nYelp 2015 Review #42\n541 overall
