This place has ruined me\n\nEver since coming here, every other sushi restaurant tastes like crap\n\nI freakin' love this place.  Their salmon is sooooo amazing.  \nAnd make sure to ask for the fresh \"real\" wasabi.  It is AWESOME\n\nYeah, I'd eat here everyday if I could.  But then I'd be soooo poor.
