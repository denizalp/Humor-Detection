This place is pretty cool! What you would expect out of a NYPD Pizza place. It was decorated in a modern NY style, with a huge kitchen in the back. We decided to split the Brooklyn Family pizza and had a few drinks while we waited. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to prepare, it was nice that our server let us know that upfront so we were prepared. Our server (I wish I could remember his name) was very nice, sweet and funny. When you come to smaller restaurants like this that aren't so busy, its nice to have staff that visit a little with you. He gave my friend a few different samples of the beers they had and they discussed different beer options while I sat back and enjoyed by drink. He saw a picture of my son on my phone and asked me about him and then told me a little about his family. I thought it was very kind of him to have a little conversation with us while we waited on our lunch.\n\nWhen the pizza came out it was delicious! It was thin crust with a thicker edge, filled with cheese, pepperoni, sausage and basil! We ate every last slice! That was at least 3-4 slices each! Perfect size for 2 hungry adults.\n\nEnjoyed the atmosphere, the staff and the food! We were able to walk out with a huge pizza and a few drinks for under $30! Perfect! Keep it up NYPD
