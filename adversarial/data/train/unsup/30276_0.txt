This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is great and the prices are decent. The only thing i really hate is the long wait times. The hostess always say 20-25 minutes and like last week we were there for 1 hour and 15 minutes until we said enough is enough seat us now. Even when you do call ahead seating you still wait 30-45 minutes. I love the place so I suffer.
