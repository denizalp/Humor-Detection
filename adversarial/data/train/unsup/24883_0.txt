Perhaps the least-loved link in the growing chain of Sporting Life stores, Bikes and Boards (BnB) is the earliest extension of the store's brand. \n\nLocated a few blocks south of the iconic Yonge and Lytton megastore, BnB started as a place for Sporting Life's growing hardwoods inventory. Bikes, boards and the like take a lot of space, and attract a different kind of weekend warrior from straight-laced skiers, or Biff and Bunny on the tennis courts. \n\nThe vibe here is consequently a little more relaxed, although the service is still great. Passionate gearheads greet and help newbies and experienced riders alike navigate the world of bikes and boards. \n\nOnce upon a time, they assembled a bike I bought to impress a girl. They tricked said bike out with appropriate safety gear, and conducted a safety check. They helped adjust the seat and handlebars, and sent me on my way. \n\nSadly, I had never actually ridden a bike before. I walked it back home. Broke up with the girl shortly thereafter, and sold the bike to the father of the next girl that I dated.  \n\nThe service I received at BnB was the best part of the whole experience.
