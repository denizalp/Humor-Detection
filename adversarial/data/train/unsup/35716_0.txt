As the show began and the curtains were cutting across the stage, I was becoming so mad because I could see hardly anything from my seats. Then suddenly the curtains go flying back, people come flying down from the rafters, and the music is so much more exciting! The show was incredible. I am a huge Beatles fan and loved every moment of this show. The auditorium is the perfect size and our seats even had speakers in them.I would go back in a heartbeat!
