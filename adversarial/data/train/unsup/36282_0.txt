The staff did an excellent job making my two year old's first dental appointment comfortable and a success! Jamie the hygienist was so caring and did a great job from beginning to end with my son! Dr. Whelan was phenomenal in his patient attention and explaining and listening to concerns and questions! I picked this office out of a group of covered providers and I am so glad I made the right choice!
