I loved it! The food was grreat, the servers very attentive but never 'in your face'. We were stuffed and happy when we left today. It's not too pricey and what can I say, was able to carry on a great conversation with my Son AND enjoy great food! Had a lovely afternoon there and would not hesitate to highly recommend it to others!
