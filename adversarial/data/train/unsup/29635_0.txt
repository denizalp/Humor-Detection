I had the pleasure of working with Steve Jones with the home selling process. \nPeople listen to me,\nSteve Jones is the most professional, outstanding, and amazing real estate agent anyone can  have the pleasure of working with. \nSteve is very friendly and knowledgeable, but I am sure everyone says that about people that they are happy with. \nWith Steve you get more that a real estate agent. You get reliability and wisdom.\n\nHe sold my house in 3 days. For OVER list price. \n3 days. \nI had my home appraised before I started the process. It was priced perfectly. all because of Steve. \n\nHe always answers the phone, and really I am not sure if he sleeps because he would answer my emails or texts at all hours. \nHe is amazing. \n5 stars from everyone he works with isn't a coincidence. \nJust before closing I had some issues that needed to be addressed.\nI had since moved out of state.  \nSteve was kind enough to put on his work boots, rolled up his sleeves and handled a major issue that would've hindered the sale. \n\n\nCall Steve Jones.
