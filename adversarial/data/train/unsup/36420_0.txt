Great location. Plenty of parking and plenty of carts. Their dollar days are my prime time. \nEverything is organized and I usually see it clean. The shoe section I think could use some improvement, most of them are kinda worn out. \nNice purse section.\nTons of clothes to look at and all well organized. Lots of housewares. Some furniture \nStaff has always been amazing.
