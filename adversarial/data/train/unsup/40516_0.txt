Food was Great! Service is great. It's very clean and I noticed management was on top of thier game!.. I've been to other village inns and I think I found my new location! Eggs tasted Great! Prices are good.. can't ask for more. Great job village inn you have earned a new former IHOP customer. Our server Amanda was Great! Ask for her if you want great service!
