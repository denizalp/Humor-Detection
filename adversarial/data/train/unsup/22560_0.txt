Traditional italian style barber that's a regular spot for old and young folk in the North York district. Father and two son run establishment, one of the best fades you can get in the north. Very reasonably priced and excellent conversations. \nJust time your visit appropriately - this place is popular and they take their time with making sure your hair is not just a sit and flip job.
