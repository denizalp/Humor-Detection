doan's is the best vietnamese in charlotte, plain and simple.  admittedly, I haven't found many vietnamese spots I don't like but...   you must try the:\n\ngrilled meat summer rolls, they are worth coming for alone.  \n\npho is flavorful and fresh and nine dollars, seriously.  \n\nSingapore noodles and pad thai are flavorful and light.\n\njust go.  I'll be there too so come by and say hi.
