This place is freaky, scary and fun! Went here with a group of people and from the get go, I was scared. The outside looked like the movie (check out the pic). I don't want to ruin it, but all I can say is that I was surprised...a lot. Even when signing the waiver or using the bathroom before we started, I thought something was going to happen lol. This location is the official location as they received permission by Lionsgate. Don't be tricked by imitators. Tip: Go as a prepaid group so you don't get mixed with people you don't know. I felt that it was more enjoyable trying to solve each room with people that I really knew. The gift shop is amazing too! Got some exclusive Funko Pop merch.
