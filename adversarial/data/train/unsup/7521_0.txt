We're new residents of Old Town Scottsdale and have been enjoying exploring the many outstanding restaurants in the area. We were looking forward to Franco's, having tried to get a reservation there several days ago and being told they were booked up for the next four nights. I gave up at the time, but my wife called later and made a reservation for a weeknight the following week. While earlier than we preferred for dinner, she was persuaded to make a reservation for 5:30 p.m. because the later times were booked.\n\nBy the time we finished dinner that evening, we said, \"That's a one-time-only place.\" Here are our reasons: (1) We arrived at 5:30 to a nearly empty restaurant, and when we left around 7:00 p.m. it was barely over half full with several empty tables. We felt misled about how busy they are; and (2) The food was so-so at best, but the check for the two of us that included one glass each of Sangiovese, two salads, a pasta dish with no meat, and a below-average sea bass dish came to just under $100 without tip! Ouch! \n\nThe only positive note was the fine service. The hostess was pleasant, our waiter was attentive, and a number of other staff members were alert and responsive to us. The person who refilled our water glasses was so attentive that he refilled them almost without fail by the time we had consumed about 1\/2 inch of water. We saw his friendly, smiling face many times during the meal. \n\nFranco's seemed a bit like a tired and dated place. While well established, it seemed to lack authenticity, charm, and good Italian food. Our overall recommendation is, \"Don't bother.\"
