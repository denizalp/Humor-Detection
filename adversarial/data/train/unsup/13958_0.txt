This massive Walmart has nice wide, clean aisles...\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sPb0wqy6GbOo0VjqtoNwjg?select=9mYekFW7ComLqE_Rn8N0fw\nI've been here a couple of times to pick up some knick-knacks for the house.  I like how I can stop in one place and get virtually everything I need.\n\nThere's always plenty of parking and this particular location doesn't get too crowded, perfect!\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
