Went to the Claim Jumper yesterday to check out their happy hour.  I've dined there before and the food is decent. ***This review is for their happy hour only*** Sat down and waited about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged, menus finally arrive, drink orders are placed (I get a glass of wine, my dining partner gets a coke) we wait another 15 minutes to get our drinks and we still haven't ordered.  At this point I'm getting the hungry cranky pains and the irritability is setting in...Drink the wine, calm down...\n\nFinally the waitress comes back to take our order (bringing another coke and he hasn't even finished half of the first).. We order the shrimp taquitos and crab cakes. After another grueling 15 minutes our order arrives (with another coke). The taquitos are a shrimp (tail intact) wrapped in a corn chip and fried, they serve the 4 with some slimy sweet sauce and a poor excuse for dressed up tartar sauce. The crab cake (not cakes) comes out and it was pretty delicious, but at $10.95 it better have been. Here's the skinny on the crab cakes $12.95 for 2, the happy hour \"special\" takes 2 dollars off any app on the menu, knocking it down to $10.95 - what they don't tell you is they take away the other crab cake! Cheeky rip off!\n\nStill being hungry we order the nachos, I'll post a picture later just to show how gross they were. The guacamole was brown, I think they added it prior to baking. The nachos which consisted of cheese and black beans. They were so soggy, I don't think they drained the beans before piling them on. Also the menu boasted of an array of different salsas, there were 2 jars, they were both the same salsa.\n\nBill came (with another coke) - $30 bucks, I went home and made a sandwich.
