This place was fantastic.  Small, quaint, and very clean.  The staff was very polite and made every effort to make sure I had a very relaxing experience. \n\nI was in town with some friends enjoying a break from the wisconsin winter.  After a long day of travel the day before and adjusting to the time zone, a massage just sounded good.  Easy to get to from the strip or Fremont.  It was about a half hour walk from Fremont or an $9 cab ride.
