Too bad I cannot give negative stars because that is how I would rate Chas Roberts. My wife and I purchased our house brand new in 2008 from Toll Bros and Chas Roberts was the A\/C company that did all the work in Aviano. Every summer for five years we have been dealing with issues on our upstairs unit. Every year it is some new problem. We have paid a lot of money out of pocket and the problem never gets resolved. Last year we had the coils replaced, but again yesterday the unit froze. The tech who came yesterday told me to take the filters out and run it w\/out them. He put some freon in it and left. He never looked in the attic. So of course today it is still not cooling properly. I call Chas Roberts and get some manager (Evie) with a ton of attitude who does not care that this issue is going on six years, that their tech yesterday did a crap job, or the fact that I have two kids under two years old and their rooms are 90+ degrees. I had to go to the effort of looking up their CEO's, Roberta Shank, phone number. After leaving her a voicemail on her cell and a message at her in-laws house and telling her employees that I will speak with in the very near future (that is a promise), they are finally sending another tech today. \nSeveral (too many to count) neighbors have had their coals, A\/C units, etc replaced for free due to these type of issues.  Toll Bros and Chas Roberts screwed up big time. For me personally, if they don't resolve this correctly once and for all it will be time to organize with my neighbors for a class action lawsuit. My children's health is at stake and enough is enough already.
