Are you looking for the ultimate cornbread?  Order the cornbread skillet (last time I ate it was $4 for a 5\" or 6\") and you'll search no more!  I began my ventures here on the recommendation of a coworker after I mentioned eating complimentary cornbread from Z'Tejas and the $2 basket at Redfish Grill and Bar.  I first started having one huge slice (you can substitute a slice for a side that comes with their entrees).  I then graduated to just ordering the skillet and having two slices.  On my next visit I had half of the pan (the server even commented how the meal I was having that night wasn't very nutritious).  I seriously believe that my corn allergy was aggravated with my obsession of Bandera's cornbread skillet :(\n\nI was able to try two entrees on separate occasions before I went stir-crazy on the cornbread.  Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, so do try some.  The salmon is also very good.  For sides, the spinach and glazed carrots are nice.  The enchilada my aunt tried was also quite tasty!  To help keep your wallet padded, have lunches here instead of dinner.  The vibe here is usually subdued, with great-looking staff and clientele occupying space, but it can get quite noisy on busy nights.  In the summer, try to sit at a booth with the window cracked open.  So refreshing, and quite relaxing- almost like having dinner at one of your chalets.
