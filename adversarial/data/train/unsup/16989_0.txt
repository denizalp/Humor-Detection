I did it backwards.  I went to XS for the first time this past summer & again during my last trip out Halloween weekend.  Been wanting to go to Tryst since my 21st before XS existed & when it was the hottest club in Vegas.  Finally, the Saturday night of Halloween weekend I went.  \n\nAfter going to XS first, you won't be as impressed with Tryst, as it is the older but smaller stepsister to big, beautiful and younger XS.  But it's not disappointing.  The music was pretty good and it wasn't all house!  The decor and the outdoor area with the much talked about waterfall is still nice.  However like many mentioned, the dance floor is small.  And I don't know why but it smelled all up and over in the club!  \n\nNot my first pick, but hey, it's still better than Lavo!
