Although the service was charming and ambiance lovely - the food was disappointing. The roasted olive appetizer and wine selection was good. Our three entrees and two salads were not good. Pizza was cooked to a frisbee-hard disk; fra diavolo\npasta was mushy and shrimp fishy; chicken pasta was a hard balls of stuck- together noodles and rubber bird meat. If we had time to spare we would have sent all three entrees plus the two salads back to the kitchen. So many choices in downtown Phx - skip this one!
