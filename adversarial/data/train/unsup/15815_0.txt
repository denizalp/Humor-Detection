The bright city lights of Vegas do not appeal to me in any way so my kayak trip down the Colorado River was one of the highlights of my desert trip!\n\nI was a bit hesitant to book since:\n+ I was five months pregnant\n+ I was booking with a friend who has never kayaked before\n+ Temperatures were soaring at 106 degrees\n\nBut everything turned out to be a - ok! The kayaking trip was definitely physical but did not take a toll on my body at all. The guides were knowledgeable and fun and the kayak was well maintained which allowed my friend to get the hang of paddling pretty quickly as well. As for the heat? The water is about 56 degrees so even with the scorching desert sun bearing upon you it never got too hot. \n\nThe Colorado River is super clean and various shades of deep blue and emerald, a stark contrast to all of the rocky terrain. It was so striking that I could visualize it in my dreams for several days afterwards and the nice lull of the boat stayed with me as well.\n\nThey pick you up at the hotel and the pricing was also fantastic compared to other tour groups. I highly recommend!
