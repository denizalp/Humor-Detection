Breath of fresh air to get away from The Strip and hangout with the locals. There is life outside the Vegas Strip. \n\nTheir Calamari was fantastic and it was half off during happy hour. My chicken waffle was a bit of a let down, but it made up for their excellent service. \n\nLove the ambience with rustic modern decor, and the building was made from containers.  Highly recommend coming here.  Had a blast with my colleague who is a local. Great vibe.\n\nCheers!
