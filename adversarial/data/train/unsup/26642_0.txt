I have been wanting to try this place based on yelp reviews. It was the best Thai food that I've had in Vegas (yes, I been to Archie's, Pin Kaow, Lotus of Siam). I'm from Chicago and started my love of Thai food there. It was then cultivated in San Francisco for 10 years when I moved there for work. So, I would like to think that I know good Thai food. I ordered the pad sew ew and the massaman curry both with tofu and at level 6 of spiciness. The husband, David(?), said this would be spicy...is that ok? It was, and they both were delicious. The noodle dish is my \"go-to\" Thai dish and I tried this curry dish over my usual go-to, yellow curry. The reason I picked this one is it had potatoes and peppers (like yellow curry) but, it also had....nuts, cashews I think, and ..... avocados! Yum-I don't think I've ever had avocados in my Thai food before-it worked.\n\nThey have other types of Asian dishes but, when I saw the Thai stuff, had to try it. I would definitely recommend as it was really good and we need to keep these good mom and pop places going in this crap economy.
