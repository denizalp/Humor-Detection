I will never understand the overabundance of \"mom and pop\" pizza shops in Peoria. \n\nIt almost seems like a practical joke.\n\nDozens of \"local\" pizza shops, all with different names and menu layouts, all living on the same street, peddling the same food made with the same ingredients to the same curious customers, who keep shifting from one pizzeria to the next hoping to find something \"different\" before they ultimately settle on whichever one is more atmospherically pleasing to them. \n\nThis is not to say Ballpark Pizza isn't worth a try. \n\nIn fact, of all the copycat pizza parlors in the city, it's one of the better ones.\n\nWhile their pizza isn't worth writing home about, it's pretty low on the grease factor and tastes quite nice when dipped in ranch. It's pretty inexpensive, too. A large with two sodas and some wings shouldn't run you more than 20-25. \n\nThe wings are what Ballpark's known for. They make a certain sauce that is so intensely hot that they have a wall of fame for anyone who can eat half a dozen of them within a certain time limit. One of my friends has his picture posted on the wall. I keep asking them for a \"Hall of Famer\" discount whenever we show up. We never get it.\n\nOh, and the rules stipulate that while consuming the wings, you may drink whatever you think will help stave off the burn. I've seen guys pounding shots of ranch to keep the burn at bay. \n\nJust a sense of what to expect at Ballpark.\n\nIt's sports-themed, but to the extent of other \"sports restaurants\" that blast six or seven TVs all playing different games or whatever the hell ESPN has on. The TVs just loud enough so that you can watch it and carry on a conversation. I was at Ballpark when Michael Vick was first investigated for that whole dogfighting thing. Then, a couple of months later, I was at Pullano's, which is literally down the street, when he gave his public apology.\n\nI need to find something new to eat.\n\nPersonally I prefer Ballpark as a lunch spot. It's fairly uncrowded, even during the lunch rush. The food comes to  you fairly quickly, and the staff are always walking about the dining room looking to hook you up with extra napkins or whatever else you may need.\n\nIt's the little things that make a pizza shop.
