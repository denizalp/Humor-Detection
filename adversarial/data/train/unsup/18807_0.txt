I was not only fortunate to attend a baby shower for my lovely fellow yelper friend, Rachel C., but was granted the opportunity to attend it at DiAnoia's Eatery.  While it was mid-February it was a beautiful spring-like day at the building had a garage door window that was open allowing the warm air to breeze through.  The space is gorgeous, I especially was drawn to the chandeliers, one made from wine glasses and another from beautiful bottles.  \n\nNow, onto the food, because that's what we all really want to know about.  I had a chance to meet the owner and chef and took that opportunity to ask him if he'd consider baking me into one of the meatballs.  I assured him I'd eat my way out.  This request is under consideration, but let me tell you, after one bite you too will start plotting ways to insert yourself into this delicious Italian staple.  My other favorite menu item was the pizza - thin crust with amazing seasoning and the perfect ratio of cheese.  \n\nDessert was great.  I had what I want to call a powdered doughnut hole, but this is such an underwhelming description of the amazing ball of warm dough with the cream center and garnished in powdered sugar. \n\nI will now be bringing everyone I know here.  And the next time someone says, \"Do you know of a good Italian eatery?\" and you don't say, \"Yes, DiAnoia's on Penn in the Strip\" I'm coming to your house and kicking you in the shin.
