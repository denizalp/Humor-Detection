I have been visiting Las Vegas since the 90's and moved here 7 years ago. I had never, ever stepped foot in this place till last week.\n\nIt seems that I wasn't really missing out on all that much. It is quite a large space with fairly cheap and affordable souveniers and trinkets. The problem is that they all are so uber cheap looking. I think I'd be ashamed to give any of this crap out as gifts to most people. I did buy some used card decks from the Sahara and the Las Vegas Hilton since they are now \"defunct\" casinos. They were only 1.50 each! That was actually a good pickup for me. Other wise most of this junk is just your super generic \"Las Vegas\" t-shirts, shot glasses, keychains, etc.\n\nThe employees were fairly nice, although I didn't exactly ask too much of them.\n\nThe one thing that shocked the hell out of me though: As you walk from the store on the left side to the store on the far right side, you pass a porn shop in the middle! Wth??? Seriously?? I did a literal double take. Plus this is in a bad area so you stand a great chance of getting panhandled and such. Always alot of fun there. :P\n\nSo, yeaaaaaa....I won't be back anytime in the forseeable future.\n\n2 stars.
