Do not get the chicken soup and the set menu!  My family dined here New Years Day. Don't know why of all the nice restaurants in Vegas, we picked Max. \nAnyway, we decided on the set menu A and 3 orders of the fresh lumpia. It also comes with soda. There were 9 of us dining. Here my review of the set menu items:\n\nAll items were brought one at a time and slow. We finished each dish before the others came out. \nChicken Soup - The most disgusting, salty, no flavor soup. Seems like they threw canned stuff in a pot and canned broth. Nasty!  How this even passed as part of the menu is beyond reason. Manager! I'm calling you out! Please taste this nasty soup. I would not feed this to my dogs!\n\nFresh Lumpia - Veggies were cold. As in they took it out if the fridge and poured the sauce over it. \nFried lumpiang Shanghai - could not taste the meat\nGarlic Fried Rice - Too mooshy. This is supposed to be dry. Hello Fried Rice!\nBistek -  Taste was ok but they used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce. Beef is low grade with too much cartilage\nBihon Pancit - lacked the veggies and meat. This too was wet noodles. Not supposed to be wet\nChicken - this is the only dish we enjoyed. But we were already full. \nCalamsi Juice - Artificial Taste concentrated nasty!\nBuko Juice - worst than Zico coconut juice coconut meat was nasty\n\n\nOverall\nI would not dine here ever again unless I was dying for some fried chicken.  If I do I'll take it to go. But then my wife can make the same chicken. She just buys the Costco rotisserie chicken cuts it up and fries it. Better than Max. \n\nNever again!\n\nI was not going to give it a star but it would not let me go forward.
