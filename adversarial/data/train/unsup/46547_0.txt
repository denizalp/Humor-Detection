Recently I have given up my normal go-to drink and have switched to Fat Heads Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale, which I found at World Market. This beer turned out to be my new go to and something I search the store for. Upon hearing that there was a Fat Heads restaurant in North Olmsted, I immediately decided to check it out. The service was okay, however the food was awesome, and the beer was better. I ditched the Bumbleberry and went for the Sunshine Daydream, and needless to say I have a new favorite. The walls were lined with detailings of the success that Fat Heads has received, and boy did it live up to that. I can't wait to go back!
