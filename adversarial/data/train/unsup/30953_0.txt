To pile on to all the brisket rave reviews, seriously.  Go get some of their brisket!  All of the meats are delicious but it's my favorite.\n\nAnd while the meat shone on its own and definitely didn't need it, the mustard sauce is very tasty.\n\nLoved the outdoor patio with the picnic tables.  Plenty of parking. Super friendly staff too - it's obvious that they love what they do and love sharing it with everyone.\n\nDefinite repeat customer here :)
