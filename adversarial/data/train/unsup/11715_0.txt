carnivore delight\ngenuine butcher shop with\nflying salamis \n\nAside from the great sandwiches, aside from the owner Sanford's pearls of wisdom, and aside from the salamis that dangle in various corners of the store, this is where I buy my beef, pork,chicken, lamb,and now seafood as well.  \nGreat pricing on USDA Prime  beef, Kurobuta Pork from Amish farms near Sandusky, flavorful chickens that are not factory farmed...  ...You can NOT, EVER, go wrong with Mister Brisket. \n  \nWhole Foods beef?  Meh. \n\"Kobe\" beef?  That's bullshit.\n\nTell you what;  Go there and ask them to cut you a 2+ inch bone-in ribeye.  \nCook it using the Ducasse method linked below. http:\/\/forums.egullet.org\/index.php\/topic\/119838-the-best-way-to-cook-a-thick-steak\/  \nEat it and weep.  Weep the tears of joy. This will blow your mind.\n\nCarry on...
