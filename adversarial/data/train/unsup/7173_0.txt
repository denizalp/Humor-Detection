Came in on a Thursday for their happy hour and half priced wine bottles! Amazing selection of wine and such a steal. I had a merlot and riesling and both were delicious! Happy hour food is $6 which is awesome! I had the arancini (these were awful, bland, no idea what the hell it was and honestly so embarasssinggggggg to have cause these were the WORST arancini's I've EVER had ), caesar salad was really small but delicious, cheese & meat board was delicious but I recommend getting the full size, meatballs were delicious but only 2?, and lastly the carpaccio was perfect.\n\nThe interior was super cute. It reminded me of a boho chic\/ pier 1 aesthetic. The booths were ugly but the flower chairs were an absolute dream! Our service was great. Our server was extremely attentive, and helpful! I wish I got to try the other foods on the menu but nothing was less than $25.... I think this place should be \"$$$\" instead of 2 because theres no way anyone can afford to eat here on the regular.\n\nI will be back for their oyster happy hour and to check out the patio area!
