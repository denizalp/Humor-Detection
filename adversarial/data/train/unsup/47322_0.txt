Nice little place. Good food and atmosphere. Was tempted to give 4 stars but the customer service really came through for us. At first they got our order wrong - gave us a bean and cheese burrito when I asked for a California burrito. They didn't hesitate to switch it out at no extra cost! Will definitely come back again in the future.
