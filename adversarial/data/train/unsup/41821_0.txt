Holy moly!!! If you don't like savory oozing cheese, then don't come here!! Ordered the half order Monte Cristo- something I only treat myself to about once every 15 years. It was beyond perfection and incredibly too big to fit in your mouth (even if you have a big mouth like me!). Raspberry preserves are traditionally served on the side, but they served theirs with sauce- which was just as yummy! Great atmosphere; casual and buzzing. Friendly service. Smiles all around.
