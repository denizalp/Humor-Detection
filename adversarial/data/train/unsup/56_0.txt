Don't go Winter. Please. Pretty please. I mean I know you have to go eventually. To make way for your evil twin. Summer. That bitch. I'm just asking if you can linger until July 4th. Then I'll be ready for three digit temps, scorching sun rays and melting steering wheels. I just want to party with your 70 degree self a wee bit longer. Thanks for listening Winter. You've been good to me so far...
