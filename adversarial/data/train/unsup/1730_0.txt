I can't say enough about how good Simona is.  Went using a Groupon for a microderm abrasion and facial and also added additional service.  Simona has such a great touch and takes the time to explain the process she is using.  I wound up buying a package for five treatments and have been totally satisfied.  Simona is sooo good she actually put me to sleep on my last two visits.  Try her, you'll love her!!
