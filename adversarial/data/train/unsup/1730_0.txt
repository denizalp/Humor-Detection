What a joke... I purchase my home, have no window coverings. We know we want Shutters, beautiful white wood shutters. So I call, make an appointment for an estimate, which runs out like 2 weeks, so I think, ok no window coverings for 2 weeks no problem we will just get through it... I had an appointment scheduled for Saturday, Friday I get a call of them wanting to know what I wanted exactly and what size my windows are so to \"save time\" they can just send me an estimate. Save time, mine or yours... wow. Yeah, thought you were going to come out and show me samples and measure and give me some estimates. Was it because I didnt know what my budget was? I havent put much thought into my max spend because I really dont care and dont need to have a \"budget\"... Regardless we were ready to spend good money on good quality shutters, to which I'm not picking from an \"email\"... what a waste of time waiting for these people.... dont even bother!
