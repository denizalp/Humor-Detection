Gordan Ramsay should consider featuring this restaurant on his show Kitchen Nightmares. At some moments, I thought there must be secret cameras filming my exasperating experience for the sake of entertainment and reality TV. But alas, it was just an unintentionally underwhelming dining experience.\n\nI ordered the beef burger, and it was delicious. Juicy, huge, well seasoned and cooked as I requested, medium. Served with ketchup and garlic aioli on a soft bun, it was decadent, rich and meaty, everything one would need after a night out in Vegas. However delicious, I found it to be extremely plain. No options for toppings or anything could have offered some freshness. Just a meat patty, bun and bacon. I can't say it was worth the over $20 price tag for a burger alone. The accompanying fries were nothing special. The fish and chips were good, but extremely oily. I loved that they were huge, thick chunks of fish, and the batter was crispy and flavorful. But just a little too greasy for my taste.\n\nService is undeniably what put a damper on our experience. Our food took an eternity to come out. The two tables next to us were seated, ate their meals, and even paid their bill all in the time it took for our party of six to receive our food. When we asked for the check, it took an eternity for our credit cards to be processed. Most of our meal was spent anxiously waiting, either for the food, drink refills, and finally, the bill. There was no sense of urgency, and the restaurant was less than half full.  For a restaurant of Gordon Ramsay repute, the service was baffling. I wish he were there to scream at the chef and waitstaff to hurry the f**k up.\n\nLocated in Cesar's Palace, this restaurant doesn't seem to get too crowded so it's a good choice for a decent meal if you want to eat somewhere other than the food court or the lines for more popular establishments are too long.
