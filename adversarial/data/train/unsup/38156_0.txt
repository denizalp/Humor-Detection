----- Combination of Integrity & Knowledge -----\n\nI worked with Mike over a 4 year remote search for a home in LAS. Finally pulled the trigger last month and could not be happier with both the house and the support I got from Mike & Tammi.\n\nReasons to use Mike for your LAS home search:\n\n* Super knowledgeable of LAS RE market. Provides clear and honest assessments.\n* Puts his past experience as a home inspector to use by pointing out both the good and bad of each home that he walks you through. His trained eye pickups things most people would miss. Not shy about pointing out the negatives. Something that is not very common but very helpful.\n* High level of integrity. Talking to Mike is like talking to a friend. Straight forward, honest feedback, and recommendations. No \"sales speak\". No pressure.\n* You get two for the price of one. Mike handled the search and his wife Tammi handled all the administrative aspects of the close process. Everything went smoothly as Tammi is timely and thorough.\n\nA special thanks to Mike & Tammi for a job well done!
