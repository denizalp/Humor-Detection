I have never had In-N-Out, so I would rate a 5 on food and a 1 on location, so I will even it out to a 3. The menu compared to other fast foods is pretty limited, and even their combos are just an easier way to order (as in, there's no discount to ordering a combo vs. ordering parts individually.)\n\nThe place was packed, which is why I am not a huge fan of this location. I'm going to guess that it's hard to find cheap eats on the Strip, so that's why the situation. There was just a huge line to order, a while to wait, a number system that didn't seem to be in any order so you really had to pay attention, and no where to sit. I will give them credit, that they did a pretty good job keeping things moving, all things considered. I just personally don't like being in big crowds and then eating standing up because that's my only option.\n\nThe burger was nice and juicy and lettuce and tomato provided the perfect contrast. The fries were great, described by my boyfriend as \"too salty\" but I say there's no such thing. Is it worth all the hassle of getting the food? Ehh I'm glad I tried it but brace yourself if you come here. I would be more than happy to visit another INO when I am somewhere else on the west coast, provided they are calmer.
