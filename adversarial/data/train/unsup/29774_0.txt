Dick's was some place I wanted to go my first trip to Vegas. It did not work that time, but I made sure it was in the schedule this time and I was not disappointed. \n\nThe food was better than a lot of reviews made me believe. And, even not being a fan of pickles, I enjoyed the fried pickles. The fries were perfectly seasoned and the burger was huge (I couldn't even eat it all).\n\nThe atmosphere was amazing too! I love the picnic feel of that place. Seating by people you do not know and laughing with them just makes for an amazing time. It really makes for the environment. And yes, the wait staff are dicks (at least most of them) but that is the name of the game. It is just a fun time. \n\nThe price wasn't bad. I estimated about $65 dollars for the meal for two and it ended up being about $70 in total (including a tip) which I figure is average for Vegas, especially when you add in the cost of the huge goblet one that is big enough for two.\n\nAll in all, it was an awesome time and I loved it!
