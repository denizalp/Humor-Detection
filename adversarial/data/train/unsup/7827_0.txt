Just met the rudest bartender I've ever met. Melanie should get a lesson in customer service. She's insecure, gives shitty service, and doesn't know how to treat customers who aren't there to flatter her. \nThe cooks even told her to smile and be nice. She flat-out yelled at me when I asked about my bill .\nI haven't been here often; I've only been here two times. Both times, the bartenders were terrible. I don't plan on coming back.
