Mandalay Bay is huge!  Border Grill is on the conference side and for that reason is convenient.  We were here for lunch and sat at the bar outside, depending on what events are taking place it can get packed.  Barbacoa tacos were actually really good and it's a nice serving, I left content with my choice.  The rice and beans were meh, but who we kidding?  It's rice and beans... I wasn't expecting the food to be as good as it was considering the million other taco options they had, but they were actually tasty.\n\nThe Corona was also tasty and even on tap if you prefer Corona Lite.  If you do prefer Corona on tap or Corona Lite, then you're doing it wrong.  That shit has to come out of a bottle as Corona Extra with a lime wedge!  It's actually a rule, look it up...
