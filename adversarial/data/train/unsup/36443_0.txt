Staff is EXTREMELY Polite, Friendly and plenty Helpful!  This is NOT a place where you have a waiter... You Order at the Counter and they bring your Food to your Table, yet the Delivery of your food is Much more than you would expect in a place like this!!!  If I were basing my review on Service or Politeness they would get FIVE Yelp stars, or SIX! !! !!!  Easily!\n\nThe Best Compliment I can give them is that I noticed employees from three of the four Restaurants (they were wearing Uniforms) in the Complex (it is only Restaurants and a convenience store in the complex) were eating here!!!  It was about 2:00 so the other places did not have customers and they want to eat here!!!  One of the neighboring Restaurants had at least two of their employees eating here!\n\nNow the tough part the Food was prepared I believe as well as it can be, they seem to have an Excellence Mentality about Service, Cleanliness and Preparation!  I appreciate that!!!\n\nPizza : : \n\nCrust had decent flavor, was Better than Al's Pizza, still seemed a little overworked, not to say it was chewy, that part was fine...\n\nSauce had an ok flavor, on the bland side, just slightly better\n\nCheese was NOT a Blend!  Yay!!!  If this was a blend, they did it well!  Still only gets 2 1\/2 yelp stars because it lacked the flavor I LOVE in a plain Cheese Pizza!  Maybe a little Too Greasy...\n\nWish They Had Sandwiches, even though I'm not going back they could put their \"Jersey\" Neighbor Out!!!  Maybe they will anyway because their Pizza is Way Better than \"his\" sandwiches!!!
