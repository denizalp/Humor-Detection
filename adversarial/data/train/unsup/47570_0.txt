Very gorgeous restaurant. The hummus and veggies we ordered before our meal was amazing and so was the bread and pesto provided. You can tell how fresh everything is. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and, while it was delicious, the blue cheese was completely overwhelming. There are so many delicious pieces to the salad that I was looking forward to- the peanut granola being one- and I could not taste any of them but the cheese! I will definitely try them out again though, a drink, appetizer and salad for around $30 was not bad. The coffee bar was amazing too. Got a little latte to go!
