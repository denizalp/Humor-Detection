YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(327\/365) \"The Trashy Toy Store\"\n\nLooking for a gift for my niece, we came here after shopping at Cardena's. This location is not in the best area, and inside was a slight mess with toys all over the place, and even on the ground!\n\nWorkers here are almost  impossible to find which took me longer to locate the section I was trying to find, and when I did, the Frozen section was pretty much cleared out. I did come across some cool Minion-inspired games(Monopoly and Operation) but then again, we came here for my niece.\n\nI would probably check out the other locations around town because this location was pretty disappointing.  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  2
