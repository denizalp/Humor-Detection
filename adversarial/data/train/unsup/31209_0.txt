After trying to read trading books and taking some hotel seminars on trading for 5 years I was not getting very far with my trading. I came across OTA and learning how the banks and institutions bought and sold in the markets (supply & demand) cleared things up in terms of timing the markets. The instructors have a wealth of knowledge and experience and are able to deliver that expertise in a way students can understand. The online trading rooms are a critical piece to the learning process and helps to see how other professionals are trading the markets no matter what environment we are in. If you are looking to either make some extra income on the side or if you are looking to protect\/build your retirement accounts for down the road, OTA has strategies and tools that will help you get to that goal but it takes work, having a written trading plan, and using the resources to help build the skills necessary. Thanks OTA for teaching strategies that work no matter what the market is doing and the ability to retake or use the resources for life!
