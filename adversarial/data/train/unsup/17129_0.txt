This is a must see if you're a Canadian. Every time we're in the States, we make it our mission to find a Cheesecake Factory. \n\nThe menu is huge and everything I've ever tried is delicious. The portions are also huge and the price is extremely reasonable. Make sure to take a doggy bag because you MUST save room for dessert! Their cheesecake is heavenly! We had the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and I've never tasted something so delicious in my life. \n\nThe service is also always great here as well and they give you bread before your meal. \n\nWhat more could you want in a restaurant. My only criticism is that they don't have any locations in Canada. I beg you Cheesecake Factory, please come to Canada!
