Oh my bad, I've been back to Vegas like three times since the first review when I promised to give an update. \n\nYes, I've eaten it sober since then. Like 10 times.\n\nUpdate: THIS IS THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I'm so effing serious. And they're only $5-6! This place would put Quiznos AND Subway out of business if they opened some up in California. In my opinion ;)\n\nAll of the sandwiches are great, but I HIGHLY recommend coming here during the holiday season (November-January) and getting the Turkey Holiday Sandwich. Envision this: creamy stuffing, cranberry dressing, yummy turkey, warm bready-saucey-Thanksgiving goodness sandwiched between two slices of heaven. Speaking of slices -- WHAT THE F do they put in that BREAD?! It's so soft and simply...scrumptious.\n\nI've taken numerous people here since the last review, both friends and family. We are all now believers. My friends and I stayed at Aria the last time we were in Vegas and made the trek across the Strip bridge just because we'd been dreaming of it. And believe me, that walk is NOT fun in heels, but the sandwich was worth it. The best part? It's 24 hours! My go-to quick meal spot any hour of the night in Vegas, unless I'm staying somewhere that's too far.
