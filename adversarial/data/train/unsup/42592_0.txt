I have been a fan of his for awhile. When l found out we were coming to Vegas l had to check out his restaurant.  We finally made it to the parking garage, which by the way you access through the Harrah's parking. Once you get in there follow the signs to the Ling casino parking lot. \nIt's not often l will pay $21.00 for a burger, but l splurged and got his famous bacon macaroni and cheese burger. I asked for no bun....cut down on some carbs , and it comes with fries, spicy waffle and regular shoestring fries. Hubby got a bacon cheeseburger. We were both very happy with our meal. Yummy is an understatement.\nAs for drinks, l got the Austin Iced tea with sweet tea vodka and l believe peach schnapps. Who cares it was delish, but pretty strong.  Hubby got Guy's winery red blend. Says it was good but hes really a Shiraz man. \nWe had no room for dessert l needed someone else to share the Cheesecake challenge and from what l saw the dessert selection was awesome.\nFun to go to a place owned by Guy Fieri and critique his food. What would have made it better would have been seeing him in the kitchen.\nAn awesome ending to an amazing weekend.
