Never shop or buy anything from Conns. If you buy anything through their credit it's 3x more then what your buying and they screw you over every way possible. Myself and 30 other people have a lawsuit filed with the attorney General of phoenix Arizona and BBB is investigating their fraudulent practices. Please message me if they have fraudulently screwed you over.
