Make sure to check in here! You get a beer and a taco for $5 when you do! \n\nThe tacos are a bit pricey for street tacos, but you are in Scottsdale. \n\nWe loved each taco we had here and opted for the chef to choose which type of shell\/tortilla we should have with the meat we chose. \n\nIt's a nice little spot with good food and a very friendly staff. We came at the end of happy hour which their menu (mainly the prices) were very appetizing! \n\nWe will be back the next time we're in Scottsdale.
