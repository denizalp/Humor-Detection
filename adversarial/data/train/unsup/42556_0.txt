I've been here more times than I can count and it's so consistently good every single visit. Paco's is ALWAYS packed, so make sure you have a reservation or plan on waiting. Seriously, I've never seen a more consistently busy restaurant. My go-to order is the chicken fajitas. The portion is huge and I can never finish everything despite my best efforts. My fianc√© raves about the tacos here. I recommend two tacos for a normal meal or three if you are very hungry. The tacos are stuffed, unlike some places who skimp on the fillings. A coworker from Texas agrees, this place is the real deal. Paco's Tacos is the best Tex-mex in the QC.
