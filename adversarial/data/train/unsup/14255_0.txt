Casino\/Arena only \nSuperbowl weekend a group of friends (20 guys) were celebrating a bachelor party. The Orleans Arena is where they settled on watching the superbowl.....how they managed to get seats in the suite owners private showing is beyond me, but the open bar and catered food along with the Zamboni rides = priceless! \nThe Orleans just screams old kitchy Vegas. Their casino seems to be asian themed, as almost all the dealers\/cocktailers are asian....which is unusual in Vegas. I mean, being the Orleans I would expect more of a Southern Hospitality, not so much an asian theme....The place needs some better ventilation, because after 5 min inside the casino i reeked of smoke and has having a minor coughing attack. \nThe outside is really cute, small colorful houses that just scream carnival, the staff however is severely lacking in customer service skills. Our friend told us to go to the ice rink, when we asked the security guard where the ice rink was he laughed at us and said nowhere in Vegas has an ice rink.....ok, maybe arena would have been a better way of asking, but really.....he couldn't make the connection from ice rink to arena with and ice rink? \nRegardless, I would NEVER stay here, its way too far off strip, and way too old. Watching the superbowl in the arena was sweet, but that is about it.
