I've been with Cox for 14 years and they continue to get worse and worse.  Hidden charges, deceptive sales practices, poor customer service, bait and switch, it's gotten so bad I can't wait to cut my ties with them. My latest experience with them was logging onto my account to see an offer to upgrade to ultimate internet for $82 a month,  I click on the offer and it shows me savings etc I click to get it and says congratulations an email was sent with your details and is being processed. I get a new modem and call them to set up and he sees the order for ultimate service then says it will be $97 a month!  I said the offer was $82!  Long story short after over an hour on phone with five different people they just say they made a mistake and can give it to me for $94 what a load of crap. If this company advertises something and I click sign up for it they should honor their mistake. But that is not how Cox does business, as soon as any competitor matches their internet speed I'm leaving Cox forever.  Stay away from them this happens frequently with them along with not being able to explain sudden charges and fees.  Loyalty to them just gets you higher prices and new customers get better deals than long time paying customers.
