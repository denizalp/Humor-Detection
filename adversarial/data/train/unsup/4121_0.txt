I came to eat at this restaurant because my friend said it was his favorite Chinese restaurant. He's a big white guy so I usually raise an eyebrow when he tells me how authentic a Chinese restaurant is. But hey, it was his treat so be it. Off we went to the hole in the wall next to Sonny's Saloon. A place where you are pretty sure there will be some brawlin' come night time since it's packed away near the seedy Industrial Road area, among the old machine shops, junkyards, and strip clubs of course.\n\nThe bar is, well it's like a bikers bar pretty much. Where the mustaches are higher and longer than the handlebars (we came at 3pm so I didn't see any bikers if they do come here in reality). However there's a separate entrance leading to the restaurant, so you don't need to run into any dude in chaps (riding a 2 legged horse with neier a bow leg in sight). We ordered his favorite, some sort of fish. Since I went to the Diamond China on Sahara and Valley View, I figured it's probably pretty good. No they don't even cook it the same. The fish is not steamed. It's more like lightly battered and cut into squares. It doesn't even look like a fish. The rest we had old standbys of sweet and sour pork, beef, etc. All in all, I told my friend I'll pick the authentic Chinese in the future, unless he's paying again, then we go wherever. Food is food in the end. Just don't bring your Asian friends here and tell them it's authentic. They may return the favor and take you to McDonalds when McRibs is back for authentic BBQ.
