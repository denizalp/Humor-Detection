This location makes good Sandwiches.  I of course order my regular Sandwich which is a footlong BMT on Cheesy Italian Bread.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mLj1xf3Za6PAoEYsddOOOQ?select=1yN8r6CM5fMLgf_nI8OJ2w\n\nThe Sandwich Artists here pay attention to your order and it generally goes smooth.  Plenty of seating inside, which is always a bonus for me because I enjoy eating at the restaurant.  My experience at this place is always a good one.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
