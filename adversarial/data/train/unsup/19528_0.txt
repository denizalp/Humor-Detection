I go to Aldi once a week.  Specifically, this Aldi location.  Aldi took a few weeks of getting used to--more on the wham-bam checkout process and funky rent-a-shopping-cart system in a bit--but now I'm very much a fan.\n\nMy staple purchases here are produce, especially tomatoes and probably the cheapest bananas you'll find anywhere, sometimes as low as 19 cents per pound (crazy).  I also really like the 93\/7 \"all natural\" ground beef, which is packaged securely in black plastic containers.  The Specially Selected brand inexpensive cheeses are shockingly good; I've tried a number of them and buy the brie round regularly.  I also get my everything bagels and English muffins, coffee creamer for the husband, bagged spinach, and chopped walnuts at Aldi.  But, honestly, the produce is key for me.  I head to Giant Eagle (coupons!) and CVS (ExtraBucks!) for amazing deals for my other groceries and toiletries and household items, but I'm all about Aldi for produce.\n\nBest selection is in the morning, as one would imagine, and I avoid late-afternoon\/early-evening weekday shopping trips at all cost.\n\nThe cashiers are seriously...yeah, I'm gonna say it...TALENTED.  I don't know how they work as quickly and efficiently as they do and manage to be so friendly every time.  Impressive and appreciated.\n\nSo, the shopping carts.  You can rent them for a quarter outside--or not rent them; it's totally up to you--and then get your quarter back when you return the cart at the end of your shopping experience.  It's strange at first and certainly a learning experience.  My husband and I still laugh about how clueless we were during our first Aldi excursion.  In any event and especially if you choose not to do the cart thing, be sure to bring your reusable shopping bags, and oftentimes there are empty boxes purposely scattered around the store for shoppers to use as carrying mechanisms.  To each his own.\n\nCash and debit only.
