This place is only good if you know which dress you want and if you're ready to make a purchase. The service wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  I wouldn't go here if I'm in the beginning phases of looking for a dress.  They sell bridal gowns, bm dresses, party dresses, accessories and etc.  The owner, Joanna uses this sales tactic where she tells you she can alter your dress for a really low price but the \"special\" is only valid for the day (we asked if we can come back and get the same deal and she said no) and to hold this deal you will need to put a deposit of $50. She kept saying that the next time we come in we won't get the same deal and she will charge more.  I didn't really like the fact that i was pressured to make a decision on the spot when i wasn't ready to do so and the approach they took regarding the special alteration prices seemed wrong.
