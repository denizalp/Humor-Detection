Ok,  I dont eat pork or shellfish - so what I could try was limited.  \n\nWe had the beef soup.  Noodles were great - you could tell they were fresh.   \nMeat was in very large chunks - thought it would be a problem, but it was tender.\n\nWe also had vegetable dumplings, and they were also very good.
