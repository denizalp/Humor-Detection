This was my first time staying at Palazzo and we had a good experience.  I would definitely stay here again.  \n\nWe arrived at about 1pm on a Friday.  Check in was not until 3pm but front desk found a room for us and let us have it early.  Beautiful, spacious room.  Ladies, there was a vanity, complete with cute little bench in the bathroom.  Loved that.  Our room directly faced TI and we were able to watch the pirate show clearly.  \n\nIt was just Mr. DJ and I so there was no need for a pool area with all the bells and whistles.  There was no lazy river or wave pool which was just fine with me.  There were 3 big pools.  Heated!  This is important because in April, the hotel towers cast a huge shadow on the pools until about 3pm.  Someone probably didn't think that one through.  Although, I would give them credit for putting the pool just a few steps from the tower elevator because there is nothing worse than having to walk a mile through a casino soaking wet just to get to your room.  I'm looking at you MGM.  \n\nLocation was super convenient.  Close to the freeway.  Walgreens right next door.  Mall across the street.  We all can't afford to throw down $100 every meal so having the mall food court near by was awesome.  Venetian has it's own fast food court but I feel like the mall food court was closer if you're staying at Palazzo.  Plus there are more options of course at the mall.\n\nI also loved that there were a lot of penny slots.  Yes I am a high roller.  I did win $200 just on penny slots over a course of 3 days so take that.
