This is the second time I've been here. Equally as good as the last. The other reviews pretty much cover all the good stuff. Plus, good looking ladies get a discount after 11 or so.\n\nAll you can eat prices are fantastic as you can stuff your face with as much fish as you want. They don't care. \n\nSurprisingly, what they do care about is you stuffing your face with the plum wine oranges they give you at the end of the meal. They restrict you to two. I guess the sushi is whatever to them, but those oranges are precious. They must be filled with gold or glazed with the blood of a thousand virgins.
