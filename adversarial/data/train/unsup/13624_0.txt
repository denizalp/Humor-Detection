service was horrible. walked in and smelled even though they were in the middle of cleaning up. drink came out wrong and server didn't even offer to fix it. ordered nachos - they were drowned with a pico that was nothing but onion and some tomato -- what i cud see of the carne asada on it was old and dried up. server new of my unhappiness and again offered nothing else. not even a sorry .
