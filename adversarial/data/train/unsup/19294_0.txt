I've seen a few Cirque shows in Vegas, and so far, Zumanity left me the least fulfilled. Odd, too, since it the \"sensual\" Cirque.\n\nThere are definitely some amazing acts. There are only two or three high-in-the-sky acrobatic acts, and they were definitely mind blowing. But most of the choreography, while well developed, were not as stunning. Some scenes just seemed to be about getting naked. (Ok, that's fine. But did I have to pay for that?)\n\nThe story line is also a little odd. There's the snarky, silly part and then the more sensual, sexy parts. The hostess for the show, Eddie, is meant to tie the stories together, but I felt like I was watching two separate shows. As is occasionally true in all Cirque shows, there were some racist undertones, which is frustrating and uncomfortable.\n\nAs others have mentioned, if you don't want to be picked on, don't sit in the front row. I'd add to that, though: don't sit in the first 3 rows, and in the bottom section, don't sit on the aisles. The actors and actresses definitely extended their reach beyond the first row; they even came up to the second tier of seats once to bring someone down who was sitting in an aisle.\n\nYou will get your money's worth, but there are better Cirque shows if you're going for the visuals and awe factor.
