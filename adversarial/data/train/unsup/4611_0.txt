So far, this is the nicest dog park I have been to, after trying most of the parks in the metro PHX area. I hear Cosmo dog park is like doggie Disneyland, but I haven't made it out to Gilbert to check.\n\nChaparral Dog Park is a very nice facility, and it is very well cared for. A tip of the hat to the park staff, who work very hard, and take pride in doing a great job taking care of man's best friends favorite spot. I think that for dogs, this place is the canine version of a coffee shop, where they can hang with their peers, and burn off steam.\n\nThere are three dog areas at this park, with one always closed for maintenance. There is an area for 'active' (AKA Big) dogs and one for inactive (that's not what they call it, I just can't remember- sorry) dogs.\n\nThe grass is very green, and in great shape. There are lots of things for dogs to do, regardless of if they like to run like maniacs, or just chill and (literally) stop and smell the flowers. For the two-legged customers, there are a few benches, and even shade structures where you can relax.\n\nThe grounds are kept very, very nice, and it is rare to see doggie pooh, and what is on the ground is the fault of lazy dog parents- it isn't a reflection of the park or care.\n\nOne word of caution, keep an eye out for the occasional aggressive dog. Mostly the patrons here do a good job of self-policing, but at times there are dogs that should NOT be in a dog park environment, and should be at home, plotting to take over the world. With that, sometimes people micromanage their dogs, and stop them from doing doggie behavior. On a recent visit, I saw three clueless pet parents mistakingly stopping their dogs from playing and bumping into each other. To the initiated, the dogs were clearly just playing, with tons of give and take, play bows, etc. Much like kids, sometimes you need to just let them work it out amongst themselves.
