I have no complaints about the buffet. It was $18 for adults, $12 for kids under 12, and my 2 year old was free. We came around 1015 (they were closing down breakfast at 1030, but they were adding lunch items to the menu which was a good look since now we had more a variety during their rotation (Im not much of a breakfast food person anyway). I did have a bagel w\/Fresh Lox (which was yummy, and their cheese grits were not bad either). For Lunch menu items, I had their sushi, and their mac n Cheese was to die for (Have you ever EATEN or SEEN mac n cheese at a buffet?? It normally looks hideous). Their prime rib was moist, but steer clear from their taco bar  because although the guac was DELICIOUS their meat looked like \"mystery meat\" . fresh Veggies, sushi, etc... \n\nThe only downfall was that It took a while for a waitstaff to clear our plates from the table. If you are in a large party, be prepared to wait a lot longer (and pay a little more) than parties of 4 or less.
