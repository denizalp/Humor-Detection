Do not order the Veggie Works poutine.\n\nBe cautious about ordering the large sized poutine.   It comes in a palm size bowl with only a few deep fried potato droppings.  You'd be better off ordering a small order of fries and smothering it in all the free condiments to save yourself nearly half the cost.  A large poutine perfected \"Veggie Works\" NYF poutine carries the same amount of fries as a the hand-cut NYF regular fries.\n\nIt needs to be labeled on the menu under mexican fries .   They should address the costumer that they have no veggie gravy and instead will throw a quick squirt of processed cheese over your frites and plaster it with a white thick mayonnaisey substance and then top it up with diced tomatoes and green onions.  This was not very New Yorky and was ultimately a disappointment. \n\nI was really enjoying my walk-in-the-rain with my new wife until we made the wrong decision and stopped in to try the new spot.  I would rather prefer the trek to Queen and Dovercourt in soggy trousers for the vegan\/gluten-free gravy at Poutini's. My craving has not been satisfied so I will be going there tomorrow to fill my tummy and reclaim my smile.
