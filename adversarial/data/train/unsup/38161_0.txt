I really enjoyed my experience at this school. I had some really great Attorneys and Judges teaching me the bar subjects (Judge Jones, Judge Willrich, Professor Spence, Professor Lopez-Jones, Professor Trujillo, Professor Gonzales, Professor House, Judge Campagnolo, Professor Lindstrom, and many more). This school provided a great opportunity for me since I was working. I love that they had a night program, even though I did eventually move from part-time to full-time.\n\nAnother reason I really liked this school is because the library is very up to date and they have a lot of modern technology, as well as mass amounts of study aids and books with regard to every subject. I loved all the staff in the office and can honestly say I never had any problems. I also really loved my experience in their clinic. It was nice to be able to interact with actual clients and get some real hands on experience in many different areas of law. Susan Daicoff, the head of the program, really cares about her clinic students and does a lot of different clinics, which includes, a clinic within the homeless community that gives students a chance to be involved in numerous areas of the law under a supervising attorney. \n\nOverall, I really liked this law school and would definitely recommend it to any one considering going to this school. I loved the smaller classes and feel that it allowed me to make better personal connections with my professors. I also feel that this school provided me with all of the tools to be successful when it comes to the bar.
