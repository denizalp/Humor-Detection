It's all about the marinara sauce here! It's delicious and well flavored. Started off with the 2 giant meatballs no cheese, hot wings (not that hot but good flavor), bruschetta which had fresh tomatoes and garlic with toasted bread (big portion). My favorite was the garlic roasted chicken lasagna it was worth the calories ( flavor was on point and the lasagna pasta was el dente) we then ordered what we hoped would top our Chicago pizza experience we had, unfortunately it was more cheese than pizza. We ordered the STUFFED PiZZA half PUERTO PEÃ‘ASCO CARNE STREET PIE and half THE OL' MEXIGANO.. had good flavor but way too much cheese, next time we will up the protein and go light on the cheese now we know how they roll. What added the cherry to this review was their staff, super friendly and they have all been there for over a couple of years which tells you about their company culture! Ya for employers who know how to treat their employees. We also tried the dessert pizza which was way over the top but if you combine with ice cream and coffee then it's do able dessert, we only wished they had Italian espresso which would be a fantastic way to end an indulgent meal.
