Review of restaurant only.\n\nAfter seeing the show with my girlfriends, I thought this would be an awesome place to take my boyfriend for his birthday. I couldn't have been more wrong. When we arrived we were seated in the far back corner, closest to the kitchen. Our waiter took our order and the nightmare began.  20 minutes later our carrots arrived and then nothing, not even his drink.  As we watched the table next to us receive plate after plate and drink after drink.  It took another 20 minutes at least to get another dish. The bus boy was nice enough to check on us, as it seems the waiter had forgotten about us. We finally got our steak which was warm and had been plated a while before it was given to us. I made a comment to the assistant manager before leaving and was offered a drink. I laughed and said I'm obviously pregnant to which he responded well come back when you can drink and I'll get you one?? Horrible service,  poor management and mediocre food.  There's no excuse, as there are way too many restaurants in Vegas to choose from. We won't be back and I can understand why most everyone I know has never eaten here.
