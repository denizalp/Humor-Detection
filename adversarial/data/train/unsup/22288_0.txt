A solid 3.5 stars ... definitely better than the average Toronto coffee place.\n\nAlong St. Clair, Krave coffee is a nice place to grab a cup of coffee.  It has a cute little patio and able clean space inside where you can find a table quite easily.  The spot is really well maintained and you don't feel any pretentious service here.  The service is friendly and quite affordable.  \n\nWe arrived on a Saturday afternoon and dying for a good hit of caffeine, Krave coffee looked like the best option.  When we walked in, we were immediately greeted with a smile and I noticed they had Sam James and Sloane tea right behind the barista... that's a very good sign.  \n\nWe quickly ordered a dirty chai latte and a simple drip black coffee.  Quick note... they only take cash or debit!!  Both drinks easily came up to $7 and wasn't so bad compared to downtown core Toronto.  The place had a lot of clean tables and if we werent heading to dinner shortly, it would have been great place to sit and relax.\n\nMy latte came quickly and hot ... the only reason I can't give this place a 4 star is the flavour.  Though the dirty chai wasn't bad... it wasn't great either.  It was a generic sweet flavour with no spice ... I was at least expecting a subtle hit of cinnamon.  I ended up getting my spice later at Pukka but was still hoping more than a generic sweet vanilla-ish latte here.\n\nOverall, cute spot and possibly best spot to sit in on St.Clair but in terms of flavour, other Toronto spots definitely have the 4 star quality.
