Hefty, well-stuffed rotis... these beauties will definitely cure any roti cravings you have. I don't normally dream of goat, but for some reason I was craving it this weekend and we dropped into Mona's for a dhalpuri boneless goat roti and a beef roti... and pholourie. I can't resist those tiny, greasy, tamarind dipped appetizers, even though I am guaranteed to be wearing them on my hips for the rest of my life. The rotis were soft, and stuffed with potato, sweet pumpkin and tons of meat, I have never had a better roti! Well done!\n\nThere was a sign on the wall saying they are looking for experienced roti cooks. This white girl from Nova Scotia thought about applying- they could pay me in rotis. ;)
