While I still feel good about the quality of work with House of Window Coverings, I've been less than thrilled with subsequent attempts to get additional work done. I twice emailed my rep and got one word responses or very little helpful information. She just seemed like she doesn't want my business or is disinterested. I am seeking out a new company for my remaining work. Disappointed with the service.
