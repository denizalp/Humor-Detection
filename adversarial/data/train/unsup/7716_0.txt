Ok so I don't normally like to leave bad reviews butt I feel as though this place deserves one. I reserved a room on Priceline.com for this motel and there was no mention of the $14 per day resort fee! Apparently you need to do some digging into the taxes and fees link to find it even though when I researched  other hotels all of them had the resort fees disclosed up front. Had I known about the resort fee I would have stayed on the strip and paid a few more dollars and it would have been worth it. DON'T STAY HERE!!!
