When we go out, we generally have one thing in mind: Asian food! However, my hub loves linguine and clams, so when I saw a beautiful picture of that dish at Roma, I convinced him we should try it. Generally our snobbish attitude is that we can make spaghetti so why eat Italian out? I think I know why now! Big portions, big flavors, and homemade garlic bread!\n\nWe could probably walk here, but the exterior has never convinced me it was a culinary treasure. As soon as you get out of your car , however, your nose tells you otherwise. They are definitely cooking fresh bread on premises as the aromas fill the parking lot.\n\nThe interior is very casual. A \"sit wherever you like\" kind place. There is a counter with salads by the pound, deli meats, cheese and a variety of sweets, and there is also a wine shop connected to the main dining area. The cast of characters is interesting from two Italian car sales guys munching on their egg and peppers sandwich to what appeared to be an entire Italian family complete with grandma.\n\nMy husband knew what he wanted, and I went with the special rigatoni of the day in a red sauce with peas and mushrooms. We shared the house salad, which was a generous serving of mixed greens with 2 giant pieces of garlic bread. I am always thrilled to see a salad done well! When our entrees arrived, we were impressed (and excited) to each receive 2 more giant pieces of garlic bread! The food was piping hot, fresh, and mouth-wateringly delicious. It was so good I found myself risking a burnt mouth because I couldn't resist shoveling down the perfectly al dente pasta. My husband was pleased as well. Whenever he says, \"This place rocks,\" I know we've found a keeper.
