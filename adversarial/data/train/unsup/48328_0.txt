I loved Cosi lunch back in the day when I worked in the Loop in Chicago. Since I was on the west side of Madison and lost in a sea of chain restaurant options, I thought Cosi would be the lesser of the evils. Plus, they have patio seating.\n\nI ordered the hibiscus mint iced tea (good), an Adobo chicken salad and a side of tomato basil soup.\n\nSoup was barely warm, trending cold. I ordered the salad without the tortilla strips and with very light dressing. I can see my receipt captures the correct order. However, the lettuce was drowning in a very tangy dressing and they forgot to include the chicken. I really needed a little protein and appreciated that the chicken they serve has no antibiotics added. Too bad I didn't get any!\n\nI guess the good news is I really stuck to my diet by only eating a 5 oz soup and bit of romaine lettuce for lunch. I did have a couple bites of the flatbread with my soup. I try to stay away from bread since it's so calorie-dense, but it was definitely the star of the meal.
