My daughter requests to come here almost every day. She just loves running around here. On Fridays she can get her face painted and free balloon animal. On Thursday she gets to see her favorite character, we're typically there when Chase from PAW Patrol is there. Weekends are very busy.  I try to go when it's less busy to spend some time on the massage chairs. When I can, I run around with her up the gym areas and on the slides.  Now there is a Princess Carriage that I pull her around in. Oh, and there is free wifi.
