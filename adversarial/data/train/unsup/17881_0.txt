I do not suggest using this place if you need to leave your animal there for any period of time. I just picked my dogs up from here for grooming. Dropped them off at 9:30am and picked them up at 4:30pm. On the drive home the dogs both crapped in the bed of my pickup. The worst of it is, this is the second time this has happened.  The first time I wrote if off as just bad luck. Clearly the dogs are not being walked when they are there. After they pooped I'm the bed, they walked all over the poop and they had to be cleaned at home all over again. So much for paying $64.  \n\nThe sad thing is, when I called the vet to complain, they told me it wasn't their fault and they weren't going to refund my money despite the mess that was created in the back of the truck. Essentially, they just don't care. Luckily, there are many other animal hospitals to take my dogs too. They have lost my business.
