Terrible experience. Save your money and go somewhere else unless you don't mind your belongings being stolen!!To begin with check in was a nightmare, they could not find my name on the reservation anywhere, finally after multiple phone calls to my boss the front desk found my reservation under the same confirm # and last name I had been giving them. Then after check in I got to the room which pretty average and not super clean I ventured off for dinner with colleagues when I came back I asked for an extra blanket which was given to me, and was asked what room number I was staying in And my id I couldn't remember the room number but the location of the room I could my id for some reason didn't match the name on the room so I was not aloud to proceed to MY room, this is at midnight people after a long work day I was ready to go to bed. Finally my co workers\/roomies arrived and I was aloud up to my room. Then I checked out and got a crazy valet parking bill once I got home I realized I left some clothing in the closet I called the hotel and was told nothing was there. So either housekeeping stole my clothes or they didn't do a good job cleaning (no surprise) and the next guest stole my clothes.
