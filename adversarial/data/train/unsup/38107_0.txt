I was unsatisfied with my service but instead of fixing the problem the owners of Naturally Clean thought is was a better choice to argue with me in a defensive manner. Months later I thought I'd give them another shot but they said the following: \"because of what has happened in the past, I don't see how we can possibly be of any help to you.\" This is a very Richard Nixon like sentence, isn't it? There's no subject making the \"has happened\" occur. If this were my company and someone hired my people to vacuum up dog hair from wood floors and a client complained that this had not been done satisfactorily, I'd simply send someone out to re-do the floors. Instead what Naturally Clean did was launch a war in rhetorics.  Save yourself a headache and go elsewhere when looking for housekeeping services.
