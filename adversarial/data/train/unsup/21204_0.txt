Do not go to this location. They have gravestones Buy two get one free. I had two that are 9.99 and one that is 17.49. They wouldn't honor their special because they were not all the same price. Douche bag at the register named Alex said it's corporate's fault. Then he tries overcharging me on two other items. Finally told him to put everything back except for the daughters costume. Would have put that back to that she not spent an hour looking through costumes to find one she likes. I will never give this place another dollar.
