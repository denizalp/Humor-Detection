Went to Sparklings late night, very excited since my girlfriend and I had heard that it was very good.  \n\nLet me start off by saying that this place is open late (until 2am) and the bartender had told us that 2 servers had left shortly before a small late night crowd of 4 small groups came in.  \n\nAs we entered we were not greeted by a host or hostess.  We waited for about 2 minutes then decided to walk over to the bar.  1) Because there was someone there who could helpe us and 2) because the music was way too quiet in the dining area, uncomfortably quiet.  It's a very large open room and with all that silence and only 2 couples eating, it had this kind of echo that big open rooms have.  Was a little strange.\n\nBartender was very friendly and attentive given the fact that he was serving 4 groups and working both the dining room and the bar area.  \n\nThe food sounded really good, but I wasn't very impressed.\n\n-The gnocchi sounded delicious.  It was good, but nothing great.\n-The Shepherd's Pie was actually pretty good.  Nothing incredible, but good.\n-Bacon and date wrapped meatballs were...good.  Are we sensing a theme here?\n-Salmon over rice with caper sauce.  Good.  Sauce was great in flavor, but lacking because there was barely any on my salmon.  \n\nThe service was great at the bar, but I was shocked that we waited 2 minutes at the front for a host which never came.\n\nThe music in the bar was too loud and over the top.  One of the TVs was playing infommercials.\n\nI very much wanted to give this place more stars.  Especially since the bartender was so nice, but we unfortunately had a 3-star experience.
