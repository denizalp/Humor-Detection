Just happened to be in the mood for a doughnut when I saw the sign. Because this building was built out of my line of sight going up 51st Ave I had no clue anything was going in there.  Of course Dunkin' Donuts picked this location because it was on the inbound side of the street for commuters from the West Valley.\n\nI was there about mid morning which is not a busy time.  I was greeted shortly and got my 2 doughnuts.  The doughnuts were as expected and the service was pleasant.  Not much else you can ask for from a doughnut shop.
