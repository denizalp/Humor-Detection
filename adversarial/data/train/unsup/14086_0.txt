Just read Brett B.'s review for some details about this place. I became a member when the gym first opened up in my neighborhood. \n\nThis place is clean, professional, and consistent. They anticipate your every need. Great daycare for busy mom's, lots of free-weights for buff dudes, fun pool slides for kids, basketball courts for middle age guys reliving their high school days, aerobics classes, yoga, everything. \n\nAnd women will especially love the female locker room. Blow dryers, lots of mirrors, elegant marble showers with free shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, a steam room, and a flat screen TV you can watch while you wait for your girlfriend to finish her makeup.
