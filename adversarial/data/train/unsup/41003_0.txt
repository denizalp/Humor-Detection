NomNomz: 5\/5\nWine: 4\/5\nAmbiance: Casual, trendy, chill\n\nPOSTINOS IS MY HOME AWAY FROM HOME!! This place is one of my favorite getaways for wine, and overall really fun! Everything is superb, from the service to the bruschetta boards to the WINE! Everything keeps me coming back for more. Postinos is awesome for a day out with your friends for a quick yummy lunch, a hot date any day of the week, or my favorite... happy hour! You can't beat the deal, either. Every day, you get half priced wines AND bottles until 5pm. So feel free to test their most expensive glasses or split some great bottles with friends at an affordable cost.\n\nHistory: To give you a quick glimpse, the mothership location is in Arcadia and opened up in 2001, so they've got some solid years behind them. This place has been a success to say the least. And props to the owners, total rockstars!! The original location was bought from a vacant post office, so the name Postino emerged from the Italian word for \"postman\" :) Love their story.\n\nWine: They've got a great assortment of world renowned select wines. Glasses range from $9-$13, and they offer at least one selection of most varietals. If you need a bubbly fix, they also have prosecco and sparking rose as well. \n\nBeer: The Kierland locations has an assortment of drafts (shorty - $4; Pint - $6; Pitcher - $10), and cans & bottles ranging from $5-$11 if wine isn't your thing. Although it's known as a wine cafe, this place doesn't forget about their hops lovers. \n\nNomz: Now let's get to the bruschetta boards. What can I say, they're all pretty much to die for. It's really just preference for what you like. My favorites: Smoked salmon w\/pesto (I always order double if there's a few of us because this one goes fast ladies n gents), sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese, roasted pepper with goat cheese, salami w\/pesto - and my friends always love the burrata and brie selection (you choose 4 for $15).\n\nThey have some great salads, sandwiches, and soups to choose from if you want more. Brussel sprout salad ($11), or Tuna Nicoise ($13.50) are my two faves, and you can never go wrong with the NYC grilled cheese ($8.50) and tomato bisque ($4).\n\nTip: If you're a newbie, sign up on their email list and you'll get a free bruschetta board (their hottest item) your first visit. Also, Every Monday & Tuesday after 8pm, they have a special priced bottle and board for $20. \n\nService-wise, this place is 10 stars. I think they take their time hiring the right team, and it clearly shows. Always prompt, polite, so friendly and highly knowledgeable with all the wines. I never have complaints and I've been a frequent visitor. Whenever my friends visit me from out of state I alwaaaaays bring them to Postino's for their chill and fun atmosphere - and great wine.\n\nHours for easy reference: \nHAPPY HOUR: until 5pm daily! \n\nMonday-Thursday: 11:00am-11:00pm\nFriday: 11:00am-12:00am\nSaturday: 9:00am-12:00am\nSunday: 9:00am-10:00pm\n*kitchen open until 11:00pm
