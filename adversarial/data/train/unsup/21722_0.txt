Sweet Tomatoes reminds me of those store purchased cookies from my childhood called Almost Home Cookies. They were almost good but weren't. Sweet Tomatoes is Almost good but also isn't. I tried a variety of things and couldn't find one thing that was good to me except for the service.\n\nI made myself a nice big salad with mostly nice produce but whatever dressings were in the salad mix tasted awful to me so my whole nice almost good salad didn't taste good.\n\nI tried the Thai Cole Slaw and after a bite I was done with that. It was almost good made with nice fresh vegetables but lacked the taste I wanted. \n\nI tried some sort of pasta salad with turkey and the seasoning just wasn't tasty. It was almost good but wasn't. The pasta was very squishy and turned to mush and the turkey had a strong turkey taste to it so it needed a good flavor to cover that up.\n\nI tried a piece of grilled chicken, it was moist but was over seasoned with some sort of Italian concoction that tasted awful. Too much dry maybe old herbs. Seemed like it could have been good chicken but wasn't.\n\nTried a little square of pizza. Wow that was bad and not close to almost good. It's kind of like Wonder Bread with tasteless sauce and almost no cheese.\n\nTried a spoonful of Macaroni and cheese, it was maybe slightly better than the blue box stuff and seemed similar to that with maybe some added real cheese. \n\nI thought the sweet potato plain might be good. It was a real potato but it was water logged and seemed like it was steamed with lots of water entering the potato making it a watery potato like baby food.\n\nThe soft serve was almost good. It tasted watered down but was thick. The metal bowls were nice that kept the ice cream cold.\n\nMaybe the worst thing I tried was the sweet orange cranberry muffin. It wasn't sweet and had raisins in it instead of cranberries. It just was very unappetizing and was very bread like.\n\nAlmost good........ but wasn't. \nSorry to put it that way but that's the way the cookie crumbles.\n\n1.5 stars
