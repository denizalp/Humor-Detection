Note to the wanna be Soprano owner...ya don't know everything about the records in your store. Especially when I'm holding a record that I played on, you're telling me it's an original pressing and it's a re-issue, nit wit!\nStand your ground with this jerk. Him and his son \"price\" the records while you wait for over an hour, by looking up the highest price on eBay, Popsike, Gold mine and other collectors guide and the doubles to triples the price. Show him the more down to earth price on your smartphone, that'll get the old coot riled up. ;).
