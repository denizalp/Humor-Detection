We went for our first time to this beautiful restaurant. It is tucked in the corner of this shopping area but once you walk through the doors you may forget where you are...for a little while. The service is excellent, our waiter Nick was superb! We started with an appetizer of grilled portobello.... enough for two to share. My husband had eggplant and I had veal ravioli. My dish was excellent, fresh and well flavored.  And even though I was totally full ....I had to have the cannoli, which was very impressive. The shell was light and crisp with a light ricotta cream. We will definitely be back again!
