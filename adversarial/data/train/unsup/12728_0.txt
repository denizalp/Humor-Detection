The Miller Ave park is a Town of Markham official dogs off-leash area located at the northwest corner of Miller Avenue and Rodick Road.  It is maintained and run by what seems to be a very keen group of volunteers.  It looks like the volunteer-run website is currently under construction but you can get the dry-kibbly info from the town's website.\n\nWe (meaning me, husband and both dogs) discovered this park last year online and it is one of our favourite suburban dog parks.  It's a great way to turn what could be a boring errand (like returning the wrong hard drive enclosure on the last possible day to Tiger Direct - did you know that SATA is not the same as ATA?  I do now) into a fun family outing with the dogs.   As an added bonus I discovered on my most recent trip this week that the wonderful dumplings of Ding Tai Fung are literally around the corner!  Thank you Yelp iPhone app.\n\nThere is a voluntary yearly membership fee of $20 which helps the committee with keeping up the great amenities including covered picnic tables for humans and agility equipment for the dogs (aka stuff for them to climb on).  The signs say you need to bring in your own water but I noticed this time there is now a tap which is not turned on yet.  There is ample parking and the fenced in-out area is nice and big.  \n\nI've only ever been there three times, but next time I go I will pay the fee.  Even if we go just twice a year it's a small price for a great way to exhaust my dogs and make them happy.
