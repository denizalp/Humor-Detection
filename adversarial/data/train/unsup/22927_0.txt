Trust these reviews. My first time at this location was yesterday and I was in the drive thru for 13 minutes for a wrap & a smoothie AND I was the first & only customer in their drive thru. It also wasn't until after the 12 minute mark that they came to the window, I was not greeted or even told hello, or given a smile. Just *opens window* \"$8.00.\" Wtf? Okay. I smiled & said hello, assuming she needed the smile more than I did. No receipt, no napkins.\n\nI decided to give it a second chance today and their DT speaker had a sign that said no cards bc the system is down, cash only. Again, I was the first and only in line. I made my order, the same as yesterday, and proceeded to the window. 9 minute wait time and \"$7.53.\" Again, I smiled & said hello (this was a different woman this time) and you'd think they would return the greeting? Anyway, I gave her a $100 bill and she said she had no change for that. I told her her sign said cash only since I can't use my card and she says \"I don't know what to tell you if I don't have change.\" So I took my money back, and left. I definitely won't be coming back to this location. No wonder they have such crappy reviews. They're all true.
