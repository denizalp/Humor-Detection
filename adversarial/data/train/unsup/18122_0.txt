Sales dept. complete thieves.  80 year old mother with dementia went in yesterday, and was talked into paying $30,000 for an Optima, WAY over sticker.   She cannot afford this car, and so I called the manager who basically told me too bad, once the car leaves it's hers. Extremely rude and unprofessional.  They are everything you would expect from a sleazy car dealership and more.
