Oh Green! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...\n\n1. You are 100% vegan. I have a plethora of choices to eat from and not have to worry about what its made with and if its vegan or not. \n\n2. Tsoynamis. Nuf' said.\n\n3. Vegan crab puffs!!!\n\n4. You have specials that change all of the time! I just wish you would make about 90% of these specials permanent menu items! I love some of them so much it depresses me when they run out or are no longer available. Example, the Chicken Schwarma wrap. I would KILL for that to be on the menu. It is my favorite thing ever. \n\n5. Most of your staff are some of the coolest people ever, and always remember us. Its nice when staff remember you (and your favorite specials). It also helps that my husband and I have been here at least 50 times in the last year. \n\n6. You don't just make me choose from a few measly salads. You have sandwiches, pizza, pasta, bowls, appetizers. The BBQ chicken and the Mexicali burgers are the greatest things ever. \n\n7. You are relatively close to my house, and I don't have to trek 30 miles to get there. So if at 8pm I decide I want you, I can get to you and not have to worry about making it before you close. \n\n8. You have an in store market where if I feel the need to pick up a box of vegan mac and cheese, I can. \n\nThere are tons of reasons to eat here, whether you are vegan or not. You have to try this place. It is amazing and no matter what you get off the menu, you will not be disappointed.
