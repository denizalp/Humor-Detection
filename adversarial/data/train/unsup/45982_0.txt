Tried the benedict with tofu bacon replacement. Was tasty -and I am picky about benedicts-.  Potatoe latkes were good. The caramel\/pretzel was tasty as well.\n\nThe mango cold rolls were good. Meat muffins were not and a bit messy to eat.\n\nNice decor. Loved the service. They tend to try new things or change some items in certain dishes from time to time which is refreshing.
