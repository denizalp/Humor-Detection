I initially had thought of this place as a four star establishment, but as I wrote the below review I realized this place is great. Five stars! Five stars for bacon! \n\nI came into The Hogtown and ordered a BLT add some of their super tasty C options. I went with 8 year old cheddar. Sharp and sassy, just like me. They had a check in offer for a free coffee with lunch purchase so Bam! I was caffeinated and satiated. \n\nThe wifi works really well, the windows are huge giving ample light and they have Toronto touches all around the interior. Where did they get those paper streetcars?! Want. \n\nPEPPER'S PERFUME: You will smell like bacon when you leave. It is not a bad thing.
