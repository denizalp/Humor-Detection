I literally just had my wedding 2 days ago, and I am still thinking about how amazing Amelia was. I was nervous since I did not do a trial run but she showed up at my hotel at 6:30 in the morning and got right to business. I just showed her a few inspirational pics for my hair and makeup, since I could not find anything specific on the internet, and she brought my dream hair\/makeup to life! She was so friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. Her assistant did my mother and sisters hair and they could not have been happier. I have never felt more beautiful in my life, and I have Amelia to thank for that!
