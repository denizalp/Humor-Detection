Bought the $20 for $38 deal and went in the same day. Walked in with my Yelp app open and the lady at the front had no idea what it even was or that she was even aware that she had a page on Yelp.\nI just wanted to get two massages and use the voucher to pay for almost all of it.\nSo I told her and I think since our native languages were different, lines were crossed but she had no idea of how the voucher worked. Me and my friend almost were arguing with her, and then after the manager on the phone, who still had no idea how the voucher worked.\nAlthough we showed the \"checked in\" page for a $20\/hr massage and it stated on a sign out front AND inside, the management didn't understand our request to get two massages.\nI just wanted to get two massages and they kept on asking for another number or trying to charge us $38 for one massage.\nWe left, and aren't coming back.\n\nIt was dingy on the inside and very small, and there was a dead pigeon on the front patio.\nTry Bali Foot Spa down Spring Mountain and stay far away.
