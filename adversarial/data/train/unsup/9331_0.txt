Stayed here during my Vegas trip, and it was just alright.\n\nIt's located towards the end of the strip, so night life was difficult unless you're a super walker or a luxurious taxi rider.\n\nOne thing I must say is that the Evening Call (Fat Tuesdays wannabee) drinks spot is so damn delicious.\n\nBut let's get back to this review on the hotel!\n\nMy friends and I ended up with a suite, and it was just alright. There was a lot of weird spaces in the room, which made the room awkward. But then again, once you're drunk, I'm sure you can take advantage of that space with someone special ;). What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas right? ;) On another note, there was a HUGE dead moth located near the windows of our suite, EW. But it wasn't like we would die with it....\n\nIf you're big on security, this place is for you because in order to get up to your hotel, you need the card to your room EVERY SINGLE time you're on the elevator. So, it could be annoying-- but safety is always first. But for me, I wasn't bringing a million dollars to gamble, so I really had nothing to lose.\n\n\nOverall, this place was alright. It didn't meet my expectations, but then again, I have high expectations. As for proximity to the strip, I thought it was a bit far-- especially since we had to walk through a million bridges to get to our destination. Coming back? Eh, probably not.
