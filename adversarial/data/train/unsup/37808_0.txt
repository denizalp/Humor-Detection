This has been one of my favorite places to come for years!  \n\nThey really cater to a senior crowd and even feature early bird specials for them.  The prices are reasonable overall though.   \n\nThe main thing I come here for is the corn beef.  The sandwiches are stacked and thinly sliced.  I absolutely love them.  \n\nThey have a lot of pies to choose from for desert, but I never have any room left to try them,.  You can take a look at them on your way out when you pay your check at the register.  \n\nI am getting hungry writting this review.  See you at Luna's.
