I know the food is great at Nora's. Been going here since they had their old location. So we decided to go to their new location on a Sunday night. We get there and it's a packed house. The hostess at the front desk told us it'll be maybe 40 to 1 hr wait. So we're like okay, we'll wait. As we were waiting, we noticed that people who had reservations were waiting for almost 30 min for their table. Even the manager and the hostess were so frazzled that night they were giving each other attitude. We also noticed many of the tables were still waiting for their food. We even waited more than an hr. and the manager came to us and bribed us that their \"$10,000\" heating system outside was legit if want to sit outside in the cold. I don't care if it was $10,000 or 1 million. We specifically said we wanted to sit inside. So more than an hr passed. We left. \nThey have poor customer service and bad management.
