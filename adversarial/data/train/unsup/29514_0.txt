I booked with Bow River\/Calgary Chem Dry based on some reviews online. I was rather disappointed with how they handled my file. I had booked them 2 months in advance for a move out carpet clean and I needed them at a specific time and on a specific date. They called me the day before to confirm and told me a wrong time. When I called the company back the response I got was \"well someone made a mistake and booked you in the wrong time slot but they are no longer with the company.\" I was thinking....\"who cares, it's your fault, fix it, I booked this 2 months in advance\" Well they basically told me I was stuck with the wrong time (even though I booked 2 months in advance) because they were full. I told the person on the phone \"I want someone at my house at the time we agreed on and I don't care how it happens, this was your mistake, it's not like I asked to reschedule, fix it.\"\n\nThe company eventually fixed it by having another customer switch times and the person they sent did an amazing job on the carpets. \n\nHad the company not come forward and acknowledged the mistake this would have been a 1 star review. However, there is no way they should have tried to brush me off like that, especially when THEY made the error. There is no way a company should ever treat a customer in that fashion.\n\nIn the end they admitted that the screw up was their fault, they sent someone at the right time, and they did a good job. Still, being more upfront and trying to fix it at the beginning instead of giving me a BS attempt at a run around would have gone much further in my mind.
