Absolutely recommended for all piano needs! Professional, kind, and very knowledgeable helpful guys! Bought a baby grand from them last week and will definitely be back! \n\nTheir prices were very competitive and I loved the online checkout process! They're also helpful with all my follow up questions! Five stars all the way!
