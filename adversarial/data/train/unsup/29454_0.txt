My life partner\/husband and I went to eat lunch\/dinner today at Red White &Brew McDowell.  We arrived at 2:30 on Friday, and were seated right away. Great waitress and amazing food.  We ordered the Mediterranean salad and Chicago pizza.  The salad was crisp, fresh and served chilled. The pizza was hot, crunchy and delicious.  \n\nYou can't go wrong eating here!!! We ordered the large pizza so we ended up taking most of it home.
