Me and a buddy came here a few weeks ago at 2am. Granted, I understand 2am service will be a little bit less than normal dining hours (although I don't think that's a good excuse, but I understand it). Seated instantly. Food was good except for the steak I had ordered. I asked for it medium rare and it came out extremely well done... before I even said anything the waitress had said they were already making a new one for me ( that was good- without me having to say anything ) BUT THEN the next steak came out and it was extremely well done, almost exactly the same as the first steak. At this point there was no reason to cause a ruckus but what a let down... business side you are using more of your inventory to correct a messed up order, but without even fixing it! I enjoy their pancakes of course so I will return.. will just have to be super specific when\/if I order steak from there again
