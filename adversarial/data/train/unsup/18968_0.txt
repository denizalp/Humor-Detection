Our 24 year anniversary is just around the corner and my thoughtful husband surprised me and our older girls, 22 and 23, with a Vegas pre-celebration of epic proportions! Checked in on Friday to the most welcoming arrival, a suite and reservations to the spa! \nThis is the kind of place that encompasses every luxury one could imagine. \nThe most helpful and friendly staff we have ever experienced in Vegas including the concierge that helped us throughout the weekend for reservations to XS, Intrigue, mizumis, Sinatra's and Lakeside. Our room was stellar! Remote controlled for comfort and efficiency; room service at 3:30am was quick and delicious! There is a $9 room service charge as well as an automatic 18% gratuity which was well deserved. \nThe level of service here is impeccable! Tables pay well and the fact that you never have to leave has made the Encore our new 5 Star Vegas go-to hotel.
