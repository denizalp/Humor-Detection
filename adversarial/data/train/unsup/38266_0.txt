I have never stayed here. The pool however is quite nice and they even do swim in movies in the summer. my parents use this as their mini-vacation place for the pools and great room rates.\n\nIt is a little older and a little run down but still a very decent place and the staff has always been very friendly when I am there.\n\nI recently went to the bar there seeing as how I live in the apartments that share the parking lot and had a martini. Never have I had an old guy ask me how dirty I like it nor did I think I would appreciate the question so. \"Very dirty,\" I replied.\n\nThe bartender was a super great guy and chatted with me a bit. He would get 5 stars if the review were for him.\n\nThe gin martini was 7.50 a bit steeper than I generally care to spend by myself in a place that is simply not all atmosphere but what the hell for the occassional after work coctail it will do.\n\nThe bar is small and was not busy at all. I will return but it definately won't be my go to place until I am ready to hit the pool. Not sure if I have to sneak.
