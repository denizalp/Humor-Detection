I called for dinner tonight and was given the wrong order. When I called to explain what was wrong, the lady wanted to argue with me. I tried to explain that I asked for dinners and was not given the correct meals. She was not accommodating and told me that because we paid for it. But I tried to explain that even thought it was paid for it was wrong. The white rice was stale and I felt like my business did not matter. It was 9:29 and they close at 9:30 I am sure that is why she didn't try to accommodate me because they were closing. Very disappointed..
