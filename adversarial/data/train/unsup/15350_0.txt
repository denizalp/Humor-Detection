4.5 stars.\n\nThe girls are really f*cking sexy. The show is mostly nude, but done in a very classy, artistic way. After a while I forgot they were naked. The venue (as well as the stage) is small and intimate (appropriate for the show). We had seats at one of the tables in front, but it seemed as though the place was small enough for everyone to get a good view. They did very cool things with the lighting and the costumes (even though they were very tiny) were great. They have brothers that do a couple acts as well. They were very funny and entertaining. Don't worry...the brothers don't get naked ;)
