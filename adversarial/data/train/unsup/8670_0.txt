I came here having bad service from Stephanie at the bar about 2 weeks ago. I was so upset the couple on both sides of me were upset with her service too! We waited 13 minutes to get our 1st drink and that was after we started timing. I was so upset we didn't even eat dinner we left and went to another bar and had great service down the street. \nIf you come here avoid her service. It's not the 1st time I've seen her. She was at Buffalo and 215 PTs and she was no better there either. \nWhen I wanted to complain about her service I was shocked that she was manager! Horrific! Seriously. NOPE! This use to be my favorite spot to come when it was Jalisco's and Super Mex! I recommend everyone to go to the Buffalo PTs. Way better service!
