Updating my review with more information. The manager, because he did not come visit our party of 18 to even say hello, did not know what our coupon was (not groupon). The waitress gave us a BS excuse, and because we did not want to make a scene aboit this or the waitress badmouthing the family called him from the parking lot. Even upon finding out that the party had a couple issues, he did not appear to say hello. I went to the bathroom and the waitress was complaining aloud to the other servers about her party of 18, there were 3 tables split among 4 families, and checks needed split accordingly even though members were forced to sit at a couple tables because you can only fit 6 people per. (I.e. one family of two, one family of 3 and then one from another family) now I understand their computers are seemingly ancient, but that's not the customers problem. With the prices of the food here they should be able to update, unless I'd guess that a majority of their business is one visit and using a coupon of some sort. We showed up, as a couple of two expecting to pay our own bill, with a coupon we purchased. One coupon for one table, us. I absolutely would not dine at this garbage restaurant without a coupon before the experience and not even with now. Even at Applebee's the manager greets every table, let alone one that could make your whole night.
