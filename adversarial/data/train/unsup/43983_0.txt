Food is fine (Chilis is Chilis) and service when sitting in the restaurant to dine-in has never been a problem. It's the takeout I have had issues with. For some reason this Chilis will not accept phone orders within a half hour of closing. I once called at 9:32 (they close at 10) and was told I could not place an order. I had just gotten out of work and wanted to pick up food on my way home. I was told I was more than welcome to come in person and order food to go. I explained I wouldn't get there until 9:50 and again was told that was my only option. So I drove there and had to place an order and sit and wait for it. I watched a guy come in and sit down at the bar and order food (to stay and eat there) at 9:59 but apparently me calling in an order at 9:32 was not acceptable. No where on their website does it state this \"rule\" about when you can place to go orders so I'm not sure how that is good business. I was so annoyed and probably will order from the Applebees across the street next time instead.
