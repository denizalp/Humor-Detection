Around Thanksgiving last year, I found a used Class A online at this place.   It was a special type of unit with a wheelchair lift.   Living in California, and with some trepidation, we corresponded by email and phone with John.   I was impressed that John gave me the straight information on condition of the coach - full disclosure and complete professionalism.  Living out of state, and trusted what I heard from John and this company - I took the big lunge, agreed on a price, made deposit and flew to Arizona (nervously) to pick it up.   What I found when I got there was EXACTLY as promised.  The unit was cleaned impeccably, John walked me and my son around, showing patience and support at all time.   The experience exceeded all my expectations - again, professionalism, and fair price.  \n\nSo, this is my first Yelp review, and the reason I am writing is to give feedback 6 months or so AFTER the deal!   John has been 100% available and assisted me by phone - but the pleasant surprise is when I took the unit in for servicing here at home (today).   The service provider said he seldom sees such a well maintained unit - for the year.  Reminded me what an excellent coach I purchased.\n\nJohn and Superstition - thanks again for the honesty, and complete transparency in the deal you gave my wife and I.  Truly a great experience I will never forget.  (Jim).
