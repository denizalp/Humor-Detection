I guess our complaints are getting attention. I gave this place one more shot and the service was a big improvement. I moved it up from 1 star to 3. I'm not to happy with the new changes in recipes though:( the arroz con polo was great but the causa w\/shrimp was so much better with chopped shrimp, smaller Pieces of onion, no olive sprinkled into it and where did my egg go? Also the anticucho de lomo seasoning seemed to have changed:( I was happy to see they had domestic beer this time.
