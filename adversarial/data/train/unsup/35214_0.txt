I've never had a bad experience at this place. The servers are really friendly,  they give the food in a timely manner and the food itself is amazing! ! When I've gone I usually would get a brisket taco which is not good everywhere.  But here....it's so good!  Also the different margaritas with a long list of Tequila is the cherry on top. Definitely a place to go to with friends or a date night.  Check them out!
