I drove 50 miles to check this place out and had a hard time finding it!\n\nIt's definitely not your typical frozen yogurt bar.\n\nI tried a few of the flavors as well as the vanilla custard.\n\nThe best (and only reason I would come here) is the Twangy Tart!\nIt's sour just like plain yogurt but with a hint of sweetness to cut the bite and a refreshing icy texture. It's insanely Delicious on it's own or paired with some fresh fruit.\n\nThey have a beautiful assortment of Fresh Fruit toppings but I felt their other toppings were lacking.\n\nI decided on the Twangy Tart with strawberries (see picture)\n\nI'm giving 5 stars  based on the unique plain yogurt flavor \"Twangy Tart\" and their Beautiful \"Fresh Fruit\" selection, I wish they were closer to me.\n\nETA: My Slogan\n\nOnce you try the Twang you'll be like Daaaaaang! \nAnd Nothing else will ever be the same!
