I went in for a late lunch, to determine whether or not this would be a good place to bring a large group.  Very glad I did the test run.  Inattentive service even though I was the only diner most of the time I was there, and arancini that were repulsive (maybe the fryer oil was going off?).  I also was nearly bathed in spicy oil from being given a container with a wobbly lid--not that the server would have noticed.  Bullet dodged!  I'll take my group of 9, and several hundred dollars worth of revenue, somewhere else.
