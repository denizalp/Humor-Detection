Hung out at C Mulligan's last night for my bestie's birthday celebration - a little bit of dancing and a lot of karaoke. \n\nFirst impression, was like my tip says - the place smelled like an old bowling alley bathroom; a little bit of ashtray with a hint of mildew. It's a dive through and through. A lot of locals, a karaoke queen, and dudes dressed for the 90's (think hilljacks + eminem circa 1999). \n\nA DJ plays every Friday up at CM's. The dance floor was empty except when extreme songs came on - either super country, super ghetto, or super heavy metal\/shock rock. The songs ranged from Kenny Chesney to Tyga to Nine Inch Nails. If you had a request, they would play it. However there was A LOT of karaoke, which got a little old.\n\nAs for drinks, they've got a full bar. I saw during the week they have martini specials (no telling how good those are, but at least they have 'em). They boy toy stuck with the silver bullet & I sipped on UV Blue with Lemonade all night. My drink was delish, refreshing with not a lot of alcohol taste @ $3.75 a pop it wasn't too bad.\n\nThe bathrooms were tiny & what you would expect from a dive. Nothing to see here folks, moving on.\n\nCM's has a patio - it was for smokers and teaching me how to bust the bottom out of a beer bottle. Who knew water and a swift tap on the top did that? Kinda cool. Aside from that, the patio looked out of place and nicer than the inside of the joint. A number of tables, and fencing along the outside with strings of lights. Super nice for warmer nights.\n\nLots of signs in the bar talked about drink specials during Brownies games & there were a number of televisions around - so it might not be a bad choice for taking in a few NFL games.\n\nI'll be back, but only because I can dance in front of these people without being embarrassed - most of them are hammered and I'll never see them in my daily life! Ha, good times.
