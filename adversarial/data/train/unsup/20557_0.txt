Opening day at GEN- long awaited while the mall built out- and finally here!\n\nWorth waiting for, and worth coming on the opening night.  Didn't seem to have any teething issues with the service, no confusion etc typically associated with an opening- everything was spot on.\n\nThe price:  19.99 per person AYCE, a bargain for LV, as all of the other places in town are a few $ more.\n\nThe ambience:  Not a normal AYCE BBQ place- more of a laid back modern vibe with nice decor, music, and lights. Almost like a bar with cozy white leather booths, huge tv, and great view of the mountains.\n\nThe food:  32 choices for the AYCE- a lot of different marinated beef choices, chicken and pork.  Tonight had the #1Gen Signature steak (Not recommended- chewy and no flavour), #3 Gen Chadoi (Highly Recommended- very very tasty), #5 Gen Beef Bulgogi (very good also- nice marinade flavour), #14 Cajun Chicken (Nice sauce, spicy and deep flavoured), #17 Smoked Garlic Pork Belly, and #32 Miso Soup (Very rich and good Miso base).\n\nIt comes with the usually side dishes which were laid out before getting to the table, so they were not fresh- they should be brought out after you sit down, they were mostly left untouched because either hard or a bit dryer out.    The salad and Jap Chae glass noodles were constantly refilled because they were eaten so quickly.\n\nThe grill is nice, it doesn't smoke upwards, the venting pulls it down, and you can't hear it at all, and doesn't leave the typical grease spatters on the table.  Changing the grill was done frequently, but the guys doing it simply picked up the old *hot & oiled* grill and run off with it.  No cart, no tray, no towel, nothing.  I wonder how long until someone burns themselves or slips on the oil dripping from it.  Opening day glitch maybe...\n\n  Easy payment, swiped at the table with a square, and ready to go.\n\nDefinitely coming back here- and skipping all the other Korean BBQ in town at this point- all the rest are overpriced, dirty and random.\n\nThank you for coming to LV, GEN!!!
