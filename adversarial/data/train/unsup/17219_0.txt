You know those places that you love and want to review because its so great but they aren't so popular, or at the height of what could be its popularity, yet? And if you and the others who love it review, people will flock and at some point it will 1- get crowded and 2- just wont be your secret little haven anymore. Well that is what Sambalatte is for me! \nI have been in Vegas 6 years and longed for a coffee joint that is NOT Starbucks or CoffeeBean. I found Sambalatte and have been in heaven ever since. The atmosphere is welcoming and homey. There is a great upstairs area that is good for bigger groups, but I prefer to sit outside. The staff is so friendly and very helpful. The coffee? Delish!!!! Creamy and not bitter. And served with pretty coffee art. I have only had the macaroons and the quiches, but I can say both are phenom!!!! The quiches are buttery and flaky with just the right amount of egg and fillings. I have had the veggie and Loraine, though the veggie is my fave. And the macaroons are bite size with just the right amount flaky crunch before you sink your teeth into the gooey center. \n     At this point Sambalatte is by far my favorite coffeehouse in Las Vegas. It is such a delight and I am so happy to have found this gem. Enjoy!
