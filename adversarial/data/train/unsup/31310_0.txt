I was sucked in by the 5 star reviews. I went in person to order a birthday cake for my wife.  After ordering, they called me back about 15 minutes later, advising they didn't have any vanilla (??) but could make the cake with chocolate chocolate chip ice cream.  I agreed.  They told me the cake would be ready at 4pm the following day (my wife's birthday).  \n\nI arrive at 4:30PM and there is a sign up \"sorry ran out of ice cream\". Knocked on the window and got someone to come out.  Told him I had a cake to pick up.  He went in the back and then called someone on the phone.  Then came to the front and said \"sorry it didn't get made\". So 4:30pm and they couldn't have told me this a LOT earlier, before I drove all the way out to pick it up?  \n\nSo they received my money anyway, as I made the mistake of buying a Yelp \"deal\".  Which is $15 for nothing but a headache in my case.  \n\nThank God for the Cold Stone on Power Road in Queen Creek! They had a pre-made cake and even decorated it for me at 5:30pm.  \n\nNever again guys. Fool me once, shame on you.
