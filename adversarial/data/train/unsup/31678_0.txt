We are new to the community, but immediately Natalie has made herself stand out as going above and beyond. I am a nurse traveler and had some issues being told exactly what I needed to know to bring with me when I got here. Natalie has gone above and beyond making sure we know where things are and even letting us use a mouse for my computer when mine stopped working. She opened 30 minutes early to accommodate us after our long drive. She is pretty much brilliant.
