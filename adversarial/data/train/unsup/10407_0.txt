*DD (date of dining): 12\/28\/15* \n\nWhen you're stuck in traffic for 7 hours and all the buffets close at 10 pm...and the wait time is from 1 hour to two hours long...we got lucky with The Buffet at the Bellagio!\n\nSalad bar:\n-Didn't even see a shadow at this station. Of course, they have your typical stuff but since it's definitely not the focus for anyone...let's move on.\n\nEntree:\n-The entrees were pretty divided between \"east\" and \"west\". Cha siu pork, broccolini (my personal favorite), bok choy, herb chicken, BBQ pork buns, siu mai?? Beef wellington, sirloin steak...I must say though, this buffet is catered to the Asian tourists. It didn't have a great variety of items- just large quantities of it. They do have a large variety of pastas, but they were not impressive. Nothing stood out for me besides the steak with killer horseradish. \n\nSoup:\n-Jeez. Maybe because I'm a huge soup person, but this selection was really poor. Your standard chicken noodle, clam chowder, vegetable minestrone...They do have a section by the entrees that is prepared \"per order\" but that wasn't good either. It wasn't customized in any way- it was just poured out by a lady with two huge soup pots. \n\nSeafood:\n-Though it was late at night, but they were keeping it coming with all the fresh seafood! Though the one everyone only grabs for is the snow crab...I was going for the cocktail shrimp.However...the salmon, tilapia and other fish were amazing. Not the cream of the crop, but stood out enough for me to keep going back for more. \n\nDessert:\n-Sad!. Though, I do enjoy their cobblers (but it's so messy). They turned off the ice cream machines pretty early, so all we had were flan, carrot cake, tiramisu and some other chocolate cakes. Wasn't impressed, but I do like they were in small portions so you could try everything. \n\nSushi bar:\n-Mehhhhh. The sushi was okay, nigiri was not bad but not too fresh looking. The rolls were falling apart so it did not seem like the sushi chef was putting his heart and soul into each roll. \n\nPros:\n-Seating is spacious. Lots of room (I guess not enough, if we still had to wait in line for 40 minutes)! \n-Great service. Our server kept coming over to make sure we were okay. We were brought tons of drinks to wash down our meal. \n\nCons:\n-Mediocre food. Nothing stood out, but nothing was terribly bad. Just not what I expected for paying $55 a person for dinner (holiday special price). \n\nFor some reason food at a buffet just looks better on someone else's plate. Or maybe I'm just super greedy and expected more...regardless, it doesn't hurt to come here but if you can, definitely check out the other buffets first since they are the same price range.
