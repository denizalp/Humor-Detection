This location is convenient and since it is on campus it makes it easy for students to eat here. It is located inside the SEB (science and engineering building.) They have the same menu as other Einsteins locations. Depending on what time you guy it can get very busy. It is going to take longer for you to get your food if it is busy. So I recommend going early, or at a time when everyone is in class, or when students leave.\n\nThe service depends on who is working that day. Usually when I go they are very sweet and sometimes joke around with you. I noticed on days at the end of the week they might run out of items. But it doesn't happen often. It is a good option if you want to avoid the craziness in the SU. You can also study here.
