Horrible food and service!!!\nStay away from this place, the food is all previously frozen and tasteless!! \nNot even worth the price or time, the service lacks in so many levels!! When I called in my order the man over the phone seemed annoyed that I called, I put that aside and still ordered as I was craving Chinese, and it wasn't even worth it.\nTrust me, stay away and go with your next best option!! Uhhhh, it was nasty!
