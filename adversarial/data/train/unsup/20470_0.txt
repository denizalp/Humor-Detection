While driving home this evening, I came upon Pizza Fiamma. I was lured in by the flashing neon signs, indicating they were now open, and advertising their specials.\n\nThe interior is pretty small. There are 2 counters for people dining-in, probably seating 6 customers between the 2 of them.\n\nThe gentleman serving me was extremely nice, and boasted that they had the best pizza around. I was up to challenging such a bold statement...alright, maybe it's not so bold, as the pizzeria's around are mostly disappointing. I opted for a lone slice of pepperoni to satisfy my curiosity, and off I went with one of their menus.\n\nDelicious! I have to say, generally ordering a slice means you get something that has been sitting forever under the lamps, and has the bare minimum of cheese and sub-par pepperoni, but this was just great. It seemed like there was way more cheese than you would normally find without requesting extra cheese, and that's not a bad thing. I don't know, something about this pizza just sang, and I loved it.\n\nUpon examining their menu, I noticed more than 1 really solid deal (extra large pizza for $8.99? Uh, yes please!), and they also serve the standard pizza place items: Garlic bread, panzos, wings, potato wedges etc, and they also offer free delivery for orders over $10. I can't wait to see what Fiamma has to offer when I place my first large order.
