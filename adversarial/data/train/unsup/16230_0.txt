Two trips to Fez and I am completely comfortable giving it a 5 star review.  The pour is heavy.  The food is delicious.  The service is great.  They let me smoke on the patio and have a drink in my hand at the same time.  I won't go into detail since it's all been said before but definitely try the chicken philo appetizer.
