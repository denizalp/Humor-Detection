It's been a long while since we've gone to Smashburger as the first time wasn't the best - salty, oily and a la carte overpriced. Seems things have changed over the years as the food tasted better and the prices seem to be more reasonable with the introduction of combo meals that I started to come back. \n\nNow the problem here is that the cleanliness of this location has bothered us enough to not return after seeing it a few times...and I see other reviews mention this so it's obviously a pattern and the normal. The first was forgivable as they were actually pretty busy with a sports team of kids and parents. I get it, in a mad rush sometimes you don't get to everything right away and if you aren't great a time management, you'll sink. The 2 times after that it was not busy and the cashiers were just lollygagging about. Tables sat dirty for a long time, if they cleared baskets it took a while to wipe and wasn't thorough, there was stuff all over the floor. I got out a wet wipe because there was crumbs still on my table. If  I can sit there and have a whole meal and tables sit unbussed, there's a problem. I asked for a sauce to dip my fries but towards the end I ran out of some so I decided to finish with ketchup. The bottle was crusty. Sure, a customer did that and sometimes you follow a messy person....so I got the bottle at the table next and it was like that too. I do not think they wipe down their bottles on the daily like you should. \n\nNo thanks. It makes me imagine what they might skimp in the kitchen.
