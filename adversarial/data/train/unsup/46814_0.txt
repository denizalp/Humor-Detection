We won't be returning here after the poor customer service and soggy, greasy pizza we received on our last visit.  \n\nWe ordered a pizza and were told 10-15 minutes and i picked it up like 15 minutes past the quoted pickup time.  When I walked in the pizza was sitting on top of the pizza oven which makes the pizzas soggy, so if you get a pizza and they have it sitting on top of the pizza oven tell them you want a new one or better yet go somewhere else.  \n\nWhen I got home I realized the pizza was really soggy and greasy.  I thought maybe it was undercooked or something.  I called them to let them know what happened and they blamed me for picking it up past the time they told me, it's not like I was an hour late or something!  Wow, talk about poor customer service.  It's ok we will get pizza from a real pizza place and Greek food from our regular spot, The Great Greek, that has much better Greek food and better customer service. \n\nWe will let our friends in the area know about our experience here.
