---Fish fry review---\n\nAs the finale to my PGH Lenten Fish Fry World Tour, I paid a visit to St. Rosalia's on Good Friday at around 5:30pm.  One of my faithful fish fry touring companions accompanied me, making the trek to Greenfield a bit less confusing and monotonous and my opinion on the quality of the goods a bit more reliable.\n\nAs per usual, I phoned in an order ahead of time, and the ordering and fulfillment process went smoothly.  For my order, I went with the fried fish sandwich ($7) and a side of mac and cheese ($3), and my companion went with the fried fish dinner, which came with roasted red potatoes, green beans, and a miniature loaf of cornbread ($10).  Despite that the fish looked kind of sketchy to me (esp. the coating), it was surprisingly good.  The coating was of the breaded variety and was light and crisp, and the fish itself was flaky and moist.  The roll, while nothing particularly special, held up to the fish well--which is the purpose of a roll, after all.\n\nAs for the sides, I can only speak for the mac and cheese, given that I didn't sample my dining companion's sides.  Unlike another recent reviewer, I found the mac and cheese solidly average for fish fry mac and cheese (maybe someone different was making it?).  My dining companion enjoyed his sides, and I ended up eating the cornbread, which isn't really worth evaluation as it was prepackaged.\n\nOverall, my dining companion and I enjoyed St. Rosalia's fish fry and would recommend it.  While it's not the best fish fry in PGH, I'd put it in the top 10-15th percentile, making it one of the better bets in the city.  As such, it made for a solid ending to my PGH fish fry tour.
