Went there for lunch today, was immediately welcomed by the hostess, and seated.  Our service was very good, and the food was very tasty.\nHubby had a HUGE platter of Nachos(I am not sure, but I think I saw part of the kitchen sink) and I had the Carne Asada.  \nMy steak was perfect, seasoned well and tender, I usually don't like spanish rice, but this was very flavorful.\nMy husband couldn't eat all of the Nachos.\nKept our tea filled up, checked on us several times and were very friendly, we will be going back.
