The menu of Peter's has remained pretty much the same since their debut in 1962. You won't find grilled chicken sandwiches or fish here. I can also assure you that you won't see anything that resembles a salad...nothing here even rhymes with salad. Now that we're clear on that, let's move on to what Peter's does have; Burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, ice cream treats and some of the best shakes you will ever attempt to drink through a straw. As a matter of fact, Peter's claims that you can mix up to 3 of their 30 milkshake flavours for a combination of more than 4500 flavours.\n\nThe burgers are charboiled, dressed in a signature fashion that makes them uniquely Peter's. Each patty is made from fresh chuck, individually submerged in their BBQ sauce before being tucked into freshly baked, custom-made buns. They are then lovingly wrapped in their foil before making their way to your mouth. Just consistently delicious.\n\nAs much as I like the possibility of 4500 combinations of shake flavours, I often choose the simplicity of the vanilla shake. That doesn't mean I won't go for a blueberry or strawberry\/chocolate now and then. Believe me, the shakes are thick, they are delicious and made from fresh fruit.\n\nIf you are going to Peter's Drive-In, remember to bring cash. The closest ATM is at the 7-11 a couple doors down, but save yourself the pain and get your cash before you find yourself banging your head on your dashboard 'cause you're stuck in the drive-through with a useless debit card and an empty stomach.
