I'd love to say that I'm a fan because truly I am but something about needing any medical imaging done is never fan worthy. \n\nSo, I'm going to do my best to hit the basics. I had no appointment, the wait wasn't too long considering there appeared to be a lot of people, the staff were friendly and my results were back to my Dr sooner than I expected, especially with it being a holiday weekend. \n\nAll in all, no complaints. I hope to not have to go back but hey for what it's worth it wasn't too bad.
