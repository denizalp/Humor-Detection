Came here around 2 pm and there was only 2 tables occupied so that should of been the first sign. I eat a lot of Crepes and I have to say the texture on these crepes were odd, over cooked and almost to thick to be Considered a true crepe . I got the spinach, ham And Brie and it was so salty and the spinach inside was most definitely previously frozen  which made the whole dish watery. My husband got the smoked salmon ate 3 bites and was done. It just tasted bad and not fresh. I gave it one star for the good service and because the salad and soup starter where good !
