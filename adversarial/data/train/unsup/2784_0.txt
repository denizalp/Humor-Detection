So yesterday my husband and I ended up going to Persian room we love it there been there a couple hundred times had my daughters baptism there it was nice until yesterday! The food has completely changed poor quality! We had a cold appetizer returned it got a new one it was still cold!( me the to be served hot per the menu) then we got our food omg it was so bad the food runner literally said OH F$&@ in my ear as he was dropping our cold food off. We had the manager Erick come by he is the worst person EVER  hands down doesn't care at all we told him our food was cold and he said FINE I'll remake it I said please remake it fresh don't reheat it!! 5 mins later food was ready obviously it was heated I couldn't eat my chicken kabob neither my husband could bc it was burnt. This place has really gone down in service and food so sad bc we loved coming here!
