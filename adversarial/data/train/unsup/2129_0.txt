I adore Tom Colicchio and was so excited to visit Vegas and get to eat at one of his restaurants.  With a few friends on Sunday, October 5th, I tried to visit this restaurant and unfortunately didn't even get to try the food.\nNot because the restaurant was busy, in fact we could have been seated right away, but because the hostess that night around 9:30pm was such a snot.\nShe had more eyeliner than hospitality.\nJust an awful girl.\nBad facial expressions.\nReally ugly tone to her voice.\nRude demeanor.\nShe acted like we weren't good enough to eat there, so we took our money to another, just as expensive celebrity chef restaurant.\nI'm bummed that I didn't get to eat here though, maybe I'll try one of his other locations on my next vacation.
