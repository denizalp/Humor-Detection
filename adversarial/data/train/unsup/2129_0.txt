I finally tried Shanghai Sang-Ji Bao at Sang-Ji Fried Bao! \n\nPerfect when it is chilly as the Bao was served pipping hot with so much meat juice and soup inside! \n\nMy friend asked if I like it? If I ate mine 2 so fast after a big lunch and now eyeing the one that left which supposed to be hers? I guess I must LOVE it!\n\nPerfect as a snack and no sharing required!\n\n10 minute wait time was so worth it for these freshly made Bao!
