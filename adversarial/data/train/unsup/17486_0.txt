Yay a Bear that just came out of hibernation! Let me feed it with my stored body fat made of out a year's worth of junk food.\n\nSaid no one. Ever.\n\nBut I like hiking, and with plans to do a solo excursion late this year I figured I better start making preparations and getting more of the outdoors to bring out my inner woodsman.\n\nI strolled into MEC on a Sunday afternoon. Not a big fan of having to pay for parking but some nice dude in a truck passed his on to me which had a good hour left on it. Thanks man! May the parking gods bestow good wealth upon your stationary vehicle.\n\nI had two objectives at MEC: One was to pick up appropriate hiking and climbing footwear and the second was to scope the place out for possible future purchases.\n\nBut wow, this place is a mecca for anyone who lives for the outdoors, at the least the occasional weekend warrior. Every section is riddled with equipment and dodads that makes anyone a walking Swiss Army knife.\n\nSpeaking of Swiss Army knifes. It was the first thing I picked out when I realized that I needed some utensils that could come in handy with my survival. But when I turned around I noticed I was in the wildlife defense section so I also picked up a bear spray and bell. Knife, bell, and spray? That Grizzly won't see me coming.\n\nTheir staff is very friendly and helpful. Even though it was very busy, MEC set up a number system for sales associates to grab hiking boots for people. I got mine in 10 minutes :)\n\nFinally the climbing enthusiast gave me more than I bargained for in climbing knowledge. I was more than glad to drop a little extra $$ to understand why comfort matters. He even gave me a few climbing pointers that really ramped up my bouldering game.\n\nLastly $5 for a membership- worth it if one expects to be back here. And I will, I'm looking forward to finding more about their equipment rental!\n\nGot my eyes on you, bears. Fuck you up like the wrath of khan.
