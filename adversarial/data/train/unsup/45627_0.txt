Stopped here from the great reviews on here and didn't regret it.  A pretty unique experience for me to be able to get the poutine (which was made with the fresh rotisserie chicken, cheese curds, and brown gravy-- And was absolutely delicious). I also got the 1\/2 chicken meal, which included a salad and A LOT of fries. Everything was incredible and I would recommend this to anyone.  If you want a unique(ish) experience in Montreal, PLEASE come here (you won't regret it).
