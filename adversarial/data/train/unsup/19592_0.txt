I came here with a few girl friends on a Friday night and we were kept very happy all night long.\n\nIt is an absolute MUST to order the fresh cut salsa and homemade nacho chips. For $2.99 the portion is massive and they are absolutely delicious. \n\nI see from other reviews that a lot of people think this place is a bit pricey, but if you're an average sized person, with an average sized appetite, most things they serve on this menu should be shared. The portions are absolutely ENORMOUS. I split the enchiladas with a friend, each of us finished one, leaving one left over and we were stuffed!! The same thing goes for the portions of those burritos.\n\nThere is another Mexican joint just across the street but what this one has going for it that the other doesn't even come close to is the atmosphere. It's dark, cozy and fabulous.  \n\nThey also open their front right up in the summer so you get that warm summer breeze all through the restaurant. Their margaritas are what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant, great!\n\nI am actually really looking forward to bringing a date here sometime soon.
