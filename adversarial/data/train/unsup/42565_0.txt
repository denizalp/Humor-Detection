DO NOT let this company tow ypur car, if your insurance recommends them  tell them HELL NO. I was in a car accident back in October and my car was not driveable and these unprofessional and lazy idiots picked up my car from another company. The next day I went to check on my vehicle and it was apparent that someone went through my car and took all my valuables. I was livid I went to the front office and demanded to look at the video footage, which they said they didn't have. I walked out of the office and one of the workers followed me trying to instigate me to fight. It took everything in me not to rip his head off. I did the civil thing and called the police and they explained that they couldn't do anything. I let my insurance company know of their actions and hopefully they take them off their list. I would give them Zero Stars if I could.
