Went here for date night before a movie, wait was 20mins so we sat in the bar area. Took forever to get drinks. Server was friendly. Order poke for app which was great. Husband ordered steak salad and didn't like the dressing. I order the tacos, you get 2, 2 as a meal... I took one bite, GROSS! The meat was so rare it was chewy and soft and basically seemed old. I don't like sending food bad. I'm giving 2 stars thanks to the staff and poke app. I won't be back, I feel like I wasted $75 on a meal, pretty disappointed!
