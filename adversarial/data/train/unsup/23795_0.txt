Do not stay here!  Save your money and thank me later.\n\nWe're  currently staying here this week, from Sunday-Wednesday.  The Executive room was $300\/night (for a weeknight!), which I thought would give you something nice in Scottsdale, but I was greatly disappointed.\n\n*  Small Room, no bathtub\n*  Uneven tiles in the shower that stab your feet as you're standing on it.  \n*  Bees on the balcony, so you can't open the balcony door without a family of bumble bees flying in.\n*  George at valet is one of the most rude people I've ever met.  \n*  Fridge in our room sounds like a mini helicopter, so we have to unplug it to sleep.\n*  Ice machine in front of our room has been broken, so it makes a roaring noise which could be heard down the hall.  We called down to the front desk and their advice was to unplug the machine.  \n*  Housekeeping did not refill our water or even wash our coffee cups. \n*  Free highspeed internet was unreliable and slower than dial-up.  I ended up using my own portable Wi-Fi.  \n\nFor only a 3 year old resort, there is so much wear and tear already that makes it look old and tacky.\n\nAs for the meeting rooms.  I went on a tour and will not be booking with them.\n\nYou have to walk through the casino to get to the meeting rooms.  This would be ok, except for the smell of cigarettes throughout the casino.  No corporate polcy would want their meeting planners to have their attendees risk lung cancer to walk to their meetings.  \n\nNever again.  Not worth the price.  Maybe for $79...and even then...probably not.  No thank you.  And definately NOT for the business traveler.  From the rooms to Valet is about a 5-8 minute walk.
