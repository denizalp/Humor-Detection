I get from prior reviewers that the Happy Hour specials are what the 4th star, essentially, is for - otherwise it'd be a solid 3. \n\nI basically agree but ... I'm a sushi [ngiri] fan, and I find those prices to be very reasonable and the quality to be good. On the other hand, I've had much better salmon skin hand rolls in over half the sushi bars around the country I've ordered them -- I won't try them again here - they weren't crisped well enough for me and didn't have that lovely dressing so many good bars include inside. \n\nI'm very happy with the dragon roll, shrimp tempura roll and spicy tuna roll - but only at the happy hour price. I wouldn't be caught dead paying suggested retail for them. \n\nI quite liked the unfiltered sake. \n\nThe decor was interesting. I loved entering by walking on a fish pond! Service was prompt, knowledgeable and friendly.
