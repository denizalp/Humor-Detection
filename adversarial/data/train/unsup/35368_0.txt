I love the burgers here, especially when I do a no carb diet! I love the juicy burgers and you can order whatever size you like! They also have a bison, which I love! The milkshakes are out of this world and the other desserts are yummy too. The service isn't always the greatest but its not that bad to make me not want to come back.
