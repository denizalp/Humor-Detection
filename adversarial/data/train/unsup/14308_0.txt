I had a fantastic piece of red velvet cake from here the other day! I love the store and the unique selection of items. While it is a little pricey, the quality and taste is amazing. I have also had their english muffins and highly recommend you grab some for home! So glad yelp introduced me to this place. I will be back to try more goodies and some pizza. The girl at the service counter was very nice and quick in getting our order.
