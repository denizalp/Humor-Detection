Chef of the Century. Enough said.\n\nHighlights of my meal:\nBread cart - Yes, I asked for one of everything. \nSweets cart - Yes, I also tried to ask for one of everything. I probably ate half the cart. \nSabayon - The best dessert I have had in a while. \n\nThe meal was fantastic. I can't think of any negatives to point out other than the fact that we were seated in the garden rather than the main dining room. The garden itself was still neat. It had a wall of living plants. \n\nI can't wait to try the Atelier next time I am in town.
