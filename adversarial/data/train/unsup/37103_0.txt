I called and made a reservation on graduation night for HHS, and they said \"No Problem!\"  Even though the place wasn't packed, they had a place for six all ready for us when we arrived 10 minutes early.  We got extra-special attention from the owner and the waiter!  I love this place!\n\nI have eaten lunch and dinner here about 3 times each, and everything on the menu is excellent!  The pork Souvlaki (grilled pork on skewers) was excellent, the gyro meat is always tasty and lean, and the chicken dinner is \"to-die-for\".  There's this mustard-like sauce that is so tasty, and not overwheming.  And, the chicken is so moist!\n\nI hope more people eat here regularly, as I want this excellent restaurant to last in this location!
