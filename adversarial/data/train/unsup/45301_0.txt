I've only been shopping with them for a relatively short time, but I think i like REI. And I think I don't like this particular location too much. The store itself is fine. It has a decent selection, and decent-enough prices. My problems have been in the form of service. Now, sometimes I go in and I'm instantly being helped by someone friendly and knowledgeable - instances like this are why I'm now a member. But it seems more often than not, I'm standing around waiting for an employee. Sure, sometimes they're really busy; a wait makes sense then. But what about all those times when there are 2 customers in the store and I'm still left standing there for 10 minutes, inexplicably. I also feel that the treatment I had when I brought in some gloves to return was not a representation of the service promised on the back of the receipt, but that's an extremely small sample size, so who knows. \n\nRegardless, I'm not sure where else I'd go. Places like Big 5 are even worse, and often don't carry the same level of gear as REI. The internet is no help when you're going camping tomorrow and you find that you need a new tent. So, for now, REI is still it, but I wish they'd tighten their game up.
