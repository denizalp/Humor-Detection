I saw a man pick up a Slyman's sandwich too fast and the shift of weight made him so top heavy he tipped right off his chair and onto the floor. Despite his recent plunge, the man laid on his back, clearly enjoying his sandwich. OK! OK! That didn't happen, but if you've been, one could certainly imagine. \n\nWhen you walk into Slyman's, it's evident they've been around for a while. I sorta feel like I'm in the 70's. That's a good thing by the way. You get that feeling that not a lot has changed inside here. Their also clearly popular, as there's a flow of people coming in and out of here and there's either a line by the counter and majority of the tables are full. \n\nThe food is quite simple. Corned Beef or Pastrami is the way to go, but I want to try their Roast Beef next time I visit. You can enjoy these gigantic sandwiches in a multitude of ways, share with a friend, tear it all up if your hungry, or even separate the bread immediately and bring the components of the sandwich home with you. \n\nThe sandwiches are delicious. They've even got breakfast that I'd be interested in giving a shot. On my last visit, the service was superb. Greeted nicely, our server was funny and provided just the right amount of conversation. \n\nSlyman's offers up some of the biggest and tastiest sandwiches in the Cleve.
