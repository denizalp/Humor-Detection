To make this review a little easier, I'll break the day and night club up.\n\nNightclub:\n\nIt's not the greatest nighclub on the strip but its decent. They have a pool that looks pretty but nothing like XS. It's really hard to get a drink at the bar. The dance floor is kind of strange and hard to find a place to boogie. Not very memorable and got really uncomfortably crowded that the group just ended up bouncing.\n\nDayclub:\n\nI'm a fan! It really helps to be on the guestlist or just know someone who can help get you in.  If not, get there EARLY because the line gets RIDICULOUS after 11AM. Luckily for my group, we've been able to get in pretty easily and avoid the long wait. There are places along the edge of the pool to park your bikini bottoms down (or trunks...or speedos...) and hang out. The pool feels amazing in the blazing heat. It's very easy to get drinks (~$10) and they open the inside of the club so you don't have to be stuck melting outside. Bartenders are sexy and super friendly. They were also selling poolside popsicles that we dipped and broke into our drinks and made vodka smoothies with.\n\nOK STORY TIME!\n\nWe found a great spot to hang out (near the waterfall under the shade) and got ourselves situated, unaware of the sex show that was about to commence behind us on the cabana. Why there were some butter faced girls humping each other and purposely exposing their tatas was beyond me, but I'll bet it began with TE and ended with KILLA. But hey, maybe you'll get lucky next time and run into these girls.\n\nThe end.
