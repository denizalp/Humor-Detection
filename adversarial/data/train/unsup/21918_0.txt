I've tried this place 3 times for delivery. Pizza is 20% more expensive than any of the other local options. Crust has been hard as a rock each time... And I hate to say this, but the pizza is just average. \n\nAlso a $3 \"delivery\" fee that doesn't go to the driver. Sorry My Slice of Pie; 3 strikes, you're out.
