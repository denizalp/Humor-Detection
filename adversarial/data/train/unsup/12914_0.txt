Greeted as you walk through the door.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  They'll point you in the right direction, answer any questions and then leave you alone and not bug you unless you ask. \n\nSeems like a fairly new building.  The place is very clean and neat inside.  It's well stocked with many health supplement related options.  The sale prices are competitive with what you might find elsewhere. \n\nNice easy parking lot in front which is always a plus.
