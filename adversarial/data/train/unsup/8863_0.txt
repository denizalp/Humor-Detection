This is a wonderful restaurant for just about any special occasion. I dined here recently with a large group and we were fortunate enough to have the back private room reserved for our dinner. The wine was a-plenty and flowing upon arrival! I felt bad for the staff because initially we came in all at once (just about) and they seemed a little overwhelmed. Drinks from the bar took a little while but I don't blame them because a) the size of our group b) it was happy hour\/dinner time. \n\nThe pre-selected white wine was delicious and paired well with our family-style meal. Appetizers included the house cauliflower (to die for!), insalata di casa, and an amazing charcuterie board. Our main course plates were gigli, short rib, scallops, and chicken, of which the scallops and chicken I think were the best-liked in our group and for myself. The polenta was so delicious that they brought more bowls of it. There were other sides, but not as memorable. We had a chef's selection for dessert and I'm glad I picked the panna cotta - you cannot go wrong with that at an Italian-inspired restaurant. \n\nMy hat's off to the chef for creating an inspiring menu and for the team at Fat Ox for a great evening!
