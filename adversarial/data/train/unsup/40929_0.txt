our a\/c went out, we called our appliance insurance company and they sent out a company called Doctor Cool. the tech named Jamie was wonderful & actually the people who answered the phone were very pleasant also! Jamie gave exceptional service and was very friendly and pleasant to deal with! we highly recomend this company!
