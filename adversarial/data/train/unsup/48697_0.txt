Bubble tea is a particular things for those who like it. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes down to it and I really go hard on when places mess it up.\n\nCoco doesn't fall under this category though. I had a semi complex order and they executed it well. I held off giving it 5 stars because I don't give those lightly and the tapioca all stuck together so it was hard to drink at times.\n\nThe service was great and they churned out the drinks we orders fast enough. I really liked it here and I will come back again soon. Always good to know where a good Bubble Tea place is in the city. This is one of them.
