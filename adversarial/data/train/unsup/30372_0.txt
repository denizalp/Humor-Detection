Today was my first time to Scottsdale, AZ. We had the intention to go up and have lunch and do a little shopping. We stayed along the main drag and just saw it and figured it was going to be good since there were many people eating outside. We decided to also sit outside in the warm sunny weather. I ordered a simple cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. It was AMAZING. My cousin ordered their buffalo chicken sandwich which also looked pretty tempting to order. We laughed as a few leaves and twigs from the trees above but the service was great, quick and friendly. I would definitely go back again when in town visiting.  Can't complain about this bar & grill.
