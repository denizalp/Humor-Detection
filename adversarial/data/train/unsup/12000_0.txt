If Budweiser is the self proclaim king of beer, well Bad Beat Brewing is the new Badass Beer! \n\nLas Vegas is full of unique start ups that have gone gangbusters Rollin' Smoke, Art Of Flavors and now Bad Beat Brewing is the next big up and coming business that is a must.\n\nLocated along Eastgate Rd in Henderson's new Booze District. It's a few doors down from Las Vegas Distillery and quite close to many of the major car yards.\n\nWalking in you'll find a great relaxed atmosphere with plenty of high top seating at the bar, tables and chairs for groups and a massive bean bag to kick back on while playing the first generation Nintendo. Darts and shuffleboard are also offered to challenge your mates.\n\nThe Big surprise to this business is out the back, and the window to see where all the beer to made. This is awesome! A must see.\n\n\nBad Beat has a great selection of beers that are bold and exciting to truly entertain your taste buds. I enjoyed a awesome flight that had\nThe Daily Grind - Pale Ale\nAce in the Hole - Basil Pale Ale\nAnte Up - Amber Ale\nHoppy Times - IPA\nGunshot - Dry Irish Stout\n\nI recommend joining the \"High Rollers Club\" with a custom growler to fill up and take home every time you swing by. Great service and great new beers Las Vegas can be proud of, every Yelper needs to get down to Bad Beat Brewing!!\n\nOverall\nDrink: 5-5\nCleanliness: 5-5\nService: 5-5\nComing back: Oh yeah
