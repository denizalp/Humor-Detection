I stopped by this restaurant with a group of my friends who recommended this place.  The restaurant itself was dimly lit (very romantic) and classy looking.  We started off with a bottle of wine and the service was great!  The appetizers were decent.  The calamari was crisp and not too soggy or fried tasting.  Someone ordered the cut roll (California roll?) and it was okay.  I think this just wasn't the place for cut rolls.  But when dinner came, everything looked yummy.  The Butterfish seemed to be a big hit.  All their fish was moist and tender!  And you must save room for their molten lava cake!  I agree with everyone else...it's that good!! Definitely enough to share amongst 2 or 3 people.\n\nOverall this was a great place to have a fancier dinner with someone.  The service and ambiance was nice.  It is a little pricey, but you'd probably know that if you chose to eat at a place like this ;)
