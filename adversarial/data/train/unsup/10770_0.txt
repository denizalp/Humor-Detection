OMG....WHAT A BIG MISTAKE. \nWe sat at  dining room last night  we just order two main courses..... a capital offense or for the Server is that all you guys having in a very sarcastic way\n and then the person disappear totally forgot about us \ndidn't forget he  or she was avoiding us all night even send some else to give us the tap luckily the support staff was there by the way I was there a few weeks ago i sat at the bar by myself fine good service  by the bartender even he is a character. But I will be the same way it will be on his position no time to babysit idiots servers didn't even know what a Manhattan is keep it up. Joe you might be the reason if I return to the place. he would go four  starts .\nOh thevserver name I forgot it is not important even when I cannot tell if she or he that's the most accurate description I can give. The food was nice and hot the table was marked properly by the support staff oh yeah I know my business that's why I know exactly when a server don't give a s*** about what customers.......
