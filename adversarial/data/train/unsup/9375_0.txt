Small very average sushi restaurant that also offers some other Asian Foods. We tried a variety of sushi and some were better than others. The non-traditional Fire Roll was the best of what we tried. The day we were here the rice wasn't too sticky and much of the sushi fell apart.\n\n We also tried the Korean Fried Chicken. It looked very good when they brought it out but when we went to eat it the chicken inside was almost cold and was dry and chewy. I wouldn't recommend getting the Korean Fried Chicken here.\n\nService was average......\n\n2.5 stars
