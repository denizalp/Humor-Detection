This review is for the Cholla Trail which is the entry from the east.  I appreciate everyone's tips about parking on the road, it was easy to find a spot about 8:30 on a weekday morning.  I think there is some turnover in parking as you have some hikers that made the trek early and are leaving.  \n\nThis is a strenuous hike, you need some tennis or hiking shoes and you will be using your hands to climb a few rock formations.  Don't simply think there is a walking path to the summit.  I laughed as I was coming down and there were a couple fellas in their street shoes that looked liked they had skipped their meeting session at the Phoenician thinking they'd take a quick hike up the mountain!  On my descent there was a fella that had slipped off the trail and Fire and Rescue were on the way up to check him out, ended up being helipad removal off the mountain.\n\nWell worth the trek.  The view from the top is terrific and you feel like you earned it.  Hope to get back up there again and maybe try the Echo Canyon start side.
