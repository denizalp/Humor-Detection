The rooms have been remodeled and are very nice. The service was good as well. I gave it 3 stars because of two things. They have a resort fee of $19 per night to cover Internet, canoes, and kayaks.  Too me that's a joke to charge for this plus the fact that Expedia stated that I have free internet! When I asked them about this they said the charge is in addition to Internet. They didn't credit it me anything. The second reason is there are no safes in the rooms. You have to go to the front desk to get a safety deposit box. Sorry but for the price of the rooms I would have liked a safe in the rooms especially after a remodel. Beds were nice and the pool area is nice with a heated pool. No hot tub though.
