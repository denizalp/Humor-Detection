If you're looking for a pork alternative, this place is nice with all chicken- based broth. Of course, the flavor is different but for those that crave a healthier version of noodles and broth, here ya go! The service was prompt, informative and friendly too! The only minor change is perhaps less scallions (they do add to the more subtle chicken flavor) but you can always take them off if you don't require as many.
