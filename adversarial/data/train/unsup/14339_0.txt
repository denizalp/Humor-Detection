Came here at around 6:00pm and it was completely empty.\n\nThe waitress told us to sit on the tall chairs but my friend and I wanted to sit on the couch. She told us that we might have to move later to the tall chairs because there might be more people.\nI was like, really? Are you kidding me, we're literally the only ones here. \n\nAnd we were the only ones for the hour that we've spent there LOL\n\nWe sat on the couches anyways and we ordered the matcha latte and frapp√©, a sea salt caramel macaron and the layered red velvet cake!\n\nFood and drinks were ok but overpriced! It was over $8 for a slice of cake ;-; *cries*\nWell since there is a $8 minimum charge per person I guess it kind of works out.\n\nWanted to try their character macaroons but unfortunately they didn't have any *cries again*\n\nCake was good but the matcha latte wasn't rich enough. Tasted like water mixed with powder :$ \n\nService was kind of bad in general because most of the time the waitresses were just chatting with each other and weren't even paying attention to customers. We raised our hands for awhile but the waitresses didn't seem to notice until we called them over.\n\nOverall, I guess this is a nice place to chill at with friends during tea time but I don't think that I would come again just because there are better alternatives out there.
