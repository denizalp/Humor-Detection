The Good:  I don't think that there are such thing as a bad burger, you know like a pizza.  I love 5 guys burger and fries and the famous In-N-Out, so I was already to write this place off.  Their sign looks like a GameStop, no sure if they are going for the geek crowd.  They have a few speciality burgers or you can design your own.  I went with the Sin City Burger, Fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun, but being from California I added avocado.  I also order a side of their smashfries, tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  So good, the egg bun is soft and the flavor of the meat has some special seasonings.  Overall, a great burger, but I hope I can get the Sin City burger at the other locations too.\n\nThe Bad:  Why has it taken me so long to try this.  I thought they were only in Las Vegas but I just found out they are in San Diego also, when with they be in the OC?\n\nThe Ben:  The guy at the counter asked if this was my first time here.  I said \"why yes it is\", then he gave me the total.  I asked \"do I got something for my first time here\" he said \"nope, I just have to ask that\".  This place is now added to my must eat list when in Las Vegas.
