We were just passing through Las Vegas (not wanting to spend a night on the strip), so the hubby booked us into this hotel. Our room was on the third floor with an outside entrance, a good distance from the casino and the noise of the street. \n\nOther than the carpet feeling a little gritty, this was an A-OK place to spend a night, especially for the price ($48). The bathroom was clean and the bed linens felt freshly washed. We parked the car in a spot that had a light overhead and a view of it from our room. \n\nThe bottom of the door had a crack to let in a draft but didn't let anything else in (critter-wise), which I didn't really expect being on the third floor. There was an elevator (stifling hot inside) that was handy to bring up the suitcases.\n\nFree wi-fi worked fine and the location of the hotel was a plus for getting on the freeway heading to Phoenix the next day.
