I've been here a few time and I enjoy the food.. Usually I give more stars but the customer service here was awful. I don't expect much from a waiter but our server Brian did a terrible job. He became agitated and upset when I asked him if they could possible remake some eggs I ordered that had onions in them. He replied, \"it's clearly written on the menu!\" Then he grabbed my entire plate and once it was return the biscuit was missing. He never once checked on us to see how we were doing and we had to track him down twice through other waiters to get his attention. We were the only African- Americans in the restaurant so I don't know if that played any role, but I definitely won't be coming back.. I left a note.. No tip do to bad service and I'm a generous tipper who doesn't write reviews.. So what does that tell you.. Do better brian
