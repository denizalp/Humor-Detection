We have seen a lot of magic shows. We were looking for a show while in Vegas, and thought we would try this one. It was a Monday night and this was the only show running. This is NOT the same show as in Australia, although 1 of them is Australian. It is a about an hour + 20 minute show with 4 people. Each kind of does his own thing, they do work together on some illusions. It is pretty basic stuff, most of which we have seen. One of them specializes in gross out type stuff, sword swallowing, cutting off his tongue, blowing stuff out his eyeball, didn't really care at all for that. The theater was about 1\/3 full. The tickets are inexpensive by magic standards. If it's comped to you, you might like it better. The magic on AGT is way better and done in minutes. My advice is if you can only see one magic show in Vegas, go to a different show. It might cost you double to get see Copperfield or whoever, but they put on better shows! You get what you pay for. BTW...notice the 5 star rave reviews? Notice they ALL have a VERY low review total?  Does that tell you something??? Definitely NOT good for families or young kids...
