I heard this club was supposed to be hot shit cause it was the newest club in Vegas.  The funny thing is hot shit can be interpreted a lot of different ways.  It could be exceptionally good, or it could be a steaming pile of, well, shit.  Unfortunately LAX refers to the latter.\n\nEvery club in Las Vegas has a theme.  For LAX, this club is meant to look something like a gothic theater, red curtains hang from the walls and candle-lit chandeliers hang from the ceiling.  The only cool thing about this theme are the balcony booths that double as private tables where you can get table service, have your own private place to party, and have a view of the mass of sweat and makeup in the mosh pit of a dance floor down below.\n\nThat said, in the event that I do throw a party in Vegas, I wouldn't mind reserving a booth here.  In any other event, I'd rather throw my money on a black jack table.  At least there, the girls serve you free drinks, and I have a chance at winning some of my money back, you know?
