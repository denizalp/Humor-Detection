Decided to stop by on my lunch break with some co-workers. I have never been here before, but I heard good things. -\nAnd those good things were right! It's a nice small sushi place with a great set of staff members. Very kind and helpful when ordering.\nI ordered one of their specials, the pokebowl, with raw salmon and it was very delicious! I recommend it with avocado!
