Pure Foot & Spa is the best!! I originally started going to the Spring Mountain location when I did live in Vegas and the foot massages have always been magnificent. I recently tried out the new location and my experience was none the less just as great! This new location has way more comfortable massage chairs that can be tilted for better relaxation.  The owner Angel is very nice and adds a nice touch to the whole experience. She makes sure that you are comfortable and is also very personable. I would recommend this place to all my friends. Can't wait till the next foot massage!
