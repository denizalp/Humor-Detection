I showed up to find out they canceled my appointment.  They blah-blahed about their policy, and it sort of made sense... but still... wasn't happy about waiting 8 hours at work and a 30 min. commute to find out that I can't get a massage from them just because they tried to contact me, when I was not at home but at work, to confirm.  What insults my intelligence even more is how easily they kiss off $100 and a potential repeat customer.  I went to Massage Envy.
