I needed to rent tables and chairs for a party, and turned to Yelp to see who are the people in your neighborhood. Andrews stood out from the rest of the pack, and I called them. Evelyn was a peach to work with, couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Evelyn gave me ideas on how to save money and achieve the look I wanted.\n\nThe prices were great, and their website has all the prices listed, unlike other places where God only knows what it costs to rent a plastic chair? You can pretty much do all your business online then you get a confirmation.\n\nI highly recommend Andrews Party Rental, and I sincerely hope to find an excuse to rent a cotton candy machine in the near future!
