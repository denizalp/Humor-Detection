their crêpes are alright they're hard to chew on a little bit and hard to cut in half.. I asked the worker before if ice cream goes on the crêpe she said yes but lied to me because there was no ice cream on my crêpe. Now their smoothies are good they just need to blend more because I did taste a few chunks.
