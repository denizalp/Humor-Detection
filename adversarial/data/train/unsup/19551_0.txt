If I could give 0.5 or 0 stars I would.\n\nFirst of all, the place is not really a Japanese place. You know from the furniture, decoration and the music they place. It is a Chinese restaurant that also serves some sushi and Thai menu. I think Toronto and Etobicoke now has abundance of international cuisine that is AUTHENTIC. I'm surprised this place has decent reviews - maybe the other clients have not tried real sushi in the area.\n\nThe sushi and rolls Conmbo for lunch was TERRIBLE with dried rice. Specially The roll was so roughly done. The sushi nigiri has fish that was till frozen. The miso soup comes in a tiny dish that they use to HOLD the Chinese spoons. The salad that comes with the lunch combo is full of withered vegetables that I did not touch.\n\nThe tempura was Yellow with very low quality vegetable.\n\nThe ginger is full of some chemical taste, didn't touch.\n\nIf you have any experience eating sushi you will agree with this review but hopefully I have just saved you from wasting money and having a bad taste in your mouth after.
