If i could leave 0 stars i would.. i've given the place a chance time and time again through ownership changes and continue to be disappointed. Don't waste your time or money with this place. 80% of the time their spray tan is out of solution or down. ..and if you are dumb enough to join id call first if you want to utilize the spray tan.\n\nIn addition, there isn't a locker room or group classes at this location.. you're better off at lvac
