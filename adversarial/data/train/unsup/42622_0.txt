Ok our first time there it took us 30 mins to get our order line was so long...we had to wait a long time..2nd time line was shorter able to taste their mangonadas,watermelon drink,chilotes,popcorn chicken,chicken wings,and cucumber drinks...everything was good...but the 3rd time my only issue was ut smelled so bad there like the parmesan cheese smell..i came out smelling like i was bathe on a parmesan bath...lol also the person making the drinks and serving it,was the cashier they also need to do cleaning which i did not like they touched the rugs and clean tables and counters with wet soaked rugs...i hope they separate people doing floor,maintaing tables and counter etc.they need to have organization it was so chaotic...cashier should stay as cashier cause they were touching money that is very dirty...we need cleanliness and orderliness but also a big vent or air purifier that will make the place smell appetizing not disgusting...i like parmesan cheese but too much is not good...
