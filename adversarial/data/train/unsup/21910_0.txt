First and foremost my clothes weren't clean. I use other dry cleaners once a week and I noticed with Smart cleaners that there was still dirt inside my collar and on my cuffs. When I brought this to the attention of the owner (after my clothes were already two days late) he became defensive stating that this was a stain. One trip to a different dry cleaners down the street and these \"stains\" were somehow resolved. \nTerrible service. Terrible cleaning. I strongly advise against using their service.
