What is going on here?  This place has great pizza and should be packed!  Okay, it is not gourmet wood fired or coal fired pizza, blah blah blah.  It is great & affordable extremely tasty pizza.  \n\nIt is a little hard to find, but worth the venture.  Buon Padre has occupied the old Venezias location at Pecos & McQueen (Behind McDonalds, next to KTR).\n\nPlease support these awesome small business owners!  I don't want to lose my new pizza fix!\n\nSorry to all my other regular take-out joints, Buon Padre is my new Go-to!
