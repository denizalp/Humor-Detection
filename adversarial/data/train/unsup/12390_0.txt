If I could give this place no stars I would.  Worst Mexican food I've ever had.  While ordering a carne asada burrito I asked what came on it... apparently only carne asada and pico... had to add guacamole.  The place seemed busy but now I have no clue why... the burrito was as small as a taco bell burrito and honestly taco bell tastes better!  The carne asada was dry and over seasoned and had a very small spoonful of guacamole and I got charged 90Â¢ for it.  Ridiculous.  I was still hungry after and that's never the case at real Mexican taco shops. I'll never go back.  I may be spoiled on San Diego taco shops but even Filbertos is a gazillion times better than this place... what a joke.  Oh I forgot to mention how annoying the lady was calling out orders... I'm disabled so it takes me longer than 3 seconds to walk up to pick up my tray she just kept yelling my order number out.  I don't understand why this place has so many good reviews.. these people obviously don't know what good Mexican food is.
