Pleasantly surprised! We got the Groupon and tried it for dinner. The food was excellent.. Each roll came in 8 pieces. My favorite was the tempura asparagus (of all things), and the fruit roll was pretty cool.  If it was cheaper, I'm sure I'd eat here all the time.  Also, the cashier wasn't particularly enthusiastic or friendly, but the folks up front making sushi were fun and chatty.\nI like atmosphere, and the self-serve aspect. It's still cheaper than House of Hunan when you keep in mind you don't have to tip on dine in.  I hope they're able to get faster service down the line.\nI'll be back in soon, for sure!
