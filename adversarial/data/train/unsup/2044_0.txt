Amazing!!  A *best ever* for us....\n\nSimple perfection, the menu includes many types of fish, pies and Brit items.\n\nWhile the summer rain fell outside, we opted for the Cod and Chips, and the Tandoori  Shrimp to share.\n\nThis was the right amount of food for two....\n\nCod and Chips...melt in your mouth fish, phenomenal crust, cooked just right.  Chips were not from the freezer....yum!!\n\nTandoori Shrimp....warm mild flavor, so good!!\n\nOur last dining experience in beautiful Montreal was without a doubt my favorite!
