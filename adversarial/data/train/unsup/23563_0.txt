This is really a zero star review.  I received flowers from my husband through this company (also known as city wide flower center).  They delivered a card which clearly had the item, lavender dreams, stated on the front.  Instead, I received a bouquet of red roses...probably would be fine for most people except that I dislike red roses.  Knowing that my husband is smart enough to know that, I called 1-800-flowers.  They verified that indeed this florist sent the wrong flowers and they stated they would have the florist redeliver the next day. Come the next day, no flowers.  I called the florist and she relayed she did not receive a notice from 1-800-flowers even though I verified with 1-800-flowers that they transmitted the message to her.  The lady I spoke to, Lisa, was extremely rude.  She didn't bother to apologize and made it seem like I was inconveniencing her by calling the number listed.  I mean it does say call if you have any questions or comments....  Anyways, bottom line Lisa said she could deliver the next day...but unfortunately I wouldn't even be home to receive them.  I called 1-800-flowers again to lodge a complaint regarding this florist.  They tried contacting her but she would not even pick up.  Even though she picked up the phone 2 minutes earlier when I called.  Bottom line, Lisa needs to work on her customer service skills.  Go with a local florist and not the big corporations.
