Get here early as they do sell out and there will be a line. With that out of the way, this is hands down the best BBQ in the valley. Moist smoked brisket is exceptional, and the love and dedication to their craft shows through with each cut of meat. This is destined to become a valley legend, and its accolades are well deserved.
