Avoid this place if you can! Now if you are like me and have a Ducati and live in Charlotte then you have little choices for warranty repair. I took my bike in a few months ago for routine service and a warranty repair for a factory part. The service took a few days longer than promised and it was stated that they had a tech out sick (I gave them the benefit of the doubt).\n\nAfter being in the shop two days longer than expected and being told they could not get the warranty factory part, I went to pick up the bike. This is my pride and joy and it has never been in the rain nor stored outdoors, to my shock there sat my bike out in the rain and from the dirt on it, I could tell it had been sitting out there for some time. This is even after I asked they keep it indoors.\n\nI spent over $1500 on the service, which I didn't mind as that is what I expected with owning a Ducati. The real problem with this whole experience is that the factory part they could not find. They said they would keep working with Ducati and call me back when the part comes in, well here I sit 4 months later and not a single phone call, e-mail, text, nada, nothing.\n\nSorry for the long review, but as you can tell I am pissed at this place and their customer service is horrible!!!! \n\nI am trying to help out someone else out who might be considering get their bike serviced here when they may have a choice to go somewhere else, do that stay away from this motorcycle dealer!!
