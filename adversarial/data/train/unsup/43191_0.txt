It is really easy to mess up healthy fresh dishes, but this Pita Jungle gets it right every time! I've never had a bad or cold meal here, when I do take out it's quick and easy, an over all great choice for a healthy lunch or dinner and a great space to hang out with friends, especially if your friends are like me and mine, it caters to all types of dietary restrictions, truly a great place with great food! I highly recommend the Chipotle Black Bean Burger for my fellow vegetarians!
