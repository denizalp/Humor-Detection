This has to be my favorite spot for a steak sandwich. I used to go here a lot back in the day to get their steak sandwich. I don't remember it being this good. For $10 you get a sold NY steak on a hogi roll with lettuce and tomatoes. You can either get it with fries or chips. I opt for the chips and soak both the steak sandwich and chips with tobasco. The quality of the steak is outstanding. Cooked at medium, gives you a solid New York steak sandwich with the perfect amount of grizzle. The steak sandwich is just one of the many good things on the menu. Deep dish pizzas, burgers, open face prime rib sandwiches, and their onion rings are some of my favorites. \n\nLocated in the good ole downtown area. Wear your neutral colors. JK.
