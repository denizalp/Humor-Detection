The staff here are fake-nice and you soon realize why: they are very very interested in fleecing all the money out of you that they can. Not only did they charge me a prohibitive amount on my first visit, but they worked out a plan for a second visit for very minor problems that they made me feel uneasy about and the bill for that plan amounted to over $400!!! \n\nI bailed out of there and trekked to downtown to go to my regular and awesome dentist Dr. Hasmig Ayancian on King and Yonge and was exceedingly well-cared for by her office. She gave her opinion that my teeth were fine and would continue to be fine with a bit more care at home. No $400 bill, no hassle, and no dark pronouncements about the state of my gums.\n\nTo date, York Lanes Dental Office continues to call me for a second appointment and leaves voice messages that say stuff like \"this is an important call and Dr. So-and-so would like to discuss your dental health.\" They are awfully quick with the scare tactics.
