After my dad was admitted to the hospital, I had the pleasure of meeting and talking to Kara, the head nurse.\n\nOut of 50 nurses, I can count on one hand the nurses who can identify Hypothyroidism and what to do about it.\n\nShe took the time to talk with my dad and explain the test results that showed his Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) reading was about HALF of what it should be.\n\nThe doctor put my dad on Synthroid, which is a CHEMICAL and NOT natural Thyroid drug, but at least they identified the MAJOR reason he was admitted to the hospital in the first place. He will be switching to NATURE Thyroid once he gets out and can see his NATUROPATHIC doctor.\n\nP.S. Anyone admitted to this ward should check their body temperature, If it's below 98.6 then you have Hypothyroidism. \n\nAsk the staff to do a FULL BLOOD TEST  for Hypothyroidism. \n\nTSH\nT3\nT4\nReverse T3
