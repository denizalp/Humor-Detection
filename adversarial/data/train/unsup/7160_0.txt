If you're here during your lunch breaks like me, forget the food court. Sausages and cured meats at TJ meats is where its at - cheap quick and you don't gotta look for a Canadian tire for the street meat. The mall sucks, floor plan is ridiculous. Why would anyone create a mall that doesn't end where the beginning starts? You walk all the way down but all that is there to surprise you is a dead end. But hey, $5 passport photos at the convenience store, who knew right? You're welcome.
