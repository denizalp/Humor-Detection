719 people have written before me. And it still has 5 stars. And I'm going to give it 5 more stars. The wait is long, but it is worth it. You know how much it is worth it? We drove 3 hours from Sierra Vista to try this place and we DO NOT REGRET THAT DRIVE. This was worth the drive. The wait is long. We got there at 10:15 and walked in the door at 1200 exact. IT IS WORTH THE WAIT.
