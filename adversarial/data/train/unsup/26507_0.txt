Very fun way to kill some time while having fun with friends.  If you don't go with a large group, it can get expensive.  You pay by the hour, so the more people that can split the cost, the cheaper it will be.  You do not need to be good at golf to enjoy.  In fact, I'm a decent golfer and I feel I am at a disadvantage because I try to go for the further targets while my friends who have never golfed just aim for the closest targets.  We always have a great time when we go.  Food and drinks are very good, but are a little too expensive.
