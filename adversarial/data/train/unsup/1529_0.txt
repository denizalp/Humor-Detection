I've heard and read so much about the Yonge and Lawrence location, I just had to try the place out now that it's just down the road from home. \n\nMy initial thought, wow, this place was busy, then I realized the line was for people waiting, but ordered already. There wasn't much in the way of seating either. \n\nI tried the California burger, the kids shared a cheeseburger, and each had a juice, and the wife also had a cheeseburger and we shared a can of pop and all shared an order of fries, for $40, which is on the high side, especially when you see the size. To say the least I left hungry. \n\nThe seating is extremely cramped, and poorly laid out, get your meal to go!\n\nI'll give them the interesting burger ideas and the burger did taste great. I heard a guy describe it as \"mother's milk\", I don't even want to know what that means. I'd be willing to come back for take out, if they ever increase the size of their burgers.
