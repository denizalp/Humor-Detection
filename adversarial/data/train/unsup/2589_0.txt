When I was told that Cartwrights serves 'game meats', I was worried that it would be the type of place where I would need to avoid making eye contact with taxidermied animal heads mounted on the walls. To my relief, there was neither a buffalo nor elk head in sight to gaze at me accusingly. Instead, the interior reminded me of a rustic and comfortable yet upscale ranch house. I especially liked the ambiance added by the fireplaces within each room. Although they were not lit (hey, it is summer in AZ) I can imagine how welcoming they would be on a chilly evening. \n\nOh, the menu! It had a little bit of everything - seafood, steaks & game, poultry & pasta. It was hard to decide what to choose, since so many things looked good. I went with the salmon prepared Mediterranean style. Wise decision! It was beautiful - pan-roasted with artichokes, leeks, garlic, roasted tomato & spinach, atop pesto-tossed angel hair pasta. Almost too pretty to eat. Almost. My friend, more adventurous than I am, chose the buffalo tenderloin. Prepared medium-rare, it came with wild mushrooms and a peppercorn sauce that was beyond good. I had never tried buffalo, and was pleasantly surprised by both the texture and taste. Of course, my positive opinion could have been influenced somewhat by the mini-cauldron of mac & pepper-jack cheese... \n\nThe wine list is impressive, with a wide selection of all things good that come from grapes. I have been on an AZ wine run lately, and chose the AZ Stronghold Nachise (a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Petite Sirah). My friend went with the Rutherford Ranch cab (great with the buffalo!), and we were both happy. \n\nWhat a nice way to spend an evening meal. Our server was outstanding - attentive but not overbearing and very knowledgeable too. \n\nI already know what I want to try next - filet mignon and the S'Mores dessert are calling to me!
