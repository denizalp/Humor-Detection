Much of old town is the same, dark room music lame drinks and 30k millionairess douche`s. I f you can not tell I am so over that scene. However Kellys breaks the mold. It has a nice patio and real cocktails that make use of some unique components. \n\nI was a bit disappointed that my drink came in a glass rather than the copper mug listed on the menu but the Moscow mule was tasty and at $13 it should be.\n\nMusic outside was audible but not too loud and the lighting was decent.
