Ok definitely the worst restaurant I have been to in Scottsdale!!!  The service is slow!!!! They messed up every single item we ordered. The restaurant had a terrible draft and the food was mediocre. \nI would never ever go here again!  Many better options for Mediterranean food in Scottsdale. A definite add to the must miss list. Blech.
