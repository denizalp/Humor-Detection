This place is great. The food is Northern Chinese similar to Chinese Muslim food. They have a great variety for reasonable prices. Also, everything is freshly prepared and you can even see them make the dumplings and pork pie behind a glass window.\nWe got the stir fry spinach (bok choy) with garlic, sesame bread, pork and napa cabbage dumplings, pork pie and green onion pancakes. I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27. Not to shabby! the spinach and garlic was really fresh and flavorful. The bread was decent, almost like a dense curried bread. The pork dumplings were similar to soup dumplings, one of my most favorite dumplings ever. The pork pie was almost like a pork patty covered in dumpling dough and pan-fried. It was crunchy, moist, juicy and delicious all at the same time. We were getting full so we ended up only eating half of the green onion pancakes which were well prepared. We will definitely be making another trip back here soon.\n\nSide note: They sell bags of frozen\/take-home dumplings. About $10 for a bag of 40.
