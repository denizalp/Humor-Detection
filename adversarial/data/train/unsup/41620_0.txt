It's a great little theatre. They still put butter on your popcorn for you instead of making you do it, which is a nice touch. When I and my wife want to go see a movie on a weekend, when we know the theaters are going to be packed with people who don't know how to act right in a movie theatre, Phillips place is always our choice. Being in a ritzy part of town, it tends to not attract those who want to use phones, talk, and ruin the movie for everyone else. They don't have a ton of screens, but they get all the hit movies. Stadium seating and great loud volume on the sound. They also now check bags for weapons, which has sadly become necessary.
