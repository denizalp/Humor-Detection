I have to talk up The Venetian - they really a truly fabulous.\n\nI got married here at the waterfall between The Venetian and the Palazzo and had such a great experience. We bought the Waterfall Serenity package with no regrets. We had a really great wedding planner named Caroline. That woman is amazing. Seriously, how she deals with all us brides is beyond me. She was so nice, and took care of everything. I'm from North Dakota, so having someone deal with everything so I just had to be there was so much less stressful. \n\nWe had this really awesome accordion player who was so sweet, and made me laugh before the wedding when my nerves were fried. Our minister was also so nice, and funny as well! The whole thing was magical. Exactly how you would want your wedding to be. \n\nThen we stayed in the Prima Suite which was beyond our wildest fantasies. It had a huge living room and bar area which was perfect for the short wedding reception that we had after the ceremony, and a huge bedroom with lots of closet space. We had a dual-headed shower and a giant whirpool tub. My husband practically had to drag me home or I would have stayed there forever. \n\nThe one time they did mess up our keys, they ended up giving us a nice discount off the resort fees for our trouble which was really nice. \n\nI would definitely stay here again!
