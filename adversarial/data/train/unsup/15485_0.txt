There really isn't not much you can write about a small German bakery considering all they offer is German pastries and pretzels. Me and Ellen F. came here after a hearty breakfast next door and decided we weren't finished stuffing ourselves yet. \n\nWe've been here several times and we always get pretzels and pretzels rolls, they are to die for! These are some of the most authentic German pretzels I've had since I've been to Munich. They are cooked just right and have just enough salt on them that isn't too much. \n\nAlong with the pretzels I also get a Berliner which is equally awesome. Good amount of powdered sugar and not stingy on the filling, these are puffy so to me you get more bang for the buck so to say. \n\nThe lady that helped us is always friendly and courteous. She was extremely patient while I picked which Berliner I wanted from their glass display and rang us up promptly. If you like German pastries or snacks this is the spot to go to, there aren't to many in town.
