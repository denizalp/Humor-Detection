Very, very nice Vegas hotel.  Love the atmosphere, love the casino, and the rooms are great.  The sunken living room with its own sectional and flat screen TV, table and desk are a nice touch.  Decor is pleasing and the bed is very comfortable.    \n\nHave to deduct one star though for three flaws with the room.  One of the two sinks in our bathroom was not usable (the plunger would not move from the stopped-up position), there was a spring on the closet door which had been bent back and prevented the closet door from closing completely, and there were minor scuff marks on one of the walls and on the door jamb to the door of our room.  Not huge things, I know.  But when a hotel is rated at five diamonds, my standards are perfection.  \n\nDespite my nits, I would stay here again.
