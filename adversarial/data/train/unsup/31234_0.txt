One of the best place to get tacos in Cleveland! Trendy, many delicious specialty tacos, which I would recommend if you're a first timer to barrio. With so many options for a build your own taco- it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Definitely recommend the green goddess shell! Make sure you try their brunch!! The crab cake taco is my absolute favorite but only served at brunch! Happy hour is also an amazing deal
