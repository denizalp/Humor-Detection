Made a quick stop here to quickly fill up because our stomachs were running on empty that afternoon. I stuck with the dollar menu for my sandwich (spicy chicken sandwich) and ordered a side of onion rings. The chicken sandwich was filling for the dollar I paid. It was also freshly cooked which I appreciate. The onions rings were also fresh but they were the blandest onion rings I have ever tried. Service was also prompt which is a hit or miss in fast food. Will I return? If I am in the area again and need a quick bite then yes. I will just stick with the chicken sandwich next time though.
