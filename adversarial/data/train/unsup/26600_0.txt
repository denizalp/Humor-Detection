I was expecting more for this buffet considering how many must try buffet lists it was on. The sushi was meh. The seafood was ok. The crab legs weren't really to write home about but they satisfied the craving. I wish they had the option for warm crab legs. The selection of food was ok. I would have given only 1 star but the dessert selection was actually up to my liking and the wait staff were very quickly with getting plates out of the way and friendly while doing so. Will not be back though sorry!
