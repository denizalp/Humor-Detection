SCAM SCAM SCAM with a pathological LIAR!!! DO NOT BOOK with Todd and Rockyglen. We were referred to Todd for a low price (you get what you pay for). He promised the world - claiming he's never broken anything and he's totally bondable. Needless to say based on reviews we have read, he's broken numerous things and never compensated for them. \n\nHe quickly came to our house (almost too quickly) to give us a quote and asked for a E-Interact transfer for a deposit of $250. We didn't hesitate and left our guard down because it was a referral. I also asked for boxes and he mentioned he got a deal. In total we gave him $370 for the deposit and boxes. In hindsight this was a small price to pay - based on other reviews, had he never show up, then it would have cost a lot more (or impossible) to find a replacement. \n\nWe had to quickly determine a Plan B. We messaged Todd every day, multiple times a day to \"5 minute\" then \"7 minutes\" to an \"hour\"... to \"on my way!\"\n\nHe never messaged and when he did, he said he his aunt needed to go to the calgary hospital from Banff (as if there no hospital there), that he got caught up in a bad move, that he was going to come over that evening but never did, the excuses kept layering on.  \n\nNeedless to say, my husband tried to reason with him and then Todd tried pawning our contact over to his \"assistant\" who then said he should expect a credit that never came. Likely it's a family scam where they try to buy as much time as possible. First of all, he made us provide the deposit to \"save the date\" through e-interac when he said his \"Square\" swipe was in the car. When I spoke to my other friend who was referred to him, she also paid the deposit through Einterac which shows he's overall SHADY! He mentioned he \"forgot\" his square in the car. DONT BELIEVE HIM. \n\nHe's good at messaging to get the initial deposit then will never be available. I'm sorry to say, but find someone more expensive but worth it. This guy is a JOKE (at minimum). \n\nNow we are looking to settle this within small claims court. \n\nBe smart and don't be like me: NEVER book this guy. Save yourself lots of money and time. Good luck with your move WITHOUT rockyglen.\n\nPS as I threatened Todd that I would post negative reviews, he's deactivated his Facebook and made his yelp appear as if he is \"TEMPORARILY CLOSED.\" As if he can run and hide from me posting negative reviews ....
