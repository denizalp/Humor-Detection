I like the gyros. Gyros are hard to mess up, and when I can't get them anywhere else for several miles you're going to get my business. I'm also liking the extended hours, and the bottled drink selection. I like that they've kept some variety, and you can try a sampler plate with items you won't normally see, even at other gyro shops. Like spanakopita, or some of that other stuff wrapped in grape leaves that I can't spell or pronounce (dolmathakia?). I didn't care for the fries, falafel, or rice, but hey--ya win some, ya lose some.\n\n*forced smile*\n\nI legitimately think this place is good for lunch. Just...please, don't remind me how awesome it was under previous ownership. I don't want to live in the past. I hope the owners will at least put on ESPN instead of children's TV while I eat. You know, for old times' sake.
