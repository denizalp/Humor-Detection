Call and made an apt for Monday, which is what they suggested to get a diagnostics no work on the truck just a diagnostics test to see what's wrong.Dropped off the truck at 8am no one ahead of me in line, told them I have to have it back today Monday I have no way to work on Tuesday, oh did I mention that I had to take a day off to do this. Called them at 2pm no call back, same at 3pm and at 4pm, finally got hold of them at 4:30 no one has even look at the truck and there is 2 trucks ahead of mine this is with a appt.The service manager Michal Johnson said if I leave it over night it will be definitely be done on Tuesday.. I again said I have no ride to work. Being upset I call back to talk with somebody else and got the service director and he could care less basically telling them they don't want my business. So I will go to ford country.
