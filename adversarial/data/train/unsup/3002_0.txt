**************************** REVIEW 878 ********************************\n\n      I have been here zillion of times and Bellagio remains my favorite casino and hotel in Las Vegas. My parents celebrate their anniversary here every year for the last 10 years.\n\n- The service here to M Life card is AMAZING. \n\n- I have the best host in the world, Mr. Steve Jackson VIP Casino host.\n\n- The best wine selection in the whole US if not the world, managed by Wine Director Master Sommelier Jason Smith, 1 of the best in the world!!!\n\n- Restaurants choice: hands down 1 of the best restaurants group in Vegas - Picasso ($100 millions worth of original 11 painting by Picasso, when can I get this close to the real thing?), Prime Steakhouse by Jean-Georges, Yellowtail sushi, Le Cirque, Circo, Sensi, Fix, and Michael Mina! \n\n- The water fountain, the best in the world!\n\n- The service, the service, and the service - I always feel like a queen when I'm here!!!! \n\n         Now, before you LECTURE me about other hotels, read my reviews to see where I've stayed and dined at first OK... When I come to Vegas 6 times a year, I've stayed around every single new hotel there already! My heart will always be with Bellagio!
