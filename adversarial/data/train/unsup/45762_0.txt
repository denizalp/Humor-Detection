I walked into this dealership yesterday, after being approved for financing on a used BMW at a \"big box\" dealer. There ended up being some issues with that vehicle and I just had an \"uneasy feeling\". I sat down with Dan Perlstein and explained the situation. He looked in their computer system, and there was not a car available Nationwide, similar to the other one, that happened to actually be there for repairs. We walked the lot and looked at a couple certified used BMW's and really was not able to find find anything in the price range of the other vehicle. Fast forward to today, and as the \"uneasy feeling\" got stronger on the other car, I called Dan and told him \"let's try and put something together\" on a car he showed me yesterday.  While he was having my trade appraised I was chatting with the other sales people and the sales managers and was made me feel like I was part of a family. I hadn't even put a deal together yet and we're talking about motorcycles, airplanes, boats, race cars and cigars!  Dan Eastman is one Hell of a GM, and really helped \"the other Dan\" put things together for me. Turns out we both worked for the same dealer family back in Ohio years ago. After walking in thinking I was going to be miles away from making a deal, I spent my last hour there today sitting with Borna Vaezi learning how to operate my new BMW. What these guys did for me today I consider above and beyond the call of duty and I have found \"my dealer\", especially considering it meant eating a transfer fee paid to another dealer. I did not see anything that any of the posters giving bad reviews experienced. I was introduced to the entire management staff while there today. I have to say if you are looking for a BMW, this is where you need to be. Thank you again, Dan P., Dan E. and Borza V. You made my day, and my wife's as well! Looking forward to the BMW owner experience. I will be sure to bring you guys some cigars!!
