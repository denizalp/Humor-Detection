Lee's is far and away the worst music venue I've ever been too and that's saying a lot from a person that grew up attending shows in church basements, fields and any other hole that could fit a band and forty kids in. \n\nThe acoustics are terrible and it seems like the only good place to stand is centre stage in the very front. It's dark, dingy and just uninteresting visually. \n\nHaving said that, yes I am aware of the number of bands that have played there and their pedigree. Yes the staff are all very nice, polite and attentive, but that just makes for a decent place to drink not listen to music.
