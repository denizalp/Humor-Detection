We stayed three nights at one of the Fountain View Suites. Check in is after 4 p.m. checkout is 11 a.m. we were a little late like 12 p.m. so by an hour......... you couldn't do us an accommodation and waive the $25 fee? Are you serious we spent all this money on your property!! Wow talk about shity service. \n\nOur safe was locked when we checked into the room we have to have some security guy come in twice to fix it what an inconvenience. Like get it together these Suites aren't cheap. Then we call for room service that took a lot longer than it should have, mind to you this hotel does not have a casino or a restaurant that's open 24 hours for you to get to there isn't much going on why the shity service!?\n\nOh did I mention $25 per day for the valet parking and if you want self parking you have to park like 3 miles away and walk back what the Fuck
