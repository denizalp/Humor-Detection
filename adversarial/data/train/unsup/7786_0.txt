ZERO!!!!!\nOn Sunday August 17 we went for what we thought would be a nice diner breakfast. We were a party of nine, the rude person that showed us to our table was quick and rude to announce \"I will not put a chair in the aisle\". Two of us went a a two person table where we waited 45 MINUTES .....YES 45! All we got was coffee while the other tables (who were all white) around us came in for their meals and finished while we waited. A lady that was cleaning tables was working I the kitchen area handling food. One do the waitresses stated that \"they were short and training a new cook\". Still everyone's orders we being completed EXCEPT ours.\nWe received strange looks while walking in to the establishment. I would hate to assume that it was a racial thing as we were the only non-white people in the diner. We are very proud to be Americans though our skin is tanned and we speak another language. \nPOOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!
