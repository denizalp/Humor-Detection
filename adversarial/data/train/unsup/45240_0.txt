I have always gotten great customer service at this Wild Flower. The food quality and selection is so great! \n\nI placed a to go order last weekend. I wanted sandwich fixings in a salad form. The woman who took my order helped me and offered suggestions. I usually dread to go orders because they are always incorrect. My order was spot on! And so quick to pick up. Love this Wildflower location!
