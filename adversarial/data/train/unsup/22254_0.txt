CLT is a convenient airport despite being a rather busy hub, with a fair amount of international traffic.  When I used to fly US Airways all the time, CLT would figure in my travel at least once a week.  Now, it's rare that I get to go through CLT.\n\nIt's a fairly new airport and the layout and amenities show that.  It has a wide open, airy feel to it in most concourses, especially the International concourse.  The central area where the B and C concourses meet can be a bit of a madhouse at times with people rushing between gates.  But there, in the midst of all this traffic, are dozens of cozy Adirondack style chairs where you can relax for a bit if you have the time between flights.\n\nThere is often some live entertainment in the central area... grand piano, country music, jazz - I've seen it all.  Lots of food options too - and a full fledged cigar\/tobacco store - woohoo!!!\n\nWeather in the area is usually good which means minimal flight delays.  Delays are inevitable in a hub airport but when they do happen, CLT makes the experience a little less stressful by providing a lot of distractions in addition to the wonderful Southern charm of all the people working here.\n\nGreat place to connect if you're headed to the Caribbean - you're almost there already ;)\n\n~ 4 solid stars for a solid, dependable and charming \"little\" big airport.  CLT may not be my favorite airport but it's one I'm quite fond of.\n\n# 280
