This is my second stay in about a month at this hotel. Love love love it! As I work for a different hotel, my standards are a little high. The look of the lobby\/area made me a little nervous at first, but everyone at the front desk was helpful and went out of their way to accommodate. My wife and I fell in love with the room w stayed in during our first stay and the front desk staff member, Kevin, went out of his way to make sure we get the same room for our second weekend staycation! The rooms are newly renovated (a note by the bed let us know the beds are brand new, just arrived summer 2016) and sooo nice. Loved the sleek, modern feel of our studio. The A\/C is quiet loud, we had to turn up the television to hear it, but you get used to it fast and I appreciate some white noise when I try to sleep. Their standard studio still feels spacious and has a kitchenette, full size fridge, and some other amenities. Definitely appreciated the room service too! The room is clean, the bed is comfy, and we'll definitely keep coming back here. Also, the pool never really has people around so it was nice to get the privacy we wanted!
