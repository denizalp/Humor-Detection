Just thinking of the food and writing this review is making me want to schedule my next trip to Vegas. \n\nMy daughter and I came to BabyStacks on a Saturday around 8:30am.  I'm glad we did because when we were leaving around 10am, there was already a line out the door.  We were greeted and got seated right away.  We ordered the following:\n\nPortuguese sausage omelet with a stack of Red Velvet pancakes ($12).  It had rice, Portuguese sausage, bacon and mushrooms.  Man it was so good!!!  The flavors exploded in my mouth.  I need to find a place near me that can serve this omelet.  The Red Velvet pancakes were so soft, moist and fluffy.  It comes with a cream cheese sauce that was devine.  \n\nMy daughter ordered the Frankie's Mini Breakfast ($6.25) -it had 1 egg, hash brown and 1 bacon.  My daughter enjoyed it. \n\nWe are looking forward to going again.
