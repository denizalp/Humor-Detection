The regular sized sandwiches are already pretty big and about $7 each. We got one Big kahuna (philly cheese steak with jalapenos and peppers) and one #9. Both are great. The philly is very cheesy and the meat is chopped in small pieces but tender. Sometimes the peppers are pretty hot, but this time they weren't very hot. I know it varies sometimes. The bread holds up really well even with all the hot cheesey-goodness. I actually really like the bread here. It's soft and chewy but doesn't get soggy until pretty much the very last bite!\n\nThe bread on the #9 holds up the same, even though it's a cold sandwich that's generously drizzled with oil and red wine vinegar. Have it Mike's Style and that includes lettuce, mayo, tomato, oil, vinegar, onions, but doesn't include pickles or mustard. Ask if you want those and they will gladly put them on. I usually get extra pickles but I forgot to ask for them. I didn't even miss them bc the sandwich was so good. It also comes with bacon, and somehow the bacon is very crispy without being hard and chewy. They have almost the texture of bacon bits but these are real strips of bacon. I usually never get bacon on anything unless I cook it at home bc it always ends up hard and dry and not crispy, but not here!\n\nStaff is also very friendly.\n\nMake sure to sign up for their birthday club and get a free regular sized sandwich AND a drink for free! No purchase necessary! But you can only redeem on your actual birthday.\n\nThe only minus I can think of is I wish the order counter is first, then the pay counter. The way they have it now you get to the pay counter first, so if it's busy the line can get awkward.
