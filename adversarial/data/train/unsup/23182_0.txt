I am not exactly a fan of the whole environmentally-conscious, pesticide-free, non-GMO, organic, natural food craze that has grabbed the American people and given them the opportunity to pay more for their food.\n\nHowever, I do like the way that this store is set up and I feel that the quality of the food here is definitely a step up from most of the major chain supermarkets.  Saying that, I also have to acknowledge that many of the major chain grocery stores are adding higher quality foods to their shelves in order to entice the millennials into their stores.\n\nAs this store is close to home and does not charge an arm and a leg (just one arm) for great tasting food, I am wiling to be a little more discerning in my selections and enjoy the Whole Foods experience.\n\nI do like the local watering hole where you can grab a bite to eat and a beverage of your choice before or after you have finished shopping.  This restaurant also has an outside entrance so you can skip the grocery store altogether if you so choose.
