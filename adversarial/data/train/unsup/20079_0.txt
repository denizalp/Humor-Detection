I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.  I liked the friendly staff, the medical theme where they dress you in hospital gowns and the waitresses are dressed like nurses, down to the good food and the spanking with the PADDLE if you didn't finish all of your food from your sexy nurse.   I may have left food on my plate on purpose!  OK, I admit I did and will do it again.  Spank me, I am naughty!   LOL
