Jen was really amazing!! I've been trying to get my hair back to a short style I had a couple of years ago, but no one has been able to do it. They always leave it too long and don't take the time to shape it in the right way. Jen really listened and took so much time to make sure that I was happy and to make it look great. I was really impressed with her precision and patience! I will definitely go back to her and will recommend her and this salon to my friends and family.
