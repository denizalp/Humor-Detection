This place seemed to pop up out of nowhere in the last few weeks and I have been a couple of times to sample the goods. Decor wise the place is pretty decent, a nice open space with a few small tables for seating.\n\nThe staff was quite welcoming and they guide you through their process, which is a bit different from a traditional Yogen Fruz or similar places. At Yeh they have around 10-12 'flavor stations' for frozen yogurt varieties. They range from standard blueberry fruit type flavors to NY cheery cheesecake. The employees working told me that they would be rotating new flavors in occasionally. After you pick your flavors you pour the amount that you want (they measure by volume when you finish). After you have your fro-yo you can pick some toppings to finish it off; anything from crushed oreos to gummyworms to fresh fruits.\n\nAt each of my visits I had the following:\n - Peanut butter & chocolate mix\n - NY cheesecake\n\nThe flavor is good, though I still prefer a traditional yogunfruz. The taste there is more fresh since they are grinding in the frozen fruits. Not entirely sure how Yeh prepares their fro-yo but it's not quite on par for me. That said I can see this place being very busy in the summer time. Finally the ice cream shop across the road has some competition for the heat!\n\nAs for the prices, I didn't note how much we were getting but around a half filled cup (their cups are quite large) was $10 for two of us. They also offer crepes which I think start at $3 or $4 each, haven't sampled them yet.\n\nOne thing the owners should improve on is varying sizes for the bowls. I felt like it was very wasteful to have such massive bowls when most people probably would not even fill it.
