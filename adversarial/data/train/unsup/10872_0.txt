I feel conflicted upon writing this review.  Why?  Because a delicious meal at Live, two out of three of us immediately fell ill and one of us threw up three times.  Right outside, on Dupont St.  And then once more a half hour later.  What gives?\n\nFirst of all, the friend who repeatedly threw up started with an amazing Kale soup, which I tasted.  Followed by the cold spaghetti and neat balls, which I also tasted.  We then shared an amazing slice of \"cheese cake\" and that's when it hit.  My other friend, Robert H. did not experience any sickness whatsoever.  He tried all of our food except for the dessert.  \n\nI dry-heaved on the street (TMI?) which NEVER happens to me since I have an iron stomach.  I was actually shocked we became so ill after the meal.\n\nI should note that every single dish that was ordered between the three of us was mind-blowing.  The service was fantastic and their patio is lovely.  The music was faint, but awesome (Bowie? Yesss) and the overall vibe was really relaxing and casual.  I would recommend this restaurant to all vegan and vegetarian friends with a caution: skip the dessert.
