One of my usual shopping places. I prefer Trader Joe's or AJ's, but I do like this particular Safeway location. It has better decor than most I have seen. They also have a great selection of wine, and other spirits. Plus, the Safeway deli sandwiches and ready to eat meals\/soups are fantastic.\n\nTry their selection of pre-breaded ready-to-cook fish fillets too - Yum!\n\nTheir recycling bags are nice and only $1 each.
