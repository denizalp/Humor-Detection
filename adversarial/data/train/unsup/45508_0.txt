Finally good food at CLT!\n\nIt's wonderful to be able to get a good open face sandwich during a layover.  The quality is great but it is airport priced.  \n\nDon't miss the berry dessert chocolate thing!\n\nThe restaurant is a bit hidden right behind the big airplane mobile in the center bridge between B and C concourse.  \n\nThis looks like just a wine bar but the tapas are really good.
