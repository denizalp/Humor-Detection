It is refreshing to come to a venue that offers something different. Not only it si secluded and somewhat exclusive, when one has managed to get a seat in a small booth-like table with no space - but I like it. It makes me feel like I am in a place that is not a franchise (if it is, I don't want to know). This establishment is austere without being uncouth in any way, like a diamond in the rough that you do not want to polish. \n\nThe servers are amazing. Personable and friendly. On top of their shit, and not too busy to squeeze in a joke here and there. The beer list is not extensive, but it works. The food menu is nice. Overall this is my kind of place. I would come here often if I didn't have a decent drive associated with it. The bathroom is one coed bathroom located in the kitchen. This is good and bad, it feels odd walking into the kitchen - but I like that you can walk into the kitchen. A feel of transparency to see what is going on in here. \n\nWhat I bring home from my visit is the service, and the feel of the place. Both are top notch. Yes, there are things that I could suggest that would improve my experience - but i'd rather not. I want to leave this place as I found it and hope that they do not change.
