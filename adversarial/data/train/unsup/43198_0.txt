It's Panda Express. There is nothing special about this one expect it's the closest one near the palazzio hotel. There is also a chipotle right next to this panda. \n\nThe food they serve is like any other dishes you would find at any other panda. Nothing too special. \n\nTheir one entree and one side bowl is less than 8 bucks. They also label the amount of calories each dish has. The calorie count can be found on the menu under each dish. (It's in a small white font, so it may be hard to find at first sight.) The calorie count was helpful cause once I saw the calories for the fried rice, I went with the veggie sides, which by the way is less than 90 calories per a serving. I'm in Vegas I need my bikini body!!! (No bloating please!!) Not that the orange chicken helped... \n\nThe lady at the from counter was so cheap! My friend asked for some extra fortune cookies and the lady denied my friend. How cheap is that?!
