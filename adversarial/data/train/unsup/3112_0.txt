I finally made it here yesterday and really had a good time.  Its a chicago style menu, with mostly burgers and chicago style hotdogs.  I went with the chicago style hot dog, and it was very tasty and filling.  I was impressed with the fact that this guy made his own chili.  I loved it! very meaty and had just enough spice to make my mouth happy.  I will gladly return.  Plus, the guy who helped me was wonderful!  Yay for Lobbys!
