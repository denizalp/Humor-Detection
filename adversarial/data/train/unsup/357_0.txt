Where to begin? I stayed for a week and had so many opinions during that time. I was very impressed on the drive up to the hotel seeing it all lit up and golden - it was all glossy on the outside, but tired looking on the inside.\n\nCons - Conspiracy to keep you gambling at the hotel.\n1. Internet rate of $12.99 for 24 hours PER DEVICE. I used my laptop and my itouch and they double charged me.\n2. Food is lousy (expected), but you are so far from everything that there are NO other options in the area, unless you consider Del Taco food.\n3. No free shuttle to the strip - also if you try to ask for alternative methods of transportation (other than by taxi) to anywhere, but here you will get unreliable information. Taxi to the strip takes 15 minutes and costs $24-30 PER TRIP ($48-60 roundtrip!).\n4.  There were small blood spatters in inconspicuous places - this is the second time that I have noticed this in different hotels.\n5. Is all the astroturf really necessary?\n6. No nightlife - just gambling\n7. Don't assume that the wireless keyboard set on the dresser under the TV actually has a purpose - it does not interface with the TV. Also the ethernet cable for the internet is a wee bit retarded and did not work with the simple plug n go method.\n\nPROS\n1. Large rooms for what you pay.\n2. 24hr room service that serves decent food quickly.\n3. Huge outdoor pool area and large jacuzzi. Astroturf has weeds growing in it.\n4. If you're playing in the lobby, you will never have to pay for drinks.\n5. Very friendly shuttle bus drivers will give you the inside scoop and will go out of their way to get you as close to the strip for free as they can.\n6. If you love NASCAR and horses, then this place is heaven for you.\n7. New age BINGO with touch screen or you can play the retro version with the stampers (for an extra fee) - bring your troll dolls and wing glasses.\n8. Curved shower curtain rod, blue chlorinated water, telephones everywhere (bedside, desktop, and by the TOILET!).
