I just moved to Mesa, was getting my furniture that I ordered delivered and then realised I totally forgot to order mattresses! So off I went and found R&S mattresses. I was there for 10 am and was out of there by 10:30. I had the most wonderful salesman (sorry I can't remember your name!) who helped me pick out 3 high quality mattresses for very reasonable and best of all could deliver the same day! My furniture was scheduled for delivery between 1-3pm and R&S said they could deliver between 3-4pm AND NO DELIVERY CHARGE! What FANTASTIC service!! Sure enough everything was delivered at 3pm and again, what a great delivery man! super friendly, took extra care not to damage my walls etc and the mattresses are perfect:) I would HIGHLY recommend R&S mattresses (and no, I am not affiliated with them in any way,lol)
