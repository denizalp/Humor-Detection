Service was bad. Don't go to this location.\nWe specifically asked for no hot banana peppers on the Brando. The guy refused to write that down. And we ended up with hot banana peppers on the pizza.\nThe whole conversation was very confusing. Just not customer-friendly.\nThe Brando was actually good - maybe I would go to a different location for that one.\nThe other one on the gluten-free crust was disgusting. It was like eating a bunch of toppings on a giant, stale cracker. Another lesson learned.
