Brothers: \nIt's your run of the mill College Bar.  \n\nCheap drinks\nGood music\nCrazy dancing\n\nA couple of minor thoughs:  The second floor of brothers looks down on the dance floor like a giant balcony, pretty unique.  And the first floor bar spans across the entire left side of the room, I also enjoyed that.  I did not enjoy how bright it was in there, I could actually see people's faces, who wants to do that at a bar?
