The burrito wrapper was done perfectly ... hence the wait.  Crisp outer shell.\n\nYou can control the amount of sauces you want.  Only gripe:  just not spicy enough for me.\n\nThe toppings were fresh, no doubt about it, except that the lady drenched my burrito with what appeared to be sour cream.  Will definitely pass on the cream thing the next time and probably order a vegetarian filling.  (Had the halibut which was fried) ...\n\nAlso, it is a clean place.  Busy (which is a good sign).  The shrimp burritos appeared to be very popular with the lunch crowd.
