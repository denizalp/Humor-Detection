Ok... So on the positive side... Its real close to my house... And its pizza.   \n\nSo lets really talk... Signiture pizza...   Meaning what we do best... A tried and true recipe that they want to be known for.  I can't wait... I love trying new things... I choose a pizza from the name and description... Ready to go... Nope!\n\nNow come questions..\nDo you want cheese? Does it come with cheese?  It reads cheese in the description... Oh yea, just some people want other things.\n\nWould you like salt?\ndude is that how you make the signature pizza?\nwell sometimes people want different stuff...\nDude just make it how its made... Nothing more nothing less\n\n(end if the line now) \nSo do you want anything else on it?\noh man... Does anything else come on it?\n\nyou get where this is going.\n\nSo its ALL upsell... Only good to build your own... And the crust is like a saltine cracker... \n\nI was really hoping for something like 800 degrees but closer... Their white pizza is one of the best ever pizzas I've tried... Also their signature... Except without the upsell questions... Also better dough and fresh mozzarella... Not grated market stuff.\n\nWith so much competition in the area and in vegas... Skip it... \n\nI hope it closes so that nobody else gets fooled into thinking its good, just because its close.\n\nIts the subway of pizza places\n\n boo
