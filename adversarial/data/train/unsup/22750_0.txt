What time is it?  It's rhyme time!!!\n\nYes, it's that time for my monthly rhyme,\nIf you haven't eaten here, it's almost a crime. \n\nDining at Kitchen Table is a memorable one,\nGood food with friends is always fun. \n\nI'll start with the service since it's as good as it can be,\nIf you're into a great meal, then listen to me.\n\nNo reservations! So, get here early,\nWe didn't wait long because we had Shirley. \n\nYes, she's the Duchess here and I can see why,\nThe food is amazing. I'm not gonna lie.\n\nWe met some friends here for my birthday brunch,\nThe coffee was strong and packed a punch.\n\nThe pancakes are to die for.  Fluffy! Tasty! Simply the best,\nYes, they're that good.  Forget the rest!!\n\nTheir Chicken Fried is awesome and better than most.\nIt's served with 2 eggs, potatoes, and toast.  \n\nNow let's talk about portions, they definitely don't skimp,\nI went Feast Mode because I'm not a wimp.\n\nHere's a tip, based on what I've read,\nCome here early and get their Monkey Bread.  \n\n5 Stars for their Chicken Fried, the service, and their stack,\nBelieve me when I say it.  I will be back.\n\n\n2016 Yelp Review #18
