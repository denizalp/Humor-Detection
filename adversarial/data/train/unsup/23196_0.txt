i took a sunday off to take a handgun safety course this past weekend and this place is huge! there are ranges for not only pistols, but high powered rifles, shotguns, and even bows and arrows. it's all outside and very safe, as gun ushers were constantly alert and around to make sure everyone was following the proper etiquette. i did feel a bit out of place without camo, a trucker cap, and my \"Go Palin\" bumper sticker...but luckily i have a heavy duty southern accent, so i guess i was OK. \n\ni hear it's cheaper than the indoor ranges closer to phoenix, but you pay for it in gas driving all the way out there. ...i don't want know you name, i just want BANG BANG BANG.
