Furniture shopping all day and finally decided to hit the westside for RC Willey.  RC Willey is good old faithful for me when it comes to furniture shopping.  Price, value, and customer service is what they key on.  My previous RC Willey visits were in Henderson.  This was a first for me. \n\nAs soon as I park, the first thing I noticed was the huge sidewalk sale and Girl Scout Cookies.  I haven't even walked and already thinking 5 stars just for the Tagalongs and Do Si Do cookies. I was greeted by at least 4 employees and was offered assistance even before I got halfway down this place. So far, I have to give them 5 stars for customer service alone.  \n\nI didn't find what I was looking for in the main showroom, but found exactly what I'm looking for in their clearance area.  Assistance came to me, he wrote me up, set up delivery, and I was off to the cashier.  Quick and painless furniture shopping as always at RC Willey.  \n\nRC Willey has decent quality furniture.  Obviously, the higher grade merch is also higher cost.  They also sell more than just furniture like electronics, exercise equipment, game room furniture, and grandfather clocks.  I spent a bit amount of time debating whether to get a grandfather clock.  Not too often that you see these in homes anymore.  As a kid, everyone had them.  Just brings memories and the prices for the grandfather clocks at RC are well in my budget. Only problem, where would I put it?\n\nMy only gripe is their delivery schedule. I made a purchase and it will not be available for delivery until 4 days later.  This happens to work out fine since I will be out of town anyway.  However, if I wasn't out of town, this would be an issue with me especially since they're local.
