Update: They raised prices on all their machines by at least another .25!\nStill my favorite place to come if you need a laundromat. Staff is very friendly and helpful but every time we come more and more machines are out of service, especially the nice larger machines you can use for blankets, they are now harder to come by. I hope they start fixing their machines and dryers soon.
