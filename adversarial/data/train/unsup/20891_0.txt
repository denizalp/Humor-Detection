Family owned with colorful and thoughtful d√©cor- and that's just when you first walk in the door! Service, even for a simple takeout order, was friendly, made menu suggestions, and even tossed in some extra sopapillas. Menu has all of your southwestern favorites, with both red and green chile.\n\nThe green chili stew was thick and well-spiced, packed with potatoes but only a few bits of pork. Good flavor in this dish, and a good price, which included accompanying tortillas. I also added on a chile relleno (with both red and green sauce) from their a la carte section, but found it soggy and overbattered. The sauces were on point, though. Bring your hankie, because your eyes will be tearing up at the heat.\n\nHowever, I'm not a fan of the gimmicky drug\/420 references all over the menu- referring to a breakfast burrito as a blunt, for example? I find it tacky and in poor taste, unless your target audience is high school teenagers. Bonus points for offering a Yelp check-in offer for free dessert with purchase.
