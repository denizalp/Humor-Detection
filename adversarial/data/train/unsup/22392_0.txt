oh man... where to start...\n\nI walked in on a sunday night with my 9 month old baby and my husband, there was a decent amount of tables filled and no one waiting.  I ask the owner how long the wait is... he eyes us and tells us 40 minutes to an hour!! I didn't think much of it at the time buuuuutttt, the next time i came i realized he just didn't want us to dine there!\n\nSo this last time I actually got to eat there we sat down and ordered our food, I pulled out my baby's food and bottle so I could feed him.  The owner came back like seriously 5 separate times to tell us how inconvenient it was that we brought a baby to his place!\n\nThe first time he looks at me with a serious face and asks \"does your baby like drop food all over the floor?\" and I was just so shocked I said yes he might a little?  I mean, I'm definitely NOT one of those moms who leaves a mess on the floor... I literally clean up the floor before I leave! Anyways... so he comes back again after 5 min and says that I can't serve any outside food in the restaurant.  So I asked if he was talking about my homemade baby food and he said yes, you are not allowed to bring food for your baby because it is against the law?! Um I've been to many places in Madison and given homemade baby food to my son and I've NEVER been told this comment.  SO i asked him then I can't give him formula either? And he said no, so I said then how can I feed my baby?! And he says \"Thats why its difficult to travel with a baby!\" \n\nAND he said all this with a straight face!! I will never be going back to K peppers, they are racist (against koreans, I am korean) and outright rude! \n\nPS. I am korean and the korean \"fusion\" food there is ok, not the best.
