Great customer service---manager (I think? If not, he should be!) spent at least 20 minutes or more with us explaining different products in the categories we were interested in, and never got a sense of being pressured or directed. Pretty much explained the products, answered our questions, and left us to make our own decisions. Very much appreciated his help, wish we had taken note of his name. Prices were reasonable for the items we looked at and the store had a very good\/wide selection.
