OK...I'm the first to admit.  I am lazy when it comes to working out.  I don't like to sweat or push myself hard.  It is certainly something I have been working on.  \n\nNow you might ask, why did you choose to go to HOT YOGA then?!?  Well I bought the Groupon.  Great Deal!  \n\nYesterday was my first ever Bikram class (first ever Yoga Class for that matter.)  This place was fantastic.  Kasper helped sign me up and eased my nerves a bit.  He remembered my name instantly.  \n\nSherie was the instructor and I just loved her.  She talked the entire 90 minutes giving the studio constant instructions but also gave us an idea of the reasoning behind all the poses, exercises etc.  It was fascinating.  She encouraged individuals and the class as a whole, but also called about people who needed help.  I don't know about you all, but I want someone to let me know when I do something incorrectly so I can reap all the benefits and do it right in the future.    \n\nThere were definitely times where I was getting very fatigued and light headed even, but she was right there telling us new students this was normal!  Thank god because that is usually the time where I quit something.  I did have to sit down a few times, but again, she said this is normal, especially for  first timers!\n\nImmediately after class I felt FANTASTIC! Sweaty is an understatement, but I was energized.  Even today, I feel great, and am more aware of my posture and breathing.  They are right when they say you feel the benefits more so after class.  \n\nVery helpful and informative.  Will be back!
