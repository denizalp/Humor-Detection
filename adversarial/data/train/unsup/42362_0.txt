Visited the Feast Buffet at Palace Station recently for breakfast. There was no line to wait in this weekday morning - making me think this might not be well known. After we were seated - the server came right over and took our drink order. The buffet selection for breakfast was excellent ! They had an omelet station, dessert bar with donuts\/danish, salad bar, and many of the usual items such as chicken fried steak, bacon, potatoes, sausage, pancakes, waffles, etc. Everything we had was very good ! We ended up going mutiple times during the week for breakfast. The price was very good and Wednesday is Senior Day where you get breakfast for half price if using casino credits to pay. This turned out to be a great breakfast option while visiting Las Vegas !
