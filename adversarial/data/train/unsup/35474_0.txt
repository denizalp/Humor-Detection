I purchased last year a patio set. \nI left it outside over winter and I was amazed that the material and color didn't change. \nThe cushions are very comfortable and easy to clean. \n\nMy advise is to purchase from this company but don't do what I did, don't leave it outside over winter even when everything looks good and in good shape.
