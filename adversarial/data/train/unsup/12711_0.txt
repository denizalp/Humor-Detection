Complete and utter assholes! Rude on the phone. Would not answer a simple question about carrying a L'oreal product. Said it was a \"sensitive product\" - whatever that means. However, if I was a hairstylist then I would have gotten a different answer.  \n\nAnd to top it off got hung up on! Had to call back to tell him off. Not sure if its a cultural thing but here in Canada people are NICE - something these shop owners should learn from. \n\nAnyone have suggestions for better stores in Toronto area that actually care for their customers? I'd pay more for better service.
