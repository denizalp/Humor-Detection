My latest favorite downtown watering hole.  They are masters in the art of mixology.  Simple quality ingredients blended with quality liquor (as an example their \"well\" bourbon is Buffalo Trace), they pride themselves on consistency.    The drinks are handcrafted and priced very reasonably, from $6 to $16 on average, based on how high on the shelf you like to drink.  They can make you a simple Vodka Soda if that is your thing but take a look at their extensive drink menu or tell them what your favorite base liquor is and what you don't  like and they will mix something up for you.  They offer a selection of canned and bottle beers if that is your thing and several wines including a few wines on tap.    \n\nB&T has Happy Hour daily from 4-7p which had several drink and food specials.   They offer up several tasty food items.  Thus far I have had the opportunity to try the Seoul Fried Chicken (watermelon kimchi,  yes please, it is light and tart complementing the chicken very well) and have stared longingly at their pork belly entree.  Also check out their specials board for weekly drink specials and the latest \"Mad Yelper\" quote. \n\nThis place is no dive but it is FAR from pretentious.  Their drinks only look fufu or cloyingly sweet, you should never judge a book by its cover. \n\nIf you are looking to get 'crunk' and only like to drink bud light and do shots of fireball I recommend you stick to Hooters or Tilted Kilt.  If you are looking for a relaxed unpretentious atmosphere and a couple of quality craft beverages DO stop in.
