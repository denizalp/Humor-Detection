What's not to love when it comes to staying at the Skylofts?\n\nMy highlights:\nSeparate valet\nPrivate elevator\nYour very own butler to do whatever the hell butlers do\nFridge constantly being restocked with beers, Red Bull, sodas, etc.\nLuxurious and spacious rooms\nMovie room\nPool table\nEspresso machine\n\nIt's sort of a waste if you don't intend on staying in, but you should definitely experience this at least once.
