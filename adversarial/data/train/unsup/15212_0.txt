with a $5 jerk special you can't go too wrong...but walk in with your ipod on loud and your order pre-written on a piece of paper to hand to the ratchet prosty working behind the counter so you don't have to engage her massive unpleasantness...seriously, you guys should start a donation jar to pay for an employee who hasn't run out of fucks to give\n\np.s. badmon chopping the jerk outside is amazing and pretty sure he hooks up a little extra chicken to offset the potential sand you may get in your rice from the vagina of the woman behind the counter...also about the rice, the peas are usually a little undercooked but thats easily fixable (as is firing the sand prosty) \n\np.p.s. I ask the person i ate with today if she wanted to add anything to this review and she said, and i quote: \"ya mention that woman behind the counter, I wanna stab her in her face hole\"
