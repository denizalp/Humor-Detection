I have coupon for 10 pieces chicken nuggets and a large fries for $3.99.\n\nService was very quick and I was seated eating my meal within 6 minutes.  This is a moderately busy hill location and has free parking shared with two other establishments.  It has a drive thru service and dining room seating (booth, table, cozy table, counter) for about 70 people with quiet top 40 music playing.\n\nFree WiFi!\n\nA quick light meal before I head downtown for a meeting.
