Stay away!  \n\nThe first time I tried them, I was unhappy with my hair colour but gave them a second chance because they were really nice. The 2nd visit, they ruined my hair!  I asked for the 'orangey' part that they did last time, to be fixed and to 'break up' the blonde with a warmer darker colour. They made me Bleach blonde with a product that burned my scalp for the 25 mins I sat there. The blonde was beautiful but not what I wanted!  He said, no problem, I'll fix it.  He basically made my hair orangey-strawberry. It is absolutely disgusting. If he didn't know how to fix it, he shouldn't have tried. \n\nI walked out $200 hundred dollars and 3 hours of my time wasted!  \n\nI went back in when they opened on Sat morning and was told to come back later 'for a consultation'!  He wouldn't even take me!!  He went on again about how beautiful that blonde was and basically told me we weren't on the same page!  I guess he has SO many other clients that he doesn't need to care about me. \n\nI talked to 3 other reputable salons in Yorkville who fit me in even though they were booked because my birthday party was that night and they felt bad my hair was  so hideous. \n\nBottom line, they will go on about their wonderful Goldwell product, their impressive schooling and use 'industry-speak' to sound like they know what they're talking about but they don't listen to what you want. They do what THEY want!  And clearly have no idea what they're doing with their colours. \n\nI have been highlighting and colouring my hair for 25 yrs. Never have I had an issue with anywhere else I've gone in Toronto.\n\nI'm sure he'll reply to this post with another reason why he was right in ruining my hair.
