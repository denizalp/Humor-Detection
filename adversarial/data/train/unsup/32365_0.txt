After reading reviews on yelp, Google and FB I decided this is the place I will take my car to for the funny sound I was hearing in my car.  They checked out the car, drove it several times and still didn't hear what I heard.  They checked out a couple other things with the car that I asked them to as well.  When I asked them what I owed them Kathy said \"no charge today\".  What? That's unheard of!  Kathy and Terry are very friendly people and took the time to check out my car and not charge me, it's no wonder their customer reviews are as great as they are!
