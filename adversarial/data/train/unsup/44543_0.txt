This was our 2nd time in this week....the 1st time we were shuffled between 4 different people and our order was in all disarray because of it but it was out of the \"norm\" today we wanted some soup and decided to give it another shot....we walked in and waited to get seated 2 of the workers looked right at us, didn't acknowledge us and we never got seated!!!  We gave it a FULL 5 minutes and 2 other employees glanced our way but never said anything to us!!!  We wound up walking out and have now vowed not to give it ano thing er chance....we are sad because we loved their food but I guess this location doesn't care too much about their customer service...do yourself a favor make sure you pack your patience....
