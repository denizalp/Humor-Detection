I eat between 6-7 times per day during the week.  Eating the same meals daily is easy for me, but every once in a while I need a change from my boring chicken breast or lean ground beef. Café Rio is just one of the options I have when I'm looking for something good, cheap, and clean.  This Café Rio is conveniently located by one of my offices and it's never busy.  A typical order for me is 2-3 servings of their fire grilled chicken with nothing.  The serving size is really depends on their employees.  Some scoop a lot, some don't.  It really doesn't matter to me just as long as I'm getting about 10 oz. of meat.  You can really taste the quality of the chicken when it's prepped as plain as can be.  The chicken is pretty good and beats my chicken breast in a taste test any day.  \n\nTIP:  Café Rio is also known for their huge burritos and bowls.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #65
