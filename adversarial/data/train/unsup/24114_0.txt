Ate here last night and was absolutely delighted with the food. \n\nFirst of all, the reason we came was to satisfy my darling girlfriend's and my need for Saganaki - cheese flamb√©e. We were a little worried when the flames kissed the ceiling, but once that crispy cheese hit our tongues we immediately forgot the fact half the restaurant was on fire. \n\nAfter that, we had the tri-sampler of dips, which was a better value than the two separate dips we were planning on (before the waitress kindly tipped us off). The Taramasalata (caviar-based) was so good, my mom bought some to take home with her.\n\nFinally the mains - I tried the Garides Skaras (Giant Shrimp) and Kalamari (Grilled Squid) dinners, as well as the Vegetarian Mousaka (Eggplant-based Greek Lasagna\/Casserole). They were all substantial and delicious portions. \n\nMy only complaint is that two children at the table next to us were staring at us for a long percentage of our meal. I would love to know what was going on in their heads, I can only hope it was some variation on wondering what we looked like as dinosaurs. I hope I was some sort of T-Rex or Allosaurus\/Human hybrid. But I'm sure with my luck, I'm sure they were imagining me as an Ichtyasaurus. Weeeeeak, yo. Those kids be trippin'.
