Hmm.. I just read all the reviews for this location... I'm not sure if I got lucky or what.   I mean it's just barely coming on 7am so they haven't been open to long... The store is clean, tables clean... Staff friendly. Maybe I just got lucky... I didn't experience what others have. All I ordered was a couple of bagels with cream cheese for me and my kid... And an iced coffee.. Our order was fine. This isn't my normal location but this place is bigger... I would come back.
