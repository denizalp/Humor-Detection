Each and everytime we go to Vegas, which is now at least once a year, we absolutely must visit the Conservatory & Botanical Garden at the Bellagio Hotel. They change the themes to perfectly match the holidays, and it is always a joy and so much fun to walk the garden and take a few photos and selfies. I don't think people realize how many hours and effort it takes to build the vignettes and keep the displays looking spectacular. There are small bridges, and walk thru's sometimes with water canopies over your head, and very festive and creative scenes throughout. I know, the place is always packed, but be sure to go anyway and check it out. No admission fee, and it is directly off of the self parking in the hotel.
