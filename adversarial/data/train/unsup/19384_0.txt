I absolutely loved this location! Mind you I really like hunting out these kind of whiskey lounges and they are rare. To truly experience good combination of whiskey and cigars, I am willing to drop a solid for it. \nWe came after midnight so the place was quiet. We were taken to the back where I saw a nice selection of Cigars. I tried an Ardbeg sampler of 3 scotches for 40$ as well as a Montecristo no 4. (which didn't seem fresh- it was hard to start up the cigar quite a few times and the price was hefty for it). I loved that we got complimentary pistachios to munch on while sipping away at Heaven. The service was great. For those coming from out of town this is definitely a less commercial local vibed whiskey lounge vs places like Burgundy Lion!
