Menu is small and somewhat boring. If you are going to be a \"nice\" restaurant and have spaghetti and meatballs, they should be killer. It was just ok. \n\nThis place is pretty good if you are in the neighborhood, not worth travelling to though. \n\nOne thing for sure though, pray that you don't have \"Jeff\" as your server. He puts on this brutal fake accent, switching between british and french, and is VERY annoying. His whole demeanor is obnoxious and unfunny, though he seems very confident that he is being charming. Really should be a 2 star review because of him, as he made the entire dining experience that much worse, but that seems harsh. \n\nThis was not just my opinion either, the patrons on either side of us were whispering about how annoying he was.
