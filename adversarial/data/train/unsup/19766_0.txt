Thumbing through one of the free Las Vegas booklets\/guide that are in every hotel, I noticed a center-fold for the Nathan Burton Comedy Magic Show.  On this center-fold was a coupon for two complimentary tickets to the show at the Planet Hollywood. \n\nMy traveling partner and I decided to go because we had a similar past experience\/deal that turned out quite enjoyable.\n\nIt took us a good 20 minutes to reach the theater from the strip entrance to the hotel\/casino.  \n\nWe presented our coupon for complimentary tickets at around 3pm for the 4pm show.  This box office attendant indicated that all complimentary tickets had been sold out but, if we wanted we could purchase discounted general admission tickets for $12\/each.  We purchased our tickets and made our way to the general admission line about 30 minutes before the show.\n\nWe were admitted 15 minutes before show time.  We had our picture taken as did all parties entering the performance (we were told it was part of the act).  Walking up two three flights of stairs to the theater entrance we handed our ticket to the usher and she directed us to sit center 6 rows from the stage.  When we had purchased our tickets the box office attendant showed us a map of our seats which were higher up the theater.  No complain here.\n\nThe show for the most part is family friendly.  Although there were some suggestive poses by Nathan's female assistants that were not family friendly - well, maybe for the dads in attendance.  All in all, it is a great magic\/comedy show.  You know it's good when you leave with the question...How'd he do that?\n\nAs for the pictures, they are part of the show in that they are available for purchase as you exit the theater.
