Cool spot to go if you are looking to just hang out with some friends late night. They have late night Happy Hour Specials as well too.\n\nThe staff are all cool and I like how they have pool tables here and open seating throughout the place, so its not crowded.\n\nIf you got the late night munchies, you gotta try the GARLIC CHILI-CHEESE SEASONED CURLY FRIES!!! These were my hands down, must-haves anytime I am here! (Trust me)\n\nHaven't tried the other foods yet, but I know I will when I come back\n\nRecommended!
