Yum diggity!  I could eat the pulled pork and buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese everyday.  Unfortunately, I think my arteries would have an aversion to that.  Seriously good food.  Even the, \"truck made chips\" kick ass.  Look for a Yelp check-in deal for a complimentary soft drink or bottle water with the purchase of any entree sandwich.  Good stuff.  If you absolutely need to know where strEat and the other food trucks are, cruise over to www.ohiofoodtruckfinder.com and stalk, er, follow them.
