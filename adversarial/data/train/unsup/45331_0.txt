This is my updated review.  My last review was that the place was OK.  Is it possible a place could actually go down hill???  Yep sure is!  First the Old Fashions are made with a mix, and not a very good one at that.  I sure couldn't taste the bitters.  Overall, it was just \"D\" grade.  My companion commented that I cooked WAY better meals.  I'm not sure what this place is trying to be, but it misses the mark BIG TIME!  They said it was \"comfort food\" which I get, but good lord, make it decently!!  Chef Ramsey, where are you, this place needs HELP!!!
