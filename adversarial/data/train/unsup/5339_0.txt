I went to Surrender this weekend to see one of my favorite DJs- that was a mistake.\n\nThis club cares more about getting as much people through the door than customer service and the customer experience. The staff wasn't helpful at all, especially the security after I was inappropriately grabbed. \n\nI don't care who is performing at Surrender in the future- I will not be back and I will tell everyone I know not to attend a show there.
