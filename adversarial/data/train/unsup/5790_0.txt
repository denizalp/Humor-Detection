AMAZING service. My filet was outstanding. My friend's was slightly overdone for her taste. We didn't complain, but the waitress overheard us talking about it and the manager came over and made my friend have a second one, mind you she was already 90% done with the first and would have been totally fine with it, but he insisted. It's pricey but you more than get what you pay for. (Full disclosure, I'm from New York and it seemed cheap to me, but I guess around here it was a lot) if I lived in Arizona, I would try to eat here once a week, but I would make sure I took a dump across the street at Ruby Tuesday. THAT place sucks and should be shut down.
