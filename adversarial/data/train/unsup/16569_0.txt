4 days before my wedding we decided to get a couples massage here and I had the worst experience. Not only was I incredibly uncomfortable during the entire massage, but when I got home there were LARGE bruises on my back and other areas of my body. During my massage, the \"therapist\" said my back was getting blue and to relax.. Pretty sure no one can relax when their back is literally being punched. I still cannot wrap my mind around how somebody can make these bruises and not stop midway..instead when I said it hurt, she kept rubbing and rubbing as if she could rub away the bruise she made. It was the worst decision ever made, so please do yourself a favor and don't even think about coming here.
