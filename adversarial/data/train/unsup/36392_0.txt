I like Big Smoke Burger's better than the The Burger's Priest, W, Hero and other places near by on King. The patties taste like meat and are more substantial.\n\nThe chicken burgers are great too. You can taste the fire on the meat.\n\nOther burger places tend to focus more on smothering the burger with toppings, which can be okay if the toppings are delicious. Here at Big Smoke I find the meat quality is excellent and juicy -- it tastes like a burger should!\n\nIt takes about 10 to 15 mins to get your order. Call ahead if you can.\n\nStaff is full of regular faces and they all work hard and have a good attitude about being there.\n\nI've ordered there many many times and they've never messed up an order.\n\nThe poutine is good when it's good but a bit inconsistent. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's a little low on gravy and cheese.\n\nThey have a smoky cheddar which makes the cheese stand out. I find with a lot of burgers the cheese isn't very bold.\n\nMilk-shakes are pretty good but not excellent. I like vanilla and theirs is more milky than vanilla.
