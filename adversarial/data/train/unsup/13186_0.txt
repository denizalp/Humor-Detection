Is it wrong that I like the taste of Peter Piper Pizza? It tastes like cardboard, but for some reason I love it still. I remember going to Peter Piper as a kid - having birthday parties here. Not this location, but still... they're all basically the same - various levels of shitty. \n\nThis location doesn't have too many kids usually and their arcade game selection is on the sad end of the scale. Still, I'm 33 - I don't come here for the games. I come for the shitty pizza... which I like. This place in particular does a pretty good job on the pizza - but most locations are about the same.\n\nIt's cheap and tasty and filling. If you haven't in a long time - get some take out or something... It's nowhere near the best pizza ever, but it's good in its own way. Don't judge my other pizza reviews by the fact that I like this crap. It's my secret shame.
