Locals will remember this restaurant as the former Laurel's, at the corner of Snow and Pearl roads. They have an extensive menu, featuring Greek entrees alongside more traditional diner items. Daily specials, a salad bar and homemade desserts make Pappou's a cut above your traditional mom and pop place.  Breakfast is also available in a clean, friendly atmosphere with reasonable prices and hospitality. Don't miss their Friday fish fry, with the best french fries you will ever taste, coupled with a varied selection of broiled, fried or baked seafood.
