I think this hotel needs to be a bit more honest with their advertisements.  Everything that happened there was a disappointment.\n\nAs it was said before we were stuck in a smoking room despite us getting there relatively early and then they gave us a made up excuse.  When I let them know I've worked for several hotels they balked and still stuck with there excuse.\n\nOn the other hand the room did not smell like a smoking room.  I was discouraged to find out that their pool closes relatively early, their bar closes extremely early (on the weekend) and they advertise \"off strip\".  No, they are not \"off strip\"  They are 12 minutes down the freeway on the other side of the airport.  I'm glad we drove.
