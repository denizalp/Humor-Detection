Having tasted a lot of BBQ and smoked anything i have to say that i am willing to sell my mother for some of their brisket.  I have never seen a smoke ring so deep.   And dear god do i ever recommend their burnt ends poutine.  The first time i went i asked them what they did with the shavings that were left on their slicer and the guy with a huge grin said that is what goes in the poutine sauce.   I have been there four times, since they opened and they are always packed, yet their staff is always smiling and joking with the patrons the two guys behind the counter are a treat all in themselves.  The best part is that they are getting a second smoker all the way from Tennessee.
