Hands down the BEST mexican food in Vegas! Been here at least 100 times & never let down. Great service with a very knowledgeble and team oriented staff. Basically everyone there helps you even the owner Frank who still takes tables. Daily specials from various regions of Mexico & reasonable prices. Try the fajitas or chile colorado.
