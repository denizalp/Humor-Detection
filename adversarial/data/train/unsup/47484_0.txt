I recently dined here and was very disappointed. I have dined at many different hot dog establishments and this one was overpriced in my opinion. The fries were over seasoned, making them very salty and inedible. I enjoyed the snap of the hot dog, but didn't find it to be a hot dog I would throughly enjoy eating again. I also had a float, it was ok but I feel it was overpriced. 2 fries, 1 hot dog, 1 foot long and 2 floats equated to almost $30. Sorry to say, I won't be coming back.
