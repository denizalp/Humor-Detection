A memorable night...miserably so. \n\nThe good: \n-Excellent French food (if you don't mind hair in your food)\n-Pretty people\n-Good decor\n-Good music\n-Wait staff are gorgeous and change their clothes midway through the evening.\n-Our server was very sweet.  \n\nThe bad: \n-Kept us waiting 90 minutes despite a reservation, \n-Drink was not mixed (my boyfriend had to stir it forcefully for me), \n-the $100 bottle of wine billed as \"the best in Montreal\" was pretty lacking\n-Very few people were dancing even at 1 a.m. It's more of a \"see and be seen scene.\" Don't go there to dance. \n\nAfter an hour of waiting, the maitre d' called us to the table only to send us back, badmouthing the people at the table for ordering dessert...saying how the guy was a smoker and kept going out to smoke and the table took too long. I don't want to hear how it's the customer's fault that you can't run a restaurant. In French culture, isn't it normal to linger over a meal? I get a 20 minute miscalculation....but waiting 90 minutes with a reservation? Why take reservations? \n\nAs a \"favor\" they gave us a booth (because it was then so late they were starting to clear tables from the floor..so it was a favor to themselves.)\n\nThis is an excellent place to go if you want to see how much stress you can put on your relationship. We'd driven 7 hours (had a flat) from Boston. My boyfriend was giving up smoking so was in acute nicotine withdrawal. People were smoking inside the restaurant. And the maitre d' was badmouthing the smoker at the table we'd reserved. Perfect storm. \n\nBy the end of the night, my boyfriend was no longer my boyfriend. He was so angry and frustrated at the rudeness of the staff and the wait, that he took it out on me. \n\nWhile no one breaks up because of a 90 minute wait alone and perhaps Globe did me a favor by making me ex-boyfriend lose it then..... still, when you drop a few hundred dollars on a bill, you expect to get service and a pleasant experience, not a miserable one. \n\nThank you, Globe, for the miserable memories.
