Great easy theater in the middle of Las Vegas.  Very nice & lots of movie options.  Great stadium seating & tons of restaurants and shopping in Town Square before of after your movie.  Plenty of parking in Town Square & a full bar in the theater.  Now all they need is a restaurant in the theater as well!
