This my home Home Depot! I don't come by all that often, as I have a Lowe's that is closer to home. However, when I do stop by there has always been somebody to direct me and offer advice. The only draw back may be the cashiers who are sometimes a little slow and uninformed to the day's happenings. Overall, I can normally be in and out of here in 20 minutes, which is a bonus for me! ++
