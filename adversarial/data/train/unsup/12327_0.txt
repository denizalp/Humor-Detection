There are few select items that I truly love but don't dare order after seeing the nutritional info. They want you to believe this place is healthy, although it is anything but!!! Don't believe me? Look up the nutritional menu on their website! Aladdin's is a wolf in sheep's clothing..... but I do love their smoothies.
