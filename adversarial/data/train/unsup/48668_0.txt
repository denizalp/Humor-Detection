Not a bad place to come for a bowl of noodles on a cool day. \n\nTheir noodle bowls are customizable and you order by marking what soup base, noodle, and toppings you want. The piece of paper you order on is generally easy to figure out. \n\nI ordered the \"chaochou style dried fish and minced pork fish soup\". The fish soup base wasn't too fishy so I was fine with that. There are plenty of toppings in this bowl. You also get a drink as part of the combo. Overall, decent meal.
