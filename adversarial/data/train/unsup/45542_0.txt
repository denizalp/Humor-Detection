Confession: I'm not a clothes snob. I figure that if it looks good on, feels good, and it's affordable, that is cool enough by me. I have never once had a person walk up to me, turn me around, and pull down the neck of my shirt to read the label to validate my existence. Therefore, I shop at Aeropostale. Best fitting, most comfortable and cheapest blue jeans I've found anywhere. They last forever, too. That's about all I buy here, but I did find a yoga top on the clearance rack for $1.99, so I snagged that too. If I told you how much I paid for the jeans, you'd call me a liar, so I won't bother. But check them out if you want to have hella more money left in your pocket for more fun things to do while wearing your awesome new jeans :-)
