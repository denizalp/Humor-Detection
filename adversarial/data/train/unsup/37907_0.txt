The Abandoned room was super fun! Definitely needs a lot of teamwork with 2 teams split between 2 rooms at first. 2 free hints in 45 minutes. They use cool direction locks for this one and lots of clever letter\/number clues. Creepy music sets the mood pretty well. We had 8 people and it's definitely a room that needs lots of people to work together at the same time to win. No tech malfunctions which is a plus. Will definitely be back for another room!\nGroupon was $50 for 4 people on weekend.
