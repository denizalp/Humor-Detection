Paige is not only an amazing stylist, she's your new BFF. The comfort and ease you feel the second you enter literally makes life better. I'm active duty Air Force and not only does she honor us with FREE hair cuts and an amazing discount, but she truly makes me feel appreciated. I moved here recently and already knew that she was the first stylist I wanted to try based on reviews and the single phone call we had where she bent over backwards to fit me in before my first day in the new job. She listened and executed exactly what I wanted all while making me feel like we had been life long friends. Her upbeat attitude, professionalism, hilarious personality, dedication to her craft, and will to please make her chair absolutely unforgettable. I 100% recommend.
