What a little gem in Shadyside. I lived here for 3 years right down the road and never went here. However, I just went in last night for the $3 veggie burger special! Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the special was only for 9-midnight, but that did not stop me from still getting the burger and leave me wanting to go here next Wednesday night. A friend and I stopped in here after work and just made it in time for happy hour- which I would say is not very good compared to similar restaurants (drafts are only $1 off). However, the list is pretty incredible and they do have good drinks specials on other nights (I think I read they have $1 mixed drinks on Thursday nights, which makes me want to go back tonight and take the morning off work tomorrow!). We received our burger check list and I was pleasantly surprised and the diversity of sauces, toppings, and add-ons to my burger. You can get up to 4 toppings free- further, the happy hour included half-off a basket of fries. The quality of the burger was very good. I enjoyed the food, the venue (which I didn't realize until I walked out that there is an entire second floor with a full bar and tables upstairs), and I am looking forward to coming back to enjoy some of the specials.
