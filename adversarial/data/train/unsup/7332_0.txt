The great reviews are well deserved. The food is great!\nThe Cubana Mexicana sandwich is BOMB! I do not like hot dogs so I subbed them for avocado and it was everything I expected and more! I had it for lunch and dinner, and was left full both times.\nI also enjoyed the Pozole. My first time trying this soup and it was delicious. I like that it's a little sour and hearty at the same time. Really good!\nThe Gordita was a first time try for me as well. It speaks to me because I'm a gordita at heart :) It was soooo good! Fluffy tortilla with chicken (comes with your choice of meat), and cheese. \nThe fresca's are supersized and mixed to order. \nThe restaurant is super clean and the ladies behind the register are sweet. Chef really does his thang, the food reflects the time he takes to prepare it.\nThe menu has a variety of sea food dishes that I look forward to trying. There is so much to come back for!
