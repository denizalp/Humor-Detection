This little hole in the wall is like a diamond in the rough!  I'm very thankful to have been introduced to this Charlotte legacy.\n\nWith daily specials and down-home southern hospitality, it's a win all the way around.  Everything is homemade \"just like Grandma used to make it!\"  My goto comfort foods are the mac-n-cheese and the chicken and dumplings.  They're oh so good, but a word to the wise:  the dumplings aren't available everyday.  Based on the specials calendar, you can expect to get you a good helping on Thursdays.  Sometimes they will serve them up as a part of their Saturday rotation, but there are no guarantees.\n\nI've also tried the chili, banana pudding, eclair pie (which is more like eclair pudding), quiche, green beans, etc.  I've yet to be disappointed.  This isn't your high-class, white tablecloth type of establishment, so lower your expectations.  Keep it casual and go for the food.  If you're looking for glitz and glam, keep on keepin' on.
