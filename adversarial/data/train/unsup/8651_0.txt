Telus Special Restaurant #1\n\nI am glad I can take advantage of the Telus April Specials that offers at Woodlot, where one can order a main and get free appetizer and dessert.\n\nWoodlot does utilized the space really well.. downstairs with the open kitchen has this buzzing and energetic vibes, while it is cozy up in the loft! And with the dim lighting, even your date looks so much more sexier... \n\nGrilled Scallops ($14) \n- it was really fresh and have this nice olive oil vinaigrette sauce to round it off... \n\nGrilled Haddock served on couscous($21) \n- The fish was pan fried to be crispy outside and the fish was fresh and flaky.. but I think I will try another dish next time..it is good but did not WOW me!\n\nFrench Onion Soup Veggie Style ($8) \n- it is really flavoured.. surprising since it is not made with beef broth... and a taste of sweetness... (you sure it is vegetarian??) \n\nSoma Chocolate pudding ($8) \n- love those crunchy toppings... with rich tasting chocolate and a touch of orange puree.. \n- scrap scrap the jar, lick lick the spoon, smile smile that smile (oh I think I am embarrassing myself in public!!) \n\nApple Tatin ($8) \n- I usually loves apples.. but this not doing anything for me!! \n- the apple has this funny texture.. soggy..tasted bitter... and it does not even go well with the gelato... \n\nGreat value because of the Telus specials...The food were all nicely prepared, with complex flavour... I would come if Woodlot have special offers again... \n\nI have to say, Woodlot is great to dine with vegetarians...that separate menu is just awesome.. made life easy for everyone!
