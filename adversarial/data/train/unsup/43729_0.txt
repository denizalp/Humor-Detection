This museum is a must stop when visiting Vegas.  It's on a major street and its only a 5-10 min drive from the strip.  This place is big and with lots of fun, old school pinball machines.  \n\nThere's staff there working out of of commission machines and if you ever have an issue with a game, bring to the attention of the staff and they'll fix it right away.\n\nThe best part is, after rent and utilities are paid, the rest of the money collected from the machines go to charity.  Suhweet!!
