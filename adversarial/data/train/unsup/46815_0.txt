My boyfriend has been getting my V-day flowers from here for 4 years now.  I couldn't ask for better quality or more beautiful flowers.  I love carnations and for those of you who don't know, they last for weeks and look lovely.  These will last past my b-day in March, and still look as good as the day he gave them to me.  \nMy family has used Browns for years and we have never been happier.\n\n2\/120\/14  UPDATE:\n\nI just want to say that this year Brown's went above and beyond.  The store is not open on Sunday which was his day off. The VERY nice lady with whom he placed the order, told him, after an explanation of why he could not be there before 5 since he was still at work, told him that that was fine and that he could come after 6 since she would still be there!  I mean really, how cool is that?  He hauled rear and got there shortly before 6,  but still, the fact that  they were willing to work with him?  Honestly, I don't see us ever using anyone else.
