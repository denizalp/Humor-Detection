A lot of French people were real deal eating here on Christmas morning. What does that tell you? If I go to a Chinese restaurant and see a bunch of old Asians eating there, I know the place is legit. Well, so is BARDOT Brasserie! Plus, you know Las Vegas has become a culinary destination when French people both work and vacation there. I was kinda surprised.\n\nWe had perfect Micheladas and split Lobster Benedict with a generous serving of Maine lobster on croissants smothered in what they called a sauce Bernaise, but it had a delicious pinch of nutmeg in it that suited the shellfish. Newburgh? We also had a fris√©e aux lardons salad. Otherwise the eggs came with no sides. It's a dish best split like we did, like vol au vent with bacon and salad. Exactly what you want for Christmas brunch. Skip the buffets and still get the good stuff.\n\nOh, and it really is The Best Butter in the World. It came with a warm demi baguette in a paper bag.
