Just like Central Bistro, this place is WAY TOO LOUD. The 25 people in the bar sound like 150 and we have have to scream to hear each other. Pity cuz the appies we had were decent. There are way too many more audibly reasonable places to choose from to bother returning, despite the fact that we live nearby. Sorry Stella, would rather head to Hillstone where we can have a conversation and not have to scream like we are at a G n R concert.
