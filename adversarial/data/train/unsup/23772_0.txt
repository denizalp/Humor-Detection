Cold Stone Creamery, good customer service! I have enjoyed Cold Stone for many years. What strikes me is that their product is consistently good and so is their customer service. My family love the cake batter ice cream and the cookie dough mix-in in cups. I enjoy the Jamocha ice-cream with sugar cone. Good job, Cold Stone! Bad job for my waist-line.
