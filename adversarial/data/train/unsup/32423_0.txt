Foodora e-mailed me with a $12 voucher and I've been looking to try this place for some time so I got the ravi slaw, corn chowder, and the steak wrap.\n\nPositives: fresh healthy ingredients, unique menu, fast service \n\nNegatives: ravi slaw was questionable, mediocre taste?\n\nOverall 3.5 stars: everything was just meh- reading these other reviews I guess I expected too much. The corn chowder and the ravi slaw were a bit disappointing for my taste, and the steak wrap was weird at first because there were too many yams until I got to the center and found the BRIE CHEESE which made it so much better (man I love dem cheezez). Maybe I'll try a different menu another time seeing as all these other reviews seem to be loving it.
