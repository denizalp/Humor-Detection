Since moving to a bigger location near the other designer handbag brands (Kate Spade, Dooney & Bourke, Michael Kors, LeSportsac), it seems less crowded and hectic, but you will still see asian tourists carrying large bags (indicating large purchases) from this very store. You are greeted with friendly faces as you enter the store- the employees are crisply dressed in black and white (the uniform), and from time to time, will offer you a \"20% off your entire purchase\" coupon. Since it is larger, there are lots of products here- wallets (saw some for $39), coin purses (saw some for $25), wristlets, travel pieces, clothing, and the big attraction: purses- hobos, satchels, crossbody (saw some for $79), small ones (saw some for $79), mid-size ones (I saw a nice mid size black leather hobo shoulder bag for $119), and large ones in a rainbow of colors (making women who like handbags, feel like a kid in a candy store). If you go to the very back, there are a couple sections that have bags at 50% off the red-marked prices (red penned price indicates marked down price from retail price). Usually you will see employees with calculators with customers (final push to buy?) but that helps the customers decide on the purchase. \n\nJust because this is an outlet store with lower than retail prices, this in no way indicates that these handcrafted Coach leather products are damaged (no rips, holes, or stains- you won't see that here)- just past season inventory (and there's nothing wrong with that). A designer bag shopper's heaven- come here and you'll see why.  Choosing the perfect bag might be hard with all the variety of goods found here. Crazy busy during Christmas time.
