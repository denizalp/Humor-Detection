Great food! I can't remember the name of the sushi roll we ordered but it was one of the house favorites! Definitely worth a try. Great service!\n\nWe went back as a group of 5 and sat at a hibachi table. We have each been to hibachi restaurants 7+ times, but our chef Oliver Queen (pictured) found a way to make it even more fun and entertaining! Request him as your chef!!
