I do security in the complex this restaurant resides, so I have alot of choices there St Scottsdale 101 location. I am a regular and ay the moment I am the Dutch. \n\nFood: Ive had Carne esada burrito and tacos many times. The tortillas are tasty (slightly thin for my liking), the steak is absolutely the best I've ever tasted. It's smokey, hint of spicy, and tender! \nI usually just add rice, beans and red sauce. \n\nPrice: the cost for the food isn't to bad but it's not low. The steak well hike the cost but it's worth and that's what matters. \n\nSeating: The restaurant offers inside and outside seating with umbrellas to block the sun. They provide the condiments bar, a digital drink machine by Coke, and Hispanic drink dispenser as well. \nThe service isnt bad at all, you can tell some of the workers are still learning the customer service curve but they are attentive and work fast. The workers are great people here and the food is tasty. \nCOME EAT!!!
