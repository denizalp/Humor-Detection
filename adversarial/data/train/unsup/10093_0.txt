We rented a van for 3 days and it was the worst place by far that we have rented from. My first experience was great but this time around was nothing like that. Before leaving the place you are to go over the car at the shack with a worker to mark the scratches and what not. Well that guy didn't even care so I did a walk around and basically filled out the paper myself for my protection because this van had scratches all over. Now to top that of we drove for about 10 minutes and the TPMS light came on. So for our safety we stopped at the nearest gas station and filled up all tires. At the gas station we also had to clean all windows because there were water spots on every single window, making it hard to see out. Not only was the outside of the van dirty but so was the inside, it looked and smelled as if they had never cleaned it at all. The only pro to this rental was the fact that we made it to our destination and back in one piece with no breakdowns or problems. So with that said, not recommending or renting from here again. Go elsewhere!\n\n\nPros:\n- made it to Aneheim, California and back to Las Vegas Nevada with no problems\n\nCons:\n- dirty van inside and out\n- shack employee doesn't care about his job\n- TPMS light kept turning on and off throughout the trip (we told them about this when we returned the car but they didn't care)\n\n\n*  when we were returning our van, another customer had just returned his rental and he returned 20 mins later because he realized he forgot something in there and the counter informed him that they just rented his car out so whatever he left back in the car was still in there. (Now I know why my van was dirty and smelly) not only that but he also informed us that his car was having mechanical problems and what not.
