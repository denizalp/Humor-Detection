My first time visiting Coco and the Director was on a Friday night. I was disappointed to see so few people there because I really think this could be a huge competitor to Amelie's in uptown. My fianc√©e and I were looking for a place that served alcohol and coffee in a coffee shop setting. We tried out Coco and the Director and were not disappointed! \n\nThey have this crazy unique stadium seating facing a projector. The staff mentioned to us that they plan to show Panthers games on a big screen. Also, they said that you could buy any beer or wine at Stoke and bring it over. \n\nWe'll be back to Coco. The ONLY downside is that you have to pay for parking but there is an LAZ lot that is $5 after hours nearby on Church St.\n\nOverall, would highly recommend!
