I don't really remember much about Loco Patron because I've only been there once and I was a bit inebriated.  Here's what I do remember:\n-hot\n-cramped\n-sweaty\n-chips\n-salsa\n-tequila\n-prank calling Denise Richards\n\nI should probably go back and update this with something you can actually use.
