This is the first time staying in the Markham area as almost all my usual hotels in downtown area are fully booked.   I had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised.    \n\nThe breakfast was great. The room was clean.  The bed was comfortable.   They have a bunch of eateries next door within walking distance.   \n\nThe only problem is their distance to downtown with the constant traffic jam on Don Valley Parkway- usually take 40-60 mins each way.
