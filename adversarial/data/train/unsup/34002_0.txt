We are visiting Vegas and I wanted to find a reasonably priced foot massage so I was happy to find this place. It's located in a strip mall, so super easy parking.\n The massage area is open but very dark and partitioned off front the front door and windows. Comfortable lounge chairs to stretch out. Low light and nature's music playing softly add to the comfortable atmosphere. \nI was the only person there that I saw other than the male masseuse.  Even though i was fully clothed he layed a large towel over my body, which made me feel more secure and more able to fully relax. He worked on my feet using reflexology and what a pleasure. Strong hands worked out all the tight spots.  If I lived here I would be back weekly.
