We were in Vegas last week for my birthday so I wanted to do something special, so I went looking for a deal on Groupon. I was so happy to find a couples massage for $99! I called and booked my appointment a couple weeks in advance and they called to confirm the day before. The spa was set up very nice, soothing relaxing music and atmosphere. If we lived in Vegas(which we might eventually) I would be a regular at this spa. Thank you for making my birthday super relaxing and awesome!
