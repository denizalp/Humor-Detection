Saw this place while at the Habit Grill yesterday and made immediate plans to check it out! We decided to go today on the lunch special ($34.95 for the full churrasco experience) . Lunch hours are held from 11:30 am- 2:00 pm.\n\nMade reservations online and was at the door when they opened!\n\nSalad Bar (5\/5) So many fresh and tasty options! Their caesar salad was fantastic! Also enjoyed the fresh pineapple, salami, peppered and smoked bacon, and asparagus! Countless options available at their salad bar!\n\nSides (5\/5) Cheese bread balls are like crack! Seriously. Very habit forming and addicting! Mashed potatoes were savory as well! \n\nAlso enjoyed the fried bananas to cleanse the palette!\n\nMeats (5\/5) Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Enjoyed so many savory, tasty meats! Lamb chops, fillet mignon, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, sausage, and bacon wrapped filet mignon just to name a few! The filet mignon was my favorite, with the flank steak a close second!\n\nWhat stood out to us was how flavorful the meats tasted. At the only other Brazilian Steakhouse I have been to recently (*Texas*cough*Texas*), their meats tasted too salty. So much so that it really took away from the whole thing. Not here at Fogo! Meats were delicious and full of flavor! Cooked and seasoned superbly!\n\nService (5\/5) Seriously, some incredibly attentive and friendly service! Wildly impressed by how we were treated by everyone, from the first person we saw and spoke to all the way to the very last person we saw and spoke to! All were friendly, personable, and accommodating!\n\nThis was such a fantastic experience that we have plans to bring some of our friends here to share this great place with!\n\nCan't wait to come back!\n\n5 stars.\n\nWoohoo! As good as it gets!
