First, i always like a clean restaurant and a greeting and received both walking in. It is a small, some would say quaint. Menus are under the glass on the tables sodas are in cans. I had the Kalbi plate (only 11.95!!). Wife got the teriyaki salmon plate, older son got two spam musubi and cactus roll. Kalbi arrived and 8 bones with plenty of meat arrived. So worth it! Wife was very quiet and ate everything but the print on the plate. Both the teriyaki sauce on the salmon and the Kali marinade were on point. We we're ib the area from inspirada (about a 40 min drive) and we will be making the drive here again soon. Great food at reasonable prices.
