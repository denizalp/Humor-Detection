DMC systems is ahhhhhmazing!!!!! When I contacted Dave, he gave me several options that fit my budget without compromising the quality of the product. Upon contacting DMC systems, Dave was very professional,  courteous and very knowledgeable about home theaters, TV mounting, security cameras and etc. He returned my calls\/emails promptly. He explained the installation process and the products in such a way that I understood - I'm not tech savy :( \n\nI had installed a surround sound system in my great room. The system sounds incredible. The install was clean, with no visible wires and the equipment used was TOP NOTCH! Very neat and clean!!! He also stood by the equipment he used and provided warranties. This put me at ease. \n\nI don't like having people inside of my house - but Dave was credible and trustworthy. I felt comfortable with him being inside of my house to complete the install. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my surround sound system. I highly highly recommend DMC Systems! I will be adding security cameras in the near future. What are you waiting for??? Call DMC systems now and get your stuff done right!!!!!!
