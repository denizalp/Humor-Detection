We first tried to visit this restaurant for Lunch Sunday 8\/12\/18.\nThe hostess was quick to say. \"We're closed\".  It was 1:50pm and they only serve brunch on Sundays till 2pm which would have been nice to know upon check in to the hotel.  \nThe hostess never offered any alternatives, concern or smile.  I understand it was the end of her shift but a hostess should always greet with a smile not a frownie face and a quick, \"WE'RE CLOSED\".\n\nDinner Sunday night 8\/12\/18\n\nThe decor is very nice.  The front bar\/lounge is very inviting.\nI believe this restaurant has the bones to be listed in the top restaurants of LV list but...\n\nThe lighting at the table was not good for reading the menu we did need to use our phone flashlights.\n\nOur waiter, meh.  Needs training.\nI asked him about the house chardonnay. I asked him specific taste questions. He left the table and I assumed he was going to get me a taste of the wine but I see him returning with the full glass of wine.  Drops it off and quickly exits.  I thought that was a bit weird, my guess was he didn't want to talk about it.  At first I was miffed given he didn't indicate one way or the other his intentions but all turned out well, the wine turned out to be really good.\n\nWe started with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip w\/ pita chips $13.  \nThe dip was good but the dark baked pita chips were wrong in flavor and texture. Too dark and too thick.\n\nMy friend ordered the Tagiatelle Pasta (lobster, shrimp, spinach, scallions, garlic, saffron butter) $32.  Ok, not great, very heavy. Would not order it again.\n\nIt was my b'day celebration so I ordered my favorites.  \nCaesar Salad $10 w\/ added shrimp $8  (3 small shrimp) \nand a side Lobster Tail $48. \n \nThe Caesar dressing was good, not great.  \nThe 3 shrimp that came with it were burnt, needed to be sent back. \nOK, first the chef should have just redone them given they were obviously burnt and if they did happen to slips by the chef then the waiter should have said no way and made him re-do them but no, I have to say the shrimp are burnt.\n\nLobster looked excellent at first sight but the middle turned out to be way under cooked, mushy. The exterior looked done so that tells me the heat was too high to cook the lobster fully.  \nVERY disappointed.  I told the waiter and he asked me what I wanted him to do.  I said, please take this and take care of it. \nA manager brought me my plate of cut up lobster back reheated. I can only guess, microwaved.\nThe presentation was not one of a fine dining restaurant.   I had a few more bits but left Â¼ left on the plate. That NEVER happens when it comes to lobster and me.\n\nWe also ordered a side dish of Crispy Brussel Sprouts (tomato, hollandaise, tarragon) $9.  Crispy means burnt. This dish could have been excellent if the chef had browned the sprouts not burn them. \n\nWe found out we were offered a dessert and coffee complements of the house. Our waiter mumbled this but we had to ask what he was talking about.  \nWe declined the offer given we don't do desserts or coffee.  \n\nOn reviewing our bill we asked why the numbers didn't add up. The waiter said they don't list the $48 lobster to the items purchased but if we added it in we'd see that the numbers added up.  \nREALLY!\n\nI did ask to speak with the manager as we exited.  He did come out and said he'd speak with the chef. I told him we had 2 managers greet our table at the beginning of our meal but no one to be seen at the end. \nHe mentioned he did offer the complementary dessert and coffee...   \nThe gesture was too little for the cluster this meal turned out to be.
