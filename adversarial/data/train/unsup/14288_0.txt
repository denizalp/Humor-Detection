While glancing the menu at OPH, we noted that 'challah french toast' \nwas on the menu. My friend the Host With the Mostest in Las vegas (HWMLV), whom I have known for over half of my life, claimed he did not know this word, \"challah\"! \nNutters! \n\nSince college, I had the chance to attend my share of break Fasts, Seders, etc... so 'challah' to me was just another baked good from the Noe Valley Baking company. Everyone knows that, right? Or so I thought! \n\nThank you, HWMLV, for knowing about the two for one deal from the paper. I'm all about the cheap eats.. and I'm all abou the OPH. \nYum, yum, yum. Come hungry and for the best selection: SHARE! \n\nTheir Apple Pancake: There is no reason why one human should be consuming ONE of these in one sitting by themselves. (I'm scared to even ask about the nutritional value of it, but eating ONE would be akin to eating 4-5 apple fritters. At least.) \n\nTheir house specialty is this apple pancake (see pic above), created with care and it comes out hot, fluffy and much like an apple pastry. IN any case, it's a must try, in my book. \n\nCinnamony and chewy, it's a nice start to the day (even though we got started kinda late, but you know Vegas) \n\nWe also split the eggs benedict (see pic above) which comes with a side of 4 potato pancakes. Yummy, but these thin potato pancakes were thin crepe like concoctions... unlike the thick fried patties of goodness I remember from my college days.  No worries, it was still quite tasty. \n\nNOTE: the applesauce and sour cream that arrive with your meal is the accompaniment to the potato pancakes. Just FYI. I think you all knew that though. \n\nThe eggs benedict hollandaise sauce was quite yellow and eggy, but the balance of ham\/egg\/english muffin was perfect... \n\nNEXT time we're going to share the Dutch Baby Pancake. \nReminder. It's not Dutch BOY. That's a Paint. \n\nBut I think you all know that, too.
