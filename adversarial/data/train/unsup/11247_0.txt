Vegas must be seriously hard up for some donuts if this is considered the best place in the city. We got the much raved-about apple fritter and a cinnamon twist, and they were below supermarket quality. They were a waste of calories which is why I usually avoid donuts in the first place. Based on the reviews, I thought the Ronald's would be exceptional.\n\nThe coffee was godawful. It was our first coffee of the morning which is always badly needed, but we couldn't get down more than a few sips.\n\nService was friendly, and prices were good, however.
