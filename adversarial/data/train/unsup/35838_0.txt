Came to egg works with a Groupon. Get their geoupon! Worth the deal. We paid 26 for $40 worth of food.  \n\nI got the crazy chicken and my husband got the Brad's scramble. If you are a coffee seinker they offer flavor creamer BTW.\n\nThe crazy chicken at this location is more cheesy than the other locations. Mine was loaded with cheese and even had cheese falling odd the omelette. What I also noticed was they put probably half an advocado in there. I'm not complaining because it was so good.  They do offer an egf white version for an extra $0.95.  Note' the omelette is huge. Definitely a shareable dish. The crazy chicken has adovcado, cheese, chicken, and mushrooms and a dap of sour cream. Take each bite with sour cream and it'll taste even better than ketchup.\n\nMy husband got the Brad's scramble. He stated that it was also too cheesy. Although he took off most of the cheese he really liked it. The brans scramble has no meat. Very vegetarian friendly. \n\nBoth dishses came with a side of potatoes and banana bread. Get the BANANA bread. And eat it with their soft butter. If you had to get one thing, just get the banana bread. If you check in, you'll get a free one. The potatoes has its own seasoning. It kinda taste like seasoning salt bit better. If you like it, they also sell it. \n\nThis location is located next to a McDonald's and a large shopping cennter. Good luck trying to find parking in front or on side of the restaurant. The complex connected to it has plenty of parking and it's a short walk. \n\nPricing here is decent for the amount of food you get. But it's cheaper with the Groupon.
