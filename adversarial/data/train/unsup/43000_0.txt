Really good food,  excellent for an airport!   So our choices were late lunch in the small town we were staying at or come to the airport early.  Hint: the Ruby Tuesday 5 star rating in the little town made this a no brainer. I had the prosecco with peach drink and my husband had the Southern flight (a tequila drink). Both nice,  but pricey at ~$14 (but I've had some pretty terrible airport drinks at that cost...I'm taking about YOU RDU and YOU MCO). Red pepper humus was delicious.  We had a salad and salmon sandwich,  both excellent.  Dessert was berries and chocolate which was assorted berries with whipped cream and thin,  milk chocolate.  Worth the price for the quality of the food,  especially at an airport!
