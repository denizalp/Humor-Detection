The only memories I have of my college geology courses were volcano types, cleavage bursts, something about not cleaning marble tiles with some kind of liquid, and \"dropping acid\" during lab. Other than that, I'm a novice when it comes to the science behind rocks. But rock knowledge is an unnecessary prerequisite for visiting \nJewelry & Minerals (J&M). \n\nJ&M is large shop with three rooms that house plenty of beautiful rocks, many with names ending in \"ite\" (the Peruvian Amazonite I've seen are gorgeous!). Rocks are sold polished and unpolished and some have been shaped into pyramids, spheres, skulls, and animals. While most of the rocks in the front end of the store seem suited for decorative purposes, in the back end of the shop is another room for rocks and  that can be used to create jewelry. \n\nStaff members at J&M are approachable and knowledgeable. They even provide services like crystal tuning, which is what I overheard one young lady request. If you hear a ringing sound while wandering throughout the store, that's probably a crystal being tuned.\n\nRock nerds are going to love J&M. Even if you don't know anything about rocks, Jewelry & Minerals of Las Vegas is a cool, one-of-a-kind store to explore if you're in the area.
