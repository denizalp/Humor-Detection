I was REALLY generous in giving KSC 3.5 stars the first time out...\n\nIn Baseball, you only get THREE strikes...I was really generous and gave the bear FOUR until I said NO MAS.....\n\nIt's not snow....nor is it cream....It has a crunch, it is very sweet and syrupy and worst of all, artificial.\n\nI will suffer big time withdrawal symptoms before I step foot in here again because its only a matter of weeks before the real deal comes to Chinatown...\n\nbtw....BIG thank you to the new Duke\/Duchess of Kuma!!!    ALOHA!!!!
