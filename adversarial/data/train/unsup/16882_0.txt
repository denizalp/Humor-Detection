Location is great and if they had new seats I'd be happier going to this theater.  They also just started serving alcohol.  I hate to compare them to AMC, but that's kind of their competitors.  They need a makeover.  \n\nOn the positive side if you have a Green Valley players card or have one and are over 55, you get perks.  You'll have to ask them exactly what they are.  Before or after the movie, you can gamble, eat or walk into The District easily, which I also like that about AMC, the convenience.  Staff is always friendly.
