What a beautiful club, Loved the waterfall and the decor. \nGreat music and the bathroom lighting was flattering :) yes, that's important. \n\nI think we arrived way to early, the dance floor was quite empty. Quite the sausage fest on a Thursday night. \n\nStayed for an hour and a half then ended up leaving. \n\nI think I'm getting to old for Vegas nightclubs.\n\nCan someone steer me and my flask to a Piano Bar or Blues club next time?\n\nRANDOM FACT:\nTryst means an appointed place of meeting.
