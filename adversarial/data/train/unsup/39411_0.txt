Too many other options to return.  We've tried this place 3 times...STRIKE OUT!  Honestly the food is decent; but there a real issues with this place.  First time was at lunch and it took FOREVER and entrees came out 1 at a time. Waiter was completely flustered.  The second time was after the dinner rush and my husband and I sat at the bar.  We could hear voices screaming and people walking around in a huff.  Disgruntled customers were treated terribly when they voiced their disappointment with their service and food.  The third time we had dinner on the patio with the dogs.  While it's a nice patio; I'm not so sure I like servers petting dogs and then delivering meals...I'm sure it happens.  But again the service was terrible.  15 minutes to get a cocktail.  The waiter apologized for the long wait; but basically ignored us and wouldn't make eye contact.  Other parties seated after us were served way before we were. Finally another server delivered our food and said she was taking over our table.  Not sure if our original guy quit or got fired; but we saw him leaving the property as we finished our meal.  I can only guess that management and training here is terrible and there is a lot of trickle down negative behaviors going on.  Never again.
