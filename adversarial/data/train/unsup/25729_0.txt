Gummy heaven! All kinds.. shapes, sizes... flavors... gummy-filled ones, traditional worms and bears if you're the conservative type :).\n\nNot a place for the waist watching kind! Indulge in the old school sugary goodness - lemon heads, boston baked beans, pixy stix, laffy taffy, nerds, warheads....\nYou get my point.\n\nBuy by combined weight so mix match to your heart's desire! Great snack and easy to get to location next to Paris!
