What a disappointment!\n\nI was starving when I came here, so I ordered a smoothie plus boba, and a Turkey Club on a croissant with avocado and extra veggies, then tipped the cashier.  I love sandwiches and boba, so I waited with high anticipation for a fresh, delicious sandwich on par with the quality Lee's popularity suggests.  Imagine my dismay when I instead got a stale, old, tough croissant with pre-squished avocado, a minimal amount of meat and veggies, and WAYYYYYY too much mayonnaise!\nDon't bother with the boba either, it's really hard and not fresh.  The smoothies don't taste like real fresh fruit either, even though they say they are. Funny, I didn't know jackfruit could be shipped to Nevada without being frozen. -_-;;  The smoothie I got didn't even taste like frozen jackfruit... it tasted like a premade flavoring added to a mix.\n\nI should also mention that the cashier was fairly rude while I was ordering, like I was an inconvenience to her in showing up and politely expecting her to do her job for a minute and a half. \n\nI was so hungry when I came here that I would have accepted even Subway as passible food.  For me to feel this badly about what they offered is a pretty abysmal first experience.  Due to such a stark lack of redeemable qualities I won't be returning... not even at 2 in the morning, not even if every other place is closed... I'd rather go to a fast food joint, eat a Cliff bar, or starve.
