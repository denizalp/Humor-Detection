Love this place! My boyfriend and I had dinner there on Sunday night and we were blown away by the pork mole. Best pork mole I've had in the valley, I travel weekly to Mexico and this is the first mole I've had that even comes close to anything I've I had south of the border.  My boyfriend got the chimichurri ribeye steak dinner, and it was outstanding. Service was excellent, Daaiim our server made perfect reccomedations. \nThere was a band in the lounge that we weren't expecting, but they were excellent. We love live music this was a nice surprise, we'll be back!\nKeep up the great work!
