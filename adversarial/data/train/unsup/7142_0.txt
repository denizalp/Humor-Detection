I have never been to a GameWorks, so I'm not sure what I was expecting. \n\nIt is unlike other gaming lounges in that they don't integrate the gaming, food and bar areas very well. They have a defined bar and restaurant area that is pretty much empty every time I've ever passed through and then there is a small gaming floor with a mixture of ticketed gaming machines for kids and other video game machines. \n\nI think if they had spread this area out a bit more there would be more room to move around and enjoy the games. It was overly crowded and there weren't too many games that looked worth the time and money to play. The only ones that did were packed and had long waits.\n\nThere are so many improvements that could be made here to make it better.
