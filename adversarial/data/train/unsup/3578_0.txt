We met up with a buddy of ours this past weekend for some wings and beer. First off, the server we started with wasn't the server we finished with, she got busy and apparently handed off some of her tables. \n\nWe started off with potato skins and a half order of nachos. The menu states it comes with your choice of meat but our server never asked us what type of meat. It all happened so fast that we didn't really get a chance to specify. Of course the nachos came out without any meat, I'm assuming when he puts the order in he's prompted to choose the meat and he decided to just put no-meat instead of coming to ask us. When the nachos came, I asked about it and he said in an accusatory tone \"you didn't specify\". I didn't like him, he had an attitude the whole time. \n\nThe music playing when we got there was great, a little old school alternative. But, in the middle of our meal they changed it to rap music, very-very loud rap music. While I do listen to that music, it has a time and a place. Mid-afternoon in a sports bar is not the place. \n\nBetween the service and the unenjoyably atmosphere, we will not be back.
