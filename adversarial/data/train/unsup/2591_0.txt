This concept of this place is really interesting; the execution could have been a little more delicious. \n\nThis had quite the date night atmosphere, low lighting, and a classy vibe. I felt a little under-dressed but nothing notable. The person who sat us almost forgot to ask if we had ever been there, but he remembered last minute and was able to explain how to do things. Happy hour is limited; I got a house white wine, bacon wrapped dates, and truffle fries from that menu and a medium bowl so I could experience all they had to offer. \n\nThey have what looks like a buffet, and you grab a bowl, and they cook everything you can fit in your size bowl on a giant circular slab.  Well, that's how it was explained. In reality, THEY grab a bowl for you and carefully portion everything you want. So the whole tagline of \"you can have as much as you want as long as it fits in your bowl\" is slightly dishonest, They have many sauces, I tried soy ginger which was fun. I opted to watch the chef cook my food, and that was entertaining, but they do have the option of delivering it back to your table. \n\nI wish that they had a menu of \"favorite combos\" or something. It wasn't delicious,  but I am sure it COULD have been had I chosen the correct combination. \n\nThe truffle fries were average, and I am glad I tried them during happy hour because otherwise, they would be highly overpriced. The bacon wrapped dates were my favorite thing. I even ate all the decorative lettuce under them! If they had added more lettuce and whatever sauce was on them it could become a salad that I would come back for!\n\nUntil then, it was eh. I'd come back if I had friends in town that wanted to feel like they were trying something that was unique.
