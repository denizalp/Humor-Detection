Located in the Bow Valley building in downtown Calgary. It's easily accessible via the +15s and convienent for the lunch crowds that don't want to venture outside towards Chinatown.  Explains why it's especially busy during the winter, although it's usually pretty steady at lunchtime. So if you're craving Vietnamese noodles (pho), korean BBQ or even Chinese stirfrys and don't want to venture outdoors during lunch, make sure to arrive a bit early or late to avoid the rush.\n\nMy usual is either the Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup (pho) with rare beef or the Rice Vermicelli. The flavors here are decent, they're not bad considering it's location. As mention above you can also choose their rice plates, which I haven't tried. They also offer traditional Vietnamese percolated coffee with the condensed milk, which has a nice strong coffee taste, where some places might tend to water down their coffee. It seems to be pretty authentic here. \n\nAll in all not a bad place for lunch if you don't want to face the cold Calgary weather, but they also lack a lot of dishes that are at typical Vietnamese restaurants so make sure to check out their menu before you get a table. It might be that you'll need to venture out to Chinatown to get what you're craving after all.\n\nOh one more thing though, they are QUICK. So if you're looking for a fast lunch. This would be a good place, if they're not packed and even if they are. There's always take out.
