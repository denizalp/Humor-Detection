I purchased the Turbo Elite for our Island and it fit perfectly! Jason was very very helpful and went beyond making sure we were satisfied! I did my research for weeks on size, price and products. We have a 12 year old island that the grill finally deteriorated. I thought we might be stuck with an empty cutout for a while! Barbeques Galore has the best prices for a great product. Jason emailed to check in on us and walked us through instructions as my son and I did the install ourselves. He was thorough and went over the warranty in detail. Very professional!
