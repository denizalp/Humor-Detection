Absolutely gonna give 5 stars. My gosh I don't know if it was because I was starving but my Shrimp Cobb Salad was one of the best salads I have ever eaten by far. \n\nEverything about it was tasty. It had fresh cooked bacon, edamame, corn, yellow cherry tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, thin sliced carrots and radishes. It also had a very light ranch dressing on it. The lettuce was crisp.\n\nMy husband ordered the Ahi Salad and he can be pretty lucky when it comes to food. He normally likes A good steak but opted to eat light too and ordered the lunch size portion.\n\nWe had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated at 545pm on a Wednesday. It was pretty busy when we arrived. \n\nServer was extremely pleasant and the person who delivered our food was as well.  \n\nBig menu choices to choose from. I could have easily ate a hearty meal but thought I better be good for some chocolate at the Godiva store near by.
