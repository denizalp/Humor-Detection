Honestly, the service here isn't the greatest. It does take quite a bit of time for anyone to come out and help. I told the server when I first walked in that we had a cake for a family members birthday as a surprise...but when I later joined the table and she took our orders...she asked who's birthday it was...without us even mentioning it...kinda ruined the surprise there. Either way, they were a help to us...but did take long. \n\nThe pizza is always good, but what I actually enjoyed was the wings, thought those were good.
