I've been to the other Crab Corner location, and enjoyed the food a lot.\n\nThis past Friday night was the fist night of Karate Karaoke at Crab Corner, so I was SUPER excited to come out.  I used to go to 3 Tomatoes all the time on the weekends, so it was exciting to be back.\n\nThe exterior hasn't changed at all.  The interior really hasn't either, except now they have a huge tank with live blue crab, and they've painted a little...\n\nNow, onto the food.\n\nEver since my last experience at Crab Corner, I've wanted to try the crab cakes.  My fella isn't big on crab cakes, but agreed to get the appetizer (4 minis) to try.  \n\nWhen they came out, I was concerned.  They are TINY...and really expensive.  \nBut after one bite, let me tell you, they were 100% worth the money.\nThere is SO MUCH CRAB MEAT IN THESE TINY BITES OF AWESOME!  This is going to be a regular item for me, I can tell.  SO delicious. \n\nWe also had the cod, and the clams with hush puppies and fries:  Everything was delicious!  \n\nDrinks were pretty decent...they had a $3 mystery shot, and $3 well whiskey....PBR was $4 at the beginning of the night, but I think it went down to $3 after karaoke started. \n\nService was pretty good.  The bartender seemed a little abrasive at the beginning of the night, but she warmed up to us, and ended up being pretty darned cool.  \n\nKaraoke was incredible, as usual.  The host was fun, and it was great to be singing on the patio again!\n\nI can't wait to come back again.  Karaoke was shut down early this week, but from what I understand its supposed to be 10-2 this Friday night.
