After the abominable Mandy's pizza closed, I was shocked to see Pastoli's go into here practically overnight.  Reluctant to try Pastoli's in case this was just an owner renaming, I finally stopped in here a few nights ago.\n\nFor a pizza place, Pastoli's is shockingly inviting.  There is a big comfy couch and tables.  My friend and I rolled in at 11:15 PM on a Saturday night.  The help was so nice, and our food came out super speedy.  We were instantly served cheese fries ($4.50) that were pretty standard.  We also got an extra large pizza with half tomato and half pineapple.  The crust was good, and they use a sweet sauce.  Toppings were an average amount.  While we did not need gluten free or other options, Pastoli's does cater to those with allergies, which is pretty cool.\n\nEveryone who worked here was beyond pleasant in their interactions, and the pizza was quite good!  On top of that, as they close at midnight, the staff did not rush us at all.  Very impressed!
