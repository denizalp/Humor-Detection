Lumberjacks takes on a refreshing change in breakfast food!  It's not like your IHOP or Dennys. Service was great and attentive the entire time.\n\nWhen the food came out, I ordered the breakfast burrito, it was flavorful. The food wasn't very hot though and the hash browns were a bit lukewarm. The fact that the food wasn't hot brought my rating to a 3. If it were hotter I think the flavor would have been even bolder, for an overall better food rating.\n\nWorth a try, and a good experience overall.
