Like all the food on Vegas' strip, OVER PRICED.  I don't think it was worth paying $16.00 for a bowl of beef noodle soup.  If this was the best beef noodle soup I ever had,then maybe I am more willing to pay for it. \n\nThe noodle came in a large ceramic bowl that is loaded with noodles and beef, but too little soup.  The ratio of soup to noodle is out of balanced.  Only 1\/3 of the bowl was filled with soup and the rest noodles.  For some people who like to eat a lot, maybe those extra noodles would help, but to me, it's gorse.  To make the matter worse, the noodles are soggy, not tender and chewy at all.   Blah, will not come here again.
