Its definately a local bar. When I decide that I cant muster the energy to go downtown, and pay full price for a dirty pint glass, surrounded by beligerant 50 year old locals, I will probably be that 50 year old local, whining about my state of affairs. The most absolutely predictable bar around, its only saving grace being its fine eye, or irish luck for good music, as the bands here often put on a show. Grab a pound of wings, and listen to some crooners cover a guess who track, and just remember that you probably will never be back here.
