Great little place on a nondescript street in suburban Montreal. I'm guessing the building was once a bank or fast food joint but in any event it is now cozy and comfortable. The Italian cuisine - Northern Italian? - was fresh and full of taste. Interesting entrees to choose from. The wine list was really interesting with many vineyards that were new to me. The staff on both visits have been warm and friendly without interrupting the table conversation. This is a great little place for business travelers - like me - that want more than a bland hotel dining experience. Enjoy!
