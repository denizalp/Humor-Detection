The only reason I'm not leaving a one star review is that Dr Garcia is a wonderful pediatrician. She's thorough and she listens and the kids really like her. We really liked her. She is the only thing we liked about this awful place and apparently she wasn't worth dealing with all the other crap because we have switched doctors.\nThe office staff here is the rudest most ignorant group of individuals I've ever had to deal with in a medical facility. They treat every interaction with you like you are inconveniencing them. They schedule appointments for days the doctor isn't even there and then have to reschedule. The appointments average two hours. Our quickest appointment was one hour. Our longest was three. (Well appointments, not sick.) We once spent over an hour in a room only to be told the doctor wasn't even coming in. \nThe final straw was them holding a form we needed for our daycare hostage for over a month. We called. We went in. They kept saying the doctor would sign it (for $25) but she never did. I wish Dr Garcia would get new employees. Until she does don't go here.
