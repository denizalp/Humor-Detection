Yay, first to review on YELP.  Check the reviews on google, they are pretty much spot on.  It really does feel like you're in Mexico here.  The building is old and junky.  The fact that the receptionist seperates herself from the waiting room with a sliding glass window is pretty comical in itself.  They weren't the friendliest either.  Then I waited over an hour and a half while people coming in kept going in before me.  When I finally walked back and told the nurse what happened she laughed at me.  I had metal splinter shoved up my fingernail.  It wasn't pleasant.  Sorry my arm wasn't chopped off.  Next time I'll try to make it more gruesome.  It will still very painful bitch.  The doctor did her best to remove the metal splinter without numbing it.  She had to cut my fingernail about a third of the way down and still ending up poking underneath my fingernail.  You think that doesn't hurt then try shoving a needle underneath your fingernail and see how far you can get.  This place is ghetto, shitty building, shitty part of town, shitty people, illegal immigrants coming in and out, long waits, etc.  Oh, and now there is a $25 fee for paperwork?  LOL.  As the person next to me remarked, \"Oh, does that mean you will pay me $25 for filling out  the 6 pages of forms you made me fill out?\"  What a pile of shit this place is.  Avoid at all costs.
