This rating is for the nachos only.\nBecause as far as I'm concerned, their nachos will more than compensate for any bad experience you could possibly have here.\n\nThere are so many nachos that even yo momma couldn't finish them all (...is that an inappropriate comment on a public forum?). They come in a huge pile.\n\nI went on Wednesday. There's a special with a pitcher of beer and Kings Cross nachos (salsa, frijoles, ground beef, tomatoes, onions, mixed peppers, jalapenos, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream...are you drooling yet? because I am, writing this description...) all for around $20. yumm!!\n\nWednesday is officially the best day of the week. Move over, Friday. We we we so excited for Wednesday.\n\nPS, valuable life lessons all over the walls, in the bathroom, over the tables...
