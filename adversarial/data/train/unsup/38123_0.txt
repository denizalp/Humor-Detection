This was another find on Yelp and thanks to our success with Bruxie we decided to give this one a go as well. I'm a sucker for a good breakfast sandwich so I was all for trying Eggslut. We somehow missed the fact that this is located in the Cosmopolitan so we got a bit lost trying to find it but nothing major. When we got there the line was wrapped along the wall and down a side hallway. We overheard someone say that they were told that the wait would only be about 30 mins so we decided to wait and they were right. After you order, your food takes about 5\/10 mins to come out so it wasn't bad at all. My boyfriend and I both loved the ingredients that were on the Fairfax but we wanted the wagyu tri-tip steak. Luckily the cashier was accommodating and able to ring us up for the Gaucho with all of the Fairfax fixings. It was a great choice! The steak was tender and flavorful. The sweetness from the caramelized onions and bun went well with the sandwich. The vibe was awesome. Everyone was very friendly and all of the cooks and manager were singing\/dancing along to the music. Since we're from Cleveland, we loved the fact that they played Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. I ordered the fresh-squeezed orange juice and it was delish. Only con is that the prices are a little high for just a sandwich and they don't really have any side dishes. However, I still highly recommend and will be back during my next visit to Vegas.
