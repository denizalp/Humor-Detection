The best burger in Las Vegas! Every few months when I visit, I eat here at least once. It's so good, I have never ordered anything else.\n\n$29 prix fixe (in the lounge or bar only)- a choice of salad, house-ground rib eye burger or fish and chips, fries and dessert. We sit at the bar, enjoy a bottle of champagne (or 2) and Carl takes excellent care of us.\n\nThis time, my more adventurous friend did try the fish and chips (I had a couple bites) and they were good. Not as good as that heavenly burger though:) We started with one Caesar salad and one mixed heirloom tomatoes, both perfect and finished with the butterscotch pudding and snickerdoodle cookies.\n\nBradley Ogden's does seem to attract a lot of celebs, if you have any interest in star-gazing. Over the years I've seen Bette Midler, George Clooney and Tiger Woods, among others.\n\nNice wine list, with lots of Northern California selections at pretty decent prices too.
