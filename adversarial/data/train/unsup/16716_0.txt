The older man with the goatee and the hat gave me a shitty look as soon as I walked in and again after I nicely and politely asked for the food and beer menu. Then he pointed me to the wall and said all our beers are there on the ledge, and walked away\n \nI don't take bs, so I simply walked out and will never return
