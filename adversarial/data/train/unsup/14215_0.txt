Horrible pharmacy. Very disorganized.  Store not familiar with online refills. Messed up my scrip 2 times. The head pharmacist Dave got very combative over the phone with me and told me he would fill it the right way as a favor... What?? You never did it right in the first place what favor? I didn't know employees were allowed to speak that way to customers, I guess at this Walmart you can get away with it. Will pick up my prescription but will NEVER be back. I'm appalled.
