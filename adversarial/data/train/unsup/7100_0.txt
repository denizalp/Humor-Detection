Healthy or happy? I would definitely have to go with happy. Skinnyfats has a ton of stuff on their menu. I decided to try it out with one of my friends for dinner on a Monday night. I was a bit confused about the location but it is pretty convenient for lunch if you work in that area. \n\nIt was fairly busy when I got there. They could tell I was a newbie and the lady explained to me the healthy side and the happy side. She also told me breakfast was served all day. I had already decided to get the Chix on Broadway even before I stepped foot into the door and that is what I got. \n\nThe verdict. A big piece of chicken on the yummiest bun with some truffle fries. I only ate half as it was hearty or maybe I was just trying to be \"healthy.\" ;) the chicken was moist and tender and nothing was overly salty or under salty. My friend liked her BLT (forgot the official name) as well.  There was also Heinz jalape√±o ketchup on the table which gave the fries a lil zing. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back. I want to try the breakfast one day. Seating is limited and is on a first come first serve basis. I liked skinnyfats and I know I'll be back.
