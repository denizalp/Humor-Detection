Favorite Vegas feature. Pure artistry - fountains set to music, an epic scale that is truly Vegas. Features several different shows with a wide range of music and fountain choreography.  Can view the fountains from Bellagio restaurants as well as Cosmopolitan cityview rooms. The effect of the shows at dusk vs. evening is pretty unique, recommend both. Never gets old.
