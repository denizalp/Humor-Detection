The space is really cool, I love the open loft type look and high ceilings and glass.\n\nOn the other hand...\n\n- Parking is all paid parking - parking meter. Teh suck.\n\n- Don't go here if you like people watching - it's dead, probably because not many people want to pay as much to park as it will cost to buy a coffee. \n\nOn the other hand, the music has been stuff like The Clash and Depeche Mode. \n\nI so want to like this place - I think it's a victim of geography, though.
