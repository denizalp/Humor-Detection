Visiting from out of state and needed to get a TB test done. Went into this minute clinic and was told to come back Saturday at any time. Asked if there would be a wait and nurse said no- I could walk in and just needed a signature. NOPE!!!! I ran in after my 8 week old baby finally fell asleep, got there at 2 they close at 530, went to sign in and they were not accepting walk ins!!! Could not get my test read and wasted money. Called corporate and woman on the phone did not know what to do or how to handle my situation. Awful!
