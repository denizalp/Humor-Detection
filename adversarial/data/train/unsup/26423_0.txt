Highly disappointed. My wife and I moved across the US with a 3 year old and a 1 year old. Every move can be stressful with a family. I have moved probably around 15 times in my life in the US and across continents, but rarely have I been so poorly taken care of as a customer. After discussing with a very professional person at first who told us it would take 21 days maximum to delivery from the day of move out (we decided to go for a shared truck to save a little bit of money), we thought we would be in good hands. Sadly we should have not trusted them as they apparently meant 21 days after move in !!!!!!! Who decides ever to wait 21 days after moving in to actually receive your belongings!!!? We are now camping with two little girls, and I had to purchase new items in order to work from a home depot table. Nice. After calling many times and being forwarded to a poor girl in dispatch (always the same one) and being refused to talk to a manager (no courage anyone to face your responsibilities?) we were finally told our load was in Las Vegas in storage (I would not be surprised if it still had not left our previous city), my wife and I feel that we have been lied to from the beginning. We tried to save 1k and decided to go with home movers and are now paying the price. Do not ever work with home movers, or if you do, make sure you are careful as it will differ from what they tell you during the sales speech. Not 21 days, more like 40. Good luck, writing this from a camping chair while my daughters sleep on a rental bed. Yay.
