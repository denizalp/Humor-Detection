Asian people need to think of better names. It either has to do something with a classy adjective (imperial\/royal), colour (red), mystical animal (dragon), or a rock (jade). I mean if you're gonna use the SAME OLD words atleast jazz it up like ..\n\nYum Yum Sexy Unicorn .... y'know? I'd totally go in if I saw unicorn as the business name.. Or not. \n\nANYWAY, if you've been to Crown Princess, this is opened by the same owner so the decor is over-the-top 'Royal' and fit for a king. However there is no red here but complimentary colours of purple and gold.\n\nThe food is pretty good. Above average, but not in my favorites. Their BBQ puff pastry isn't very flavourful, but the crust is nice and flaky. Their sticky rice was presented in a pyramid shaped which was unique and had lots of ingredients. Also their BBQ flour rolls have too much flour and not enough filling bbq pork and spinach.\n\nOh yeah, the service is great btw. Very attentive as to when the teapot is empty.\n\nOverall: I go dim sum a lot and this place is only okay.
