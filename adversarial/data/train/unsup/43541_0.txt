I finally checked out Jewel's Cafe today and I wanted to cry tears of happiness when I took my first delicious bite of chicken and waffles!  I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease recently and have been too scared to eat out, so it was a HUGE relief to not have to worry about getting sick from my meal.  The food was delicious, the cartel coffee was amazing as always and even my boyfriend (who loves his gluten-filled foods) was a fan.  I will definitely be coming back!!  I'm so grateful that this place exists.
