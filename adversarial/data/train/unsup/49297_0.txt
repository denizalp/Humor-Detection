Just had my week after manzilian \"check-up\" and I have\nto tell ya everything came out great.......no ingrowns.\n(pun intended). \n\nI can't say enough about Nadia and her technique. \nShe is thorough and painless......and I will tell you\nthe \"boys and their friend\" haven't been this smooth\nsince before puberty !!.  (My wife says thank you !!)  :) \n    \nI am a believer in Nadia's expertise and highly suggest\nyou ladies and gentlemen set an appointment with her\nfor your Bra or Bro - zillans, or for any of your other skin\ncare needs.  You'll thank yourselves for it... guaranteed !!
