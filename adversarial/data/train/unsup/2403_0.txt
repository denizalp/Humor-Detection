This is your average run of the mill nursery. My wife and I are planning on redoing our backyard and they are very close to us.So we have spent a fair amount of time in here milling over their fair selection of trees,shrubs,and cacti.\n\n The staff is semi distant from there customers and it seems like 1 out of 5 visits we have someone ask if were finding everything ok. But if its not one of the times they ask be prepared to try and find one of the staff members strategically hidden throughout the store.
