Clean and inviting. Instructors were great!\n\nJust be aware that their sculpt class isn't actually \"yoga.\" It's more of an aerobics class with house\/pop music and some yoga stretches thrown in there. As someone that Loves what yoga does for mind, body and spirit... I prefer to avoid the \"booty\" class and \"sculpt\" class. Although, I definitely felt the burn afterwards!\n\nNothing bad to say!\n\nWish they were open 24 hours
