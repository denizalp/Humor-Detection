Grapefruit Moon definitely has a hype machine behind it that gives it too much street cred around town, but I still think this place is A-OK.\n\nI popped in yesterday for a wrap and a cider and it did the trick. It was one of those cursed Toronto downpours, so their beloved patio was wetter than a whale, leaving me inside with the fruit flies. The crispy chicken wrap was very tasty and I heart their spicy mayo, but I really dislike their potato things. Potato things, that aren't fries, I deem cop-out sides. \n\nThis review sounds negative, but when the sun is shining this place is a solid three stars. Three cheers for my fave fruit's lunar namesake. \n\nPEPPER POINTS for living up to their name and having lots of grapefruit-y things on the menu, like greyhounds and grapefruit mimosas.
