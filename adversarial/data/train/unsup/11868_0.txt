I love Bath and Body Works' foaming hand soap. Last Halloween I bought a bottle of blood red liquid and one of green slim. They both smelled heavenly. The red smelled like Red Hot candies, the green smelled like cotton candy.  \n\nA store assistant shared a secret . . . she said little boys will wash their hands for hours with those foaming soaps, so much so, you'll have to run them out of the bathroom. We all know how impossible it is to get little boys to wash their hands . . . She was right . . . it worked like a charm. That got me hooked on stocking up on foaming soap.\n\nI buy when they're on sale and keep them for impromptu gifts like a house warming, birthdays, anniversaries, or just visiting a neighor for coffee. They're very affordable, and always a hit . . . with adults as well as kids.\n\nLast month I found a new hand liquid called Limoncello. It carries the scent of fragrant lemons, and conceals a kiss of olive oil to combat dry skin.\n\nWhile in Tempe I wandered into BBW to buy a bottle for my daughter. The sales lady says it's limited stock only sent to a few select stores to test the waters. The $14 price tag, compared to the $3 cost for their regular hand soap, might have discouraged buyers.\n\nThe BBW website says it's out of stock: http:\/\/www.bathandbodyworks.com\/family\/index.jsp?ppg=96&categoryId=20729646\n\nAnd I just found a bid on Ebay. One bottle, originally priced at $14, sold for $29. \n\nAnyway, the BBW in Arizona Mills is a lovely shop. Very helpful staff. The store is a bit smaller than most BBWs I've frequented, but not lacking in their lovely standard inventory.
