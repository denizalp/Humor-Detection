This is where my fiance proposed!!! But before he proposed it felt like we had an 8 course meal! We just wanted it to stop! We were getting complimentary dishes from the chef, which was wonderful but we were dying by the 4th plate. The food was good but not the greatest. However, we both did have two unforgettable dishes: the Halibut and the Filet Mignon. The best we have had. Dessert: I had the banana split which they made look really fancy and fun! \n\nThis is a really elegant restaurant and the service was impeccable. The funny part was that they did not know that my fiance was proposing so they accidentally interrupted with dessert! But they were really sweet after the proposal and that is why I love them!
