Stopped in for a quick lunch I chose the 8\" Italian Sub toasted, the bread was incredibly fresh, crusty with just the perfect amount of chewiness. The toppings were absolutely fresh and the lady working the counter on the bakery side made one of the best subs I've had in a long time, I was only able to consume half of this hearty sandwich but struggled to leave the other half but hey I'm in Vegas and I'm not taking a doggie bag, unfortunately I should of but didn't wrap it up and offer it to one of the many homeless or panhandlers on the strip. My associate tried the pizza and said it was just alright I guess it's all about making the right choices, even the restaurants in Vegas is a gamble sometimes...
