I guess I can hold a grudge and be a little bitter, the last experience left me sad when I went to Mark's Caf√©, but after a long long long long time, it was time to give them a try.\n\nI had still been hearing that Mark's is the best spot for eggs benedicts, and those are still my favorite, so I wondered on over to Mark's around 11ish on a Saturday morning, and let me tell you my hopes of having any eggs benedicts where slim to none since it was almost noon.\n\nThe place was packed, so grabbed a seat a bar, again service was friendly and fast.  I asked if they had run out of hollandaise sauce, and guess what, they had not!!! Oh today my was day!!\n\nI didn't even need to look at the menu I knew what I wanted, I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedicts.\nIt was 2 English muffins topped with corn beef hash and 2 poached eggs and covered in fresh hollandaise sauce. This was an excellent tasting eggs bennys, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, bright yellow, a little tangy and buttery smooth! Everything I had hoped it to be! Soo good! This was a delish breakfast for sure! \n\nI am so sorry I waited forever to give Mark's another try, but you better believe I will be coming around more often!
