Came in for my appointment for a mani\/pedi and they were ready for me. I have been a customer here for over a year and the staff has always been professional and courteous.\nSince I don't have a lot of experience with nail salons I think the value for the price is totally worth while and while I no longer live in Surprise, I still travel for my appointment.\nI am willing to drive for great customer service!
