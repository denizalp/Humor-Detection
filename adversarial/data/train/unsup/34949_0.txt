Something White was the first shop we went to in search of my sister's wedding gown. Quite honestly, we were not planning on buying a dress that day; we had planned to look at a couple different boutiques before making a decision. However, Rebecca made the experience so fun and enjoyable! My sister was able to pick out the dresses she liked to try on, but Rebecca made some suggestions based on my sister's style and helped guide us through the entire experience. Mallory, my sister, ended up choosing ten dresses to try on, which could have gotten overwhelming had Rebecca not asked us to narrow down and \"rule out\" dresses as we went! Once we had narrowed it down to two, Rebecca put Mallory's hair up, gave her earrings to try on, put a veil in her hair, etc. to give Mallory an idea of what it would look like \"day of\". Mallory was GLOWING; you could tell she truly felt like a bride! Mallory ended up finding \"the dress\" at Something White and decided to cancel her future appointments at other boutiques. We were pleasantly surprised at how easy our decision had become! I highly recommend you start here... be warned that it will set the bar pretty high. Thanks for a great experience, Rebecca!
