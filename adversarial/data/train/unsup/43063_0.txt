An absolute hell for handicapped or seniors. \nASU, listen up: ADA is not an option, it's the law. \nSpecifics: I am a mobility impaired individual. A ride up the hill in a golf cart to the concourse is a fine start. However, that's it, no cart, escalator, or elevator whatsoever up to the upper level seats. We are told the carts cannot drive in the stadium.\nHow about the other side? . . . No way to get across the facility.  \nA well meaning individual ASU employee is waiting for a supervisor to okay a seat change, no one appears. I stand for forty five minutes. Man comes out to demand his TV be turned on. . . bellows rudely at the employee who I doubt has anything to do with his TV. In front of me passes a golf cart with a healthy smiling young man with an empty Chick Fil A bag. He seems to be able to get a ride through the concourse. Band is doing pre game show.\nSolution was finally resolved by security man who made a decision, but by this time I've been standing way longer than I should have, watching people with walkers, canes and worse, trying to negotiate the inclines. No carts or wheelchairs in sight. Supervisor never showed.\nWhat the ____? This isn't the 19th century. How are they allowed to get away with this?\nOnce seated, The Band sounds great, but wait? Arghh! the speakers sound awful. Just a din. Whole experience was so unpleasant, we just left. This won't get better later. \nI attend Pac 12 football at another facility regularly. Sure you can cut corners, but these folks are over their heads as far as providing basic needs. Just don't.
