OMG, this place was so awesome!\n\nWe came here on our last night of vacation, before flying home, & let me tell you, I did NOT want to leave here!\n\nI had done my research on yelp about this place, but actually coming here was beyond what I imagined.  The facilities are kept so clean & the detox rooms made me feel so relaxed that I could've just fallen asleep.  I kept thinking \"geez, I wish I had known about this place years ago.\"\n\nThis will always be on our list of things to do while in Vegas from now on, & when I feel stressed, this is going to be my \"happy place\" that I go to in my mind.  Perfect way to end our Vegas vacation!\n\nTIP:  Be careful when you go into the \"Red Clay Balls Room.\"  The balls can be slippery when stepping into the pit.  I almost fell down!
