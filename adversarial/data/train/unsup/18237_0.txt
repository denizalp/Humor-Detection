This is why I love local joints. Jeff and Michelle and their crew began making themselves double-shelled tacos with a soft flour, pasted with refried beans, wrapped around a hard taco, then filled with normal taco things. They loved them so much that they said, \"Hey...why not put this on the menu?\"\n\nAnd that's how the 25th Street Taco was born. It's my favorite food item in the world.
