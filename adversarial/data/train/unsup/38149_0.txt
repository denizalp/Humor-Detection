If fabulous and fresh Greek food is what you want, then this is the place for you!!!  Just enjoyed an epic lunch!  Wonderful Greek village salad, superbly fresh fish, and the most delicious Greek yogurt and Greek coffee!  Beautiful decor and excellent service! Who knew that this was in Las Vegas!!!  So coming back during our stay this week!  If there were 10 stars to give I would have!  Opa!!!!
