We stayed here because it was walking distance to the US Airways arena, which is where the Phoenix Suns play. There are tons of eateries, bars, and clubs nearby, so it's great to be able to walk everywhere an not worry about parking or DUIs.  I've stayed here in the past so obviously these issues don't prevent me from coming back:\n\nParking $19 self park.\nParking Garage is across the street, not connected to the hotel. \nNo rollaway allowed in our room per \"fire marshall\" so daughter had to sleep on floor\nOur room had a connecting door to the people next to us. This door was not soundproof and we could hear the tv blasting until after midnight and heard their alarm go off at 4am.\n\nI don't know how reception\/guest services is because they now have a self check in kiosk where you swipe your credit card in and it prints out your room instructions and  keys.
