A huge Thank you to Brad and Luke. Brad for getting back to me even though it was late and getting Luke out the next day on my schedule!\nLuke was professional and up front not only did he find and fix the problem \nWe called about, he found the root cause of why it happened. Even showed me the work around another company tried to do. (Which didn't work).\nNeedless to say everything is running smoothly. Thank you both. \nI won't use anyone else from now on.
