Don't show up 5 min prior to a beerbus, they won't accommodate the rest of the patrons with flights because \"they're saving the tasting glasses for the beer tourists\". Seriously? It's a Saturday night, what about the rest of the customers? Wow, too bad, I would have really liked to sample all they had to offer.   I will return however, they're new and still working out the kinks I suppose, and I hope to update this with more stars.
