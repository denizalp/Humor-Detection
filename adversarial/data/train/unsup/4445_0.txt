If I wanted to be ignored by cheerleaders I'd go back to high school.  On my 3rd visit to this establishment I waited 15 minutes after ordering a beer at the bar before requesting that my order be cancelled and leaving.  My previous visit to the Camelback location was equally disappointing.  The manager apologized shortly after our food had to be remade when we waited for 40 mins to receive lukewarm chicken strips, cold fries and a cold burger.  I think he comped our meals, but there is a service issue.  Perhaps the management should pay more attention to their patrons then their employees gratuitous ass cheeks.  I want to like Twin Peaks so much, but in the end, it's just a poor man's strip club with no champagne room.
