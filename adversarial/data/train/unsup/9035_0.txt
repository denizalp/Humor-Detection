Awesome. That's what this museum is. Awesome architecture, awesome collection, awesome staff. \n\n3 levels of gallery - largest on the 4th floor, smaller rooms on the 3rd and 2nd. Open, clean, airy gallery space. Polished concrete floors give a nice shine as you glance down. If you're a quick visitor, you'll be done in under an hour. If you grab some (free, currently) headphones and listen to the audio tour, it'll take you closer to two.\n\nThe collection is informed by the Bechtler's taste so there's an autobiographical feel happening (which I tend to like). They liked books and sketchbooks - there are a number of them. A few prints here and there but paintings were far more prevalent. The Warhol family portrait made me giggle. Interesting sculptures, some good, some mediocre. \n\nMost interesting part of this collection, for me, are the tapestries. Painting-sized weavings hung or draped, attributed to a variety of modernists (Miro, Picasso, etc). I'd never seen this style of art in a permanent collection before, amidst large, more conventional paintings, and was fascinated. I don't know how I feel about them hanging side-by-side with other flat works - they appeal more to the craft side of my brain and require a different reading. But still, awesome.\n\nFor 8 bucks and discounted parking, this is a rad way to spend a few hours. The store's a little tiny but there's some interesting wares, jewelry, MoMA design objects. Cafe looks promising. The building is just gorgeous, a huge Sol Lewitt design lingering over the lobby. I can't wait to see what kind of exhibits this place attracts to CLT. \n\nThanks, Bechtlers, for elevating the Art Museum scene in the Queen City to the next level. We needed it.
