I was craving steak and eggs.  As if I didn't have enough eggs earlier but, I was craving and well boyfriend came through with suggesting we come here.  This is my new favorite spot for some legit tender, juicy steak and eggs.  \n7.77 for a decent portion.  You get 2 eggs, hash browns and your steak.  \nThe only 2 things that I wasn't too happy about was \n1. Hashbrowns tasted like they had been made much earlier in the day, sat for a while, and somewhat re heated and served with our order--- cold ? Hard and crunchy.  Not ideal.  \n2. They take a long time to bring out your order.  \nThey weren't crazy busy when we arrived.  \nAlmost as if they had one cook in the kitchen making everyone's food. \n \nOn to positive --- \nPrompt seating, prompt drinks, and waitress checked up on us several times and she was pleasant and kind.  She was attentive. \n\nMy son had the french toast.  Was good but not the best.  Satisfied his craving though.  Nothing special. \nI would say the steak and eggs is what peeps come to eat here. \nI did see a plate of spaghetti and meatballs come out for another table.  Looked good, I wouldn't mind trying that next time.  I definitely will be returning.  But strictly for steak and eggs--- with no hash browns.  Ha! \n\nThey could improve on their timing with bringing peeps orders out.  Whether it be a server issue or cook issue. \nAlso making sure the food on your customers plate is hot\/warm.  But will come and try again.  I'll give them another shot for sure. \n\nNo pictures unfortunately, I had left my phone in the car.  Smh. Next time.
