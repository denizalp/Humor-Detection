When the weather heats up and so do the warehouse sales, I am here most of the time!  My mom loves getting a deal and so do I, but I clutch onto my wallet tighter.  ;)  I also tend to put more thought in whether or not I really need\/want something.\n\nPros:\n-  tons of free parking\n-  washrooms everywhere\n-  free wi-fi for the guys\n\nCons:\n-  no food places, so it's pure shopping\n-  more seating needed\n-  facilities are quite dated\n-  roads surrounding the conference centre are quite bumpy, need to be paved, so not a pleasure driving in the area\n\nDue to the parking situation alone, I would much prefer to attend an event here than Direct Energy Centre (The Ex) and pay $$ for parking or Metro Toronto Conference Centre where there is absolutely no parking whatsoever.
