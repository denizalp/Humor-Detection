I'm only giving 2 stars because a few people work there are awesome! MANAGEMENT SUCKS! I did an exchange yesterday, 1 pair of panties the wrong size, and went to the PINK section the look at leggings and left my exchange in the area somewhere and the stores claims they didn't found it... so basically paid for underwear I'll never get! I'm a ANGEL card holder also, I'll be paying that off and closing the account, sucks cuz I love their bras and underwear but customer service is everything to me.
