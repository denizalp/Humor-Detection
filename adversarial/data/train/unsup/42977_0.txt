I've dined here a handful of times.  Yes there is butler service, and what seems like a private chef for your party.  Mention any type of \"asian\" cuisine that you are craving, and they will whip it up for you - with a gourmet twist.  I think last time I was there the chef was experimenting with coffee crusted sweet and sour shrimp.  Sounds strange but it was DELICIOUS.  The service is impeccable. This place is the epitome of high-roller status in Vegas.  Both clubs at the Palazzo and Venetian are excellent.  Private dining rooms w\/ flat screen TVs - humidor cabinets filled with countless cigars to choose from.  Hmm is that a cuban cohiba I see?  Maybe not.  Oh and the view of the strip from the 36th floor ain't bad.  Yes - you need a minimum of a $1,000,000 credit line to have access to this club.  Sweet.
