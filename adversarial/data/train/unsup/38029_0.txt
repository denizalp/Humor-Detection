First time here with friends during Phoenix Comic Con. The waitress called me a sir, (I'm a female) my boyfriend got his wings cold, it took 15 minutes to get our waters, and I paid $8 for the smallest ceasear salad with no sides or anything. They restaurant wasn't busy as well, I can see why there are so many bad reviews here. Not coming back.
