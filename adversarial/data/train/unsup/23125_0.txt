Two words: Cookie cup!!! \nThe cookie cup is composed of two macaron cookies sandwiching two scoops of ice cream, and topped with a roasted marshmallow. You can choose two different flavored ice cream for the two scoops. If you're feeling adventurous, you can add on the first topping for $.75, and each additional topping for $.50. The toppings are graham crackers, oreos, rainbow sprinkles, & chocolate sprinkles to name a few. \n\nThe workers were friendly and easy-going. Being an extremely indecisive person, I did not feel rushed to pick a flavor right away. They were really willing to have me sample all 24 ice cream flavors since there was no line behind me. I tried only two flavors, and fell in love with the mocha java yaya and mint chip. I was cracking up at some of the names for the ice cream, such as \"Netflix & Chill\". I would definitely try a couple of samples while having fun at it. The best part was seeing the marshmallow roasted by a torch right before our eyes. If you're looking for something lighter, they also have scoops of ice cream available. \n\nThis place did not quite get the five stars for me because of the price and sweetness. The first couple of bites into the cookie cup was out of this world amazing. However, the subsequent bites were truly sweetness overload. It's also treading on the pricey side - $7.50 for the cup. I have eaten larger macaron ice cream sandwiches with great flavors for only $4.50. \n\nOverall, this place is great for kids. There is a complimentary water station by the napkins. If you're planning to eat your dessert on site, there are a handful of tables inside and a couple of tables outside. \n\nRemember to check-in on yelp for 10% off your order. They also have a stamp card, buy 9 scoops of ice cream and get the 10th scoop free.
