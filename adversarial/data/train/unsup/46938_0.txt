This is directed to the Starbucks Cafe in this location! \n\nI am extremely upset with the service(if that's what I can even call it) I was given at this Starbucks Cafe.\nWhen I walked up to the cashwrap the Barista was attending to another customer so I politely waited to be attended to.  After he finished with the customer, he started side work or restocking what it seemed, he then looks at me and says \"I'll be right with you\" and I nodded with a smile. Then proceeds to give direction to the other employee that seemed to be doing to same (restocking\/ cleaning) and they both continue to just have there back to me (At first I can understand maybe they were behind) but then I waited to be attended to for 5 min, it was 10am and I was the only patron in the cafe at this point. Nothing was said to me after he stated he'd be right with me. I am not exaggerating when I say I waited 5 min AFTER he had already finished with his customer I just stood there politely and quite ,waiting. Nothing at that point is an applicable excuse for such treatment. I had my son with me and we were extremely patient and polite. I just don't understand how this is acceptable. Customers need to feel welcomed, not out of place!!! And that's exactly how I felt walking out. After waiting and not being attended to, I had end up walking out without any service and having to explain to my son why we were leaving. I know I may have looked as if I didn't belong in such area but that's not how anyone should feel as a customer!!! Please prioritize appropriately. This is customer service 101.
