Reasons why you should stay here:\n\nFree valet parking;\nEasy access to the Strip and the Monorail;\nPlush Bathrobes;\nPragmatic Design\/Layout;\nVanity Mirror;\nKichenette with kichenware\/ utensils;\nHuge Jet Tub;\nGreat Staff;\nNon Casino;\nFull Balcony; and \nLarge Room\n\n\nI've stayed here before, but I loved it even more this time.  The Signature is the ideal hotel to stay at in Vegas, especially for a convention.\n\nBf and I checked in on 8\/20\/13 for MAGIC.  It was noon and the suites were not ready.  I left the bags with the the bellman outside by the valet.  Kathleen said she would call me when the room is ready and she DID as she promised at about 3.\n\nWhen we arrived, there was a man who opened the door for us and walked us over to the check in area.  Kathleen is Caucasian, but she handed my id and credit card with both hands as it's customary among Japanese.  I really appreciated that subtle but profound extra touch.\n\nThe Signature is extremely convenient.  Although it's not the Strip, it provides indoor walkway to the MGM, and voila, you are on the Strip.  There's also a short distance access to the Monorail.  It was 4 stops to the Las Vegas Convention Center.\n\nI loved the lay out at The Signature.  First, there's a door to the bathroom, unlike the rooms in MGM.  The toilet has its separate door.  There were dual sinks, a huge jet tub and the bathroom was generous in size.  There was a vanity mirror-again an extra touch that I appreciated.  There were plush robes in the closet, and a compact yet powerful blow dryer.\n\nThe Signature is a condo\/hotel so each unit has a kitchenette with all the utensils and kitchenware to make a meal if you so choose.  It has a separate seating area and blackout drapes that actually work.
