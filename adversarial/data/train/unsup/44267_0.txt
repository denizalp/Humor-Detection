Although the decor of this place is very dated and over the top Victorian style, I truly enjoyed my visit.\n\nI ordered a burger, and you can substitute any burger for a bison burger at no extra charge(so of course I did so)!  My burger was cooked perfectly!  It was the best burger I have had in a while.  It was served with chips, but I substituted fresh cut fries which were also amazing! \n\nAll around good experience, just don't let the atmosphere fool you :)
