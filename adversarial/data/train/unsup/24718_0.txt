We went to Tao on a busy Saturday night. There was a line circling the area, not just 1 line, but 3 different lines: Venetian guests, Guestlist, and finally a line for those who aren't the first 2.\n\nI went with a total of 6 girls. We knew about 10 guys inside, but luckily they stayed at the Venetian so they got in. But we had 1 guy with us who managed to find a promoter for Tao so we all got in free.\n\nBut the guy directing people to the lines made us go in the wrong line so we waited for 30 min before realizing the dumbass's mistake. We walked passed the line and scurried in.\n\nHoly shit, can we say sardine can? Totally packed packed packed. What's a danceclub if you have no room to dance? The main dance floor was ESPECIALLY overwhelming. Even the bar area was crowded. The crowd was so-so, there were some gorgeous people but that was countered by a surprisingly high number of fuglies.\n\nThe decor was beautiful, stunning, I loved it. Dark and zen like feel with some hot girls parading all around in lingerie. Naked girls with petals covering their boobies in bathtubs.\n\nO yea, we saw Seal perform his new song, he was awesome! I think heidi klum was there too.\n\nIts sad that so many guys get hassled for what they wear. I saw so many girls in the club wear these stupid shirts that read \"its my birthday!\" Or \"getting married bachelorette party 2008\".\n\nYou serious? You're wearing a stupid shirt and you made your whole crew where them too. They all stood our like sore thumbs since I saw some hot girls wearing some sluttty dresses. Hey its Vegas, baby!\n\nI genuinely liked Tao MINUS the dancefloor action which is a big deal to me.\n\nOther than that, its a great nightclub.
