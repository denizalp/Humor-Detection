My friends and I went to Vegas this past weekend for one of my friends 22nd birthday.  We clubbed hopped and ended the night here. In order for us to get into XS we first had to go to Tryst to get a stamp because they weren't having a guest list at XS. We got here and waited in line. There were like 5 check points within the line and we had to get our IDs checked at every single one and get stamped, do they not trust one person to check IDs?\n\nMy friends definitely wanted to go to XS because Afrojack was playing. I wanted to go because my sister said it was a nice club. \n\nWe got into the club and it was SUPER packed. It was so hard to move. I was so irritated because the people that were there that night were so fucken immature. my friends and I were standing in a crowd and then people rush on over to the section we were at and start jumping, screaming, and pushing to get to the front. While they're doing that, you got the security in front of the crowd pushing EVERYONE back. I'm stuck in the middle being pushed forward then being pushed back -______-\n\nAll the other clubs we went too gave us free drinks, XS didn't.\n\nMy buzz was killed from all those people who were pushing especially this little asian girl. I'm asian and the asians that act and look like her make me not want to be asian, they make me embarrassed. \n\nWe didn't even get to go outside to check out the pool. I'm going to give this club another try when I am back in town. Hopefully it isn't as crowded and has classier people.
