We live just 4 miles from this park, but previous visits in 2011 kept us away due to rampant irresponsibility on the part of owners not picking up after their dogs.  Instead, we'd go to Palo Vista on McQueen in South Chandler. Built on a landfill, that park has no lake.\n\nThen, weeks ago, we thought we'd give Cosmo Park another try, and we're glad we did!  While there was still the occasional poop negligence, it wasn't nearly as bad as years ago. And the dog lake does offer a \"splash\" of that heat-relief dynamic of which our 2 water-shy dogs suddenly & gleefully took full advantage. Plus, the other fenced-in areas are a smart concept, ideal for dry play, agility, or one for much smaller\/ timid pups that may feel overwhelmed with the possibility of too many dogs approaching them.\n\nWater-wise, for those concerned about bacteria, cleanliness, or the current outbreak of Leptospirosis, the Park District closed this water park for 3 days last week for its scheduled clean-up, but I couldn't say exactly what they performed beyond Chlorination. \n\nI recommend bringing a couple towels -- maybe some shampoo -- along, as they'll come in handy!  The hosing-off station is an added feature to get any gravel, sand, mud or smell off your pup prior to heading for the (large) parking lot. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: As long as ALL dog owners are attentive and assume responsibility for their pooch, this is a good place. Full disclosure: I did see a chocolate lab take a \"chocolate break\" at the water's edge, and the dog's owner didn't come to clean up the chocolate mess. (OK, I'll stop.)  If you've got a water-loving pooch, and you don't give this park a look-see, your dog may never forgive you. \n\nSUGGESTION: The park would be better served with more doggie drinking fountains, as they are none in some of the other fenced in areas.
