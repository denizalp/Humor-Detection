What exactly is going on here?\n\nThe boyfriend, some friends, and I went here on a friday night. \n\nWe waited about 20 minutes to get a pager, and waited another 30 minutes until the pager went off and were seated.  Under that impression, we thought this place would be good.\n\nWe ordered mild, bbq, and \"9-1-1\" wings.\n\nFirst the mild.\nThese are fried, greasy, chalky tasting, breaded wings, smothered in butter. No salt. No taste. Disgusting.\n\nSecond, the BBQ.\nThese were the same chalky, floury wings, barely touched with BBQ sauce. It doesn't take a magician to toss a pan of fried wings in sauce yknow.. they could've spent the extra 5 seconds tossing some more sauce so the wings were actually covered in it. Fail.\n\n9-1-1\nThese brought tears to my friends eyes. The boyfriend, who can normally stomach anything hot, only ate 1. Our friend ate 3. They paid for it later in the bathroom.. lol\n\nThe only thing about this place that was positive was our waitress. She was so attentive and friendly. She was right there when our sodas\/waters got low. And didn't take long at all when we asked for the bill. She was very awesome, and received a very nice tip from us.\n\nThis place... is just... gross. Gross gross gross. Stay away!!
