I'm starting to think this place is only good for those people who had been drinking and craving for carbs.  I heard this is the best pizza around here, that we must come to try.  One of our friends didn't eat dinner, so he was hungry.  This was the reason why we were here.  I wasn't too hungry, but I don't know when will the next time I'll get the chance to grab a slice.  I ordered a white cheese slice and a pepperoni slice. It wasn't that good.  It was old and very chewy.  Nothing special, I'll be craving for.  \n\nSeating inside the Secret Pizza was limited and super-super dirty.  They don't clean up or wipe down the counter.  The trash cans were overflowing.   It's very disgusting to me.  I did see the typical college students spot, grabbing pizza and beer here.  It's probably the cheapest place to eat at the Cosmo.
