Let me begin by saying that I have never written a negative review, ever. However, after my experience with Sun Devil Auto on Val Vista and Warner, I am compelled to share my dissatisfaction. Six weeks ago, I took my vehicle to this location for a \"free inspection\", as the air conditioning was not working. The inspection was not free, and I was charged $140.00 for recharging the system. Although I was not happy about the charge, I paid it, as we were needing the vehicle for a family vacation. After EIGHT MILES of driving, the air was blowing hot again. We cancelled our vacation, and took the car back in, to be told that repairs costing $210.00 needed to be made. Because we were already in for $140, we decided to have the work done, and rescheduled our vacation. After driving the vehicle twice, the air once again was not working. We again had to cancel our vacation and took the car in for a third time. They \"repaired\" their mistake, and days later, the air was once again blowing hot. Today I took the car in for a FOURTH time, asking that the problem be resolved or that I receive a refund for the $350 already spent. After inspecting the vehicle a fourth time, I was told that an additional repair costing nearly $500 needed to be made. I, of course, asked for a refund, as the air is not working any better than it was 6 weeks and four visits ago. I was told that a refund could not be issued. After spending hours on the phone with Sun Devil and their corporate offices, I received a PARTIAL refund.\nMy confidence in this organization is completely shaken, and I recommend that all steer clear of this \"business\"!!
