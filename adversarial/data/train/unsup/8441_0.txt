NO FILLERS!\n\nJust plain ole LOBSTER (good portion), Butter (just enough), and Old Bay seasoning in a pillowy soft, buttered bun. THAT'S IT!\n\nIf you're tired of places who pollute their so called lobster rolls with mayo or other junk, you need Luke's Lobster rolls in your life.\n\nLocated just outside Fashion Show Mall, you don't come here for the ambiance or to people watch. Their little shack has limited outdoor seating so dress warm during chilly weather. They also offer clam chowder and lobster bisque. Their rolls are about $19 so it can get pricey if you're extra hungry, but you'll taste the quality in the first bite.
