Where to start... the first week they had it they painted my blue BMW X6 black then argued with me over it being the right color. But you open the doors and could clearly see it in the door jams. \n\nBut they said they would fix it. I should have walked away as the black was beautiful. But I gave them a change to fix it. They had it for a week and a half. Now paying for the rental i had to get last minute. They have never once called me i always have to call them.\n\nIt was supposed to be done 6-15 I called and they said oh yea it's not going to be done today I'll have it done tomorrow. This happened Friday, saturday, Monday, tuesday and wednesday. \n\nAnd now when I go to get my car they have unbuffed paint in the drive side door James, they painted over the rubber lining around the front wind shield, sun roof and back driver side windows. But frankly at this point I will take the huge hit to the cars value rather than deal with these jokers again. Becareful with them if they dont get it right the first time, the quality of the work is going to vanish.
