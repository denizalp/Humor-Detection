Usually, I would give this a one star, but since Woodside Mall has been here for decades. I've literally came here since I was three years old. \n\ni'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, but the mall hasn't changed much, except for a few stores here and there, but some stores have been there for decades. On the good side, it's a place with a ton of memories, allows for a lot of reminiscing memories when you come here. On the bad side, it's really old now, and unattractive to most people because it has dim lights and nonattractive stores.\n\nIf you come to Woodside Square now, the shops that you will see here are Food Basics, a cheap sports store (you can buy cheap branded pants, shoes, etc. here). This is probably because the products are outdated, so you can get them cheaper. There's a foodcourt here, with one bakery in he foodcourt, and one further away. Both have been here for a very long time, but I prefer the bakery that is not in the foodcourt. There is a Smart Maple here (for those who know, it's on the similar chains of One's Better Living that sells a lot of products from Hong Kong and China for much more expensive prices than you purchase it from Hong Kong and China. There is a shop here for Asian Herbs. Furthermore, there's a Toronto Public Library, Shopper Drugs Mart and although the owner changes, there's always a dim sum location here.
