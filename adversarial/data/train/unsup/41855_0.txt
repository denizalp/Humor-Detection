I love this place.  Produce is a little overpriced with some few exceptions. Salad greens\/spinach is $3 but oh so worth it. Really fresh taste and will last in your fridge for 2 weeks because it doesnt have to travel millions of miles to get to you. Bread is good too at $1.99. Dont buy milk or eggs thou. I know, what a shame. They are way overpriced. Hickory farms eggs are almost $3 when I can get them for $1.99 anywhere else. I would come here more often if they had the basics right.
