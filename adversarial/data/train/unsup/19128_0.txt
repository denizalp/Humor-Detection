My neighborhood Walgreens & \"go to\" pharmacy.  What can I say about this place?.....it's convenient, clean, and the staff is friendly.  We get most of our daily living stuff here.....Son's contact lens cleaner, eye drops, etc....and when we get sick we stop here to get cold medicine  and cough drops.\n\nWe used this location to get Passport photos for our trip to China and it's a quick process.  Their photo equipment is always in good shape, so if you need prints printed from your digital or old school camera, they can accommodate.\n\nI've never had a problem here.  It's a Walgreens and not much different than the 1000's of others around the country.  I'm glad that they're consistently good in my book.\n\nWill I return?  You can count on it.
