I've been to the lower ERC a handful of times, and each has been a let down.\n\nThe coffee is mediocre, at best, and never tastes anything like you would anticipate or expect. The service is slow, and none of the Baristas seem to know what they're doing behind that big silver machine. Give me five minutes behind the counter, and I'll show you how it's done. \n\nIf I wanted coffee prepared by a bunch of inattentive stoners, I would smoke a joint and make my own coffee at home.  \n\nFail.
