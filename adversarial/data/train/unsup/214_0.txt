I usually go here for the hotpot to share with friends and some bulgolgi on the side. This plae is good for late nights as it closes pretty late. We ordered some appetizers, small bites like meatball skewers, agedashi tofu, kalbi, and some other delicious entrees. The atmosphere is pretty comfortable, and a place you would kinda expect from a korean\/japanese style late night bar.
