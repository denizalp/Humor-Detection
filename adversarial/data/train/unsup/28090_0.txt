Don't let the entrance fool you! This is a really big place. Behind the first tables you see there's a lot more space and tables. Although tables enough, we ate at the bar. Nice bar man, good vibe.\n\nBecause our friend had a flight to catch we were here very early. And that's a good thing: happy hour!! Good value for money on alcholic beverages.\n\nThe concept consists of small bites of which you need 2 or 3 depending on how hungry you are. And don't forget to ask for the vegetarian options. They have a whole menu when you ask for it! My suggestion: put it on the normal menu. More and more people or no vegetarians but choose to eat less meat. And the options are good. \n\nMy girlfriend and I both ordered the onion soup. Hot, hot, very hot and average in taste.The vegetarian risotto was perfect. Cooked to perfection. Nice taste. My husband ordered the meatballs. Nice, but he missed the spaghetti or some bread.\n\nNot a place I would go for an nice evening out, but definitly a place I would visited again for a quick bite before going to a show or an evening on the town.\n\nNote: I'm no native speaker.
