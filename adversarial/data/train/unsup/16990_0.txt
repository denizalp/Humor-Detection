Come on Yelpers, go easy on Urban 7!  Sure, it's not always crowded but that's because there's plenty of room to spread out.  It's in a great location and it has laid back yet chic ambiance.  It's split into 4 areas:  There's a patio with seating in the front, the main dining area on the left, on the right is the main bar and at the rear is a smaller bar with it's own lounge.  The patio is fun since there is plenty of people watching to do and it's spacious.  The rear lounge is a great place to host a party, I've attended several there in the past.   \n\nMartini's are their specialty in terms of drinks, and the word Martini in the restaurant name does lend premise to that argument.  That and they serve expertly made Martini's.  My wife and I ate here last week, I had a dry Martini.  She couldn't drink so the bartender whipped up some muddled concoction that she loved.\n\nThey recently revamped the menu to make it more Latin centric with Cuban leanings.  Ropa Vieja is a classic and the Mar y Tierra delivers a one two punch of grilled ribeye and shrimp tempura.  It also comes with fried plantains which I thought was the perfect Cuban touch.\n\nIt deserves a shot, and maybe even a second one, to check out the cuban cuisine, the patio scene, and a well made Martini.
