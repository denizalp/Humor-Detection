I recently went to Mint this weekend to try it for the first time.  I had driven by it several times in the past and have been meaning to stop in.  Here is my breakdown on the experience:\n\nFood - The food is different from all other Indian food I have tried before in Brampton.  It is clean, simple, and very tasty.  They have some great deals going on as well which add to the bang for your buck.  We were able to try several dishes and all of them exceeded our expectations.  Mint also serves alcohol and the list of available beverages seems extensive.  The prices, very reasonable. \n\n**5 Stars.**\n\nAmbiance - Mint is very well decorated.  The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming.  You can stop in casual or dressed up and feel comfortable all the same.  The lighting inside the restaurant is very good.  The seats are evenly spaced out so you really do get to have a personal experience, even if the restaurant is busy.  The seats are comfortable.  There is very nice Indian music playing in the background that only further adds to the experience.  My only complaint is that the washrooms could be a little nicer and better kept.  They have what you need, they just seem to be half a step below the overall quality of the restaurant.  \n\n*4 1\/2 Stars**\n\nService - This section definitely deserves a mixed review.  Our server's name was Sarah.  She was a very pleasant young lady with black hair.  She is the exact type of waitress every restaurant should have.  The service Sarah offered was impeccable and was far above the going standard for good service.  Our drinks never ran out and our empty dishes were cleared immediately.  If you want friendly service with a smile ask to sit in her section.  If the owner reads this comment please commend Sarah for her efforts.\n\nI did have a run in with another server who works at the restaurant and this really is my one and only complaint.  I am unsure of her name.  She is a shorter, older looking Indian girl who appeared to be the only other server.  I found her to be extremely rude, someone who should not be in the restaurant business.  As a customer, she really made me feel like she did not appreciate my business.  I would avoid being served by her if at all possible.  She was very short and abrupt with me.  Everything she said was just full of attitude.  Not someone you want to deal with.\n\nBecause of Sarah I give this section a **5 Star** rating.  I will return to the restaurant for sure and ask to be served by her.\n\nOverall Mint Indian Bistro is a great place to dine out.  It is afford ably priced and the food and atmosphere are great.  It is a must try for any Indian food fans in Brampton and I particularly recommend Mint as a place to have a great date night, or to get takeout from.
