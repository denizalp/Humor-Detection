I absolutely used to love coming to this bar,especially after a long day of school and work.I had walked in with four of my friends on Thursday night,and it was around 1130,the place was packed as usual on a Thursday night and I had finally found an open area at the bar,I was waiting for a good ten minutes for a bartender to notice me so I could buy a drink,when a tall red headed girl which was a bartender came up from behind me and my other friends,and literally PUSHED us out of the way,and normally I really don't acknowledge when that happens because it's a crowded bar and that is bound to happen,but it was so rude.I immediately ignored it and waited until she left so I could get my spot back,And then I got shoved by another person on my left side and I was shoving into her by accident..this bartender immediately turned around and cursed me out in front of a lot of people,and she just kept saying \" this is my fucking well,I fucking work here,get the fuck out of here\" and then security came up to me and immediately said \" you're done,get out\" Needless to say,I will never return here,and my friends won't either.I was in for ten minutes,just to get kicked out because a bartender\/server decided to push me,and then curse in my face when I was trying to get my spot back.I really hope no other bartender treats people this way,I'm a server so I would never in my right mind would curse at someone the way she cursed at me in front of a lot of people.
