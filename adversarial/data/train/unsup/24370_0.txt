Holy bologna.  This place is delicious.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect from an Asian Fusion restaurant in Cleveland that offered a sticky bun, \"taco style\".  This place blew me away.  \n\nThey had lamb ribs on special that were served with a Dijon mustard bbq sauce.  My bf asked if the mustard was local...the chef scoffed and said, 'no, it's an incredible seed from France'.  I LOVED every second of that exchange.  And it only further endeared me to this hidden gem.  Oh, and our waitress was perfect.  Friendly, prompt, joked with us.  The service is on point here, guys.\n\nThe lamb was tender, perfectly cooked...the potatoes with sweet corn and black truffle--I'll dream of those in weeks to come.  \n\nYou should come here.  And order the lamb.  Like, right now.  I wish this place was in Chicago...
