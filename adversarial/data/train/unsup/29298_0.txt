It's Starbucks what can I say. The drinks are fantastic. I love to get the banana bread heated up a little bit. This location is always very busy. The only reason for the 4 stars is the The condition of the parking. Filthy. They need to get a hold of the landlord and have it cleaned up. Trash all over,grease stains all over the blacktop. Very gross.
