This is how it all starts.\n\nCall GRUBHUB or actually place my order online.  All of a sudden I get the call, 'Kimberley?\" in a very thick asian accent.  \"Yes?\"  (I wondering what's wrong....)\n\"We have your order and we will be 20 min\"..... okay I'm thinking,,,,, HUH?  what do you mean 20 minutes?  20 minutes till they get the order cooked and done or 20 minutes until you are on my front door?\n\nThey had all the hotel info, but then informed me that they were not allowed up to the room.  I'm worried.... Does this mean that he is downstairs right freeking now???!  So I proceed to ask him a series of questions...... \"ARE you downstairs right now???\" , he says \"No, 20 mins\".  Im still puzzled.  He then says, \"I'm not allowed to come up to your room, only lobby\".  I'm thinking....are you in the lobby RIGHT NOW????  He says, \"No, See you in 20 mins\".  and I'm thinking ...okay, we have figured out the plan now.  Then he says \"I've been waiting 20 mins\".  OMG!!!!!!!! Now what?!?!?!!!!  Does this mean he has been WAITING downstairs for 20 mins now????!  What the hell!  Finally we come to an agreement that he is in fact, NOT downstairs and I tell him to call me when he is in the lobby.  He then says again, \"See you in lobby\", with a thick accent and very little english.  I'm going bat shit now....  I hang up thinking, am I going to see food tonight or not??   He calls in 15 more minutes, \"Kimberley...I in lobby\".  then he mumbles something about coming up to my room.  I'm thinking ARE YOU COMING TO THE DOOR???  He then states that security won't let him upstairs.  Well.... I can get security to bring you upstairs.... He then says, No, security says no..... I'm pulling my hair out by now.....\n\nAll I had ready was a bathrobe and slippers.... so I went down to the lobby in front of everyone who was checking in..... to get my food.\n\nHe's sitting there and jumps up right away.... GOOD GUESS...since we have never met before.\n\nSeriously, for the $, this food is totally legit.  Very authentic and very very tasty.\n\nI had the Papaya Salad, which was probably the best I've tasted in years & Red Curry with beef, it was so addictive I wanted to eat the entire tub full but that's way way too much, the chicken satay, it wasn't dry, tasteless at all with the same greasy peanut sauce that everybody uses...it was in fact a cut above.  Everything was fresh, the lettuce, the onions, the tomatoes.... everything was recently prepared just for my order and for that they get a GREAT BIG gold star!
