We went to PJs on Saturday night to watch the Laker game and have dinner with 8 people. The manager and hostess were very accommodating even though the game was cancelled on regular tv. The calamari was excellent! The east coast oysters were the beat I have ever had. Our server Matt was on top of it. He also had a busboy helping us as well so even though he was busy with other tables, they had a good teamwork system. I would definitely go to Pjs again next time I am in Vegas! Thanks for the good times!
