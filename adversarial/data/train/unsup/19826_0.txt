You know those restaurants where the wait staff actually care about making people having and the chefs are so passionate on serving good quality food? Sushi Aoi is one of those places and it warms my heart everytime I go because the people there are just so caring. Perfect for family outings, dates, group hangouts, or solo food adventures 8)\n\nSashimi Lunch \n- really fresh\n- good knifework on the fish\n- reasonable sizes for the cuts\n\nUnagi Don\n- it's expensive but so worth the price\n- they give you lots of unagi as well as some complimentary veggies, pickles, and toppings \n- can definitely fill two stomachs\n\nTempura \n- good ratio of filling to batter\n- batter is flavourful, crispy, and not overly oil\n\nThanks Sushi Aoi for giving meaning to full service restaurants :D
