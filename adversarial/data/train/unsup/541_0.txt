I wish I lived on this side of town so I can come here more. But it's always a nice treat when I make the drive. Closest I can get to home in Las Vegas. If you are from NM then you know what I am talking about. By no means mexican food. Something similar to text mex if you are familiar with that. But to me it's, home. Love this place and digging the new location. Never disappointed.
