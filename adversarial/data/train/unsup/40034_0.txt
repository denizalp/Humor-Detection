If you live in the Phoenix area, you're a fool if you don't come check this place out.  I picked up a preorder on Saturday which I served at my Super Bowl party the following day.  Second LMB experience...  To those complaining about the lines, plan ahead and preorder to skip the wait.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  Even reheated the next day this stuff is as good as it gets!  I picked up a few pounds of brisket, pulled pork and turkey as well as a few sides.  The ranch beans were phenomenal.  I knew the flavor would still be there the next day, what I didn't know was how moist all 3 would be after reheating in my oven for a 2 hours!!  Everyone that came over loved it and the best part was I had leftovers which I've been snacking on all week.  Just polished it off tonight (Thurs) and it honestly tasted like it just came off the smoker, unbelievable.  All 3 of their sauces are top notch, I refilled bottles of all 3 on this visit. \n\nI've never been a big BBQ guy - what I've realized is that is because I never had LMB.  It's a shame I didn't discover them sooner because their flavor is out of this world!
