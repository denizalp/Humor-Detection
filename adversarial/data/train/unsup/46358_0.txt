We ordered the prix fix lunch & added another side. No regrets; many choices at the Cosmopolitan but none w\/the warm yet modern Mediterranean ambience and great service. Food was notably fresh and beautifully prepared. We compared it to a recent dinner on the island of Hydros. It's quicker to fly to Vegas!
