Newly remodeled and reopened a few weeks ago with the addition of a brick oven & updated menu. You order on tablets when you go in. It prints a ticket that you bring to the counter to pay & get your order. Only tried a couple of slices today... Margarita & carne. Although it was a big improvement from previous pizza they still need some work. The menu described the margarita pizza as having buffalo mozzarella & San Marzano sauce. None of that was on it. Not even traditional basil that's always on a margarita pizza. Basically plain mozzarella cheese. The carne was as described but nothing special. Both slices were overcooked..very crunchy... Seemed like if done right the crust would have been light & airy.  Slices are reasonable $6\/$7. Whole pizzas around $30....which if I would have got the margarita liked they served, I would have sent it back. I will give it another chance after they're open a couple months.
