This place has been on my radar for a while. We drive by at least once a week. We finally stopped in. Having looked at the menu on line I was pretty sure what I wanted. I went with the create your own bowl. So I picked the grilled salmon. This is a large piece of grilled salmon. I also chose my 5 favorite vegetables and brown rice. All this was drizzled with red dragon sauce. Thanks to a fellow Yelper's tip I ordered the regular sized bowl. This was more than enough for me. \n\nThe food was ready in about 15 minutes. They brought it out to our table. The meal was tasty, but didn't knock my socks off. The salmon was the best part of the meal. I tried a piece of yo roll sushi my daughter offered me. I'm glad I didn't go with the sushi. The rice was dry and the sushi lacked taste. It didn't seem fresh to me. \n\nThe two reasons I'll be back again are:\n1.) The price is reasonable.\n2.) I don't know of a similar place in the area.
