When you're itching for ramen in the Centennial area, head to Ichi Ramen House.  I've been here twice now and it's nice to get our soup on relatively close to home.  So far, I've had the Popcorn Shrimp, Brussel Sprouts Tempura, Miso Ramen, and Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen.  On the first visit, the Miso Ramen's chashu was perfect, tender and flavorful.  Yesterday's visit when I had the Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen, the chashu was thin and tough, so that was disappointing.  The Popcorn Shrimp is a generous portion and has a little kick to it, but not too spicy.  I also liked the Brussel Sprouts tempura appetizer, crispy but not greasy.  The service has been very attentive on both visits.  I can see myself coming back again, just hoping that yesterday's chashu experience was a fluke.
