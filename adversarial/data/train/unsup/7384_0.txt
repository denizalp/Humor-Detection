Two star status +++++++\n\n1 star for dust control sprinkler, seems like no one presses the darn thing but me.\nHad a few people react  as though I was detonating a bomb.\n\n1 star for the park actually existing\n\nTURD BOMBS EVERYWHERE !!!  Especially the perimeter, which enlarges daily. \n\nPeople seem to become so intentionally attentive to  conversations they never have to acknowledge  that their dogs actually do crap from time to time.\n\n5 stars for DOGS!!! They have a great time no matter what! Piss,Poo, dust,  and all!
