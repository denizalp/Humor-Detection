Not only have I replaced all four of my tires here, I've also purchased several of their take-home-and-cook pizzas, gallons of vodka and wine, and take advantage of their free samples [which, by the way, can be a substitute for a meal if you're running low on cash]. While the two of us cannot justify buying a 5 gallon bucket of pickles, this is a great place to shop for a large party. The prices are good and their selection is decent.
