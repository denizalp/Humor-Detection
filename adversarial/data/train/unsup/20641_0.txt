You won't find many places like The Strip. The energy level is incredibly high and you never know what or who you will see. For example, after leaving Harrah's at 6:30 a.m. and wanting nothing but sleep, I ran into Hey for Jim (see picture).\n\nHe told me he came to Vegas from his reservation two weeks ago and I was the first person of 400 to shake his hand. I asked myself if I was friendly or stupid. Surprisingly, he didn't ask for money. What he wanted was something very different (not that, you freak). :) \n\nHe wanted me to spend the day with him on The Strip to go up to people on their phones to let them know they were ruining society and that we needed to go back to being human again. \n\nI told him it was a great concept but this was Sin City and people wouldn't care. I then told him I had to get some sleep. He shook my hand goodbye, but it was a trick. Once he had my hand, he squeezed tighter and wouldn't let go. \n\nAt first, I squeezed harder and planned how to disarm him, but the endgame for that option ran through my mind (potential blood exchange and\/or jail). Instead, I made my hand completely limp, which he didn't expect and allowed me to slip my hand away. \n\nSurprisingly, he was sad, not angry. I think he wanted a friend. I told him I'd see him later. I did see him later that night but I didn't approach him. He was drunk and tossed a cardboard sign onto Las Vegas Blvd that read: 'Native. Please Help!' \n\nStrange experience but much better than sitting on the couch watching television.
