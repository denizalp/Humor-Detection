Went in with hair that was a hot mess, multiple colors (last few from boxes) plus greying roots. I found Phoenician Hair Co through a Groupon and am so thrilled I did!  I was blessed to have Lita there whose \"magic hands\" turned my horrific hair into a masterpiece through color, highlights, toner, and a haircut.  She was meticulous in her work and you can tell she has a true love for what she does.  I loved that she was as excited as I was with the results.  Everyone there was kind and welcoming - the boss was there and you could tell he is well respected and loved by the staff which showed in every aspect of how the business was run.  I have gone to many salons and usually hate the experience of it all but this is one I will be going back to. Highly recommended!!!!
