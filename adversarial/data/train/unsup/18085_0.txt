Amazing place to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, or any occasion. Located inside the forum shops right next Starbucks. When you enter forum shops you make a right and just go all the way down.\n\nCelebrated the beau and I 7 years anniversary on Jan 1st and made reservations. It wasn't too busy so if we didn't make reservations I'm pretty sure we would have gotten in quickly. They have a bar area and a fine dining seating. It was a very secluded area, kind of romantic, very elegant.\n\nUpon seating we got a basket of breads, crackers, corn bread and butter. We were noticed right away by waiters and waitresses. They explained the menu in detail and even helped us choose what would be better for us. \n\nFor appetizer we got The Whale which comes with Alaskian King crabs, shrimp, lobster tail and scallop shrimp ceviche. It is ordered by how many people is in your party. So the order was for two of us so it was about $24\/person. This was really already a good amount of seafood but you know we weren't going to stop there.\n\nWe both ordered petite filet mignon which was 8 oz. That was like perfect size maybe even a an oz. too much for me and we also ordered a 1 pound of alaskian king crab which was A LOT! We didn't realize that it would be that much for just the two of us. The crab was so perfect though. It is already cracked open for you and it is sooooo meaty. So much crab in each bite. The steaks were cooked to perfection of course. Very well seasoned. \n\nThis is a great place to celebrate an anniversary.
