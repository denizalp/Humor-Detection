Awesome, awesome,awesome.\n\nI'm a smoker and can tell you that their pulled pork beats mine, per my wife, and their brisket equals mine, per my wife.\n\nThey are very friendly and thoughtful people, between the owner, his dad and their employees. \n\nI would highly recommend this place, simply stated.\n\nOh, by the way, the beans are very good.
