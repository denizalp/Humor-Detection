Pretty good mexican grub in the 480.\n\nI had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate.\n\nThe meat in the tacos was tender, tasty and plentiful, accompanied by chilantro, onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right.\n\nThe chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce, the batter was not too soggy, the chile was cooked well (not crunchy\/underdone, not squishy\/overcooked) and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into.  This dish came with the standard rice and beans, neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form.\n\nMinus two big stars for what they consider guacamole.  It wasn't thick, it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish.  No bueno.  If it ain't green, thick and tasty, you better hit the drawing board.\n\nYa feel me?
