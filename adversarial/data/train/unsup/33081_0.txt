One of my all time favorite hakka Chinese restaurants. Almost everything here taste amazing. Some of my favourites are the seafood soup, chilli chicken, chilli shrimp, any of the manchurian dishes and fried rice, pakoras, wings, fried banana dessert and Singapore noodles. \n\n* I would recommend dining in store rather than takeout only because the food is more fresh and you get large portions.
