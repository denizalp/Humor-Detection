I love Red Robin.\n\nIts this location that has kind of let me down.\n\nI have had ok service in the past and that is why this is a two star review instead of a one star review.\n\nMy fiance and I came here the other day before seeing Jurassic World down the street. He ordered a Hawaiian Burger and I ordered a Chicken Ceasar wrap like always.\n\nEverything is going great until our food comes out and there is no dressing in my wrap. (Insert sad face) just a dry bed of lettuce, tomato, and a few pieces of chicken. I let our server know and he apologized and had them make a new one. The only problem is now my fiance has his food and his is getting cold because he of course doesnt want to be rude and eat while im waiting for mine so now were both in a lose lose situation.\n\nThe manager brought out my food and was very nice and i really do appriciate that, (Another reason this is a two star review and not less)\n\nSo I start to eat my wrap and the first half I ate was almost completely empty. Like one tiny square of chicken and a little bit of lettuce. It might as well of been an empty tortilla with dressing in it. \n\nThe worst part for me was when I bit into my second half and almost broke a tooth an a huge hard chunck of what I can only guess to be bone or cartilidge... \n\nThat honestly ruined the entire meal for me. \n\nFor ever.
