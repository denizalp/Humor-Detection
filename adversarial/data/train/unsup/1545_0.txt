Very overrated place. OMG I am actually quite shocked how less than uneventful my experience was. \n\nI visited Cleveland on business and decided to check this joint as it advertised itself as \"earth friendly\" organic, natural food with lots of beer  and wine choices. I am all over it.\n\nI set at the bar and it took a while for someone to recognize my existence. I asked for menu, they took menu from a customer sitting next to me and gave it to me. I asked for a draft beer since I am SD bound beer cruiser ;) they had nothing I liked, tried 3 wines and settled on one \"not very exciting\" chardonnay. It was uneventful and I didn't feel like I was getting a good vibe from the bar crew. The menu didnt sound as interesting either....Since I couldn't order anything I liked to drink I decided to get something small to eat...WHAT A MISTAKE!!! I should have left without ordering anything. \n\nI got this ridiculously small cabbage salad (size of a tea china cup plate) for $8....OMG....seriously?\n\nTake your money and go somewhere else!!! Customer service was crap, drink, wine and beer menu was uneventful if thats even applicable!
