I only go here for the fresh salads. The macaroni, chicken Caesar and seafood pasta salad are all excellent. I find the marinara sauce on the pasta to be very bland and the sandwiches take forever to be made. I shouldn't have to sit at a table to wait for a sandwich in a DELI. But like I said I love the salads
