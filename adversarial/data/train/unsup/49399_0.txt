Over 30 years ago I stopped at Dazzo's. When I got there it was closed. Two men( the Dazzo's brothers, Ron and Frank) were working inside, one of them came to the door and said \"sorry we're closed, come back tomorrow, that's when we officially open\". So my wife, my Mom and I came back the next day and we have been going to Dazzo's since. We've literally have seen the Dazzo's family grow up; their kids and now there grand kids. I love hot dogs and crazy about their beefs and and sausage sandwich, ( you know sweet and hot peppers and real, real, real wet). Even though we moved a bit farther from their location we still make it a point to stop in and grab a bite to eat. Without question there is no other place like Dazzo's in the Valley. As always best wishes the Dazzo family and lets do another 30 more years.
