This is an awesome place with Organic items and friendly staff.  Did I mention they give a Military Discount....HUGE to me to see a business that supports its military and veterans.\n\nThe coffee & tea are awesome, the food is good and the staff are great.   I have never had a staff member with a down day or if they were having one, they did not let you know, they treated you like family, made you feel welcome and made sure you were satisfied.  The atmosphere for hanging out is cool as well, its not very big, but is warm and welcoming.
