Undoubtably there is a new contender for the best korean bbq restaurant in Las Vegas.  Gen Korean BBQ house offers some of the most delicious selections of meat and ALL of their appetizers are included for free!  Your group is allowed to select 4 appetizers and 4 meat selections at a time.  You then cook at the grill centered at your booth's table.  The price and quality can't be beat!  $15 for lunch and $20 for dinner, eat here now and get your money's worth!\n\nOur server Kristina did a good job explaining the different meats and recommending meats for us to grill.  Our selections included the dinner only items (Roast Beef, Galbisal [marinated premium steak]) as well as premium pork belly, beef bulgolgi, and beef brisket.  As a tip, always get the beef brisket because it cooks really fast.  That way you have stuff to eat as the other thicker meats take its time to cook.  \n\nThe appetizers we also ordered (again, surprisingly free)  included japchae (glass noodles), miso soup, seaweed salad, pork katsu cutlet, popcorn shrimp, korean fried chicken, and gyoza.   Of course staple mini dishes like kimchee, rice, spicy pickles, and potato salad were also included and waiting on the table when we were seated.\n\nThe service was great and overall there seemed to be enough staff as almost every booth was filled with customers and yet the food kept on coming.   There are plenty of tables in this large restaurant and parking is easy as it is connected to Galleria Mall.    \n\nSo move over Tofu Hut, Hwaro, Sura, etc.. Gen's finally reached its way from California and I'm sure it's here to stay.
