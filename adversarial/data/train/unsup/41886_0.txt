Awful. Only getting 2 stars cause its cheap. Should've known better. Better cheaper buffets at home at the Indian casinos and that's saying something. \n\nCrab legs are cooked in SALTY Salty water and just sit in it and absorb all that salt and get mushy. Salty mushy crabs legs - so gross.\n\nPrime rib was upwards of medium well,  cut your loss and switch it out, ugh.\n\nVirtually everything just felt like it had been sitting in the window way too long.\n\nFinally I went for the creme brulee, pretty hard to mess that up...\n\nAnd they did....\n\nIt had no caramelized sugar on top and sat in a cold case... \n\nI thought to my self; \n\"Oh how neat they caramelize the sugar in front of you and make it all fresh!\"\n\nNo, they don't. There is no caramelized sugar to CRACK on your freakin creme brullee, they told me \"well there is caramel on the bottom\"\n\nIt's not flaun, it's creme brulee damnit.\n\nNot to mention it was totally instant mix from a box. \nSo nasty. \n\nThis place SUCKS. Way better buffets on the strip for a much better value, sure it's 27 bucks, but the food quality is about par with fast food that sit in a window forever.\n\nAnd yes I still left the waiter 20% cause the only thing I can say good about this place is at least the service was good.\n\nDon't waste your time or money.
