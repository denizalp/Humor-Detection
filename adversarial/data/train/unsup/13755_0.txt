Never EVER going into this store.  I bought a Groupon to their store for a class and called multiple times  in attempts to register.  The staff was rude and inconsiderate, and they were absolutely clueless as to class information. When I purchased the Groupon, I was excited to take one of their classes, but now I'm glad I never did.  I've never been in this store and I will never be.  I even asked to talk to the manager and the owner herself was rude.  I hate to say it, but the employees seemed like just a bunch of stuck up rich people.
