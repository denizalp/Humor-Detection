I've only lived here nearly 2 months now so I realize that's not long for an apartment review.  Still, I wanted to give a shout-out to my new home.\n\nI moved here from NH and did the apartment hunting long distance so that I would have a home to drive to.  Rose is the leasing manager and she has been terrific to me.  I drove straight to the leasing office signed all the papers waiting for me, and was handed the apartment keys within moments of arrival to my new city and state.  \n\nI hadn't seen any photos of the inside of the apartment so peaked inside gingerly when I unlocked the door.  What a pleasant experience -- huge for a one bedroom, clean, neutral colors and lots of sunlight which I adore above all else.  \n\nMy neighbors are all wonderful.  We greet one another going in and out and on the elevator and have snippets of conversation here and there.  \n\nThe pool just opened and I'll take advantage of that soon.  I peaked into the exercise room and it looks nice, too, and plan on using that, as well.\n\nI even get in my 2.5 to 3 mile runs by running in the apt complex parking lot and the private boulevard from the main road to our apartment buildings and making a couple loops.  \n\nI've also met Ron from the maintenance group and he helped me out when I first moved in for logistics of having tv cable installed on the weekend.  \n\nI met Jennifer at the leasing office today and she was a gem and very nice, as well.\n\nI can't think of anything negative to say about my apartment complex.  It's been a very nice choice and the staff have all made my move easy as can be.
