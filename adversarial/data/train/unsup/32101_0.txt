I am so very impressed and happy with the way our home carpets turned out after a weekend visit from Noble Carpet Cleaners. Bright, soft and most of all CLEAN. Thank you to Gene, a hard-working and personable young man. Very professional and knowledgeable. Actually the best service I've had since moving to Las Vegas. Thank you!
