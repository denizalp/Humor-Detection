Great Hours. Limited Equipment. Wonderful Staff.\n\nThe main appeal of this gym is that it's a 24\/7, no frills kind of thing. The array of equipment is limited, but sufficient to get in a variety of decent workouts.\n\nThe staff, however, are particularly friendly and helpful. They make a point of knowing your name, and always let you know when they're organizing group workouts or new classes.\n\nAnd while the place is not that large (especially for a gym), it's rarely busy, and I've never had to wait to use any of the equipment.
