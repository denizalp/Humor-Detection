OK, the donuts are good. I only eat them about once a year. It's not the donuts (kind of ) that I have an issue with. It's the service.\n\nI've only been in twice and the service was certainly less than stellar. I felt a bit like I was in the Seinfeld episode \"The Soup Nazi.\" We came all this way for good donuts, but I kind of felt we were treated poorly. We were rushed. There were like 50 varieties of donuts-- none with any labeling at all-- and I asked questions. The woman working made me feel like I was just a pain. She was rude when my daughter asked for fritters, too. \"We don't have any. And even if we did, they're not included in the dozen.\" :\/ OK...\n\nThe other thing I have an issue with-- and this is just a personal thing-- is their obviously liberal use of trans fat. Even the major donut chains have taken trans fats off the menu. Jack Frost hasn't, and the flavor is good but trans-fatty. Trans fats leave this oily film in your mouth that is easily identifiable. I really wish they'd switch to a trans-fat free cooking oil. There's just no need for it anymore. It makes a once a year treat into a once a decade treat for me. Deal breaker. :(
