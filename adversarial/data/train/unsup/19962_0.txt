Incredibly slow service on multiple visits.  Prices and overall value are quite good on happy hour, though not so great during regular hours.  Early when this place first opened I enjoyed the really hot salsa\/sauce and it was served in the standard salsa container, but now it has been switched to a little spoon sized serving.  You'd think that either the price ought to go up for a decent portion or the little spoon size ought to be a complimentary condiment.  \n\nTequila selection is substantial and the happy hour tequila was actually a decent tequila.  This is a notable plus because many places with upscale spirits tend to offer garbage for the happy hour drink specials.\n\nFair amount of eye candy too, female wise, for those that care.
