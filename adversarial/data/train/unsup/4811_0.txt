I loved my experience at Milos.  I would highly recommend coming for lunch and sampling their 3 course lunch menu for $20.12\n\nI order the octopus salad ($10 supplement) which was well worth it!\n\nThe Lavriki (sea bass) had a full filet and was simple yet flavorful\n\nWalnut Cake for dessert (the yogurt martini was better)\n\nDefinitely make reservations for lunch if you're in Vegas!
