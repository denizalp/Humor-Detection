Purchased a refrigerator.  The salesperson was knowledgeable and helpful regarding the product and arranging delivery.  The excellent customer service shifted me away from buying the fridge at the same price from a competitor.\n\nThe delivery people were also excellent.  They were courteous and helpful, and effectively overcame a few obstacles to get the job done.
