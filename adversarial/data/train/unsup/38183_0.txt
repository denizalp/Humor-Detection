I asked the waiter what was best and he said the vermicelli.  I've had this at tons of other restaurants in and out of Vietnam and this dish is very good.  The ingredients were some of the freshest I have ever had at a Vietnamese restaurant.  The reason for no 5th star is that the noodles were a little soft and I've had better sauce that you use to mix in the bowl.  The Vietnamese (iced) coffee was very good, but I've had better at many other places.  I'd go back when in the neighborhood.
