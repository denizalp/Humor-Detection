I know some people love this place but I have tried several times now and just don't like it for a few reasons. Regular coffee is bitter and the service is a bit odd, like they are recovering from the prior evening. Checked out at counter and i was presented with an ipad to click one of three giant buttons on how much of a tip i wanted to leave, which i thought was a bit obnoxious. I prefer their competition C3 down the street. However if you want authentic coffees I think this is the place for you. They are all about coffee.
