Met up with some of my favorites for lunch...Terri R, Suzy H, and the current Duchess of Fix8, Shirley B. \n\nFix8 Fitness Cafe is located in Henderson off Horizon Ridge. Their specialty...clean eats.  Your choices are healthy ones of course. You can select off their menu, which include Steaks, Fish, Turkey, Chicken, and Salads. This joint even has Loco Moco's. There's multiple combos to choose from, but I decided to customize mine to a large order of steak (8 oz clean \/ no seasoning), mushrooms, and some greens.  The steak was prepared medium, was tender, and full of flavor even though it was clean. The broccoli was also tender, if that even makes sense.  In my opinion, the prices are fair considering the portions and the staff here is great. I will probably be back since I'm in the area every once in awhile. \n\nMy Wishlist:\n-Although you can customize your order, the prices should be adjusted if you decide to take something off the combo. I deleted the rice and instead of giving me the option to pay less, I was only given the option to substitute. In fact, I paid an extra $1 because I chose broccoli. I guess broccoli cost a full $1 more than rice.\n-Add Bison and Ostrich to the menu\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (419\/500)
