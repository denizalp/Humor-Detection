I went in looking for a last minute cake for my nephews birthday. It was about 7pm and the bakery associate was cleaning the area around the cakes. I was looking for a specific type of frosting and had asked her how I could tell it was the specific type. She couldn't be bothered to even look at me directly and stated \"it'll be named on the label\" and continued to clean. She was very unhelpful in assisting me. I would rather take my business where someone is at least willing to help me find my item.
