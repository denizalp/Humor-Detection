This has to be, hands down, the worst meal I have ever been served anywhere, in a restaurant or home.  The chicken was dry and tiny, the roll was rock hard, the corn was a chewy mess.  I won't even endeavor to describe what I think was supposed to be coleslaw.  The restaurant itself was filthy to boot!  You could not pay me to eat there again.  The upshot to this review was that the wait staff were terrific.  We were lost and they went out of their way to assist us, which is why we didn't walk out as soon as they set this horrible excuse for rotisserie chicken down.
