$50 a person. I guess this is standard buffet price here on the Las Vegas  strip. If you're into king crab legs cut in 1\/2 or shrimp, the price is worth it. They served prime rib, lamb, Turkey, bbq chicken, and pork loin as well. The asian food area was very sad, the sushi was sadder, the desserts were buffet standard although I'd have e to say their dessert panna cotta shot cup  was a nice little treat. Standing in line was a 30 minute wait and this was on a Sunday around 5pm.
