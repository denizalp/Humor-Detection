Came here on Mother's Day (even though I'm not a mom yet). haha. My other half wanted to bring me out and on top of everything, he's not a fan of shabu shabu. But he insisted, because he knows I love shabu shabu!\n\nOn Mother's Day, they had a special get 2 entrees & 2 drinks will get you free shrimp. So... why not. We ended up getting the meat\/chicken plate. And everything else is  unlimited! That means: Refill on Rice, Salad and Veggies. Initially, I didn't know about this and ordered a side of udon noodles. Which I thought, wasn't really necessary. When I heard about the unlimited, I ended up getting additional 3 bowls of salad (portion is not that big), 2 bows of rice and one additional veggie dish. All just for me. :) \n\nHonestly, I prefer the shabu shabu in Boston. Where there's different types of broth you can choose from and then just throw everything in the broth and eat\/drink from it. While this shabu place in Henderson, NV, the only two soup choice are: Shabu Shabu or Sukiyaki (water or Dashi soup & egg). \n\nWe ended up getting the Shabu Shabu, to me it is tasteless because they only add water and one piece of seaweed in the broth. The broth is not tasty, but it is used to cook the meat\/veggie\/entr√©e that you get. Then after the meat or seafood is cooked, you dip it in 3 different types of sauce, which is all yummy except the spicy one (because I can't handle spice). If this place add additional tasty broths like kim chee, tom yum, etc... then this place will be my go-to-on a weekly basis. \n\nThe service here is great; attentive and quick. I wouldn't mind coming here again, but Boston's Shabu Shabu is better than here because they have different tasty broth options.
