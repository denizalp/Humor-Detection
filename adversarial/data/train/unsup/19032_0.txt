I've switched gyms, leaving my beloved Yorkville Club for Goodlife. Goodlife St Clair is a 10 minute walk from my home so it was an obvious choice. The gym itself is pretty standard, variety of machines semi-cramped in a medium sized gym. The cleanliness is pretty average; the showers are always clean, the gym is in maintained moderately well, however a few towels they supply are stained or tattered. It get's it's just 'okay' review for the crowd. I'm not one of those gay guys that goes to the gym to hook up or cruise but I do find it motivational to see some fit, friendly people working out. I've tried this gym at different times during the week and have a pretty good idea of the crowds. If you go before noon it's going to be liver spots all up in the change room. It attracts a very elderly crowd in the week during the daytime. It's convenient if you want to get in and get out. There's no wait for machines and old people are generally friendly. The evenings during the week attract the mix crowd and it gets very busy. I find myself waiting for machines or having to re-adjust my workout to accommodate the long wait times. The weekend afternoons and evening attracts the Jersey Shore crowd; the guys who come to the gym for 4 main reasons: (1) to work on their arms, (2) to work on their chest, (3) to talk on the phone, (4) to spend 70% of their time talking to their \"bro's\". Goodlife St Clair is adequate and I don't have many complaints towards Goodlife the company, but I may try the Extreme fitness located around the corner once my membership is up this year.
