I'm so happy I found Senza Pelo. Tasha is fantastic! She listens to what I want and her recommendations are always spot on. I never feel like my Botox is over or under-done, like I have at past establishments. The office staff is always pleasant and welcoming. My appointments are always running on time so I am in and out.
