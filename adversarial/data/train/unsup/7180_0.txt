oh my goodness. I had so much fun here.\n\nI am honestly not the biggest fan of Karaoke in general but wanted to get up and there and give it a go again.\n\nI was not that drunk either, or maybe i was (can't remember).  Last week Sunday night came here around  12 midnight and got to sing Jessie's Girl by Rick Springfield, lol .the ladies seem to just really like that song in general, always a party that busts out. Decent looking cougars there, if I say so myself...  yeah and I had a bunch of impromtu backup dancers dancing right at my feet.\n\n  So yeah it was fun but the song selection here was weird even some very popular artists there were only certain obscure songs from that person.  I like the song Jessie's Girl but it was not really my first choice or whatever.  There were drink specials like 2 pitchers of Miller or Coor's Light for 12 bucks. I think I drank 90% of one pitcher by myself..YEAH.
