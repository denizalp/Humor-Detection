In considering my experience, (without exaggeration) this law firm doesn't deserve any stars. The lawyer assigned to me from this office was too busy for my case. He had so many other cases that he couldn't focus on the details of mine.  It was up to me to ensure that the court received the correct information in time for the projected court date. This place was terrible about returning phone calls, and\/ or getting paperwork out on time.  Also, my case required that I appear in court. The lawyer assigned to me from this office reassured me that they would appear in my place. This was far from the truth. I was called a day prior to the court appearance to show up to court by 9am. I was fortunate enough to be available and appear on time. I could've handle this entire case myself but I decided to be on the safe side and hire an attorney. Even though I won my case, I would never use these people again. Winning the case is the only reason why I didn't take further action in reporting these individuals. They were very unprofessional and seemed incompetent at times.Â I am a very reasonable person, most people would not of put up with this level of unprofessionalism. So, this review is merely to help others and hopefully persuade them to spend their hard earned money at another law firm.\n\nNote: My first contact with this Law Office was located on North 83rd near Peoria, AZ close to the Arrowhead Mall.
