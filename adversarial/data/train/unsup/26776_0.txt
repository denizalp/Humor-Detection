I bring my two cars to this shop often. First it was oil changes but now I trust them to do whatever maintenance is needed on the car. Last couple of times they had to replace my brakes and an oil pan. Their prices are very reasonable specially compared to Honda where I used to go. I tend to ask a lot of questions and they always take time to explain everything to me. Top-notch service. It's nice to have a local place that is trustworthy.
