\"Too... much... beef....\"\n\nI don't think those words have ever escaped my lips before. There was entirely too much good beef there, what with all the other accoutrements that came with the meal.\n\nWe did a sort of \"steak flight\" a multi course meal deal involving Angus Beef and Kobe Beef, which... damn, I'm still reveling about. \n\nThe decor and style of this place just broods a sort of richy masculinity, a veritable playboy-ness of being strong and forward without encroaching on metrosexuality. It's as if a Wall Street broker made a down town Manhattan version of what he thought a rich style Texas steak house ought to be.\n\nAll in all this is a place you go to for either an impressive meal, or to impress others with your super credit line, and flashy new suit. It works kinda ok for a romantic meal, but over all, it's a great food dining destination.
