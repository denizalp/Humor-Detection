I really wanted to like you, but you spilled my boyfriend's soda and cleaned up your counter, but not my boyfriend's glass. And upon check in you told us to sit outside and have a drink as we waited and told us you'd remember to come and get us when our table was ready. But you forgot about us and marked us off as seated. So we waited an hour and had no food. Boo. Maybe this just wasn't meant to be.
