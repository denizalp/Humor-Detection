Pick two of the following: service, quality, or value. That would sum up how I felt about most restaurants, you could only get two of the above, never really all three. After visiting Yonaka, I swear they used some kind of alchemy. Maybe in the back of the kitchen they have a philosopher's stone churning out magic. \n\nThat magic of theirs is putting out dehydrated this, compressed that, candied this and maintaining a clean presentation that has no \"odour\" of pretentiousness. What more can one ask for in off strip dining? Really, the only thing that could make the experience better is if they threw money at you. Chances are if that ever happened, it would be folded nicely in some origami. \n\nIs there an option to mark \"Yes\" for \"Good for dates\"? If your date is not a success after visiting Yonaka you're doing something wrong. \n\nIf you're not convinced on visiting Yonaka yet, then let me tell you what I ate! The Crispy Brussels sprouts are a must get. The dish comes in a surprisingly generous portion and very clean flavors. Unless you really love edamame, or craving it I would pass on the grilled edamame. HOWEVER you would be crazy to pass on ordering the Sake Orenji and its tasty citrus flavors! I believe that its only $7 during happy hour too. Now the Wagyu ishiyaki was good, but a bit gimmicky, if you want something interactive then by all means go ahead. For me the stone cooled a bit quickly after about the 5th piece and took a bit longer to cook the delicious sliver of marbleized beef. The Pokuyaki is recommended, comes in large portions of Kurobata pork, complimented by a fennel puree, dehydrogenated fennel, sliced jalapenos and granny smith apples. Finally to desert (phew!), just take a look at it (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas#HbyoBxcqDscvxc9Zvway0A) if you don't want to try that, there must be an error in your DNA replications, or you're allergic to chocolate. \n\nI believe the happy hour starts at 11pm to close (around 2am?) with a decent amount of selection (SAKE ORENJI!), $3 Asahi draft, and wine.\n\nThe only thing *I* would like to see from Yonaka in improvements is a better beer's list. They have the classic Japanese beers, but with craft beer booming in Japan there are lots of tasty options that could be added and pair well with a lot of their food.
