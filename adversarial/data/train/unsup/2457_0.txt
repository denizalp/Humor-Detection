This cardiology office holds a very dear place in my heart. \n\nI was born with a cardiac defect, but it didn't require serious attention and surgery until about ten years ago. During that time, I searched and had appointments with at least five different cardiologists in the community. No one can hold a candle to Dr. Feyrer - Melk. (Yes, she has a difficult name, but her initials are AMFM, so for those of you who recall traditional radio, it's actually pretty easy to remember.) \n\nThe thing about AMFM is that not only is she well-trained and competent in her chosen field, she's a compassionate \"hand holder\" who can empathize when the going gets tough. And frankly, when you have heart issues, your emotions run high and it's reassuring to have a doctor who truly cares. She would personally call my home to check on me. She gave me her cell phone number when I was stressing out. Her office would fit me in for a same day appointment if I desperately felt that I needed one. \n\nAMFM in the process of changing up her practice and I'm not sure if she's taking new patients. If you can't get in to see her, she has a Nurse Practitioner (Theresa Jacobsen) who is also outstanding. (AMFM would demands the same quality in her peers.) As a Nurse Practitioner, Theresa can write prescriptions and do essentially all the things as a doctor.  However if you were to have some extraordinary problem that's outside the scope of a Nurse Practitioner, then AMFM would step in and get you through it. It's really a win-win situation.
