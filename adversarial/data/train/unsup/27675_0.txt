This is our fave mexican restaurant in town! Love their warm chips and bean dip!  The salsa is good too! All lunches & dinners come with a cup of their signature fideo soup which I love!  I ordered the carne asade taquitos ($9.95) from the appetizer menu.  Comes with guacamole and sour cream.  My husband got the enchilada & flauta combo ($13.95) which came with beans & rice.  The service is ALWAYS top notch.  ALWAYS!  We have also tried their carne asada tacos, the carne asada platter, the cheese enchiladas, the chile rellanos-all very good.  For desert that have awesome sopapillas and churros but most of the time we can barely finish our dinners.
