Hands down one of THE best croissants I've ever had exists here. It's on my way to work so sometimes I stop in and grab a coffee and pastry to go.  I've also stopped in midday. Oddly every time I've gone in it looks a bit empty and understocked.  The food is good but the environment leaves a bit to be desired.
