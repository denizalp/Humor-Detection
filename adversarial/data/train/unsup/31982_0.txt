Everything about Cafe 33 is great. Service, timing for take out, take out packaging, cleanliness, location (free street parking is usually available off of Shady Ave or other side streets), and most importantly, their food.\n\nCafe 33 is definitely my *favorite* neighborhood takeout place. I have probably ordered take out from them at least 20 times and eaten at the actual restaurant on a dozen other occasions. \n\nTheir food is consistently good. I abandoned my old neighborhood take out in favor of Cafe 33s unchanging menu and service. My favorite entree is the dry saut√©ed string beans and it remains the same whether I order it in the restaurant or have it for take out. I've also had their rice cake entree and multiple different side dishes that were all equally delicious. \n\nI have also not tried the hot pepper chicken, but have heard that it is worth getting if you eat chicken (I don't) and like food with a nice kick.
