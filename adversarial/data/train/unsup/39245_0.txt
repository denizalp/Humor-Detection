This spot has the best pad Thai ever! Ive tried pad Thai from so many restaurants and I always end up always going back to jatujak. Once you've tried pad Thai from this place, pad Thai from somewhere will never be the same and it will never compare to jatujaks. The pad Thai is cooked with tamarind sauce instead of ketchup. It's just so tasty  and they give you so much food for the price you pay! This is always my go to place whenever I'm craving for pad Thai.
