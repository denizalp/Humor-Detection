I get in these moods where I just crave certain styles of food.. lately Ive been on this Vietnamese kick that has lasted for the past 3 weeks.. I think maybe in a past life I was a beautiful Asian woman!! In any case I took my co-worker Ruben to a place I just so happened upon online.. its called Thao's Sandwichs.. we walked in and found that we were the only non Vietnamese in the place.. all eyes turned on us.. Oh hell yeah, this was a VERY GOOD SIGN!!!  This means the food is going to rock my world and my tummy!\n\nThe place.. just awesome! We both had Banh Mi as well as Pho.. piles of fresh veggies and chiles.. loads of sauces, hoisin, sriracha as well as chile paste and soy.. the Banh Mi had one of the best crusty French rolls Ive had to date (sorry Saigon Sandwich) with ample fillings and an out of this world taste. I had the Pork Roll and Ruben had the special. Special was loaded with Vietnamese style meatballs (not the chewy ones) and covered with cilantro, chiles , pickled carrot and daikon..\n\nWe moved on to Pho.. I had the everything Pho including beef brisket, tendon and tripe.. in a delicious beef soup that wasn't salty as some other places tend to focus on.. seems to be quite a bit of complexity in that there soup! Then fishing around in there found all of those wonderful rice noodles.. then started covering it in Mules Ear, chile and Thai basil.. so many complex flavors all with a harmonious balance and aroma! Ruben played it safe with just the lean tender beef Pho. He can be such a daddy's little girl when it comes to new food experiences.\n\nThe one thing I would complain about was the fact that they were out of Boba and I settled for a Leche Choobee, it tasted like soap.. I think Dove to be exact.. simply vile.. I think the Choobee was alright, I may try it again some other time but without the Lyche!
