I had to try this place after hearing so many good things about it and it certainly did not disappoint! I'm not really an Indian foodie but here goes:\n\nThe Chicken Korma with rice was absolutely amazing. The creaminess of the coconut milk and spiciness of the sauce made for a perfect combination of flavors! \n\nThe garlic naan was light, fresh and equally flavorful. Warning: If you get this takeout, your car will smell like garlic for days! \n\nThe curry chicken bowl lunch special (extra spicy) was tasty and full of spices. It was the perfect portion for lunch! \n\nI have only ordered take out on the 2 visits I have made. The place seems to be really slow, so I hope it picks up soon! I know I will be going back soon! I've heard that the samosas are the best!
