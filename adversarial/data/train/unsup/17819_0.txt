This is probably the last time I eat at Tick Tock but I might stop back for drinks and sit at the bar and watch all the lunacy.  Place is a GOLDMINE for that.  Came here late on a Fri nite and was craving a fish fry.  The server lady we got was maybe 70?  Ordered 2 VODKA and diets to drink.  When they came out we could not tell this was NOT vodka.  We both asked her twice what it was and we were told vodka.  Later upon receiving the bill it said: BAC (in her own handwriting).  Anyone who loves booze as much as I do knows what Bacardi tastes like this was Bacardi.  Fish fry was gross and fries were bagged, frozen, cold and greasy...yumm..  When they took my full plate of food away one would of thought to ask how our food was?  Nah.  Come to find out I could of gotten any potato side instead of the crap fries but I was never given the option.  If you like to flag down your waitress for everything you need and be told what your going to eat\/drink without any input then come here!  Maybe Gertrude needs to hang up the orthopedics and retire?  Only reason this place gets another star is the staff is (mostly) friendly and there is that excitement in the air while walking to your car at night here that you 1) might get robbed or 2) may get asked to buy rocks.  Both are pretty sweet.
