I recently went to Frilly Lilly for my first Brazilian in years. I was nervous, but my waxer Erin made me feel very comfortable. She talked with me the whole time, keeping my mind off of the pain, and she was SO quick. The end result was better than I expected and way less painful than I anticipated! I also really liked how they have the \"before and after\" products for you to use in the room. The price is a bit high, but when you're dealing with someone waxing your lady parts, I believe that you get what you pay for! I will absolutely be back, in fact I have another appointment booked already. Love this place!
