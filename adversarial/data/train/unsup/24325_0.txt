Luminarias...oooh...\n\nThe big bug sculpture exhibit lured us into spending the evening at the fantabulous DBG Los Noches de las Luminarias...that title is as long as the labyrinthine paths!   My little cutie pie was so ecstatic to find such bugs at the end of the trails!  His favorite were the giants ants on the hillside.  Who cares about the scintillating luminarias dotting the paths.  Got us some Baileys and coffee plus cider for the little guy, we were good to go.  \n\nFun!
