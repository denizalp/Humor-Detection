Difficult to review hardware stores since this is really not my thang.  However, I had to come in to source some toilets, faucets, possibly hardwood floors for some renos.\n\nThe difference between Lowe's Vs. Home Depot is that it seems more refined in terms of their displays.  Plus, they seem to sell more large appliances like washers\/dryers, fridges, vacuums, etc.  Home Depot doesn't have as much, or any if at all, large appliances.  Lowe's also has more kitchen\/bathroom vignettes displayed.\n\nWhat Home Depot has though is that their customer service seems better!  They are friendlier and each time I do hafta go there, I am always acknowledged.  This may be a generalisation, but the salespeople at Home Depot SEEM more knowledgeable about certain products.\n\nOne comment that I must make is that I did not like how BOTH Lowe's\/HD displayed their toilets.  They are at least 6-7' off the floor with the actual boxed products underneath.  I expected to judge size by having the products on the sales floor, but no.  Very difficult for me to gauge size when I am unable to pretend to sit on them to properly gauge size.
