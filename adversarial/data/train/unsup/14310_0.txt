You win, darling husband. Flock rocks. \n\nI had the Frenchie salad last night, hold the onions, add cheese and a side of chicken. It was a huge, healthy meal. I was left feeling full and great afterwards. Even though Flock has a few choice salads that are mega popular, they still make each one to order, something you can taste. \n\nFlock here for you lunch or supper. \n\nI've found your flock, Shepherd.\n\nOK, I'm done.
