I absolutely love the walking trail. The trail is paved but, especially in the spring\/summer, you still get a heavy dose of lush green plants and flowers all around. I am so glad I recently found this trail because I plan on making it a weekly visit.\n\nThere's also a parking lot right next to where the trail begins, which is convenient.\n Only thing is there's no indication of the length of the track (how many laps for a mile).  Also, when we went last week, the bathrooms were locked up. Not sure if they're permanently closed or just haven't opened up yet but it would be nice to have at least one facility available in the park.\n\nThe playground is very large and well-maintained, and there's always kiddos around enjoying it.
