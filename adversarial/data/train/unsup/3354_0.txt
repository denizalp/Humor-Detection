This place really is trying. The hostess and waitstaff was friendly and dressed very \"hip\", but waiting 10 minutes for a glass a wine when the place was practically empty is not cool. The place feels like it is trying to be very cool and fresh, but it has the feeling of a place that won't be around long, as it looks like it was thrown together on a budget.\n\nSpeaking of a budget..holy prices, batman! The roles were expensive, miso soup for $8? NOT prices that reflected the quality or atmosphere; they should have been half of what they were.\n\nThe sushi was interesting (some sauces were a bit different and refreshing), but not as good as you would expect for the prices paid.\n\nIf this place is around in a year, I'll be very surprised. There are just so many other good choices in the area.
