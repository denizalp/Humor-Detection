Hands down my favorite bar in Las Vegas!!! Absolutely nothing like it!! It's like stepping into the Great Gatsby film. You must experience it for yourself.\nPS: Don't come here if you're looking for cheap liquor, only the finest top shelf liquor is served here... and for a reason. The best drinks you'll ever have. Cheers to the amazing Mixologist.
