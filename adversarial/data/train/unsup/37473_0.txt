When Bluebird Kitchen opened I was so excited and not let down at all. The menu items are always fresh and up to par. The House Roast Beef and House Turkey sandwiches are my typical orders and they live up to what a sandwich should be. Last night at a Yelp event I was able to sample Bluebird catering items for the first time. The asparagus wrapped in phyllo dough is so good. Well done, gang!
