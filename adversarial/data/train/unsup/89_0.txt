This would've gotten a 3 star (\"A-OK\") review, had it not been for the over-entitled cabhop(or whatever they're called) who made an already bad day even worse. After losing $900 @ the casino, the last thing i need is to be guilt tripped and hustled for a tip. All he does is blow a whistle, which is redundant and useless because the cabbies can see people line up and would drive up anyways if he wasnt there. Anyways, I was nursing my big losses and wasnt really paying attention, so i just got into the cab and let the driver put my bag into the back. Then the cabhop opens the door, sarcastically snarls \"WELL I HOPE EVERYONE TREATED YOU WELL HERE\", and slams the door on me...\n\nWell, everyone did treat me well there, except for that asshole. The rooms are old (perhaps intentionally), and the internet is like $15 bucks, or $25 in one of the convention rooms, which IMO is lame and sucks a lot of ass. The tv is also from like 1983 and the remote doesnt work. Additionally, I waited in a huge ass line at the cafe outside of the elevators for a quick hot breakfast (quiche on the menu), only to find out after 20 mins of waiting that they only had pastries. In addition to that, they left my coffee out of my order, so i had to wait another 10 mins to get that..for some reason.\n\nThis casino would've started with a 3 for average accomodations, and gotten a 4 for $10 craps tables and a smokin hot raven haired cocktail waitress named Roe, but because of the previous 2 paragraphs, -2. I get free stays at harrahs because i lose a lot of money, so i may stay here again in he future....if it is the only choice...and if the other choice is imperial palace...lol\n\nMy name is Boris Yelpsin, and I approve this message.
