Whatever you do, do not waste your money ,time, or  resources coming to this establishment.... it's very un clean the room up on entry smell horrible, had to purchase disinfectant products for the horrible mildew smell there were roaches crawling everywhere by my 2nd day of stay, and the front desk mistakenly checked me out and gave someone else a key,  who happen to walk in on me as I slept in my bed. The business offered no recourse no discount no partial refund just a verbal apology....... Worse experience of my life in any Hotel or bed and breakfast or extended stay environment.....
