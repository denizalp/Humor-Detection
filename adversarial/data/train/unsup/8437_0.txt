The bill for our party of eleven only came to $148.  Friggin' unbelievable for dim sum.  I particularly loved the har gow (shrimp dumplings in the clear wrappers).  Funny detail- My dad recognized one of the waitresses who is also a dealer at Main Street.  What's more, she recognized him.  He gambles way too much!
