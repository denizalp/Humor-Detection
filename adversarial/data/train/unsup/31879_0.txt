I had been hanging out in the hotel with some friends when they had to catch their flight and I found myself alone with a few hours to kill. Gun ranges in Vegas have guns not available in other states. I googled gun ranges and the gun garage popped up. I called with a few questions and the young lady that picked up was very nice. \n\nI arrived about an hour from closing and the staff was all very nice and accomodating. They know people are there for an experience and take care of you. My instructor Kyle (ladies working there teasing him because his brothers name is Kenny) served in the military so you know you are getting some legit advice and proper instruction. \n\nI choose the \"only in vegas\" package also know as the \"full auto\" package. Because I booked online they also gave me a magazine for the 1911 pistol. (They taught correct terminology, but I have a lousy memory). The package included the UMP, Saw, Uzi, p90 and a mounted 1919. I also bought 3 rounds for the 50 cal sniper rifle at the suggestion of the field instructor. GREAT SUGGESTION. He had a special protocol for it because it has a huge kick, big cloud of smoke and a BANG. The targets are fairly close but you can ask them to move them further down range if you want.The first magazine for each gun I did controlled bursts and the second I went full auto.\n\nAfter I paid the staff called me a cab(their free shuttle ends around 6). End of the day I had a great time and a few souvenirs. Would visit again. You may be paying a few hundred bucks but these guns are worth tens of thousands combined.
