Cleaning out some boxes and found a necklace I received as a gift I never ever liked. Turns out the stone was glass but the metal was worth $60...yea! I would have just thrown away otherwise. \nInside was nice and they have large screens when they measure\/identify your jewelry, makes it feel like a completely honest offer and transaction.
