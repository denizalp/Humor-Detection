Last name hungry, First name always...\n\nWhen you visit Las Vegas one of your goals should be to eat. The second goal should be finding a buffet to eat at. The problem is there's a lot of choices and It's hard to make a decision. If I'm going to gain the calories and have to work them off I want it to be worth it! I personally prefer a buffet with a lot of breakfast food, fried food, and dessert. I'm not interested in fish or meat. \n\nThis Buffet was interesting because it's the first place I saw that made fresh pancakes. They had red velvet, banana, blueberry, or chocolate chip. They had lots of choices with several different toppings. Not only could you make your own pancakes but they had a crÃªpe station too. If you aren't looking for sweets head over to the omelets station so they can make one fresh for you. I love a buffet that offers stations, where the food is fresh, fresh, is key for me especially when you're visiting a buffet.\n\nEven though I didn't eat much of it they still offered a good selection of pizza, fish, sushi, and meat. I needed to save lots of room for dessert! \n\nAs for the dessert, bar...they nailed it! \n\nCandy apples, gelato, chocolate covered marshmallows, scones and jam, crepes station and about 20 other desserts! Keep the sweets coming! \n\nThe ambiance was pretty awesome too. My only complaint is there's a long line and we had to pay $10 to skip the line along with $30 for the buffet. my friend paid an additional $20 for the unlimited Mimosas. It can get quite pricey fast...Even with all those prices, I would still come back! \n\nNom nom nom!
