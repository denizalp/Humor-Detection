Don't judge a book by its cover.  This is how I feel about Mare Pizzeria.  Doesn't look fancy outside like other places and probably won't attract too many foodies but I had a Hawaiian slice last weekend and was pleasantly surprised.  A very good portion of cheese and ingredients, crust was not dry like other places that also warm up the slices for take out. \n\nService was quick and price was fair.  Definitely much better than anything at Pizza Pizza and I would say rivals the fancy Neopolitan style pizzas out there.  \n\nGive it a try and you may be surprised too.  For a few dollars, you've got nothing to lose.
