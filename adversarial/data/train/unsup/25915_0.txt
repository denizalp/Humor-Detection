I really like the boba here. They have an extensive menu, full of different boba flavors and different ways to get it. I like my taro and getting taro is usually my way to judge a boba place. The taro here wasn't too sweet and had enough of the taro flavor to make it yummy. The place also had nice little snack foods like fries and calamari, which aren't bad. I make it a point in stopping by here when I get a boba craving.
