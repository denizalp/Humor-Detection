The Pebble Marketplace Great Clips is one of the hair salons that I frequent. It is halfway between home and work. It is  also convenient because it shares the same shopping center as Smith's, my bank, and Starbuck's. After work I appreciate convenience.\n\n  More than convenience, I appreciate talented and personable hair stylists. I'm sure many of you reading this have had a Samurai hairstylist where you couldn't wait for the miserable hairstylist to finish aggressively cutting your hair. Anyway at the Pebble Marketplace Great Clips, every hairstylist that cut and styled my hair has been talented and personable. With that said, I give a shout out to hair stylist Robin. Her artistry of beard trimming and hair styling transformed my caveman look to clean cut within 20 minutes. Throughout the whole time we were joking about the Vegas weather.\n\n  Great Clips is up to date with the computer age. When you visit Great Clips, you have the option of putting your name in a computer data base. It's kind of neat because it records your hairstyle. So, when Robin started cutting my hair, she knew off the bat that I prefer the three on the side. The computer data base also comes in handy for online appointments.\n\n  What Great Clips isn't is a fancy hair salon. It is my understanding that they don't wash your hair at a sink. What Great Clips is is Great Value. Twelve dollars buys a nice haircut. People have complimented me on the Pebble Marketplace Great Clips haircuts.  So, they are doing something right. Value extends to beard trims and shaves. Their $5 beard trims and shaves are one of the best deals in the area. \n\n  Regardless that I am not dedicated to one hair salon,  there ought to be additional check-ins here. The service and quality of haircuts equal 3.5 stars.
