Hello NYPD Pizza.  I'd like to turn myself in.  Please arrest me for attempting to warm up a so called NY style pizza from elsewhere in the fridge cause it was that baaaaad!  I heard New York's finest can offer me just a quintessential slice to expunge me of the heinous pizza crime I commited!  \n\nYes!  Just one meatball slice was all it took!  The classic NY slice foldability was on point.  The crust had the perfect balance of chispyness (Chewy and Crispy) The cheese AKA the fats had a nice stretchyness to it.  \nA really good foldable meatball slice that I ordered indeed.  Since this was an already made pizza slice that just had to be reheated.  Some of my homemade meatsaball toppings were room temperatureish.  So it could've used an extra couple minutes in the oven.  I'll be back for a full size made to order pie with no lukewarm topplings.  \n\nOverall this location is a good place to watch a weekend game or why not burn off those calories afterwards and with a high intensity interval dumpster diving session at the Nordstrom Rack in the same plaza.
