If I could give 10 stars, I would. I have a wonderful experience EVERY TIME I come here. Everyone that works here does amazing (& very thorough) work. Clean, organized, calming environment & they use new utensils on each person! Doesn't get better than this. I highly recommend this salon! \n\n-\"I feel pretty... Oh so pretty....\"
