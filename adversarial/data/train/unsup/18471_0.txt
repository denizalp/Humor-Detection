I wanted to try a new threading shop and upon checking on Yelp, I decided to give Javals a try. Right when you walk in there is the inviting smell of incense. I grew up with the smell so to me it was familiar and luckily it was not too strong. The shop is very clean and there are black leather sofas to sit on while you wait. Indian music plays on the T.V., which I find exotic and relaxing. The lady that was working is focused and checks on how you are doing as she is threading. She had me sanitize my hands before sitting in the chair which now makes complete sense since you will have to hold your eyebrows in some parts during the threading process. Other places never had me do that, but now I know and I appreciate it! The last place that did my eyebrows made it little too thin and I like mines a little thicker (more natural),so I had a good clean up while I grow my eyebrows out some more. I will be back in 2 weeks because I am so happy with the clean up and shaping. I did not have an appointment, but walk ins are welcomed. Prices are extremely affordable as well. Give this place a try!
