I'm beginning to wonder whether Gordon Ramsay is just a fictitious, overly confident chef. Having tried out several of his restaurants now, I'm really just not that impressed with anything he's put out. His concepts are just too over the top, trying way too hard.\n\nI guess this time it's with an Asian influence e.g. honey-pig bao buns (translation: bun buns?), soba noodle chicken salad, etc. Except... the servers are all wearing this shiny pewter\/charcoal grey spandex-type dress and bowling shoes? \n\nThe burgers are mounds high, piled with condiments and requiring knife and fork. The hotdogs were visually appealing. We tried the Pork Belly Dawg and it wasn't bad - but the pork belly and sauce added on top of the hotdog made everything super salty. I like how they used a gourmet sesame bun though instead of the usual cheap-ass stuff. It made a big difference in the texture - no dry and loose crumbs all over the place.\n\nHowever, the truffle parmesan fries were seriously delicious! Another salt-heavy item but the fries were crispy, the cheese was pungent and drool-inducing, and the truffle oil just made you want to keep eating 'em! \n\nI was most impressed with dessert (and to think, I almost passed it up because I was unimpressed with the hotdog). Just try to NOT salivate over this: sticky toffee pudding with salted peanut caramel ice cream PUSH POPS! \n\nRiiiiiight?! I haven't had a push pop in a loooong time (Flintstones anyone?). Dang these were crazy yummy with the toffee pudding at just the right amount of sweetness so that the salted peanut caramel ice cream carried most of the flavor. It was gooey but not  to the point where you had to pick it off your teeth. All the flavors just blended together for this amazing peanut buttery taste. I just want to go back for this!\n\nbottom line: gets a good vote for a hangover meal contender, but expect to pay $$.
