Good spread, great service (our coffee was refilled multiple times without request) and pretty good selection.   Eggs Benedict & florentine were cooked well, hollandaise seasoned well.   But I wasn't impressed.  Pretty standard and I'd rather visit elsewhere, if I'm completely honest... especially with the smoke lingering in the line area...
