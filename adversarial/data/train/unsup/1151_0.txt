I'm torn with this place.  The room itself deserves a 2 star but the casino deserves a 4star! sooo i had to compromise the two and give it a  3!!  The hotel is beautiful inside.  I truly like the decorations etcetc.  The rooms though are disgusting.  It has the remains of the old aladdin and it isnt pretty or nice at all.  Plus the bathrooms were horrible...so many of us girls were trying to brush our teeth at once so some of us used the bathtub!! too bad the drain didnt go down..sooo ew.  The sink spurted out in diff directions and pressure was so low it was crappy.  HOWEVER i LOVE the casino!! I thought it was soo pretty and okay i may b bias but they have the wheel of fortune!!!!!!!!!!!!! the round one not the regular looking slots. MY FAVORITE!! sooo  I was there for the remainder of our non clubbing nite =).  Prettty hotel...nasty rooms...booo!!
