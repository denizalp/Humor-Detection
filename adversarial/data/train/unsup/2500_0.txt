First time there and after reading so many reviews, both good & bad. I went to see for myself. I guess everyone has their opinion of every restaurant in town.\nWell it was not so busy and we got seated right away. Our server was an Caucasian guy which is not a problem, the problem was that he never smiled once. Yes he did his job but a smiling face goes a long way towards customer service in making you feel good dining at the establishment. \nThe asian waitstaff was much better in the fact that she smiled and actually help a conversation with me, wow can you believe that!!!!! \n\nNow for the food, it was good and for sushi per say how can you really screw up on certain items like Ikura (salmon eggs), massago (fish eggs), pretty standard items that you buy from the wholesalers and you don't do anything but serve it.\n\nFor the Fresh fish, well it's another story, had the poke hahahaha it was good tasting but really, 4 pieces of fish at this size 1\/4\" x 1\/4\". Now I know it's all you can eat and trying to control waste but I think it's a little too skimpy on the fish for the poke.\n\nOver all it was good, love the fact that they do the sushi correct with the correct amount of rice and not try to fill you up with oversize rice portion.\n\nThe only issue was the seating, which is always a challenge at a small restaurant. The tables are very close and the one next to us had a family with a whiny young child who would screech loudly for no obvious reason. \nI would definitely return - hopefully there will be no screeching children on my next visit.
