Great atmosphere with a friendly and knowledgeable wait staff. Started off with happy hour drinks and appetizers which were all great. Then we got the entrees which looked amazing but unfortunately the strip steak  fell flat. I ordered it medium rare but when it came out it was over cooked, tough and dry. The  chimichurri sauce that was drizzled on the plate was super tasty but there wasn't enough of it to drown the steak in. If you go in be sure to get the mac and cheese side. One of the best macs I've had.
