Canyon Ranch = Heaven in my book.. if you enjoy a healthy lifestyle, you'll like the food at Canyon Ranch Cafe.  It seems a bit out of place in Vegas, but at least if you're in Vegas partying it up, you have a place for breakfast or lunch to balance out the unhealthy drinking and eating with some natural, organic, healthy options.  It's not for everyone, but I was able to enjoy a couple of meals at this cafe during my weekend stay at the Venetian.  \n\nPortions may be on the smaller side, but the food is filling and it will fuel you for whatever is on the agenda for the rest of the day\/night... I had granola and yogurt and a poached egg one morning, and I had vegetarian lettuce wraps for a late lunch on another day.  (I took it to go and ate poolside).  I also had a smoothie as a snack one day... \n\nPrices are moderate (for Vegas) - everything else is so damn expensive that it almost seems cheap to eat at Canyon Ranch.  I didn't make it to their newer location at the Palazzo; hopefully next time!\n\nAnd attention to those in charge: I'd welcome a Canyon Ranch Cafe closer to home in the Phoenix area!
