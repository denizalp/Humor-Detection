Love this nail salon. The new dipped nails are so awesome! Super thin but durable! Fun process to get them done.  I highly recommend Leo for nails.  The pedicures are relaxing and enjoyable. They take their time and do it right. I highly recommend Laura for pedicures. I live some distance away but I wouldn't go anywhere else.
