I was very much looking forward to eating here, but it didn't live up to my expectations (even remotely).\n\nWe arrived a little early for our reservation and so decided to sit at the bar, order some drinks and an appetizer while we waited.\n\nThe appetizer was the chili mozzarella balls which were decent, the bread seems to made in house and has good flavor, but is a little oily.\n\nThe maitre d arrived and said that the table was ready, we got up and asked to transfer the charges to the bar to our table and that's when the server at the bar got all awkward and made out like it would be a problem to do that (no doubt so that she could get her tip on the bar charges) - I don't really appreciate being made to feel awkward about things like that.\n\nWe ordered two more appetizers - the wild mushrooms and the eggplant fries.  The mushrooms were very flavorful, but they were expensive for the size of the portion.\n\nThe eggplant fries were terrible - they just tasted like oil, we sent them back and were talked into trying the goat cheese stuffed peppers.  They were also not good, the peppers had no flavor and the goat cheese just leaked out of them (the cheese also had no flavor).\n\nWe ordered the parpadelle and bucatini for our pasta course.  These were the highlights of the meal - past was cooked very well and my bucatini had a great sauce.\n\nFrom there you are encouraged to order an entree, but we were full (and slightly underwhelmed by the appetizers and so decided to move straight to dessert).\n\nMy favorite dessert ever is tiramisu and given this was an Italian restaurant - and I had seen tiramisu on the menu online, I was ready to order that.\n\nSadly tiramisu was not on the dessert menu and so rather than try something else we got our check and left.\n\nI really think that anyone could make food that tasted as good as the dishes we had & when I go to a \"celebrity\" restaurant and pay that kind of money I want something that in no way could I attempt to create at home.\n\nFor the prices charged I was very disappointed; the \"debate\" about transferring charges from the bar to our table also left a bad taste.\n\nIf I could I would give this place 2.5 stars, as you can't & 2 stars would be very harsh I am stuck with giving it a 3 star review.  There are better (and much cheaper) places to eat on the Strip.
