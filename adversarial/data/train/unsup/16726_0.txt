Who else tried to make Mother's Day reservations 5 days in advance and had to call about 15 place before finding a spot that would take you? ARGH. I've now learned to never procrastinate this task again! BUT The Canal Club, being the awesome place that they are, saved the day! \n\nWe came here with a party of 6 for Mother's Day brunch and had a delightful time! The ambiance is SO fab, with tropical decor and hip touches. We had a great table in the corner next to windows with natural light. Our server was very friendly and compared to other resort brunches in the Valley, the prices are very right here! (No $75 per head like most resorts!). You just pay for what you eat\/drink.\n\nI ordered their avocado toast to start (with no eggs) and it was so so tasty! The bread was pretty dreamy. It would be fantastic with eggs, I just wasn't feeling them that day. I loved the pickled onions on top. For my entree, I ordered their Cobb Salad and it was so filling. The dressing was amazing and definitely homemade - a ranch with some added zest. I love a good hearty salad and The Canal Club cured that craving! I also sampled their purple potato hash and oh my goodness, so yummy!\n\nI will definitely come back for brunch or dinner another time soon. :) I would also love to try some of their fresh cocktails, they look amazing!
