I have been a customer of this salon since they first opened back in Novemer 2015. I cannot say enough great things about this nail salon. Everyone is so polite and curteous. I always get a gel change\/manicure and have never left unsatisfied with my nails...always great and lasts what seems like forever or as long as a gel manicure can! Haha. I typically request Van or Tammy as my tech. You cannot go wrong getting your nails done here...period!
