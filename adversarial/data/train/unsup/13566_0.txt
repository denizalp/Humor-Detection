Talk about leaving a place hot and bothered ladies! *fans self\n\n\n\nCame here for a bachlorette party and not really knowing what to expect but as we were escorted to our front row seats (mm hmm) and watched the clips of the sexy sexy men playing, the anticipation and butterflies in my tummy grew. Also gives you a little bit of time to figure out which guy you like and want to look out for during the show ;]\n\n\n\nThe show itself actually consists of many skits, fantasy role plays and uniform changes, audience interaction and games and the guys coming down to dance around with the audience members (best believe I got me a little lap dance action)\n\n\nAll the Chippendales are attractive so don't worry, I'm sure there's going to be one to you and all your girlfriends liking. You can take a picture with all them in their Chippendale uniform for $20 after the show.  Since ours was a bachlorette party we had a bag of goodies that came with a free picture with the guys. \n\n\nDid so much screaming and \"woo-ing\", I lost my voice, which I didn't realize till the day after because we went to XS after the show, and com'on, there's no whispering going on in there either.  Sexy men + Losing your voice = ALWAYS a good time!   Def. will be back to see them again.
