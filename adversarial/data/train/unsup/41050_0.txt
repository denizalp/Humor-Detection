I usually go to a nail salon in Sagamore Hills and I probably should've just went there. The girl that did my nails was super nice so no complaint with her but her skills with doing gel nails is absolutely terrible. This was my first time here and will be my last. I should have called to understand how much gel nails cost. I usually pay around $25 at my other salon. Lush Express charged $41 and I thought it was a total rip off. My nails look so splotchy and uneven. There are tiny bubbles on my nails and I hate it. As soon as she was done I was ready to take them off. I'm not writing this review to be hateful but to be honest. Please don't be fooled by their 4 star rating. As far as getting your nails done here, stay away.
