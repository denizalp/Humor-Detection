I have to start by saying this is a review of the marketplace, not of the individual businesses. Firstly, I hate this kind of place...the overly corporate nature of Phoenix is perhaps shown in its true colors better here than anywhere else. Masses of people all in search of the latest crap that some multi-millionaire wants you to think is fashionable or this week's \"need-to-buy\" item. Not a single thing about it is attractive to me.\n\nBut perhaps more than even the masses of mindless drones who frequent this locale, what annoys me most is the layout of this place. This is the modern-day labyrinth. Oh, you can get in fairly easily. But finding where you're trying to go, EVEN when you can plainly see it in front of you, is remarkably difficult. And just try to get out of this shopping mall and get back onto the 101 freeway...I dare you. Good luck! There's literally 2 ways to do it...get in line behind the other 100 cars trying to do the same thing out the ONE exit that lets you make a left (which is OH-so-conveniently located on the complete opposite side of the plaza), or make a right and then cross 3 lanes of traffic and flip a bitch somewhere down the road. I mean, seriously...either a complete moron or a sociopath designed this parking lot.\n\nAnyway, all of the things I could possibly need to buy here can be found much more conveniently elsewhere. So that's where Ill be...elsewhere.
