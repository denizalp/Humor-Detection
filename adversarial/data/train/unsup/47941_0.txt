Had the oysters served on an impressive blue ice lit water bowl. Savoured a chateaubriand for 2 with a variety of veggies. Its probably enough for 4 persons if an appetizer is ordered. Enjoyed it with peppercorn, a cilantro and a horseradish gravy, but the meat did not need it. Liked the bread selection, seeded bread was my fave. We had 3 men serving our wishes. Beautiful chandeliers and gas flame features decorate the sleek decor. Busy and beautiful steak restaurant.
