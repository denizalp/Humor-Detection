115 degrees outside and a little face braced idiot with attitude tells us to wait outside. Inside looked like crap. Cheap tables all crowded together with LV worldwide destination sheep scarfing up lackluster food at ridiculous prices. The food was CRAP and overpriced beyond anything that Vegas has to offer. It's typical of Strip prices - these are all sheep and you must fleece them! They don't know that they can rent a car and eat good food in a one mile radius for 1\/10 the price. I knew better but was walking in 115 degree heat and the kids needed to eat, so I drank the Kool-Aid.  $8.00 BudLight? $16.00 Chili Dog with canned Chili on top? YUP. SHEEP. Feed the sheep and steal their money. You think these morons from All Ports know what a a $1.00 Chili-Dog and an awesome American (ButtWeiser) costs? Nope. That's Vegas. The Strip lives on stupid sheep from everywhere. Sorry they stole from me in a bad situation but never again. We gave one of our chili-dogs to a homeless person eating out of the trash can...best part of my day.
