Just terrible. I went in and had a new barber give me a cut - my mistake all the way and I'll take that. It was my first time getting a haircut by a chick. She was talking during the cut and I learned that she was a rookie and didn't have a passion for cutting and was just trying to get her hustle game on. Half way through the cut I noticed several patches on my head and I had to practically hold her hand to get the rest of the cut done properly. Apparently no one else works there. I got in there primetime, between 5 and 8 on a Wednesday. The place was empty. The owner of the place only takes clients by appointment and the rest of the staff are hacks who don't show up to work, leaving the rookie to bottom feed. Never again. Pittsburgh is in short supply of decent urban barbershops that cater to an upscale clientele. If you think this place is it dont waste your time or $23 bucks like I did. It was an expensive lesson that no one else should have to learn.
