I wish I could give this place 0 stars. My father and I had Dustin and Irving as our servers and I couldn't tell which one was in training! The breakfast experience started with two coffees and two waters. I requested \"Coffee with creamers please\" I received a coffee with a bowl of whipped  cream. Like that makes sense. After about 6-7 minutes of looking over the menu, we ordered Swedish Crepes, and a HAM and cheese omelete. I received my Crepes without incident. However our servers, yet again, apparently \"misheard\" my father in saying a HAM and cheese omelete. And Instead just brought a plain ole' omelete without ham or cheese. After waiting another 10 minutes to get their attention, we told them of the mistake and proceeded to act in denial as if they didn't make the mistake. Now this isn't my first day speaking but apparently it must be their first day listening. I will not be back. Don't spend your tip all in one place!
