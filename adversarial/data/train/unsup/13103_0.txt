This Place stole my Money! I paid my rent on the 3rd they sent me a 5 day notice saying i didn't pay and that I had to pay with a money order, so i did  couple days later i saw that have deposited my rent check from the 3rd and the money order, so they got both of them, now trying to get them to pay me back and they giving me the run around, this place is bad i mean people being killed there, roaches, bugs, people getting heir place broken into. and they wanna charge u 600 - 800 to live there... WOW, looking for a place to move into this is not the place trust me, Management sucks big time...
