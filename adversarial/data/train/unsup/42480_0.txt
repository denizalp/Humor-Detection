We arrived about 7:35 with the family.  We did not get served until 8:30 and it was awful!  I mean terrible.  I do not know how they stay in business...It was not very crowded and they just kept bringing chips.  It sure isnt the same place as when Ben owned it for sure!  We told them we would pay 1\/2 and never, never return...worse Mexican food in Charlotte....and we know food!  We did tip the waiter very well!
