This place is pretty much empty most of the time.. so if you do not want to see anyone you know this is probably a good place to go lol... the good thing is that they have 18 rooms, and they always have the latest movies. also the food court is just outside the movies and if you feel like doing something else after, you can always gamble or go bowling!!
