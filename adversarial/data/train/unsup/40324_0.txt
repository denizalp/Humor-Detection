I recently ordered two vegetarian dishes from Basil Thai, and they were wonderful. The vegetable fried rice was nicely flavoured, and had a generous portion of mixed vegetables. I ordered a flat noodle dish with vegetables and requested it spicey. Not only was there a perfect amount of heat in the noodles, but this dish was light and flavourful. Unlike other area restaurants, this dish wasn't swimming in oil, which made it truly enjoyable. I won't hesitate to order from Basil Thai in the future.
