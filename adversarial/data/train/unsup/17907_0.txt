I went to Burgatory and didn't eat a burger. What kind of American am I? Everything on the menu sounded so heavy so I settled with a chicken salad. The salad serving was huge and the waitress kept the water refills rollin'. \n\nIf you live by the saying, \"A moment on the lips is forever on the hips\" I don't think Burgatory is your go to. All self proclaimed meat eating, deep fried, food bloggers step on up! \n\nThere was an issue with my salad (the gross kind no one wants to discover when chompin' down on some greens) and my waitress quickly brought me out a new salad. The service is quick, the ordering process is different and fun. \n\nGood place to try out. The other bonus is the bathroom is dark and play loud music. No need to worry if your intestines start to blow smokes like a diesel truck. Cheers!
