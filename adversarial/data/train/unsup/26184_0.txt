Matt and I stopped here on our first day in AZ. October was Customer appreciation month with drink and lunch\/dinner specials every day. We sat on the patio. I had a margarita which was delicious and Matt took advantage of the Dos Equis special. We shared the grilled fish taco's which were huge and over flowing. We also had the cheese enchiladas to share. It was way to much food even for the 2 of us. Of course we did fill up on 2 bowls of home made chips and salsa before the food arrived! Service was very good as we were only 1 of 3 tables in the whole place.  I would most certainly go back.
