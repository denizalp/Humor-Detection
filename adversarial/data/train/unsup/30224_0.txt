Warning: I'm going to whine about my first world problems with this one.\n\nFirst of all, the good.  It is a smallish LCBO that has the essentials.  It is similar to the one at Ossington and Bloor--totally adequate for picking up a bottle of whatever or some beers.\n\nThe bad: the location.  It is in a horrible location, right in between Donlands and Greenwood.  You have to get off the subway and walk out of your way to make your purchase and then walk again to get back on.  \n\nWhat is worse is that there is no grocery store around.  So if you were looking to pick up a steak for the grill AND a beer\/wine, you are looking at multiple stops if you are using the TTC.  It is ridiculous and evidence that we need to loosen up the liquor laws here in Ontario.  I just want to buy a measly tin of beer or single serving of wine to go with the night's dinner WITHOUT having to make multiple stops on the way home.  Why can't we have this? \n\n(And don't talk about timed transfers.  This isn't about saving $3 and is about saving time.)\n\nIt should be noted that if you have a car, this location is very accessible.  In fact, there is a zipcar lot right next door which is quite handy.  And if you need something more specific beer, wise, the Beer Store is right next door.
