We were here during Pride so, in fairness, I'm not going to comment on the uber slow service or the fact that it was two hours from the time the server told us they were \"switching over\" to the lunch menu until we were finally allowed to order from it. Wait. I just did. Ok. I'm going to comment on it, but I'm not factoring that into my rating. \n\nFactored into my two stars: draft selection is bo-ring. Only major label stuff, when I was here. Sure, they have Guinness. Who cares? Everyone has Guinness. And local breweries do better stouts. \n\nOther considerations: the food was terribly, terribly overpriced. Two of us shared nachos with chicken ($20). Now, I know that I should know better than to order $20 nachos, but I had just run a race and my body demanded nachos. No arguing with it. The serving size was paltry (they're nachos, for goodness sake, not oysters - pile them on!) for the price, and the toppings, salsas, etc were mediocre - I'll spare you the details, but we felt foolish for paying so much for what we received. That's never a good feeling. \n\nPositives: big patio, lots of sun. Server wasn't outright surly with us and did try to keep the water coming. Great location. None of those are strong enough draws to convince me to return anytime soon, though.
