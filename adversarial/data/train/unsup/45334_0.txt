I would give them negative five stars if I could.  These are a bunch of con artists.  $500 for the WORST grout cleaning we've ever had.  The floor was SOAKED!  As in standing water.  The technician showed up and the price magically tripled.  We negotiated several times and settled on $500 for the 'extra steam services' to clean our grout.  Square footage was about 600 sq. ft.  The floor looks no better than before, the 'supervisors' in the office just stop replying to your messages, they were supposed to be there for 4 hours and were gone after an hour and a half.  Learn from my mistake-DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!
