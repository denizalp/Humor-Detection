Worst Car Dealership Ever!!!  Be careful, they do not make deals with integrity.  They sold us a car, but we we were not happy with it.  At first they told us the car had 70,000 miles and in great shape.  We made a mistake of signing papers before seeing the car.  Well, when they delivered the car, We were shocked.  They gave us a dirty car with a hole in the trunk, broken windshield, worn tires, smelled like a wet dog and cigarettes on the interior, and on top of that the mileage was over 110,000 miles.  After we drove home, we called back and asked for a different car.  They replied that they would look into changing cars.  To make a long story short.  They did not change cars, got us locked into a deal we could not get out of, a premium on top of the car that made us pay over list, interest rate that would make a loan shark envious, and did nothing to change cars.  \n\nNightmare of an experience for us.
