This place is whack. Took an hour+ to receive a burnt waffle, the entire thing was black and the chef tried to hide it by putting both burnt\/charred sides on the inside of the chicken waffle sandwich. There was no ketchup either in the whole place, limiting my friends fry experience. There was also no syrup and they refused to tell us that until after we waited over an hour for the chicken and waffles.
