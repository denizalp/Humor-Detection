I was not pleased with this company.  They came highly recommended, so I went there, but I was sorry I did so.  They had a half price sale on trees, but I learned later they jacked up the prices for the sale.  Also, they said they would plant for free, then they told me it would cost me an extra $100 for a one year warranty and to stake the tree. Once the clerk had put the sale in his computer, he swung the screen around and I saw that an additional $69 figure had been added for a \"trip charge\"!  My now $299 tree was at nearly $500 with the tax.  I really should have walked away.  My bad.  I also had to sign a document saying that if the installers damaged anything on my property, they were not responsible.  Well, they broke the hose reel off the side of my house (brand new) and then told me it was on the ground when they got here!  Finally, the installer told me the tree would shed.  The man who sold me the tree assured me this tree never sheds!
