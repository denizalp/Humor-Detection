We have gone for many trail rides across America and Canada.  Koli provides an entirely different experience, and is the best place to ride we've found anywhere.  Their rides are more open.  Rather than having the horses in a tight line where all you stare at is the horse in front of you's butt, the ride is more open where you truly experience the Arizona Desert in all of it's beauty.  The guides were very attentive and kept us all safe and happy during our ride.  This place is AWESOME!
