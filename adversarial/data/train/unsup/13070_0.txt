Time for some real talk: this place is overhyped. I've eaten a LOT of steak in my lifetime. In fact, I was in Wyoming in February and that was an eye-opening steak experience. I have been waiting to try Jacobs for years and just never got around to it. Tonight was the night! I went with my parents for my mom's birthday. \n\nFirst off, I ordered my Snake River tenderloin sliced because that's an option. And it never arrived sliced. I was surprised to look down and see something that resembled charred when I ordered it medium. Cutting into it, it was done properly within but the exterior of the steak was too charred. It was unenjoyable. \n\nMy dad is ridiculous and only eats his steak well-done, which is steak blasphemy, I am well aware. The waiter said he should order it medium-well and that it wouldn't bleed, as none of their steaks \"bleed\" and if it wasn't to his liking he could take it back and cook it more. Steak comes, it bleeds. In fact, I think his steak was more medium than mine was. He chose not to send it back.\n\nThen, they ask for our valet ticket to call down for the car, but when we get down over 15 minutes later the car is not ready. Additionally, this was the longest meal of my life. \n\nIn general, I found the experience underwhelming, especially for the price. Everyone was nice and polite but I would not return. I am really at a loss as to how many 5 stars this restaurant has received.
