The food at Green was impressively similar to the things they're fakes of. I'm surprised someone said portions were large, they were quite the opposite. I can't imagine eating here often, the food definitely isn't healthy, if you eat whole plant foods, you'll be reminded for a couple days :-\/. I was shocked when I asked if there were tree nuts (allergic-not deadly just painful) in anything I wanted to order, it took a while for them to find out & didn't sound sure or convincing (playing with fire). Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and it's nice for transitioning into veganism or satiating cravings if you need to.
