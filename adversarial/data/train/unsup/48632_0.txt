For dinner I tried the cornbread, brussel sprouts, chicken and waffle and watermelon, and the shrimp and grits.\n\nThe cornbread had a moist texture yet crumbled at the bite. It held its corn flavor well; the buttery flavor did not overwhelm.\n\nThe chicken seemed delectably tender and juicy; the skin had an immaculate crisp yet did seemed neither overly oily nor rich.\n\nThe grits seemed quite buttery, which paired well with the generously large shrimp.
