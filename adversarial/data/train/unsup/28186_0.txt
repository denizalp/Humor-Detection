Jazz bar in downtown! Live music from THU-SAT. They also show the lists of musicians online so please check it out if you are also into music. Two sections  -one is bar, one is for music. For music listeners, the seating may not be the most comfortable and the most visible. Sometimes people share seats too. But since it's hotel lobby, I guess it is the best they can do..? Drinks were good, but service needs improvement!
