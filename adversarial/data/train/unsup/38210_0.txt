The atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual and cozy. It is like your typical American restaurant when it comes to the food like Yard House or Claim Jumpers - but what is unique about Lazy Dog is that you can bring your dog with you!\n\nFirst time visiting was for a friend's birthday dinner. I got the pasta Carbonara. It was a pretty good portion, however, I thought that it was too salty. My friend, who had ordered the mushroom pizza thought hers was pretty salty, too.\n\nI did like the fact that if you checked in to the restaurant you get a free appetizer, so we got a basket of their really good basket of fries.\n\nThe place was packed, considering we did dine in on a Friday evening; however, the service took a very long time. The waitress did not check in on our table enough, and we were a pretty big group. Also, since we could not get a hold of our server, it took an even longer time to get our checks. Overall, we spent a little bit over 2 hours in the restaurant, so the efficiency on a busy evening is very poor.
