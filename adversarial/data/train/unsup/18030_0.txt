What's better than having an ice cold slushie in 110 degree weather? umm, an ice cold slushie with alcohol and a shot of Everclear!\n\nWe tried the 190 Octane (Orangey flavored\/Everclear), Cat 5 Hurricane (Fruit Punch\/151 shot), and Strawberry Daiquiri layered with Pina Colada (Mine! SO GOOD!)\n\nExtra shots are now $2 each and come in an inverted test tube. Don't let curious people around your drink -- they might pull out the test tube and dump the entire shot into your glass.. like I did. HAHA..\n\nOne half yard (32oz for $12) plus the extra shot will definitely, DEFINITELY get you nicely buzzed.. and have you wandering the streets of Vegas walking home from Caesar's Palace.. stopping by for some pizza at a random joint.. and so on and so forth. :P\n\nmake sure to bring back your souvenir glass for discounted refills! aka round 2 :)
