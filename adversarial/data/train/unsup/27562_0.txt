As a well groomed man, I look forward to my visits to the spa. So naturally when this well know Salon & Day Spa opened up in my neighborhood, I had to check it out! My wife had been getting her eyebrows waxed by Caroline, and she was extremely happy with her work so I decided to give her a try! It had been a while since my last wax so she had a pretty good canvas to work with. I explained to her exactly how i wanted them (clean yet manly), and she totally nailed it! \nOverall, the Par Exsalonce experience was very comfortable and pleasant, and I would HIGHLY recommend Caroline to anyone looking for a great esthetician!
