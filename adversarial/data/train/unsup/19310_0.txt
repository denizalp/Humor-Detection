USE TO BE A FAVORITE OF OUR BUT NO MORE !\n\nWe are yr rounders and like supporting local places.  Especially when the snowbirds leave but I guess it doesn't matter to some restaurants.  We have left messages with concerns about their declining or unprofessional service but no response.  I guess Pinnacle Grill thinks all is good - at least while the Snowbirds are here !\n\nNow we eat later in the evening so maybe this is after the main management leaves but my wife put it best a couple weeks ago when she said the restaurant:  THE RESTAURANT APPEARS TO BE MANAGED BY A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS !\n\nWait staff (not even our own) hovering over our table to pick up the paid check, no water service after the bill was paid, and one of the waiters bringing out the noisy vacuum right behind our booth as we were \"Trying\" to talk.  When I mentioned something to him about how noisy he was, he looked at me like he had no clue what I was talking about.\n\nSo I HOPE the management had left and this is not how the restaurant operated when the seasoned management is in the house.\n\nBut then again, I won't know because they haven't responded to any of our other comments.
