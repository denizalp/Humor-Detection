We were seated immediately upon entering things, Megan our waitress took our drink orders immediately. When she came back with our drinks she took her food orders, and our food was out within 5 to 10 minutes. It was all hot and delicious, my kids milkshake was also delicious.\n\nSecond visit, seated immediately drink orders taken. Blah.... I was charged for guacamole side that had no flavor. Burgers were good, nothing to brag about. \nWent to Arby's after so we wouldn't starve later.  \n\n\nLAST review. Seated at once, waitress was training a new employee. Got drinks quickly. Then the food. \"New\" cheddar double burger had more mustard than cheese. I'm just glad I got a side of cheese to make the fries edible.
