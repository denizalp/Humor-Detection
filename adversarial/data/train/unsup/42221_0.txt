Place is super old skool with lots of funky decor.  Had mlusical entertainment throughout the night - pianist and a violin.  The schnitzel is to die for. The size was very big, I say almost enough for 2 people.  Staff was friendly and attentive asking if you need anything else a few times and refilled our water.  Nice place will be back for sure
