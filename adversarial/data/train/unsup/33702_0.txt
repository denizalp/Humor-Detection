Came here earlier today for lunch. Very similar concept to Chipotle as what other reviewers have said. Ordered chilled rice noodles, grilled green and red peppers, roasted diced green beans, lemongrass chicken with peanut sauce on the side. All for $10. The chicken was flavourful and wished I got more of it. Had I known about splitting the protein, I would have liked to try the tofu as well.\n\nWasn't quite fan of the diced veggies. It was pretty difficult to eat the noodles and veggies together because the veggies were so small! I think if the peppers were sliced and the green beans were left as is for the noodles, it would be much easier to eat. I pretty much ate the noodles first then the veggies after with a spoon. Not impressed. Also wasn't such a great idea requesting the sauce on the side. I didn't get enough sauce in the cup and it didn't coat much of my meal. It was pretty plain. \n\nStaff are friendly and the atmosphere is chill. It's a good hangout spot for students. Maybe I'll pop by if I am in the area again.
