Have seen numerous shows, including a half dozen different Cirque du Soleil shows, and this was by far the best show I have EVER seen.  Sang, clapped, danced, and almost cried during entire show.  \n\nGot seats about half way up so we could see everything and was blown away by show, but there was so much to see that I bought tickets for the next night in second row.  Could literally touch actors and that was AMAZING...they actually interacted with us.  Highly recommend getting up close tickets.\n\nTHIS IS A \"MUST SEE\" SHOW!
