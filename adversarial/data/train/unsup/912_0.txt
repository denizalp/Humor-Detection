2.5 STARS\n\nI totally dig the ambiance... It's a cross between modern and minimalist with a hint of Asian vibe.\nI could imagine closing the place up and throwing a dinner party here with an open sake bar.\n\nWe came here and the place was dead. \n\nWe were greeted by the hostess and got seated right away. Glasses of water were delivered right away as well..which is good.\n\nLooking at the sushi list. It wasn't at all impressive. There were a lot of rolls that contained cooked seafood. \n\nIn my book. You are not a legit Japanese 'SUSHI\" restaurant without all the yummy RAW FISH. \n\nMy excitement died...so we just ordered something minimal... (Trust me, i go all out at a japanese restaurant..first time in my life my table only consisted of one makimono roll)\n\n*Beef Tataki: thinly sliced seared beef tenderloin topped with garlic chips and a citrus soy vinaigrette. I totally loved how the meat was perfectly seared. It was red and thinly sliced, and easy to eat. It was so addicting, I wanted to order a second plate. The only thing is... the vinaigrette sauce isn't that balanced. It was too much on the acidic side. a dash of sugar in the sauce would have done the trick. or some Sherry wine.\n\n*Organic Miso Soup: A bit bland. The addition of mushrooms was an excellent choice. Didn't get much tofu and seaweed on my bowl though..which I usually expect in my miso.\n\n*Toro Sashimi: ooooh. we got lucky as we got the last 2 slices. They were TOO THIN. I know Toro is the most expensive fish out there... but don't be all cheap with it. People who will order Toro will know they would have to pay at least $12 for 2 slices. So oomph it up a little bit.\n\n*Prawn Tempura Dynamite: Eh. didn't do much for me. It's such a kindergarten roll. Nothing fancy. \n\nIf you're a sushi newbie, or a sushi scaredy cat... come here and practice on their \"cooked\" rolls... however..if you're a sushi monster like myself... don't even try.
