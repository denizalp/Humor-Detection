If you've read my Wonder Bar review, you'll know that it's extremely rare for Kaitlin D. or me to not finish our drinks completely. Well, at Myxx, we couldn't stomach more than a sip or two of our drinks.\n\nAlso, their food is like the convenience store version of food from nice restaurants, and the space made me feel like I was in my elementary school cafeteria.\n\nThe End.
