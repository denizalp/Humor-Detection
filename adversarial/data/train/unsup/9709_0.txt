Our whole family loves Courier Cafe. We've been coming here for 14 years and have never had a bad meal.\n\nBreakfast? Outstanding. Great eggs, pancakes and out of this world jam.\nLunch? Burgers that fill you up, soup that makes me want to come back.\nDinner? Great specials, comfort meals that say relax, you're at home.\nLate night snacks? You bet. Ice cream and pie that satisfy whether the Illini have won or not.\n\nFriendly service, honest ingredients all add up to a fabulous restaurant. \n\nBut don't come here, it's hard enough to get a table now.
