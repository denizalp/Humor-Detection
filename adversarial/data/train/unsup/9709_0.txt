Recently went to Chop for a birthday dinner, group of four only. Very busy, service reasonable. Two in our group ordered steak well done, both came very pink  and cold! Returned to sender, came back overdone on the outside, still pink inside! Expect far better for their prices. No adjustment made on the bill either for kitchen error, which made half our group eat later than the other two. Wouldn't return in a hurry, better dining experiences in Calgary. A place like this needs to stand out, and unfortunately, they just don't.
