I'm going to give this hotel 5 stars primarily because of the staff. \n\nWe stayed in January, while driving through to California, in a room with a king sized bed, pull out sofa and kitchenette.\n\nOur girls liked the extra room, the shower was nice, the mirror in the bathroom was amazing (it's the little things.)\n\nThe CONS: Coming in from southbound I-15 was a nightmare, the hotel is just south of the airport and getting to the actual hotel seemed like a herculean effort by the GPS.\n\nThe PROS: Nice bedding, included breakfast, amazing staff.\n\nAt each interaction with staff they went above and beyond to make us feel like we were welcomed. It wasn't that they gave us free stuff, it was there genuine demeanor towards us. The breakfast crew was helpful\/funny and approachable and the housekeeping staff was super warm and friendly. \n\nIt goes along way when we're trying to teach our kids how to treat other people to have adults set such a good example.
