let me preface my star rating by saying i did not eat here - only a mid workday early hh break.\napparently it's the bee's knees for italian food. and it also happens to have quite a reputation for being a bit of cougar bar and the place for the 40+ single set to be seen and take home that recent divorcee and test drive his new maserati\/her new boob job.\n\nthat being said, i had no desire to try this spot out. however, i was invited here for a HH drink.\n\nwhen we first showed up, it was about 330, and they didn't technically open til 4, but the bartendar said it was no prob and his smile told me that was sincere. the bar takes up an entire room, a four-sided job and extra tables for more seating. an hour and a half later and this place was buzzing with the right-at-5 HH crowd and cougars were on the prowl indeed - along with business professionals you would expect in TukeTown. \n\nNot sure on the prices of the drinks because i was being treated, but i would imagine they were on the heftier side, given the ambiance and style of the joint. all in all it was a better experience than i was anticipating - the crowd was certainly not my style but i didn't really feel out of place. i'll have to go back for eats and see if it's as fabulous and everyone says!
