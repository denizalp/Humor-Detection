A bit pricey but worth it.  I can't say anything bad about the food here, everything I got from the lunch buffet line was good.  Service is excellent and we got seated pretty quickly.  Highlights:\n\nThe spicy tuna roll was actually pretty close to something you get from a sushi bar!  Smoked salmon had the right balance of not being being too salty and a hint of smoky flavor, shrimp cocktail was pretty big and cocktail sauce was not too sweet or sour.  Soft serve and other desserts were good too, not overly sweet.\n\nRecommended for sure!
