I had the misfortune of dining here recently. My companion and I were unamused.\n\nThis place sucks. I'm sorry, and I had high hopes, but Rock Lobster is overrated and completely disappointing in every way.\n\nTo begin, the staff is surly and overworked. That wouldn't be so bad, but the food is poor as well. \n\nWe ordered the lobster roll and it was the worst, smallest lobster roll I have ever had in any city or country. Do not order this. \n\nWe had the lobster boil; again, very mediocre. Advertised as a 1.2 L lobster, it was much smaller in person. Bait and switch much?\n\nSave yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else, Rock Lobster is an embarrassment to Toronto.
