You didn't think I was born perfect did you?\n\nWell without getting into gory details...the esthetician here did a fantastic job in keeping me clean. They use this strip-less wax, which hurts less than the traditional method of hot wax and cotton.\n\nBasically, they smooth on a layer of hot wax, it hardens rather quickly, and they pull it off. Easy-peezy.\n\nIt's affordable, and you are in and out of there quickly.\n\nVery guy friendly too. So...git r' done. It's summer.
