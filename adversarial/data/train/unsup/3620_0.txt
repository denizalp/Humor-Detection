I know everyone loves Pomo, but I have had mixed experiences. I've had pizzas that were delicious here (usually the more plain pizzas), but I've had a couple that were not so good. Additionally, their lasagna was not my fave (a bit on the greasy side). Their prices are a bit high, and I understand they have high quality imported ingredients, but there are other similar restaurants with better prices and better flavor.
