This is absolutely the worst doctors office staff EVER... I love the nurse practitioner but the staff here is the worst!! Be prepared to be talked about as soon as you hang up the phone or as soon as you leave... There is always at least a 1-2 hour wait and the waiting room is always messy... I understand this is a child's doctors office but they should be on top of things... You can hear them talking about people and there person information behind the glass when they hang up the phones and laughing about it that someone couldn't make a payment... The only reason I continue to go here is because of my sons fathers insurance company. It was hard to find a doctors office that will accept both mine and his insurance that isn't so far away... But please if you can help it stay away from this place and I mean FARRRR away unless you like rude staff... But I do love the nurse practitioner... Never met the actual doctor...
