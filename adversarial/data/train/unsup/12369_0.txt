Dishes came out one at a time, so we were forced to share otherwise 3 of us would have starved while the other ate. The carpaccio was too thickly cut, ruining the texture that should make a carpaccio. Uni Tomato cream pasta was beautiful and tasted great. However, after that dish, our Kurobuta pork took another 20 minutes. This dish needed some more seasoning. Our friend at the table, who is not at all a foodie or cook, said the tomato sauce seemed a bit watery. The server thought we were done and asked if we had room for dessert. ??? We told her we were still waiting for the parma prosciutto carbonara. That was another 25 minutes. We don't mind waiting for good food. But this pasta was so disappointing. The noodles were undercooked, the sauce was not flavorfully seasoned, and the prosciutto was barely dressing the pasta. Our non-foodie non-cook said he probably could have made something better than that pasta. We went in at 6:45 and didn't get out until 8:45, of which more than three-quarters of the time went to waiting. From the first dish (the carpaccio) to the last dish, there was a time difference of 75 minutes. \n\nTwo people in our party didn't catch their flight and had to take the bus back, so I might be a bit biased because of that. Either way, other than that, it would have only gone up to a three. Ugh... sigh... \n\nI see the high ratings and I'm very disappointed because I think that people really want to like this place because Italian-Japanese sounds like such a cool combination. I really want it to be, but the food has to taste better. If they're still around in six months, I will try them again. I hope they get more staff in the kitchen and that they coordinate their service better. Their servers are really nice, but it's funny that we got asked if we wanted dessert when we were still waiting for another entree. See, even to the server, it would have made sense that all the food came out together. Aiya...
