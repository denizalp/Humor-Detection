The perfect date spot.  \n\nProsperity is fun because it's always low key, comfortable and warm.  Their fire is stoked during the winter and in the summer they have a very cool patio that makes me want to water-ski in the 6o's.  \n\nI especially like it because of it's great mix of good food, retro fun and board games!  They have all sorts of old games like battleship, Clue and Cleveland monopoly.  I don't recommend Cleveland Monopoly because it takes forever and people get super greedy when it comes to their favorite parts of town.  That, and last time I played, I was out first.  Thus, I hate that game.  Hate!\n\nI've had plenty of their menu items.  I am always pleased!  Pleased as Sangria Punch!
