I have been coming here a lot but this last few times its been nothing but bad, the lady that did my nails was grumbling because she messed up a nail then she cut me while filing the acrylic and also left glue all on my fingers that I have to try and get off now. She then wasn't happy I didn't leave a tip? Well I'm not tipping someone that didn't seem like they wanted to do my nails to begin with. I'll be going somewhere else
