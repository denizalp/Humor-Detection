Just NOT my type of place. I went with a group of friends on a Saturday night around 8, and by 9 the place was packed.....With a very older crowd. At 38 I was probably in the bottom 10% of the age range, maybe 5%. Drinks were decent, but SUPER Expensive. Almost $15 for a martini. \nBy 10 the place was pounding pretty good, I have to say their sound\/lighting system was pretty awesome. I just don't want to see women old enough to be my mom shaking their asses on the stage. If you're in the 40-60 range and looking for a solid place to party, and relive your 20s, THIS is probably your spot..... \nNot trying to be rude to the older crowd, I think its damn cool that you still know how to party....I just don't want to be there while you are! And a friendly heads up to the 21-39 crowd to avoid this place, unless you're looking for love from an older guy\/girl.\nReally my 1st Club-Type(but not really a club) experience in Phoenix. It was a pleasant surprise that nobody was really being a drunken slob like so many club type environments in Chicagoland. I'm not sure if I can attribute that to the age group or Phoenix in general. \nEither way, not a place I'd go to again......\nTip to Management\/Owner.....Having grown up in the Chicagoland Club Scene in the 90s and 00s, if you're going to have a club environment, have room for people to dance. Ditch all the tables in the 1st room in lieu of a dance floor.
