Okay....since my last review, the prices did go up....about a dollar or so.  But still is worth every dime!  For the amount of food they gave me on my last visit, I still felt like a winner.....a full winner!  \nCompared to most Filipino restaurants, they still have the largest selection, and they are still generous in portions...enough to share.   \n\nI love visiting this restaurant.  It brings me back to the Philippines with their delicious authentic food and TFC on the tube!  Wowoweee!
