Went here before we hit the road back to L.A \n\n$25 a person during lunch hours. The food was..good. Not the best buffet in the world, but it was enjoyable! Their cheesy potatoes were my faaavorite. It had this certain flavor to it that was really good. \n\nHad different international foods..not such a big selection, but yknow, pretty good. \n\nWhat ruined my meal were these 3 Hispanic girls cackling non-stop behind me.
