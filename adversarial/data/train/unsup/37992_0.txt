Not sure if the lunch course was Greek food except the yogurt. The sesame bagel with smoked salmon was pretty good. Need better presentation for the white fish for their main entree. The shrimp dish was just bland. The cous cous tasted just like the ones you get from Delta first class food. Not saying that its bad but just that it could be better as they prepare to order unlike the airplane food. The servers were professional and friendly. Not a bad experience after all, but I'd love to see some improvements in the food.
