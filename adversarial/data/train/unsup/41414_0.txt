The food was great and I left feeling fulfilled, I do like that they have tortilla chips accompanying the burrito, not sure if they do that with all the food that they serve.\nI also like the face that they have napkin dispensers on the tables along with salt and pepper shakers. Yes some places call themselves a \"Taco Shop\" but it's still a full fledge restaurant....\nThey would have received 5 stars but the air conditioning was out and it was a little warm even though they had a evaporative cooler inside, maybe if it had water in it, would have been more bearable.\n\nIn my best terminator impression,\nI'll be back!
