It looks like a meth warehouse, the temperature is hot inside, there is a lone bathroom, and obviously a work of love.\n\nI finally had a chance to visit this space last night to see the comedy troupe \"Bully Mammoth\", we found parking fine (while seeing a lot of ladies with wigs walking around) and it was a pretty easy building to find since it is a big warehouse structure. I was surprised to find the inside was a little cramped(since the outside looked so spacious?). The hallway\/entrance where the ticket sales were located was cramped and cash only (understandably) led into a long and not very wide seating area. There were couches up against the walls, the seating was only about 6 seats wide and there was a raised area in back to see the show better. We luckily attained front row seats of the slightly raised smaller stage, which had an all curtained background.\n\nIt was a great show (even though I got deer hide fur in my eye just when a hilarious skit came on, trapped in between laughing too hard to take the offending hair out of my eye causing me to cry as well-one hazard of sitting up close!), but it got pretty hot in there and with the actors under the hot lights sweating with all the body heat. \n\nWhen the show was over, there was a mad rush to the bathroom (only one, I found more toilet paper but not more paper towels, but fairly clean) and it was located in a room that had assorted furniture, futuristic paintings and an organ. (?). \n\nI am on their email list for writing workshops, plays and look forward to coming here for other events they put on, and def. to see Bully Mammoth again!
