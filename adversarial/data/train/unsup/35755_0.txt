I've been going out to eat at SASA ever since I could drive in high school. I love sushi and Japanese cuisine and SASA is one of my favorites for a couple different reasons. It is not the most gourmet or high class but I love the atmosphere, the style in which they cook and serve their dishes, and food quality and creativity are of the highest caliber. \n\nSASA has a young slightly hipster vibe as the bar is clearly a centerpiece in the low light. The tables are simple and minimal and allow u to focus on your food and company. The sushi rolls alone are enough to make a trip to SASA, however I highly recommend starting off with some Nagiri or Sashimi to start. Everything is played beautifully and tastes DELICIOUS. There are so many different flavored and unique tastes to try. The only complaint I've ever really had is I wish more of their menu was spicy. \n\nAll said and done SASA is not fine dining but it is on the classier end of sushi. If your looking for a fun night out where you can enjoy a nice atmosphere without braking your wallet (or the $100 mark) then I highly recommend a night out at SASA.
