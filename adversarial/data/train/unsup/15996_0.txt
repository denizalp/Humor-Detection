This carwash is my favorite around and I'd say it's probably one of the best.  I always use the self wash bays and never use the drive thru wash.  No quarters or cash?  No problem.  Each self wash bay accepts debit or credit cards.  One swipe gets you 6min for $3 plenty of time to spray and wash your ride.  Something about the spray nozzle on the wands really rinses your car off well and saves time.  I've been a bit disappointed that the spray wax option hasn't worked right recently.  Hopefully it's fixed by the summer.  The grounds are always clean and vacuums work well.\nMy favorite part about checking in here are the sexual innuendos about BJs lol.  Call me immature if you like, but at least I keep my Subie clean ;)
