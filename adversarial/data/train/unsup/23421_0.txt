The service I received at Parkway Honda was excellent. We purchased a 2015 Honda Odyssey. Our sales rep, Todor, was easy to work with, and even took the time to drive out to my husband's office to finish some paperwork quickly so we could get our new car earlier than later.\nDavid, the manager, gave us a great deal on the car with no BS. We purchased the car within minutes. He didn't make us wait or dither around with \"offers\". They also bought us lunch while we waited for the paperwork to be filled out.\nBased on other reviews, I am looking forward to having my new car serviced here as well. Great job guys!
