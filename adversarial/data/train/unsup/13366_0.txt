Bland boring and dull. Just ordered pickup, ate a few bites, and then went to go make my own food. I ordered my entree with garlic sauce and specifically ordered the \"spicy\" option. Tasted like bland mixed vegetables with no spice or seasoning of any sort. The soup was equally bland. We typically order from another place down the road and will be doing so in the future as well.
