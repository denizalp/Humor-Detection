Here's my big issue with this place. We booked a jacuzzi room ahead of time and when we got there no one told us it was broken. It wasn't until we tried to use it that it wasn't working and I called down to see what's up. The lady at the front desk then told me, \"oh someone should have told you at check in that it's broken in that room.\" REALLY???? What the f*ck. Not apologetic at all. Pretty much made me felt like I was a dick for asking why it wasn't working. To make things worse, it was CHRISTMAS. 1. Trying to rip someone off on Christmas...seriously? 2. Being mean to someone on Christmas...wow\n\nI love La Quinta's because I can travel with my dogs easily and not have to worry. But it made me so upset because all I wanted to do was to relax after walking around. \n\nBut ruining someone's Christmas when they're already on the road away from home is not cool. It makes me not want to stay at another La Quinta again.
