Their key cutter is sharpened every day and my key copies work perfectly. Fast, efficient, friendly, knowledgable service. My only issue is that I wish I had asked about the cost of my car key copies. They are the old fashioned non-chip type that both open the door manually and start the ignition. These Copies cost $10 each  -- several dollars more than the house keys I was copying, which I didn't realize. This company Offers a 24\/7 emergency locksmith service if you lose your keys so their number is in my phone!
