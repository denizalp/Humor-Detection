Very very poor management. \n\nWe were there last year for the Suns playoff game and wait in line for a seat like the other 25 people. Some Yanni looking dousche and his fake as hell trailer trash barbie wanna be walked in asked for the manager, proceeded to yank his jock and get a table in less then 1 min. \n\nI walked right over to the same manager while he was schmoozing the Dousches and asked why they were so special. (nothing like bursting the ego of a semi-famous dousche) The manager was so embarrassed he escorted me off the floor and proceeded to tell me \"they spend so much money here every year that they deserve preferred treatment\" \n\nI walked out and told every other person who was waiting what had happened and out of 25 people at least 18 went somewhere else. \n\nI sure hope the VIP was worth the $500 they lost out on when we all walked. Not to mention the bad press and no repeat business.
