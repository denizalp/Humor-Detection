Mmmm pear bread. My friend said it was so good that \"I want to marry this bread. We need to make this happen.\" Pear bread, perfectly toasted, meshed with brie+ four-cheese blend, bacon, and arugula. One of the best sandwiches I've had in a while! There was a balanced compliment of textures, from the slight crunch of the toasted bread, creaminess of the cheese, and cool crispness of the arugula. Flavor wise, it was equally balanced. The light, spiced pear taste went well with the smoky bacon and mild cheese.\n\nThere was a small hiccup with receiving our drink orders, but other than that service was great.\n\nDefinitely a place to go to again to try more delicious sandwiches.
