This a review based on multiple visits - I am always served in a friendly and efficient manner. The ground floor has a nice open layout that lets you browse all the electronics with ease. The upstairs has the Genius Bar and all the various accessories. This section is always packed. It's important to book ahead if you can because otherwise your wait could be quite long.  I've had to have several repairs done on a variety of apple products.  Each time I've had great service and many times the products were replaced without charge.  It's a great store to visit and I recommend it highly if you like apple products.
