My group decided on Harrah's for its location and relatively low room rates. I went along because I'd never been in the area before and the positive reviews sounded reasonable.\n\nBut then as I roamed the Strip, wandering through other hotels nearby, I realized that Harrah's is almost as ghetto as Sahara and Circus Circus. The four and five (!?!) star reviews don't make sense to me. Harrah's was filthy, inefficient and sad. It took me an hour and a half to check in because representatives kept disappearing. Then my room wasn't ready for another two hours. A number of items, such as travel perfume and makeup, went missing from my bathroom counter. I don't want to think about what could have been stolen that I didn't notice was missing right away. Not many visitors will admit it, but Harrah's is the Wal-Mart of the Strip hotels.\n\nYes, the cheap options hold their appeal because Vegas is an expensive town for a vacation. It's easy to think that, hey, you won't be in your room much anyway and you'll be too drunk to notice minor things like dirty drinking glasses. If you absolutely think your standards can sink that low, congrats, but I felt I could have done better without spending much more money. Anything south of Circus Circus and north of Mandalay Bay, except Flamingo, seemed like better bets.
