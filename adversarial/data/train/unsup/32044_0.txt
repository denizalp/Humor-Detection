We were seated quickly and greeted by our server. An kitschy souvenir cup filled to the rim with beer and another with orange slushie. Yum! Food was out quick and our server was just a little too nice. I wanted the abuse I've heard so much about. I did get an awesome hat that read \"I go down faster than the stock market.\"  The food was delicious and even though it's supposed to be dickish, our server was quick and efficient. :D
