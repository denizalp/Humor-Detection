The only positive thing I can say is about this place it is open late.\n\nWe ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed.\nPancakes were burnt. Hash browns were burnt. A breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it. I was drunk I don't remember.\n\nBah. Cook\/waiter was funny, so points for that.\n\nAgain, the only good thing was that it was open when I wanted food.
