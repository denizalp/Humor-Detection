This is one of the coolest shows I've ever seen. It was my first cirque show and I really enjoyed it. The performers are amazing. There is so much going on at all times during the show, you always have something to watch. The seats have speakers in the so it sounds like surround sound. I would definitely recommend this show, especially if you like any Beatles songs.
