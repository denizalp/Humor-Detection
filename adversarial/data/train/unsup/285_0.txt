I felt like I was going to die after eating here.  Not good when it was my last meal before leaving to go back to san diego.  I usually have a stomach that can eat anything but that wasn't the case. My stomach made noises the entire time after I ate the meal here. Made noises for a full day! The next day wasn't pretty also. Sorry. TMI but it's the truth. Just stay away.\n\nI was just so hungry so I ordered a couple of items.  I ordered the crab roll and the lobster mac & cheese.  I was so hungry and I usually love anything lobster or crab.  I preferred the crab roll. It is chilled and the bread is toasted. I was just used to it being served that way. My friend ordered a shrimp roll and it was chilled as well but looked completely raw. She asked them to heat it up. They said that's the way they serve it. Should be mentioned in the menu. I should've asked them to heat up mine also but I was starving. The lobster Mac and cheese looked pathetic. Lots of Mac and cheese and a few pieces of lobster on top. I've had better crab rolls and lobster mac and cheese elsewhere that's way better than the food here. Nothing special.\n\nNot a fan and never going back again.
