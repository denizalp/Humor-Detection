There was really no part of this meal that was anything but spectacular.  I probably can't add anything new to this slate of almost 700 reviews on here, but if I came back again, I wouldn't do it any differently: start with a couple cocktails, oysters and steamed mussels, move on to french onion soup and a bottle of burgundy, and then finish with the poulet roti, perfectly roasted and juicy chicken served over some kind of potato and apple (?!) slaw sitting in jus.  It was all amazing.  Also, the spaghetti squash with honey glazed cranberries, while not exactly the highlight of the meal, tasted exactly like christmas.  You'll know what I mean, even if you're Jewish.\n\nWe got out of there for around $120 a person, and I have to say I feel like as far as fine dining goes in Vegas, we did alright.  If there was a Bouchon in Chicago, I'd be back in a heartbeat.
