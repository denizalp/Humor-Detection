I've passed this place a million times. It's in my bookmarks, yet it took me forever to finally get here. And it was worth the wait!\nSuperb dinner! I mean, it was so good.\nTo start, they give you some bread with this cool butter dish. It's a rectangle plate with butter that has 2 \"holes\" in it. One has parsely and garlic and the other...I'm not sure, but it was delicious. Fresh black pepper and course sea salt top the butter as well. It's a classy was of serving bread and butter.\nWe started with the cheese and meat charcutterie board. The humbolt fog goat cheese is outta this world (especially if you like goat). A provolone cheese and proscuitto. The board also comes with some fruit, fresh mustard and I think a honey. That was spectacular. We really enjoyed that.\nI got the rib eye steak and it was so good. I didn't love the potatoes that came with it, they were just ok. But they steak was cooked perfectly and paired so well with the bottle of wine we ordered.\nI will absolutely come back here. I will highly recommend.\nService was fantastic. Food was insanely good. I can't wait to eat outside, The patio looked beautiful, but it was still a bit too warm when we came. Next time!
