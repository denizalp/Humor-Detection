I have been here - numerous times. \n\nI don't like it. \n\nI have quite a few friends who dig this place and are always trying to get me to meet them there... fuck. I don't wanna... ever. \n\nIt's not that it's scary or anything - I feel pretty comfortable here usually. It's just that there's always something horribly stinky here - either inside or outside... It's either some person inside who hasn't washed - like ever, or it's like a broken sewage fermentation tank valve or something near the dirt lot you can sometimes park in. \n\nThat's another thing - I'm pretty paranoid and OCD anyway, so leaving my car behind to go inside here means I'll just be thinking about people smashing the windows and stealing the radio or something all night instead of enjoying myself. \n\nI kinda feel about this place like I feel about the Rogue, except I don't hate it quite as much. Unless you're a regular here, you'll probably feel like you don't belong. It's somewhat of an \"in-crowd\" kind of place where being \"out\" is \"in\"... I don't know. I guess it's easy for me not to go here since it's kinda far. I hope when I do go there sometimes, they don't read this and decide to spit in my drink or put it in a glass they used to trap roaches until they died.
