Back in the day when I was a Montreal Expos Fan, Le Grande Orange was the nickname for the red haired Rusty Staub. The Sky Harbor Airport version is more feminine (La instead of Le) and a pleasent surprise for captive eating between flights. I had the Breakfast Burrito which was really tasty and with a nice kick, despite its overall messiness. Best of all, it filled me up and lasted all the way to a late dinner tonight in Baton Rouge.
