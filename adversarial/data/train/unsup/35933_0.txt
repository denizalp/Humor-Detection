This place was a big disappointment. First of all, don't come here in the summer! They have no air conditioning, and there's only one meager fan that isn't even pointed toward the tables. Second of all, the beer wasn't even good. My friends and I tried the \"hopless,\" the session IPA, and the American amber ale, and all of them were very unremarkable. The food was mediocre.  When I first browsed through the menu, I was happy that they seemed to have a lot of vegetarian options, but I was disappointed that the black bean tacos were unavailable. I settled for the quinoa falafel wrap, which was decent aside from sitting on a bed of soggy, tasteless fries. Finally, the service was pretty slow. Do yourself a favor and grab a beer and a meal somewhere else (like Siboire).
