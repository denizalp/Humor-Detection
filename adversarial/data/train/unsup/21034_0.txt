I got married in Las Vegas last week and we were treated to a complimentary dinner here. My wife watches a lot of food network and apparently fell in love with Hubert Keller. Something about that gray ponytail really makes her happy. Even more amazing was he was there walking around the restaurant talking to people. She about lost her damn mind....well as much as someone can lose their mind in a very nice, upscale restaurant. \n\nAnyway...amazing meal. Food, service, patrons. Perfect. Even more perfect was getting a bill for $320 and it says \"complimentary\" on it. A super must go when your in Vegas.
