I probably should write a review, since apparently I'm the restaurant's profile picture right now (oh dear).\n\nThe prices for dinner items are a little more expensive than the hole-in-the-wall establishment that I expected when we pulled up to this Mexican joint.  That's probably because the vast majority of the dishes are seafood related.  There are non-seafood items, especially on the lunch menu, but seafood is definitely the special of the house (bahia means bay).\n\nSo, of course, I made the mistake of ordering a non-seafood dish.  Luckily it wasn't a horrible mistake - my cheese enchiladas were filling, had decent flavor, and were, best of all, cheap.  However, I'm sure the seafood here is spectacular, and I broke my own rule and didn't order the house specialty.  My horchata, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious.\n\nService was great as well.  When the chef sent out beef enchiladas (not an item on the $7 lunch menu) instead of my cheap version, the waitress apologized profusely and offered to let me have it if I'd like.  The bus-boy was a cute 10 year old wearing a walkman.  Obviously an authentic family-run establishment.\n\nStop by if you're in the area - it's better than those buffet places that the nearby DMV is advertising!
