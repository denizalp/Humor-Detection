Update: I FINALLY TRIED THEIR POTATO TACOS AND THEY ARE HEAVEN! \n\nWell what can I say? I fell in love with the famous Horchatte - mixture of horchata and espresso! So good, had it twice haha! I must say their Chili and Guacamole fries are to die for; I still have the taste at the tip of my tongue. I can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu! #JuliannaApproves
