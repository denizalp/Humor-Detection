I am excited!\n\nI love Izakaya Tsuki's North York location  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/izakaya-tsuki-toronto and I am glad that they decided to open up another location up in Richmond Hill!\n\nOpens till 2 am 7 days a week  as I always have midnight snack\/drinks attack and kind of bored going to my usual Cheap Chinese places or one of the franchise restaurants\/lounges.\n\nThe staff here are friendly, attentive and polite. I would leave that to my Yelp friend to comment on that as I was busy drinking my sake and trying to take some photos of my food.\n\nWe shared:\n\nAnkimo - Steamed Monk Fish Liver ($9)\n- Since I cannot eat foie gras all the time in Toronto, I would settle for monk fish liver\n-  Texture was smooth and just with a little fishiness\n\nMaguro Tataki ($14)\n- Not the best maguro but a dish with interesting texture and taste\n- Love the mixed greens on the side, I need my veggie sometimes!\n\nButa Negi Shio Yaki - Grilled Pork with Mustard Mayo ($10)\n\nOkunomatsu Kinmon ($22.99)\n- Not every sake is available on the menu and there are definitely a good choice of quite a few sakes\n\nI know I will be back to Izakaya Tsuki to have a draft beers or 2 when I am looking for a late night spot to chill out a little.
