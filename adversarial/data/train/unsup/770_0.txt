I'm a fan of these types of Mexican restaurants. It's the line up and order what you want and they scoop all your ingredients onto your burrito right in front of you steez.\n\nIt's the Chipotle\/Qdoba\/Kokopelli\/Cafe Rio style place.\n\nWhat sets Bajio apart from these other spots? I think their restaurant is a bit nicer & they have some additional options that you might not find at the other guys.\n\n3 types of beans: refried, black & spicy\n2 types of rice: Mexican style & sweet\nTONS of types of sauces\n\nIf you're a fan of this type of Mexican & you want lots of choices, give Bajio a try.
