I don't often write reviews and when I do I like to keep them positive, but after my recent experience with My Tight Face, I felt compelled to share the following information with the consumer. I left a message for them because I wanted to inquire about specific services. One day later a lady from the front desk called me. I was inquiring about a specific service, Endermologie. When I inquired about types of services they offered for facial tightening, the receptionist had no answers, became defensive and addressed me with combativeness. When I asked her why she was being so rude she put me on hold and another lady answered the phone. I proceeded to ask her questions about a specific machine for which I wanted to book a service, the new Endermologie machine from France.  She said that the information was confidential and she could not share it with me and less I went into their place of business for a consultation. I replied that if they had the machine I would book an appointment on the spot, but she too became very defensive and insisted that it was confidential. Really? I'm out! I told her with that type of an attitude I wouldn't take an appointment there for free!
