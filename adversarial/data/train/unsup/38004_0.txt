Waz is outstanding. He has the integrity, expertise, knowledge and composure of the \"ideal\" trade professional. He has been loyal to me for over 10 years, through thick and thin, and several homes, one a complete disaster. Waz has a hybrid engineer-designer brain and as a client expect only the most pertinent, helpful suggestions. You will receive optimum results. Respect the fact that Waz does not employ a body to make his appointments. Yes, in my experience...as good as it gets. Plus he's charming! And extraordinarily calm under duress . PUNCTUAL. TIDY. ATTENTIVE TO DETAIL.
