Yummy comfort food. Great spot even with 3 kids in tow! It's not a huge space and the exterior doesn't look completely inviting. I had been in favour of Korean for lunch but got outnumbered 4 to 1 when we parked and my husband spotted this joint. Well, I'm so glad we tried it. The pricing is reasonable, the space is clean, bright and inviting, and our server was sincerely patient and friendly with us. He was attentive, helpful with food suggestions and kept coming back to warm up our coffee. I'm sold.
