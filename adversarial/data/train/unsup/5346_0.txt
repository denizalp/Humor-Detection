Ordered: Steak & Eggs 12am-6am Special! (Graveyard Special)\n\nDrunk, tired, or just hungry for \"Steggs\" (Steak and Eggs) this place is a go to if you're on this side of town. $4.99 \n\n** MUST BE 21 or OLDER FOR THE SPECIAL**\n\nIt comes with hash browns and toast. The steak is 7 oz and its okay for the price you pay. When drunk it may be the perfect thing! \n\nThe wait is pretty long, so I suggest coming at 11:50pm to avoid the wait or coming at 2. Otherwise it will be a 15-30 min wait. We arrived at midnight and the wait was 15mins. \n\nThe server was patient with my party of 10 and I gave her a nice tip. Overall good place. \n\nI got their ham as well and it was good.
