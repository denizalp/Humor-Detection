I LOVE THIS PLACE! Everyone i see that works here is so friendly! Ive met the owner once and hes such a cool guy. My Favorite Flavors are FRUITY PEBBLES & TARO! So amazing! I hate seeing the reviews of people saying that they dont explain things but ITS ICE CREAM PEOPLE! They have the names on there for you to see and give you samples. The place is a bit quiet and i wish they had music playing but i heard someone complained about that which is dumb. Anyways LOVE THIS PLACE! Definitely recommend!
