It's true, this place is legit, it is the bomb, and is definitely as good as it gets!\n\nAfter the gym, I requested to visit this place, and Earl did not hesitate to take me.  When we arrived, we were the only ones.  While trying to look at Nelson Q's review for some suggestion, the man himself shows up!  How cool is that?\n\nNelson traveled far and wide (N Vegas) for some delicious treat at Frost Bites Shavery.  We then tried many different flavors and they were all so good.  Tough decision.  Earl and I somehow came to the same decision of black sesame snow creamery, topped with mocha bits and condensed milk.  So, Earl changed his order to coconut snow creamery, topped with pineapple and mocha bits, capped with condensed milk.  He finished his regular size cup  while I was half way through mine, so he start digging his spoon into mine.  Oh well, he paid for us both so I let it slide.\n\nAs we were waiting, Amanda shows up with her adorable baby girl Petra.  By the way Petra was eating spoonful of mango creamery fed by Amanda, I know that will be my next choice to get on my next visit.  Petra was demanding for more creamery because Amanda wasn't feeding her quick enough!  That is how delicious those snow creamery treats are!\n\nThank you Mike for being patient with Earl and I and letting us sample so many different delicious flavors.  \n\nThis is a non-guilty indulgence that Earl and I can add to our lives.  Delicioso...so ONO!
