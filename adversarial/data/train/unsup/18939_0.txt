I had a loyalty card that needed a few more punches prior to expiration for the freebie dinner so I ate here a couple times over the last month and can confidently say there are much better options in the carnival of AYCE Vegas sushi joints.\n\nFrom the quality of the fish to the inadequate wait service to the novice work behind the bar, this place has totally slipped for me. The red snapper tasted a bit dry and dense as though it had been left out and everything else was just so-so...I did get to top off my underwhelming experience with their melted then refrozen freezer burn mochi.\n\nSide note: In talking about this place with other sushi owners at places I frequent, it's widely known that their fish quality has taken a hit...they said there's a specific reason why but they declined to elaborate...sad as I've been here more than a dozen times.
