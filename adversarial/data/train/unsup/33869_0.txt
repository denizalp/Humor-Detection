It is February 6, 2014, I went to lunch here around 12:20 and every one seemed to be in a bad mood. Starting down the line, the black guy gave me a bad attitude when I ordered, the white guy was supper nice and awesome, and the big white girl wanted to charge me for a burrito for my quesadilla because I asked for pico De gallo and lettuce. Did not appreciate the bad experience :).
