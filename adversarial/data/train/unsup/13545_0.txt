2.5 Stars as it is a pretty terrible place however their food is better than most bars and it popped up in a location that is in desperate need of things to do at night.\n\nDue to the last attribute I mentioned and the fact that it is still relatively new, it is packed Thurs-Sun. Legitimately packed. Like with a line to get in. To SANDBAR!!! Not to be overly judgmental, but if my weekend's turn into me waiting in line to get into a freakin Sandbar, just kill me. Seriously. There is also a VIP line complete with girl holding a clipboard to bless the lucky few who want to wait 20 min for a beer in their Cabana rather than 20 minutes to get a beer at a bar table like the rest of us. That's right, I said a VIP line for SANDBAR!!!\n\nThe outside chairs are super uncomfortable, the service is SLOW and for whatever reason it seems like every single patron smokes which seriously grosses me out and makes me ill, but hey, on the off days when I can guarantee myself a seat at a booth inside, I might stop in for a beer, some grub and a ballgame...maybe.
