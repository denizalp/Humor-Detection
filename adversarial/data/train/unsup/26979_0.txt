Possibly the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas featuring authentic dishes plus dim sum.  The new location inside the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino is definitely an upgrade with higher ceilings and apparently double the space of previous location.  Seems like the move eliminates the long lines of people waiting for a table.  Best dim sum in Las Vegas with fresh food served via tableside carts including the shrimp har gow and pork shumai...standards at dim sum.  Don't get seated in the big dining room with carpet because the carts aren't able to move in there which made it quite annoying to walk to the carts to pick food out.  \n\nI recommend ordering from the menu for dinner since dim sum ends around 3 pm.  All dishes are very flavorful and authentic, mostly Cantonese in my opinion.  Must try include the lamb chop appetizer, egg white fried rice, salt and pepper pork chops, green beans with XO sauce.  These are just a few recommendations but the menu has a dish for every palette!
