The Pho is what I consider healing. Every time I feel like I'm getting sick or a cold coming on Pho 90 is there for me. I usually order two things: Rare Steak Pho and Curry Chicken w\/ Rice plate. The curry chicken is a wonderful dish that is bursting with flavor. The Pho never lets me down.  Excellent choice if you want to experience the healing powers of the Pho.
