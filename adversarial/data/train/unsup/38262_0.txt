This place gets very high marks for making all of their chocolate in-house and really going the extra mile for authenticity.\n\nI recommend the Free Chocolate Tasting & Factory Tour, just go online to reserve your time slot... it's free! It was very interesting to learn how the chocolate is made and then taste pieces from many different countries!\n\nOur favorite chocolate was the Ecuadorian Milk chocolate. Also, the hot chocolate sample was some of the best I've ever had!
