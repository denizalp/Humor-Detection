Went for dinner.  There were different stations latin, asian, italian, american.  With not very many selections.  The meat carving station was pretty good, I had the prime rib.  There were plenty of desserts to choose from.  Frozen yogurt was good.  They also had unlimited house beers and wine.  Beers are all Lite beers and there were 4 choices of wine.
