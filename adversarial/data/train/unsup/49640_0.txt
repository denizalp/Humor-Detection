I was in town to play in a celebrity\/ charity hockey tourney.  Met up with some boys from college and stayed here.  The hotel was great.  Pool was fantastic.  Location was great.  Only down side was there was some construction going on outside and they started at 7am sharp.  It sounded like it was right outside our rooms.  The sliding doors were shut, but didn't help.  Thank god that was only Friday morning as they weren't working Sat and Sun.
