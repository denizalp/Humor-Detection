We arrived 10:30pm Tuesday night - only 2 people at the front desk with a huge line of about 15-18 guests.  One older guy was slow and steady getting guests checked in, but the other girl finished with a guest and then declared that she needed a break. Another girl appeared \"from the back\" (why wasn't she helping earlier?) to take over.  She checked in one guest, then she left. Another woman appeared \"from the back\" (what's going on back there I wonder?) She obviously did not enjoy her job.  Let me ask you something - if you hate people then why take a job working with the public? \n\nMeanwhile another woman came out to work on a computer over to the left with no intention of helping out the line. A couple Platinum tier gentlemen came up in their special line which meant they could cut in front of all us \"minions\".  But one of them insisted that two older ladies be taken in line before him.  Chivalry is not dead!  35 minutes later, we were checked in. Unfortunately the Fulton Food Court closed at 11pm so we foraged for food out on the strip.\n\nThis hotel was only $29\/night, it's on the strip so easy access to everything.  Our room smelled like a moldy mop and the light in the shower was burned out. But luckily we weren't in the room that much so who cares.  This hotel needs a makeover badly.
