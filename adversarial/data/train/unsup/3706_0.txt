Hello North LV Yelpers!\n\nSo I want to give a BIG shout out to my favorite neighborhood\/ favorite LV 7 11 for supporting my drinking addiction! Keeping me fueled up during my summer semester here in Vegas.\n\nI've been coming here 4 times a week the last 8 weeks getting my french vanilla fix to start my early mornings on campus. Now that summer semester is done, I can kick my habit to the curb!\n\nLast month I stopped by around 9am and this month I stopped by around 630am and grabbing my first drink of the day never took me less then 5 minutes! Fast, easy, cheap! I love 7 11! \n\nI've been to many 7 11s to pick up my french vanilla, but other 7 11 machines didn't have what I was looking for... the perfect taste. Watered down drinks are horrible! \n\nMy favorite morning school drink cost under $2 making it an affordable addiction!\n\nFor the most part, there's always parking spaces. Gas prices are reasonable. Close to the 15. Friendly service.\n\nGrab your goods on the go! with 7 11!\n\nYay for cheap coffee!\n- Miss Yelp 2011
