Gold, gold, gold.  \n\nWhat can be said about a stellar do-it-yourself carwash joint? The list is short, but so many places ruin the whole economical choice. Here's what's right at VSC:\n\n- free vacuuming, and plenty of drive-up bays for the activity. No squishing cars around other vehicles. And FREE.  And powerful! \n\n- Cash or credit self-washing bays. Use credit and a timer runs that shows you exactly how much you will be charged EVERY second! No mystery, no disappointing surprise. Misery be gone, along with car filth. \n\n- All the equipment works! I checked the other bays, and there seemed to be no malfunctions. This place is kept in order, clean, functioning.\n\n\nWant an automatic wash? They have that, too. The only downside is the weak lighting in the vacuuming zone, which makes it a bit difficult to reach those hard to see spots at night. The washing area, though, is lit like an operating room. Surgical precision sudsing at Vegas Suds Carwash. \n\nSo happy to find this place because I'm cheap, but still demand the best.
