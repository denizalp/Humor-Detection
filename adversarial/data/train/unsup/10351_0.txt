It's like a giant magpie stockpiled all the glittery pieces of flare and beading it could find in this shiny new casino.  Wicked buffet! Giant Chandelier stretching 2 floors!  Pink, Silver, Purple hues everywhere.  I thought I was at Afterlife on Omega.\n\nIt made the Bellagio (where I was staying) feel like an old Reno hotel with a fancy bidet in the front.
