So, the on again off again sad experience with SAFEWAY hasn't changed. Now they've got a few new cashiers who are slower than the 7 year itch (working at peak check out times) who are rude and not very bright. (Roberta). I'm just biding my time now waiting on SPROUTS to open.\n\nOh, and the homeless who continue to ask for handouts are still allowed to loiter against the building and bother customers. What's so disappointing is this USED to be a really good store. I don't know what happened, but it's not working.
