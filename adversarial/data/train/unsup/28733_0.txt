So we came here on a Saturday night after midnight and the place was pretty much dead and therefore sat down at the bar. They bartenders were very helpful and knowledgable.\n\nBut I have to be honest...for sushi I was very disappointed with the serving sizes. I mean this is Vegas...so I expect a generous amount especially for $15 a roll on average and I was not comfortable paying that much for a roll that I think is worth $7 at best at any other sushi restaurant. \n\nMy suggestion would be to pass on this place. I mean you're paying for an experience, and I guess I didn't get what I paid for.
