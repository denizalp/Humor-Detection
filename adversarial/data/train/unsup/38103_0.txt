Simply the best for authentic ny style pizza or Philly cheesesteak. Staff is nice, service is quick, and the food is consistent every time. Prices are fair, but they do have coupons and such to lower things a bit. Can't recommend this place enough. It's my new favorite joint. Surprised there isn't a line out the door for this stuff.\n\nIf you're from the north east, you owe it to yourself to stop by.
