Woah...after spending some time at a few other neighborhood pubs, I hopped onto the downtown trolley and rolled down to this area. Well I think I rode the trolley in a circle twice and these guys convinced me that Silver was a good idea.  Ok...I was down to just go out dancing at that point.  I get in after having to pay $10 at the door.  [Humm I guess...].  I got in there and found me a cozy spot on the dance floor. \nI danced my a** off to some hiphop-bass bumpin'-booty shaking tunes they played mixed in with some Mexican and Latin favorites.\n\nWhile I enjoyed my time there, I knew it was time to leave when 2 girls starting fighting on the floor at my feet and people were scurring from the back to the front of the club from another fight back there...\n\nI know when it's time to leave...so I made my way out and I walked back home.
