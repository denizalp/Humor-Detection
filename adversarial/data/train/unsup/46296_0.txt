This diner should be featured on the food network! Incredibly cute decor with such a homey feel as soon as you walk in. Linda, our waitress, was lovely and efficient. You can tell this is the type of place where the locals go regularly because they can't get enough of the tasty food and friendly service. Breakfast and Lunch is served all day! I would choose Lou's Diner over any chain around.
