I came here at 2pm and it was busy. Typical nail salon, nothing fancy. All I wanted was a colour change and I waited close to 25 minutes and I wasn't too happy. During my wait I seen two other unhappy customers return with nail problems and the owner looked irritated but helped them. One thing that is very unprofessional at these nail salons are that they speak their own language  which can make a customer feel very uncomfortable. Finally when it was my turn, the lady rushed, got nail polish on everything and took less than 5 minutes with me.  Now, its been less than 24 hours and my nail polish has chipped, so I will be going back to get them fixed up. After today, I will no longer be going to this salon for my nail needs, sorry.
