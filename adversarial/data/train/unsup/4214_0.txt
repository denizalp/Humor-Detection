We were in Chinatown and my aunt wanted to grab a few things.\n\nIt's crowded here but the store offers a plethora of affordable groceries. I like the variety and love how they are able to fit so much into such small spaces. Cashiers are quick. You will be in and out with your goodies in no time and you'll still have money in your wallet.
