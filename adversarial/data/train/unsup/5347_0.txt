Before I mention anything about the food, let's discuss the staff. They are so full of personality that they were like trained bubbly androids lol Really though, they were very nice and seemed genuinely happy that you came to dine there. The pizza was great too. Had a thin crust veggie pizza (don't ask me which one - I forgot because I was busy guzzling it down). Being from out of town, I can't say if the crowd is always like it was, but it was very crowded when we went. And that usually spells great food. Thanks!
