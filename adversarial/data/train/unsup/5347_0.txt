Fantastic!  If it wasn't for the bartender, wine, TV's & ambience at Pizza Rock, I'd say this is my favorite, the best, even better for strictly the pizza cause the PR menu is larger & has a nice variety (FYI under the same ownership)\n\nBesides that it's by the slice..\n-I love the Grandma Slice omg!  The peppadews, sauce & dough all fit together like out of this universe!  I wish I could eat more, but have even split one slice it's so huge!  It's way too big for me to get a whole pie so the slice is actually perfect.  (Not on PR Menu)\n-You can try many unique slices & make a whole unique pie of your own.  Like BYOP lol.  Hey, they should add that!  \n-The Picante is one of my favs, but one whole pie gets to be way too hot & spicy for me.  The Slice House makes it w\/ ricotta so it cuts that heat w\/ a alil sweet.  If you do order a whole pie at PR, add the ricotta cause it doesn't come on that Picante.  Mmm!\n\nPizza Rock told me that I could bring the slice back there to eat so I will do that next time.  All of the pizzas are great & super good like at the restaurant.  I have eaten at both numerous times & the consistency is on point.  I do wish that one of the two would bring back the square Detroit Green.  It was to die for!
