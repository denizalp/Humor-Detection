Sul Irmaos (Southern Brothers) does have an interesting sandwich menu. Love the different combination of elements but does those work in a sandwich? \n\nBut I found out after the first bite of The Beefeater ($8.75) - Southern Slow Smoked Brisket, Deep Fried Okra-Shrimp Crunch, Collard Greens, served with Creole Mustard, that I dislike okra a lot more than I realized! Even deep frying it not helping at all. The beef though tender, has a texture of roast beef instead of brisket!\n\nI though really enjoyed the Pulled Pork Beanasaurus ($8.75) - Southern Slow Smoked Pulled Pork,  Baked Beans,  Slaw and Fried Mac & Cheese Bites. The combination of the ingredients gave it a interesting flavour. I heart Mac & Cheese Bites!!\n\nSul Irmaos being a smokehouse, I do find the meat lack any smokiness in both beef brisket and pulled pork. \n\nOwner\/Server was super nice and friendly. I don't mind coming back again to try out other sandwiches when I am in the area.
