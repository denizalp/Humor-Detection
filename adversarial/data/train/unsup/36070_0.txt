Not the place for the baller-on-a-budget. The bill adds up fast with tapas, and this place is no different. Huge sake selection and the food is ridiculous. Everything we had was amazing. Top of the list - miso sea bass. Get this!! Enjoy the music and the club-vibe but don't trip on the weird videos.
