We haven't been to a VI in years. The food we ordered was delicious and very prompt. However, I'm writing this review because I cannot believe the outstanding service we received from Steven today!!! Literally it was the BEST service we have gotten in years! He was extremely efficient, he creatively put together menu items we wanted, automatically gave extra napkins without being asked, provided extra pancakes (all you can eat menu option) to-go without being asked, he was super friendly and man, I just can't say enough!! Thanks Steven for making our experience a great one! We will definitely be back!
