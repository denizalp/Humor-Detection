Awesome experience.  Definitely worth watching if you are the type that enjoys musicals and have trouble acquiring tix on broadway.  A lot of the cast here have broadway experience.  \n\nThe sets and costumes are beautiful.  Downside is the cost...you're gonna pay $86++ for the cheapest seats (the upper corners of the theater might be discounted further but the view apparently isn't that good).  \n\nKissy Simmons is great as Nala!  \n\nMy tip is to sit in the $86 part of the theater somewhere in the F section rows M through P, Seats 1-20.  The view is good from this area.
