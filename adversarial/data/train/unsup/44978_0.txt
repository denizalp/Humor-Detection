Went for lunch from work last week and somehow forgot to write a review.\n\nPatois is not a fancy looking joint - but it's nice, bright, and well, what really matters is the food, right?\n\nAnd the food is excellent.\n\nPortions were just right for the regular sized lunch\/dinner, there's a lot of options, all the sorts of traditional Jamaican dishes, but the menu isn't overwhelming or complicated. And though the service is quick, there's still some effort put into presentation, which just made the meal that much better.\n\nI love the wall of Jamaican proverbs, it was an entertaining read while I waited for my lunch.
