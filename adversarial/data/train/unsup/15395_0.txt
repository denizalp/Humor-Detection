This is one of my all time favorite places......of all time.  I absolutely adore the concept of creative fusion cuisine.  Chinese-Mexican...SAY WHAAA??  \nThis is what America is all about.  This is why we fight terrorism.  ;-)\n\nNow they have this ridiculous byzantine menu and ordering process, which was designed by some sorta IRS bureaucrat...and they refuse to change it!! DO NOT LET THIS STOP YOU.  You can get through it and you must, because waiting for you on the other side is fantastic food.  \n\nIt is best to go with a friend and have them help you order, but if you can't here is my tip.  Find the section that says \"Combinations.\" Then select two of the following (at the top).  \"Chinese BBQ Pork\" and \"Jerk Chicken.\"  And yes rice and beans.  \n\nNow GO!
