Went here for lunch with friends and it was awesome.  The place is really bright with color and smells great inside.  Lunch special was great.  Service was on top of everything.  Very nice. Chicken rice bowl was the best I've had in a while.  My friends said the sushi was awesome.  Spicy tuna was the best.
