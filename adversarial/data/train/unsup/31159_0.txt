8\/15\/2017 - After leaving some negative reviews, Lorex reached out and let me know that a replacement NVR had been shipped.  Someone forgot to tell the customer service people to ship the NVR because its a week later and there is no tracking number, no NVR.  And I've been sitting on hold for 40 minutes this morning waiting to talk to someone.  \n\nLorex, following up with a customer and LYING doesn't really help.  You guys acknowledged the NVR was defective.  You guys received the defective NVR back.  Why don't you do the right thing and send the replacement that should have been sent 2 months ago.\n\n9\/1\/2017 - Update.  Received the 3rd replacement NVR (its the one I sent back months ago) a week ago. Last night, cursor in the upper left quadrant and the software wouldn't load.  THANK GOD I bought it at Costco.  Still really upset that I'm out the installation cost of this system but at least I will be getting my $2500 for the system back.  For my replacement security system, I'm calling the technical support line first and seeing how long it takes to get through.  Also thinking about putting 2 16 camera systems in instead of 1 32 camera system.  Might have been too much for the NVR to handle.
