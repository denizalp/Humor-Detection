Had a really great experience! Ludy (my hairstylist) and Dee (the owner) were very welcoming and sweet since the minute I walked in. It was my first time and they were both very chatty and fun as if they had known me for many years.\n\nLudy did an amazing job with my hair considering I hadn't had a real haircut in two years after finishing my Peace Corps service and it was in a ridiculously unhealthy state!!\n\nAs they were taking care of me, they were very welcoming of other clients and knew them all by name. It felt like home. Make this your next stop for your next haircut!\n\nI heard about them from Groupon where they also have great reviews.
