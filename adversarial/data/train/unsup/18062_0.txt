I love hotel lobby bars, and this one is the BEST! It's at the base of the ultra-swanky Wynn Tower Suites, which is the swanky VIP enclave within the already swanky Wynn hotel. But anyone can sit here and have a drink.\n\nThe drinks and ambiance are fantastic, but it's really the people-watching that makes this place. Expect tons of one-percenters, high-end hookers, nouveau-riche sports figures and assorted other white trash celebrities. Last time I was there, Pele (the soccer player) and some chick from Pawn Stars passed through.  \n\nAs these fine people get drunker, however, things can get delightfully awkward. I watched a swaggering redneck songwriter in a sport jacket and ball cap (!) needle the shit out of some poor black attorney, repeatedly calling him \"Sidney Poitier\" as the bartender guffawed politely, tapdancing madly on the line between offending either party. Awkward as fuck, but fun to watch in a really sick way!\n\nAnd THAT's what I love about this place.
