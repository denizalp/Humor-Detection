Not bad for a hotel bar, but if you're not staying here it would probably be best not to make it a destination or even a stop-over.  There are 8 comfortable stools at the bar and there are several lounge tables with chairs to match.\n\nThe bar is a part of the hotel lobby and is void of any privacy partition.  It's a great place to track guest movements because you have a perfect vantage point of the lobby elevators.\n\nPrices are average for the area.  It's nice not having to pay $9 for a Chivas Regal on the rocks.  And it's a decent place for a nightcap if you're already staying at the Hilton (or hope to stay in it...wink wink).\n\nAfter the club it's the hotel party...
