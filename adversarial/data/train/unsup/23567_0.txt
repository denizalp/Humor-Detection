I'm lovin' this hut. This lilliputian vegan restaurant packs a big punch with beautifully crafted, delicious dishes that won't make you miss meat at all. We came here around noon on Saturday and there was only one other patron eating. As we left it got a lot busier and tables (4 inside and a few more outside) started filling up.\n\nThe menu consists of noodle soup, burgers, sandwiches, salads, rice noodles, and faux meat Chinese style dishes. After browsing through the menu I decided on the golden vermicelli ($8.50) and tried some chickless banh mi. I also had an iced chai to drink and spicy fries to share.\n\nThe iced chai was absolutely delicious, one of the best iced chai drinks I've had. It was beautifully presented, with a rich, velvety foam on top, a dusting of cinnamon, and a lovely chai flavor that reminded me of the great chai tea they serve at Indian restaurants. The vermicelli was equally as beautiful to behold, and had a wonderful combination of textures, temperatures, and flavors, from the grilled faux beef, the soft rice noodles, lettuce, spring rolls, shredded carrots, radish cucumber, and sauce. It was a hearty meal that I could have easily shared with another person. The banh mi was also quite delectable, with a light, airy bread with crispy outer crunch, the tender faux chicken, and crunchy pickled vegetables.\n\nThe fries were a sizable amount, with a flavorful slightly spicy tomato sauce with beans and some faux meat. \n\nService was friendly and cheerful and our meals took only a short time to be made. \n\nAlthough the space is very small, they manage to make it a serene, peaceful environment, and I love the plant wall decorations. There is a TV on one of the walls too that plays various vegan cooking demonstrations, showing off spectacular looking dishes.\n\nDefinitely a healthier option for eating out. I'll be back for more delicious dishes!
