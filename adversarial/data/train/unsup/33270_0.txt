Great Phoenix treasure!  I've driven by Hob Nobs over the years and finally stopped in to check it out.  Great place, cool vibe, had no idea the diverse menu and even a full bar!  We stopped in quick to get some food to go, I ordered the Doc's Choice sandwich and my daughter had the Garlic Shrimp Pizza.  The service was friendly and attentive and the food was awesome!  My sandwich was incredibly tasty and my daughter's pizza was delicious.  We will be back!!!!
