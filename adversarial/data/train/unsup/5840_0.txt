SiChuan beef noodle soup on the strip, quite expensive but it's pretty delicious if you're craving warm soup on the strip (located in the Venetian). \n\nYes: \n- Get combo fried rice!\n- Beef Noodle Soup... spicy, pretty nice and generous chunks of beef and tendon. We also appreciate that the soup wasn't oily. \n\n\nNo: \n- Obviously overpriced, double the price of Asian food in LA\/off the strip\n- Service was kinda wack... they charged an extra curry sauce item on our receipt, we complained, and then they informed us that they FORGOT to charge us a dollar for extra Chinese sausage in our fried rice so we actually owe more.... blahblahblah typical attitude.  \n\nLove you, Vegas.
