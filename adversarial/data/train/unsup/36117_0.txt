Being someone that's indecisive towards nail salons due to some bad experiences (some at Today's Nails in Markham- which used to be my go-to) I had been skeptical to find another salon.\n\nHowever, when my nails chipped during work, I couldn't bear to look at my nails in that state. i ended up going to SJ Nails as it was the closest salon that looked decent. \n\nThe moment I walked in, I was promptly greeted by one of the girls who directed me to their color wheels in order to pick a color (I was doing a shellac manicure). I ended up selecting 'Marshmallow' from BIO Seaweed Gel (which is very commonly used.)\n\nShe managed to prep my nails and get them started into the process extremely quickly and I believe I was out of the salon in only half an hour tops. quick paced, but very good quality work!\n\nI look at my nails and they're filed evenly, the polish is level and shiny, and there are no traces of air bubbles, which I have noticed from other salons. This is top in my book!
