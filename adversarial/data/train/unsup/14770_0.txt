Solid curry house with really good katsu. Didn't blow me away though.\n\nCame around lunch time and it was full but we got seated right away. Waters dropped off and orders taken quickly. The service here is really efficient. Both of us ordered the chicken katsu with level 3 spicy.\n\nThe chicken katsu is made really well. When you cut or bite into it, the breading doesn't just fall apart. That separates great katsu from badly breaded chicken. The curry was good, came out piping hot and had a slow creeping heat to it. I'm glad we asked what \"medium\" was and he said 2-3 on the spice level (out of 10!). I can handle my own with spice but I don't even want to imagine how spicy 10 is. I would recommend 3 for some heat without being too hot.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come again, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.
