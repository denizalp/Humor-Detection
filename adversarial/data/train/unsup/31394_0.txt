Very nice hotel, our room was clean and comfortable. Kudos to the front staff for letting us check in early. We also got a room on the 9th floor with a great view of the Westgate shopping district. We stayed here because we didn't want to drive home after the Toby Mac concert and the next door Glendale Arena so it worked out perfectly! My wife is using the spa this morning for a much needed massage.
