Good board games, low price of admission, and a good atmosphere in general. Now, you might wonder why I'm leaving this place a One-Star Rating. Simply put, they kicked us out for no reason.\n\nIn their defence, we were a rather large group (about 8 people if I remember correctly), and due to the fact that we came to this place right after dinner, we didn't order all that much from their menu. Furthermore, we were playing Monopoly, and you know how people get when they start playing Monopoly. We were definitely on the louder side of the spectrum.\n\nWe were under the impression that, like many other board game cafes in Toronto, you pay the price of admission and you can pretty much stay for as long as you want to. Although this place pretends to operate under the same business model, if you read the very fine print at the bottom of their menu, THEY RESERVE THE RIGHT TO KICK YOU OUT AT ANY POINT IN TIME FOR NO GOOD REASON.\n\nThroughout our game, the waitresses constantly came up to our table to ask if we wanted to order anything. We made it pretty clear from the get-go that we were here to play board games and nothing else (at a place called ROLL PLAY if I may add. Go figure). After a while, when the place began filling up, and the staff realized that there are other parties (who were likely more willing to order from the menu) who wanted our table, they nonchalantly told us that we have 30 minutes to finish up and leave. That was it.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I like this place. It's a great place to hang out and play board games. However, how the staff treated my specific group of friends is total BS. Needless to say, I'm never coming back here again.
