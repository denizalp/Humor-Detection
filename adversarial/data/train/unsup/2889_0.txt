I love sushi, and I can put down a lot of food.  So this place was made for me.\n\nWent with my dad and brother on a Sunday.  All day buffet for $17.  Walked in, and the staff was very nice and welcoming.  They cleared a space for us immediately when we wanted a booth.  Very attentive, I always had a full glass of water.  No complaints about the service at all.\n\nNow... the food. Sashimi you have to pay $0.50 extra per piece, but you don't have to for the Nigiri.  So we got a lot of that.  My favorite is the mackerel, and it was good.  Eel was good too.  I've gotta say, these guys have presentation on point.  Depending on how many pieces of nigiri you have, they lay them out on the plate nicely.  Good artistic use of space.\n\nThe appetizers:  BBQ squid was on point, nice and spicy, I wish I took a picture of it.  Agedashi tofu good.  Tempura was alright.  My dad got more tofu afterwards.\n\nThe rolls:  Standard, 8 pieces per order.  Spicy tuna, spicy crab, spicy salmon, sweet potato tempura, yellowtail, eel rolls all pretty good.  Above average buffet sushi.  You can order special rolls from their buffet sushi as well, and that's where they shined.  I only got the Mr. Tokyo roll.  It has black tobiko and MANGO on\/in it.  I flipped out.  Really nice looking, delicious pieces of sushi.  My only regret is not ordering those from the start.  Next time I go, I'll definitely make up for my mistake.\n\nOverall, a great experience.  My dad honestly isn't that big a fan of Japanese food, and he was like, \"Let's do this again before you leave for school.\"  I leave in two weeks.\n\nI would've given this a 4 out of 5, because I've had a better sushi buffet in Raleigh.  But this place also overlaps a PokeStop.  And it got lured.  TWICE.  5 out of 5.
