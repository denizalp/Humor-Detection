I stopped in with a group of fellow Yelpers after a luncheon nearby.  It's a quaint little shop that showcases many lovely pastries.  It is small inside hence not much seating for larger groups.  You can definitely take their treats to go.  Service was ok as it was busy.  Although it did take them a while just to bring out desserts from their case.  That was a little puzzling.\n\nIf the flavor matched the beautifully decorated desserts, I'd be writing a completely different review.  Unfortunately I felt a little bit of a let down when it came to biting into the few choices I sampled.  I tried the Coconut Chiffon Cake as well as the Mont Blanc.  Both equally just ok in my book.  I don't know... maybe I just picked the two bland desserts in the case. \n\nI wouldn't be opposed to coming back again to try a crepe or different dessert.  Everyone deserves a second chance.
