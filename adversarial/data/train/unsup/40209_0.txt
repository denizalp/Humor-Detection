Today I had excellent service from the guys at Jiffy Lube! The assistant manager Michael answered the phone right away and was able to tell me that they had the battery I needed for my car in stock. My old battery was corroded and he cleaned off the area and sprayed it with a protectant to help my new battery from having problems! We were in and out within 20 minutes and I was beyond relieved since it was close to closing time! I would highly recommend their friendly service!
