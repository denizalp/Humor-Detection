Decided to drive a bit out of the my way to try Rocket Burger & Subs based on the \"Yelper\" reviews!!  This place is too clean for a \"Greasy or a Dive\" title, but there food reminds me of some of the BEST greasy\/dives out there!  \n\nThey have a wide variety of food choices and there menu doesn't tell the whole story, so you may need to ask some questions.  When I looked through their burgers I noticed the \"Eddie Lopez\".  \n\nTo my surprise there is a better burger topping than bacon...  Hot Pastrami!!!  It was a mouth watering double burger that came with Hot Pastrami stacked on top of the two patties covered in melty-cheesy goodness, toppings and their thousand island dressing.  It was FANTASTIC!! \n\nWe also had the \"sub of the day\" ~ the Big Dipper.  The roast beef was delicious and it had just the right amount of cheese.  Their au jus dipping sauce was not good, but the sandwich was superb.  Their Au jus did not have a beefy taste, it was too thin, too hot and did not set well on the pallet with this sandwich.\n\nTheir fries are fresh but a bit too greasy for our taste.  Will try to get them well done on our next visit or try their onion rings.  Their cheese curds were very good!\n\nThey do have one of the largest selections of soda, pop in a bottle.  It's fun to try a soda you've never heard about before like an imported micro brew root beer or cream soda!  (Both were very good BTW)\n\nRocket Burger & Subs, even though it will be extremely hard for me to consider ordering something other than the Eddie Lopez burger, I'm looking forward to my next visit, trying something else and plan to bring some friends with me. If you have not tried RB&S, they are a solid place to \"Book Mark\"!\n\nYelpers, what is your favorite Rocket Burger or Sub??
