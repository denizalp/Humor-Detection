On our short visit to Vegas, this restaurant was recommended by a fellow hotel-stayer. Very pleased that we came! The food was excellent, and def. lived up to our expectations. We asked the waitress what she recommended on the menu- and we went with it! The green inlet was loaded w\/ veggies- delish. Baked potato soup is great, and loaded with yummy cheese, scallions, and bacon. Okay... the STAR OF THE SHOW *drum roll* the red velvet coffee cake! My mouth is watering as I type this! Honestly, that could have been breakfast in-and-of-itself!
