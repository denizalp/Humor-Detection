My wife and I (and our 4 children) frequent this place throughout the week. Recently Derek added sandwiches to the menu. I tried the first one listed ( I-Ree, i think it's called ). It was delicious! Reminiscent of the time we spent in Jamaica, the Jerk Mayo is such a great touch (they will put it on any kind of bread you want) perfectly tangy and a hint of spicy.
