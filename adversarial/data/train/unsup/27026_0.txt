I recently came here and wow it's like brand new lol they remodeled the place it's much bigger and nicer. We sat and waited for our dim sum to come around seems like they didn't have much to offer. I asked for a few things and they said soon it's coming which it never did lol. Overall service is bad and food never came only had a few choices ate what we can grab and we left
