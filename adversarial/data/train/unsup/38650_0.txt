This hotel is up for sale, so - nobody cares. \n\nParking is expensive ($35\/night) & Valet is even worse ($45\/night). They are not luxury service providers by any means. It is super disorganized. Long messy lines.\n\nBell Man - Sometimes they leave your bags on a trolley unattended when they get busy. \n\nFront Desk - the LINES are INSANE! I've seen hour long waits to just check in. Sign up for SPG Membership, u get a different line up which can sometimes be faster.\n\nRoom - Renovated, slightly updated. The Westin bedsheets are the best. I \n\nCleaning Lady\/Service - The cleaning ladies are terrible. They don't follow proper sanitation guidelines. They touch your toilet then place fresh towels in your bathroom, then touch your bedsheets. They rarely empty garbage bins properly, so in some rooms they smell. The rooms are incredibly dusty.\n\nRoom Service - Terrible. Food is bad. They always mess up the order. OVERPRICED. $35 for a simple breakfast that sucks is ridiculous.\n\nMaintenance may randomly knock on your door to inspect. Be aware to put a sign on the door or lock it if you are taking a shower or plan to sleep in, this made for an awkward experience - twice.\n\n\"Service Express\" - This is the ONLY way to contact anyone inside the hotel. Front Desk, Valet, Room Service etc,. all together on 1 button to call out & there is nothing \"EXPRESS\" about this. I've waited for up to 15 minutes for someone to answer & get my car called up.\n\nI stayed here for at least 30 nights because of business.\n\nOverall, nothing good about this expect the bedsheets & location. If you like clean, service, any sort of hotel luxuries, not the place for you.
