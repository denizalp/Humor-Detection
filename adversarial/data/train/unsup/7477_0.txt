This park is what I would call the \"Goldilocks\" of parks in the area. Not too small, not too big, just right. They've got a little bit of everything: Soccer fields, Disc Golf course, walking\/running trail, small playground with a covered picnic area, and even tennis courts.\n\nJust last year I lived about half a mile away from this darling park, but now even with moving to the University area, I like to make the occasional trip back. The walking path is great and it's length is super convenient, it measures out to nearly a perfect mile. You have to walk the length of the disc golf area as well to get to a mile but it's pretty level and a great spot to get a baseline for cardio training.\n\nThere's a set of bathrooms in the corner of the parking lot, it's a bathroom in a public park so don't be too picky, it is what it is.\n\nIf you got an hour or so to burn, this is a great place to unwind, burn some calories, or just people watch.
