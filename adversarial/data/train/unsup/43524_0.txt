I love Einstein Bagels, but this location gets 1 star for their inefficient service.  This is a breakfast place where people need to head to work.  The staff are very slow moving and there doesn't seem to be a good system to just grab a bagel and go.  I'm sure they lose business...  I often wonder where the owner or manager is each day-no seems in charge.  If you're in a rush, don't stop it...  You'll only leave aggravated!!!
