someone once told me that the wynn is better than the bellagio. WELL THAT PERSON LIED TO ME. i've tried both and i think bellagio just has better quality food and the atmosphere is nicer too.\n\nafter a night of clubbing and being hung over the entire day and perhaps still drunk, making my way to the bellagio buffet is something i always look forward to. you pay first, and i usually come here around 4:30 and pay for lunch and stay til dinner when they bring out the crab legs and other dinner dishes (i'm asian..). the first time i came here, i had the best waitress. she hyped up the orange juice! her exact words were \"we have the best orange juice, all hand squeeze, with no additional water or sugar added!\" what a sweet chinese lady! so of course, we all got glasses of orange juice and she wasn't lying! the orange juice was the best!\n\nthe dishes i love getting here:\n\n1. steak\n2. sushi\/sashimi\n3. smoked salmon\n4. CREME BRULEE (i can eat 5 of these)\n\ni definitely think it's a must-go buffet in vegas, and i guess the wynn isn't bad, but i personally prefer bellagio.
