Ah, the gut bomb.  What better way to repair the damage done after a hard night of partying than country gravy?\n\nJerry's has become my go to spot for post party breakfast.  The restaurant is clean and the service is usually quick.\n\nImagine the Denny's menu, only with good food.  That's what you get at Jerry's.  Simple, tasty food.  There are a ton of breakfast choices to be had, as well as the lunch\/dinner type items.  \n\nFor me it's all about the chicken fried steak.  The steak is perfectly cooked and the gravy is delicious.  Though my stomach won't thank me for ordering it my taste buds will!\n\nIn the realm of 24 hour diners that host neo-nazi book signings, Jerry's has to be top.\n\n(note:  That nazi thing isn't cool)
