We're locals, so we were really excited to finally experience the High Roller. The line was long so we bought our tickets at the kiosk. They cost $40 each. As we were walking in, we noticed a sign that says locals save $5. We mentioned that we just bought tickets and didn't get the $5 discount & the employee told us if we bought them at the kiosk, it was too late to get the discount. He was quite rude about it. We figured we'd deal with it after our ride & proceeded to the attraction. There's a bar there, so we bought a couple drinks & waited in line for the ride. The drinks were expensive, but we knew the drinks would be at this new tourist attraction. \n\nThe pods you sit in were really nice. We were with about 10 other people, which was fine, we didn't feel overcrowded and it was easy to move within the pod. The view was magnificent, of course. The ride is about 30 min long. If you're afraid of Ferris wheels, don't be afraid of this one. It goes so slow, you don't even feel like you're moving.\n\nWhen we finished the ride, we tried to see if we could get our $5 local discount. The girl we talked to was even more rude about it than the first guy we spoke to. She actually rolled her eyes at me. My boyfriend then asked to speak to a manager. She basically refused to get the manager until we continually insisted on seeing a manager. We were then led to the manager by a different employee. The manager quickly apologized & credited $10 to my boyfriend's credit card. In addition to the $5 discount, she said locals 17 and under ride free.  However, we didn't see this special posted anywhere. I'm sure lots of families would come if their kids ride free. Why offer these discounts if they don't really advertise them?\n\nWe paid $70 for the tickets & another $25 for 2 drinks. For $95, I'd say go to Ghostbar or the Voodoo Lounge & enjoy the same view &  enjoy more than 1 cocktail!
