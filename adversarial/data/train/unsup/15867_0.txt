This restaurant is totally something you would find on diners, drive-ins and dives. Just amazing food and not just one style either. \n\nWe started off with Guy-talian Fondue Dippers which were pepperoni-wrapped breadstick with a provolone and sausage cheese dip. Im not a big pretzel person but these were great. The cheese dip is what makes the dish. We also got the Fireball whiskey wings which were great. they came with some kind of blue cheese dip which paired great with it.\n\nFor our mains we got the Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger which won burger of the year in vegas last year. This burger is built with crispy applewood bacon, six cheese mac, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  Great burger with great flavor. They even cut this burger in fourths for us. The burger comes with 4 different types of fries and all were amazing and went great with the leftover cheese sauce from the pretzels. \n\nWe also got the 14 hour slow smoked brisket. Wow, some serious flavor here. Looks like a plate of BBQ brisket that you would get in Texas. I just thought that were was a little too much bbq sauce drizzled over the meat. I would've liked to try more of the flavor from the brisket. \n\nLastly, we ended with Triple Doublemint Pie. Holly cow, this was huge. It was a mint chocolate chip ice cream pie with oreo cookie crust and hot fudge. We had 4 people and couldn't even get close to finishing this dessert. \n\n\nThe service was excellent and they were on top of everything.
