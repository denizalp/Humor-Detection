Jimmy Wan is an interesting place.  It has some of the best dumplings and noodles around.  The atmosphere is funny with white table cloth's, etc.  If you grab a spot in the corner, its not too bad. The drink menu is nice with a great beer selection, local and imported.  I would recommend this place if you are hungry for dim sum, especially since there are not many other options around.
