(UPDATE due to Services Rendered)\n\nCalled today @ 4:30 for some services on a last minute basis and I was told to come on in and they'll do as much as possible in the time given.\n(worst case scenario:  I'd leave my wheels with them).\n\nI was there by about 5:20 and was serviced immediately.\nI don't have a pedal wrench so I needed some pedals installed, I thought I was due for rear breaks and I also wanted to get a fitting done.\n\nPedals were on in no time!\nDude looked at the breaks and said \"To be honest, you're not in need of new pads yet... we'll just do a cable adjustment for ya\".\nHe fitted my bike.\nGave me a lot of info on safety regarding SPD know-how to keep me from getting mushed by a PAT bus.\nOverall, they were very friendly and helpful!\n\nI keep getting lucky and going in when the owner is there.\nNot sure if its luck, so much, or if that's just how he likes to run things--either way... I like this shop a lot!\nI think that this will be my 1st choice of LBS's from now on.\n\nI called around and got some insane estimate on the things I wanted done and here I paid a total of just shy of $17.00!     \n\nWIN!
