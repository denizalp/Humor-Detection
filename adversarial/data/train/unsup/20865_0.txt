The burnt ends have to be my favorite.  I ordered the choice of two meats.  I asked if I could get ribs and burnt end \"sure for an extra 3.00\".\nIt wasn't worth the worth the extra three dollars imo.  You get three ribs 1.00 a rib not Work the extra money.  Get something else besides the ribs.  \nThe burnt ends were so tender and so delicious yummy yum yum!\nThe onion rings were so yummy.  If you come here they have an all you can eat, I can't even eat what I ordered I don't know how someone can eat all you can eat and make it worth while.
