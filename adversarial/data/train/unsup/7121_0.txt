When you think of Vegas you don't necessarily think of nature. I sure didn't, until I heard from some friends about this place and had to go check it out. Lucky for me and my friends it was unusually cool when we went so we didn't totally broil out there. They have a really nice visitor center, with cool educational displays about the area as well as huge panoramic windows and lookouts where you can observe the beautiful red rock formations. We decided to drive the scenic loop (relatively short), and stopped at various areas for sightseeing and did a short hike to a waterfall that actually had flowing water! This is very exciting when you're in the desert. All in all, a wonderful excursion that I'm looking forward to repeating. If you've never been, you owe it to yourself to see this wondrous place. Plus, the Red Rock casino is really nice and close by in case you start getting gambling withdrawals.\n\nSTEPH JUDGEMENT: Magnificent wilderness so close to Vegas!
