I used to love to come here,the owner was well spoken,but after my 4th time here and this was a few years ago.\nI was told I needed new rotors for my car and I started stressing out after I got a price quote.they started doing work on my car right away withought me even saying it was ok to work on my car,before I signed anything.\nand I called my brother since it was his car before and he told me he had just put in new,more expensive rotors that cost him $120 or so and after telling the owner I wasn't comfortable with his quote Wich was 2-300 for the work on my car he put everything back and was really nice about it at least.  I never went back after that and I asked my friend for help \n\nand we went to auto zone and I had Warrenty on my break pads wich were really bad,not my rotors.so I got those for free and I bought a spray for the breaks for $10 instead of spending $$$ at the shop.\n\nI know shops are going to cost for their knowledge but I felt like I was being tooken advantage of since I don't know much about cars. \n\nthe good part is that they are nice and will give you a ride home if your car has to be in the shop for the day.i was more than happy before but I haven't been back in years.i am not angry but just thought I'd share
