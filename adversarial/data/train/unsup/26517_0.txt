My one star is in no way meant to give this location ANY credit. This Dunkin Donuts is only getting this rating because I really do like the Dunkin Donuts' breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. They are really good. Which makes the existence and poor management of this store even more of a travesty. We need more options in this area. However, this place is by far the worst restaurant of any caliber I've ever been to. We have tried to give it a chance numerous times...purely on the fact that the food is tasty. However...after my experience today...I have committed to never going back. And I announced this to my kids \"Eat up and enjoy. I will not be spending another dime here.\"\n\nThe people I've been served by there are rude, slow and just do not understand the concept of customer service AT ALL. It's amazing.
