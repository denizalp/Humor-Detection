I was eager to try Lilac when I heard it had opened. I stopped by the location to make an appointment. I was happy to see they had an actual PERSON attending to the phone and greeting customers. \n* Most foot spas have NO greeter and the technician is the one who answers the phone while she is working on you. \nThe next thing about Lilac was it had actual doors and walls separating the rooms. \n* Most foot spas are one big room divided by flimsy curtains. \nWhen we arrived we filled out a short form. Then we were escorted to the foot massage room where we were treated to 30 min foot soak, head, scalp, foot, and leg massage. \nAfter the 30 mins we were taken to a private room with 2 beds. We had the 60 minute full body massage which included the hot stones. The technicians asked how the pressure was for us both multiple times during the session. \nMusic was pipped through the entire place- not just playing on scratched CD. \nI could not hear anything from the outside world once inside the massage room. This is usually not the case with other foot spas. You can hear the beeping of the microwave and purr of the washing machine and hum of employees talking while on their break. \nAs far as how often I will return... the prices here are about 15$-20$ more than other foot spas in the area and that can be a huge factor when budgeting in bimonthly massages. 60$ per hour body massage here compared to 40$ other places is a big difference. Sad to say that I've almost gotten used to the above mentioned distractions and noises and it felt a bit odd to have my massage in such a quiet environment. \nI'll be back when my back is out of whack and I encourage you to give Lilac a try.
