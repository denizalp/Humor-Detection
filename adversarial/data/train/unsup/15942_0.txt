I almost feel like the Dingo Warrior, later to be known as the Ultimate Warrior, WWF superstar. When you walk in a huge curtain is draped up to stop the cold air from attacking the customers sitting inside. I don't know if it was a ploy to get hardcore wrestling fans in here, or as I said to keep cold air out. I like to think it is for the wrestling fans, but I'm almost certain that is not the case. \n\nVery relaxed atmosphere and a perfect location, if you are out on the town on the weekend, maybe to the West Side Market, or wherever you are going, a good cup of joe is very near you. \n\nI think I may run in like a bat out of hell next time I go here and have the Warriors theme music blasting on my way to put in my order. If not next time, it is on the bucket list of things to do.
