BEWARE of this cleaner!  Like another reviewer posted, their management and ethics are simply terrible. \n\nI copied this statement because I simply cannot put it any better.  If they ruin an article of your clothing, you are SOL.  I took my brand new Calvin Klein dress, only worn once, my new favorite, to have drycleaned and they broke the teeth on the zipper and the dress will no longer zip.  As I said, I only wore this dress once and the zipper was fine when I dropped it off.  The manager refused to even acknowledge that this was something they could have done and would not offer any restitution whatsoever. \n\nI only had a problem once before in many years of using cleaning services.  It was a ruined silk shirt, just like the experience the other reviewer had.  In that particular case the service I had used (not this cleaner) eagerly paid me for the ruined shirt, as they should, or at least offer a cleaning credit.  The manager at Discount Cleaners was argumentative and did not seem to care at all that I ended up with a ruined dress that was their fault.  \n\nI don't take time to post review unless I am extremely happy or extremely unhappy with the service or experience.  I cannot stress enough that you need to beware of this establishment!
