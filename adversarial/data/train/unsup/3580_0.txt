The manager here is ridiculously rude and delusional. I went in to exchange a shirt that I bought for someone as a gift. They tried it on and it did not fit, so right then and there I folded it back up and put it away to exchange it for a bigger size the next day. This lady would not exchange it saying she will not resale it because it's wrinkled. I told her it was folded and in the bag for 48 hours of course it's not going to be laid out. She began to raise her voice and cause a scene, and attempted to write something on my receipt so no other store would exchange it for me either, but I snatched it from under her pen. I shop WEEKLY at this store, and felt EXTREMELY offended that she would not allow me to get a different size. Sad to say that this company is losing a VERY loyal customer because of her attitude and lack of customer service.
