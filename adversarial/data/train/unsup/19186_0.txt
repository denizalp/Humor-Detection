It worked, it was on time, and the 28x got me where i was going for all of $2.60. Besides that it was freezing cold, loud, and the older bus seats were fairly uncomfortable, I can't really complain. \n\nWe did arrive 5 minutes early for a bus that never came. The next one arrived on schedule, but it was raining so we spent 20 minutes in the rain. \n\nThat said, we took the bus many more times reliably than that one time when it didn't show.\n\nOverall, a pretty good system.
