After all these years I still love PV Mall. I'm shocked the McDonalds closed after all these years. Clearly I haven't been here in a while. It brings back tons of memories from childhood. The remodel they did years back is nice and I like the furniture throughout the mall. The crowd looks clean cut and even the kids look like upstanding citizens. I'd come back a lot if I lived closer to it.
