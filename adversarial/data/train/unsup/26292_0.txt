The food is good here.  I like the fact that there is Hawaii style food as well as korean style food.  Jun's gives more sides though.  The boiled peanuts are nice.  My girlfriend liked the miso tofu spicy soup.  My roast beef was good too.  All in all I think I liked Juns more for korean and Island flavor resturant for my Hawaii style food.
