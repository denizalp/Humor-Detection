Great selection of accessories and optics. Reasonable prices for weapons. But beware. I called the store looking for a part, they told me they had it, drove across town, and found out they DIDN'T have it. This was really irritating due to gas prices right now. Other than that mishap, great store. I really think they need to hire more help or give a class on how to handle orders and questions properly. SERIOUSLY.
