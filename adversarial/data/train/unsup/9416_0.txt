This is the anti-mall of malls in many ways.  It has a lot of good things going for it:\n\nA Fruit\\Mini Market. \nA Black's \nSome knick and knack stores \nA few restaurants... and a food court... mostly generic and forgettable. \nA used video game\/computer store which if I recall, has good prices\nA LCBO(!)\n\nThey also have a walking clinic --which I have used in the past a few times as they open late but do bring your phone fully charged, a tent and a spear since you will probably run out of juice and will have to hunt for food before you get called in.\n\nThis mall is always semi-empty of shopper and customers except for the LCBO and Pickle Barrel. Most of the time you will think most people use this mall by four types of people. \n\n* Locals who live on the nearby condos across the street(s)\n* Office folk who work above the mall \n* People using is as an indoor crossway to and from the TTC and the Bus Terminal\n* Twilight Zone survivors stuck on a time warp who are unable to leave the premises\n   due to some mystical yet terrifying course \n\nWould I come shopping here? Uh... for what? Most likely for the LCBO. Otherwise most people would never even know of the existence of this place... but it makes for a great indoor walkway to Bay.
