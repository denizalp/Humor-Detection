I struggle with the 5 stars.  Not because it is not deserving, but it might bring more people here and the secret will be out.\n\nI can only speak for breakfast which is AWESOM.  Our server Allison was amazing.  Extremely friendly and helpful. \n\nI had corned-beef hash, two eggs, biscuit and home fries.  The hash was some of the best I have had, and I love hash.  Wife had biscuits and gravy and it too was fantastic.\n\nThis is simply one of the best experiences I have had in a while.  So glad we stopped.
