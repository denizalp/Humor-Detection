It's been almost 3 years since my first review of this place and it's still a favorite pizza destination. I alternate between here and the Neapolitan place down the street. I had a lull between visits, but then I invited friends who'd never been before for happy hour.  They loved it so much that we've ended up coming here on a regular basis again.  I forgot how easy it is to just come in and share a salad and pizza with a couple of other people.  Plus they make a good Moscow Mule to go along with those items.  I prefer to sit outside on the patio, but it's too cold in the winter for that.  It used to be very crowded back in the day, but now there's never been a wait when I've gone.  There are still many items on the menu that I've yet to try after all this time, but maybe that's because it's all about that pizza for me.  Mangia!
