A gas station with a restaurant or a restaurant that happens to have some gas pumps? \n\nSuper impressed by their pull pork and massive amounts of barbecue sauce options from hickory to North Carolina (vinegar based). \n\nIn addition to a bakery and grill, you can also find cute niknaks and stationary. If there was ever a North Scottsdale gas station, this is it!
