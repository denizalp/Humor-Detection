I ate the Montreal smoked meat sandwich at Costco.  It was the single most memorable culinary experience I've experienced in Mississauga.(I'm from Chicago). I wish i could've finished another. The meat, the crispy baguette, the dressing, and the cheese oh my God the cheese. I wish I could eat this everyday so that I could get sick of it, because then I wouldn't dream about this sandwich again. Damn you Costco, Damn you Canadians for having food that just tastes better. I can't believe i've fallen for a $3 sandwich at Costco.
