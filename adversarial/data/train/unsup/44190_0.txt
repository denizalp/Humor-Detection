This was not my favorite Cirque show... but before you go ragging on me, I still think it's amazing work.  The stage, sound, screens, and music were all wonderful.  This isn't the typical Cirque show where you see acrobats fly\/jump\/swim\/etc all around you. This show is not just for Beatles fan but for music lovers all around the world...\n\nSeeing how well this show has done... and the people in the audience, I can only imagine how HUGE the Beatles was.  Pretty amazing music...
