Ehhhhhhhh....\n\nThe coffee is sometimes good, sometimes not. The staff are sometimes friendly, sometimes not. For example, today, as my americano was tossed in my direction across the bar (with zero visible crema on top, may I add), the barista was talking to the guy across from me (Was he the owner, manager, random customer? I don't know) about how the espresso was off. And guess what? It was. I strongly considered handing the drink back and asking for a drip, but decided to let it go.\n\nWhile I'm aware that this incident was irregular\/anecdotal, I do feel that it sums up my experience at Lit quite well.
