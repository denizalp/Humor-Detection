Romy, my border collie mix, is far from a bad dog. In fact, I hear the statement \"Good boy\" leave my lips a gazillion times a day, followed by a belly rub and a t-r-e-a-t (had to spell it out in fear he'd know what I was talking about.. Collies are smart that way). Although he listens and behaves much like a well mannered lad at home and even off his leash, it's quite surprising that walks with Romy are nothing short of a handful. Now I don't mind getting dirty, but I don't care much for getting dragged through the mud by a dog that can't contain his excitement when he sees a squirrel, a car passing by, or smells another dogs piss in the distance. This constant tug of war has been an ongoing issue, and yet I excused it due to his young age and that soon, with continued walks, he would settle. I'd begun to think I was mistaken. That is until I came to Bad Dog Frida.\n\nIt's kind of funny that a pet store could hold the answer for nixing my dog's behavior, but it's legit. We spoke with such a friendly, energetic and informed staff member. By the looks of other reviews, perhaps she was an owner. Anyhow, she suggested a few specialty leashes for the wandering dog. And she went into great detail about all of them. We ended up purchasing the Gentle Leader with the promise that we could return it no questions asked. That promise need not be fulfilled seeing as my pup has already taken to the leash and I have seen such a huge difference in his walking already. \n\nThere is so much more to Bad Dog Frida: treats, healthy food at competitive prices, toys, SMART toys, herbs, and even kitty cat essentials. They even strongly encourage you to bring your dog to shop along with you. So nice.
