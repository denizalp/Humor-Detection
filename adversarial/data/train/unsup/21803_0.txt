A-OK about says it all.  I can't say much else about this place.  Their food isn't bad, but the problem is that you've got a chain Mexican restaurant in the middle of Arizona.  Now, if I were back in Pennsylvania, I'd be like, \"Yay! I'm going to get some Mexican food at On the Border because it is slightly more Mexican than Chili's.\"  But I'm not.  So go to Los Dos Molinos, or Macayos, or Serranos, or Espos, or Elmer's, or Los Favoritos... Si Senor?  El Zocalo?  Filiberto's?  Nando's?  Seriously...
