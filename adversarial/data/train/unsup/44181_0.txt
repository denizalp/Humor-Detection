I would give this place an extra half star for the memorabilia if I could.\n\nThis place is classic old Italian.  It has a half barrel for a front door and no windows that I could see.  It is a little dark and all the walls are lined with classic photos of mid-century movie stars, movers and shakers, et cetera..\nI didn't know who everybody was but these walls are definitely preserving unique Vegas history.\n\nThe food is solid Italian with four prix fixed menus to choose from that all offer all you can drink wine, soup or salad, and a cappuccino to end your meal properly.  \n\nThe service was excellent and I thought the 20-30 dollar a person price with all that it included was a good value.
