Earlier this year I got a flier from Perfect Pool Service.  I decided to give him a try as my current Pool Service was letting me down.  The owner Freddy came over later that week to take a look at the Pool.  The price was good and he was very likable.  The weekly service was much better and more thorough that what I was getting from the other company.  \n   As I have only been in my home for just over a year it took some time to get the pool up to par.  It had not had the attention needed for some time.  Freddy quickly got it right and made suggestions to mage things even better.  When I did need additional items he explained the reason and gave me the best price possible.  \n   I had him do a drain and deep clean of my pool just prior to the summer starting.  Wow it looked so much better and Freddy and his team did a fantastic job.  His guys and well taught in the job and take the time to make sure the pool is safe for swimming.  I had a problem with my heater which is not within Freddy's expertise but her recommended a friend who did a great job getting the heater back online for a  great price.  \n   Trustworthily and reliable come to mind when I think about Perfect Pool.  When they are done I get a text with a pic of my pool.  That shows me they were there and what time they were at my home.  I just like the personal touch the Freddy brings to his business.  I highly recommend them if you are looking for Pool Service as they will meet your expectations!
