HORRID.\n\nMy best friend and I went on the 4th of July in order to partake in some flag-waving boot-scootin' good times. Instead, we got:\n\n-a 45 minute wait for a table\n-a Mom's Apple Cobbler in a plastic cup because the bartender left ice in the martini glass too long and it cracked. Mom's Apple Cobbler, incidentally, is white, creamy, and looks like a bodily fluid manufactured by the half of the population of which I am not a member. Thus, having it be served in a plastic cup made it look like I'd robbed a bank, and not the kind with money\n-water in plastic cups, NOT MASON JARS as advertised\n-a 30+ minute wait for food after ordering\n-soggy fish and chips with no chips\n-absent service\n-a clientele that summed up my impression of Las Vegas vacationers over the 4th of July: fat, white, and lethargic.\n\nI don't love this bar.
