I have been here for about a year and a half, and expect to renew my lease for another year when it comes due.  I have been very happy with Escape overall.  Management has always been super helpful, and maintenance requests are handled quickly.  I also love the location in Midtown--it is convenient and lots of things are in walking distance.  Right by the 51, so easy to get elsewhere in the Valley.\n\nMy one major complaint is due to the other residents, some of whom are disrespectful of the property.  They leave dog poop everywhere.  There are 3 dog comfort stations, including a little park with artificial grass.  All provide bags and waste disposal bins.  Yet people let their dogs poop all around the complex, and even leave poop a couple of feet away from the waste bins!   This is illegal, irresponsible, and unsanitary.  And the maintenance guys are the ones who have to clean it up, hardly fair to them.  When I walk my dog, I spend the time  telling him to \"leave it\" over and over so he isn't sticking his nose in other dogs' poop. Ugh.\n\nPresumably these same lazy and\/or disrespectful people are the ones who leave trash on the garage floor by the elevator.  How hard is it to take your Starbucks cup upstairs to dispose of it?\n\nThis is a resident problem, not a management problem, but I think it would help if management could install at least a few cameras here and there.   \n\nOtherwise, I highly recommend Escape.
