After all the hype, and an hour wait, I was not really impressed with the menu. I got a cheese omelet which was fine, but not crazy good. The side of toast was the best part-served with homemade jam-I would have been happier with just an order of that and coffee. Went here for the surrounding area which is known for art murals in this part of the city, so overall, was worth it.
