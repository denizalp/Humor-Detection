Resort Stay International, GeoHoliday Club and Starpoint Resort Group are all names of people who provided me with TERRIBLE service and treated me poorly. \n\nThey sold me on their package and then changed the rules and canceled my reservation. BAIT and Switch.  I am still waiting to see if my credit card will be refunded. Not happy at all with their service
