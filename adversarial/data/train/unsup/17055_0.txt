I will admit that I was an adult who decided that trampoline jumping was a good idea.  The lowest amount of time you can \"rent\" is one hour.  It costs ten dollars which is fine.  The problem is that as an adult, I lasted all of fifteen minutes before I was winded.  My problem was of course that I wasn't too keen on some of the hygeine of the children.  But if you want to bounce around and aren't afraid of germs, this place is cute.  It'd be better if there were some \"adult sippy cups\" available.  But then again, the teenage staff probably doesn't want to clean up any accidents from adults who over-indulged.  I made the mistake of trying to jump into the foam sea.  Not only was the jump pathetic (a testament to my poor athleticism, but I will say, it was probably not the best smelling activity in the place).  The trampoline dodge ball, great idea, I'm too much of a scaredy cat to try, as well as a big bouncy obstacle course.  If you do go, try not to feel bad as the kids bounce around and do flips.  Otherwise, you'll be too tempted to sit in the chairs that all the other grouchy adults are waiting in.
