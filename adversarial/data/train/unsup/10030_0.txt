We waited a whopping 1.5 hours four our freebie pizza.  I honestly didn't think it would take that long, but halfway through, we just decided to wait it out.  I'm not sure why the wait was so long either, maybe there are still some kinks to be worked out. \n\nWhen you enter, the line is on the left side.  Basically you order what you want, just like Chipotle.  Thy have many options to choose from.  I also like the fact they have gluten free and vegan gluten free crust for $2 more.  \n\nSo as you go down the line, you are offered choices of toppings, you can add as much as you want without being charged extra.  The one bad thing is that if you add so much, your pizza will be a stranger heavy and you have to roll it to eat it.\n\nThe crust here is very decent.  A thin crust pizza that I wish was a bit crispier.  Since this was freebie pizza day, I will give it a pass.  Hopefully, it'll be comparable to the pizza at Tanger Outlets.\n\nOverall, this is a much needed addition to this area.  Ambiance and decor was very nice.  Wishing you all the best, Fired Pie!
