Bad hosting. I was overlooked for a table of 2 multiple times while waiting. Short white girl with blonde hair was the host(sorry I didnt have a chance to get her name). Bad experience overall and it sucks because the food is usually very good and I was looking forward to dining in today. Hoping my next trip in doesn't go like this
