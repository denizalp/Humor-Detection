Today is my birthday and we came here for my birthday dinner... and I wish we didn't. You guys know I rarely give less then stellar reviews, ever, because I hate doing it.\n\nBefore my birthday dinner, I called early to confirm and to ask if the 4 of us could be seated near the patio, because we're having a celebration, and that would be lovely. The gal on the phone got oddly feisty with me, cut me off, and told me they make no guarantees about seating with reservations. That's fine, but it was so awkward, I had to cut her off in return and instinctively said, \"I'm sorry, I was just asking, it's not a big deal, i'm sorry.\"\n\nWhen we arrived, it didn't improve. Our server seemed very unhappy to be with us, and was so low energy it was uncomfortable. This was our first time for dinner, and he didn't walk us through anything, and wanted to immediately take our order. I don't expect to be babied, but maybe i'm unusual (?) because i'm not a person who can see \"NJ Oysters\" \"Capital Oysters\" etc, and know what they're like with no description. We had to keep prying for answers to questions regarding pricing and flavors for various menu items, even beyond oysters. Awkward.\n\nI did enjoy my Lobster Roll. When we were served dinner, my brother ordered a beer. It took so long to come, that by the time it arrived, all 3 of us were done with our meals (he wanted his beer with dinner). We also asked for a few other things that never came. As I type this, I also received the \"naughty\" e-mail from the reservation system saying they marked me as a no-show, and asking \"What happened?\"\n\nOverall, the food is good if you're in the area and would like seafood. I recommend Alley Cat if you're coming with friends for apps and can put up with the experience, but I do not recommend it for any type of celebration or client entertaining because you will leave feeling sad like me, and with a HUGE bill. :( Many sad faces for this birthday girl.
