I only came here for drinks and was delighted with the range of beers on Tap and in bottles!  It's like a Bier Markt, but cheaper and less pretentious!  We had friendly and attentive service, and enjoyed our seat in the patio!  Inside looked nice too when we went in to use the washrooms - very pub-y and cozy.  Would definitely come back!
