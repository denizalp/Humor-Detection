If your a vegetarian there is only one dish on the menu. The . My wife asked about that dish and our waiter copped an attitude when asked about the #5(  Chile Relleno & Green (only) Tamale) and #6(Red or Green Chile Burro & Cheese Enchilada)  items on the menu. The #5 dish had no meat which constitutes a vegetarian dish. \nI had the Slow Roasted Carnitas. The waiter asked me if I wanted flour or corn  tort i l l a s. I asked for corn and was never given them. \nI have never experienced such a lack of customer service from a waiter in my dining at any restaurant. I wish I had his name so I could tell someone about our experience. \nThe food was good but I seriously doubt I would come back to this restaurant.
