PRAISE BE TO \"BOB\" AND THE GODS OF GOOD PLACES, THE EUCLID TAVERN HAS RISEN AGAIN!!\n\nHow long has it been since I've been here you ask...?\nI HAD A FLIP PHONE, THAT'S HOW LONG!\n\nThe old class of the Euc has been updated; new, intimate stage, combined with a very nice and well-stocked bar and ON TOP OF THAT, amazing dogs and tots with a million toppings via the powers of..THE HAPPY DOG!! \n\nOne of the only difficulties is the lack of parking, but via street, nearby lots, etc.,  you can find a place and enjoy the same ambiance you would on the other side of town...ONLY NOW IT'S HERE ON THE EAST SIDE TOO! \n\nMe, I'm a happy dog to see the Happy Dog at Euclid Tavern's doors open again:)
