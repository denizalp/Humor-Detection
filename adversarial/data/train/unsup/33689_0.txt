I'd definitely like to add more info to discourage anyone to rent here. My daughters friend is still there and recently went into the office to ask Darlene some questions, well she was yelled at called names and humiliated in front of other people in the office. I also just saw on my Facebook account that I was messaged by a complete stranger that had an awful situation at cornerstone ranch apartments please don't rent here! 0 stars, I had to give it one to post a review
