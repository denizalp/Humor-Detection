im SUPER critical of pizza spots so when i give them a good rating take it as a sign of something good. I had tried Godmothers on a desperate wimb of needing some marinara sauce one night. so i called and asked just for sauce in a container, and when i got it home i was happily surprised! it tasted like authentic pizza sauce, the pizza that makes me homesick for NYC, the pizza that you can cuddle with your nonna while eating. Grandmas sauce to the max! I then got an idea to try their other food, and their cheesesteaks did not disappoint. You get a huge sandwich for your money, stuffed with meat, cheese and whatever other toppings you want. The staff are always polite and helpful on the phone, even better when you pick it up in person. I'm so excited that i live down the street because now i know where to go when I need a true taste of Italy. Their pizza crust is perfect, not too much cheese, perfect balance of sauce and crust, crunchy bottom, not soggy. Its a 8\/10 for me!
