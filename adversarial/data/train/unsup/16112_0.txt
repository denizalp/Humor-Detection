One word to describe my experience, disappointment. From the moment my twin sister and I walked in, we were expecting a way better layout. \n\nAs we walk around to mingle we noticed that the crowd here is less than mediocre. We are used to hanging out at Rehab where every person can be a model or probably is a model. \n\nWe came to the conclusion that Wet Republic is the pool party for the Rehab rejects. \n\nOh, and if you like drugs, there are plenty of people on them here. EEwwww. We won't be back.
