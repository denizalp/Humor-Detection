Food is sub-par, the service is a fucking joke, and the place is not merely \"dingy\" (as though that's somehow endearing), but totally unclean. Do not bother unless you want to hang out in a dive with sticky tables and listen to shit music for 20 minutes while you wait for an unintelligible old man to hand you your \"burrito\". Oh, and since when do \"burritos\" come with something resembling Caesar dressing mixed with Miracle Whip and sugar water all over them? The beef \"satay\" (ordered spicy) was bland and gross, and my girlfriend's chicken (ordered medium) was passable but somehow spicier than mine.\n\nIf you're in a rush and for some fucked-up reason you need to eat on that block, Subway (the shitty chain restaurant) is next door. It's faster and costs about the same and your shirt probably won't stick to the table. (And nobody on Yelp will have falsely led you to believe that you're about to eat a decent meal.) Also, Subway (the chain shithole, not the garbage burrito dive) accepts debit and credit cards.
