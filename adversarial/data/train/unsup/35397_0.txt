Pleasantly shocked at the good service and food at this location after reading previous negative reviews. The menu is fun and has a good variety of food.and beverages. We enjoyed our specialty lattes of frosty mint and smores. The ham, spinach, and cheddar scrambled eggs were satisfying paired with roasted potatoes and fruit. All the dishes were a large portion. The highlight the meal was without a doubt the French toasted which may be the BEST French toast we have ever had. Service was fast and friendly. They were very attentive at making sure we had what we needed and were enjoying our meal.
