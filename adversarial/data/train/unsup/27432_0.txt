Authentic Mexican food located in a very oddly placed  area underneath a grocery store. You have to drive into the parking lot, with the location on the corner of the buildings bottom floor. \n\nIf you don't find it, keep looking! It's worth the treasure hunt, as the food is very good. The Carnitas is delicious, and you can get it two ways... With all the trimmings (aka ears and other assorted pieces of unnamed pork) or just the meat. It comes with Nopales (cactus) which pairs well with the food.
