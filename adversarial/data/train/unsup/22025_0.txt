Completely overpriced and so disappointing!!\n\nI tried their veggie burger for the first and last time yesterday. I would definitely not go here again. I paid $8.50 (with tax)  just for the veggie burger alone. Pretty astronomical price for a fast food joint, especially considering other better tasting veggie burgers (e.g. Hero Burger) are $2 less. The bun was fresh but doughy and the biggest part of the burger. The patty was salty and extremely thin (think of an iPhone and then halve it). The toppings very ho-hum (your basic lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, pickles, relish, ketchup and mustard). Really disappointed that for this price that they don't offer anything beyond these very standard toppings.    \n\nI  didn't like the fact that they don't put the toppings on in front of you so that you can personalize it (e.g. more\/less of some toppings).  When you order, there is a list of about 7 very standard toppings on a  card beside the cash and you let them know  if you want all or some of the toppings. Then you can't see as they're making it and they hand the finished product to you. My burger had way too much lettuce (a huge thick piece) and almost no ketchup or mustard. \n\nWithout a doubt one of the worst and most overpriced veggie burgers I've ever had. They seem to have spent all their money on making the place look flashy rather than the food. No surprise that I was initially the only one in there. Save your money and head to Hero Burger.
