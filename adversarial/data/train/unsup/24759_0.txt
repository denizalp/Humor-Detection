I really want to give this place a mercy 3-star review, but honestly the 2-star \"Meh. I've experienced better\" phrase matches my sentiments too perfectly to round up.\n\nI just didn't much enjoy my visit to Salty Senorita. The food was okay (about 2.5 stars), and the service was alright (another 2.5), but the atmosphere is one of...frat boy party palace (1.5 stars). I don't know; it just seemed like it was all set up for a raging party...only nobody came. And that made me feel bad for them...and lame for being there, like I chose the wrong party to go to that night.\n\nI guess if the food was outstanding I could put up with the \"get ready for a pAAAAArrrtttyyyy!!! ...uh, or not\" ambiance. I'd sit there smugly enjoying my meal like I knew something the rest of the world didn't. Only, the food isn't outstanding. It's really not THAT bad either. It just didn't have...how do I say this? It had no kick. No pizazz! I've mentally blocked most of the experience out, so I just have faint images of bland meats and cheesy sauces. I'm actually trying to block out those memories too. I can't imagine a scenario where I'd willingly return.
