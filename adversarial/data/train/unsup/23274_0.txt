Wow, what terrible terrible terrible- did I say terrible customer service. Went there to look at a duvet, found one on a shelf that said $39.99, when I went to the cashier the duvet scanned at $79.99.. I stated that it was the wrong price, the cashier and I walked over and she started to explain how the skews work.. I told her it was not my problem that the duvet was in the wrong area, isn't that why they have staff?  As I was talking to the cashier two co-worker came up and started in on me.. On the way back to the till, the cashier found the Assistant Manager, the manager and I went to the duvet section and she flat out said to me that she would not honour the $39.99 price.. I stated I would even pay $54.99.. She flat out said NO... I then asked her name and she stated she was the \"Assistant Manager\" No name was given... The funny thing- she put the duvet back where I had originally found it.. So what is she going to tell the next customer that she isn't honouring that price because it was in the wrong area?  I will NEVER shop at this Walmart again!
