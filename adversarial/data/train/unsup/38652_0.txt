Get while they Fresh!  If you like Hawaiian Poke, then you'll like this place.  It's in the back corner of Island Grill and Sushi.  First of the people, you'll they promote that local atmosphere.  I'm not originally from the Islands but they make wish I was.  Fun and friendly!  Now the poke...so fresh and tasty.  My favorite is shoyu with either ahi and salmon.  I can eat that every day.  If you like poi, come on thursdays and have that craving fulfilled here.  Only negative is they do sell out in the evening (which is good because that means tomorrows stock is FRESH.)  If you like poke, you can't pass this place up.
