5 stars as every time I come here, no matter what shift is working, the Employees are always friendly and smiling. The store and restrooms are clean. They have a few different brews of coffee available and good snack selection. \nThe employees will actually help you look for items if you can't find something. Holy Cow!!! The managers are friendly and helpful as well. \nThis place is packed on the weekends with all the CA traffic coming and leaving Vegas. It can be a bit congested at times, but hey, CA folks are used to it. \nDuring the weekdays and most evenings it's easy to get in n out quickly. \nThe parking area and gas pump area is well lit and always looks safe at night. They have a car wash too!
