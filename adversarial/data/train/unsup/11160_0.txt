Dropped by for lunch with a friend.  I love the vibe an decor here....it's very modern and chic.  I ordered a Triple Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Provolone, American, and Cheddar Cheese on Griddled Texas Toast, $7.95 & Tomatoes, $.95).  It comes with a complimentary side of Caesar Salad....bonus!\n\nThe Grilled Cheese Sandwich was awesome!  The thick Texas Toast was griddled perfectly....not too burnt, but not too soft....and the combination of Cheeses was just right.....the Tomato provided a nice, juicy & sweet flavor to the Sammie!  Next time, I'll also add Avocado to the Sammie for $.95 more.\n\nOur server was great too.....patient with us as we talked and browsed the menu.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
