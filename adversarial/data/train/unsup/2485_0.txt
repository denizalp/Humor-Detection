I will always prefer a bookstore to an EBook.\n\nI saddens me to see  the loss of bookstores everywhere.  However,  I'm glad to see a few bookstores still standing, and Barnes and Nobel is one of my favorites.\n\nBarnes and Noble has everything I enjoy about bookstores, great selections, friendly and helpful staff, Starbucks with comfortable couches & chairs.  There is just something I find peaceful and relaxing about being able to read a book sitting on a chair in the middle of a quiet aisle drinking a caramel macchiato . I guess that's why I will ways prefer a bookstore over Ebooks.
