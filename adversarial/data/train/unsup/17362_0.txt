There's a new restaurant with a celebrity chef  at the M Casino\/Hotel. Reservations a must for the time being. However none are needed at the back bar, which I actually prefer as you can watch the Executive Chef Seonkyoung Longest, winner of Food Network's Restaurant Express, do her magic. I hear she comes out to chat with the guests at the end of the night, a nice touch as it can make for a memorable evening. \n\nThe eye catching hosts are newer and had trouble with seating. The front end managers are pro's, resolved our \"mixup\" quickly with a smile. The food is \"pretty\" and on par with any fusion eateries in Los Angeles, birth place of food mashups. I recommend the Korean Street Tacos, Samgyeopsal lettuce Wraps, Ahi Poke, and Jayde Roll. \n\nI'd stick with the appetizers and sushi as the majority of the main dishes are family style. The large portions easily serves 4 to 6 people, which is strange as most of their seating are for couples. The Kikkoman factory soy sauce bottles, rice bowls that serve as soy sauce plates, and cheap fast food chop sticks seem out of place for a fine dining restaurant. \n\nI would love to see tasting plates, samplers of all the fantastic creations. The server could even explain the food a bit. If you're going to have the winner of Restaurant Express, I figure you'd want to experience everything (much like the judges do). \n\nThe new eatery is definitely worth a try, despite having a few things to work out. At the end TV celebrity chefs are just really cool.  \n\nThumbs up, but as always, let me know what you think~
