I am travelling from out of state and requested a single contacts lens as backup as I am down to my last contact lens.  They said they couldn't help me even if they wanted because my RX from California is expired.  Granted I need to update the RX although I can see fine with the lens I have which are the RX I asked him to fill.  I said I was just looking for one Lens (each eye) until I can get an eye exam.  He said sorry can't help you.  I posed the hypothetical question of what they would do if someone came in and had lost a lens and couldn't get home because of it and would get hurt (even die) without a single lens.  He said oh well that just how it is I can't help you, even if it meant death.  I asked him where his ethics were and he said he still could not help me and Visioncare couldn't help regardless of whether it meant someone would die.  I guess I have a choice of paying high exam fees \"today\" or get no help regardless of health situation.
