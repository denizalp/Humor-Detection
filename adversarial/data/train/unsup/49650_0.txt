Spent 110 dollars on a pair of jeans that are supposedly \"madewell\" youd think!! Nope they ripped in the butt 4 months after having them. Store refused a refund or even a new pair. Best they could offer was 20% off a new pair. Not spending 90 dollars on another pair to have them rip again thanks though!!
