Honestly, I had no idea this store was here. We found it by accident when my family was in town. I saw their awesome reviews and we decided to pop by to check it out. \n\nPros: \n* FF Team: Friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming employees \n* Yelp Check-IN Offer: 4 free targets\n* Well stocked: Impressive selection of custom\/higher-end rifles & handguns \n* Competitive pricing \n\nCons: \nN\/A \n\nWe didn't purchase anything during this visit. However, we will be back to explore their extensive inventory. This store is great for shooting enthusiasts and worth a stop. \n\nReview 2 for 2017
