Linda is the best! My daughters boyfriend.... being a typical male tried to get her a corsage for homecoming at the last minute. I called Linda up on Saturday around 4:15pm...they close at 5:00pm and it's Homecoming night! She saved the day!!!! She made the most gorgeous corsage for my daughter. Thumbs up!! Best florist in town!
