I got the Green Garden Quinoa Bowl and it is a large portion!  The veggies tasted so fresh and the pesto is delicious!  Our waitress was very friendly and when my friend asked for coffee to go, even though they didn't have to go coffee cups she went out of her way to find something to put it in!  The atmosphere was also great-easy going and nice for a casual bite to eat.  Although I didn't have any drinks, they sounded awesome-on par with current creative trends and they had a good craft beer selection as well.  Next time!
