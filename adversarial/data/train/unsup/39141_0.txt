Well l needed some more glide to prevent heat rash when running. So I stopped in here. Found some cool new running socks, hope they prevent blisters. My son bought a BB Gun. Sports authority overall is high priced to me, especially clothing. I checked in but forgot to use my 10.00 offer and now I am bummed. Oh well. Nice employees and helpful.
