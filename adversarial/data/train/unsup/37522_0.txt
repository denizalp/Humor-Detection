I had used Accurate Garage Door over seven years ago to fix a broken garage door spring. This past Saturday, while trying to program my pin pad, all of our codes for every remote, car, etc. got accidentally wiped out and wouldn't re-program. I called Accurate in a panic and the gentleman who answered the phone was so awesome!! He walked me through exactly what to do to get everything reprogrammed. AND, if that wasn't amazing enough, when I overheated the garage door motor and had to call back, this same employee explained what was happening and what I needed to do next. What AMAZING customer service!! We will only use Accurate for all our garage door needs!!
