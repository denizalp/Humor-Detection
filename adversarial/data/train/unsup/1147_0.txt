Walk in and 2 seconds later the \"lady\" at her front says rudely \"Can I help you?\" I say \"Can I get a drink?\" She says \"You have to bring a guy in.\" Who the hell makes that rule?? Who said I won't buy my own dance?? APPARENTLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DICK TO GET IN THIS \"BAR\" PEOPLE! Wtf. Shitty place anyway. 0 our of 100 stars. Rude.
