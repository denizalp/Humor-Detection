It smells so much better than it tastes!\n\nI still love how nearly every server is Chinese and their English is not so great. That gives it high marks in the authenticity column.  But then, the mix of dishes they have (hence the Asia in the name, as opposed to China), make it so that they do a lot of things decently, but seemingly none of them super well.  (You know, jack of all trades, master of none, kinda thing).  \n\nBeing a white girl (and a pale, blonde white girl at that), I feel I have to hyperbolically express how spicy I would like dishes at Asian restaurants, so that they're the normal spice of Asian restaurants. I asked our server if the Ma Po Tofu (very authentic dish I love) is spicy.  She said she didn't know as she doesn't like spicy dishes. It was not spicy, it lacked the Ma La the it should have, and it was fairly bland. Disappointed. The only 'spicy sauce they have if you ask for any is chili oil. \n\nI'm hoping that Jim G no longer wants to curb his late-night cravings here, as it's just not nearly as good as it smells (but it smells delicious!!!)
