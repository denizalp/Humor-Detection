So they have a drink menu on an ipad.  Big freaking deal.  I found Lola to be way overpriced for the quality of food received.  Basically, you are paying high prices to say you ate at a celebrity chef's restaurant.  I'd prefer to pay to eat delicious food.  That did not happen at Lola.\n\nItems:\n\nBread that comes to the table is very blah.  If it's not great bread, I'd prefer no bread at all.  Why take the hit for carbs and waste valuable stomach space on bland bread?\n\nCocktails - good cocktails.  They were $10-12, but I think worth the price.  However, don't order one just to use the ipad menu.  The ipad menu is stupid.  You can play with my ipad for 2 minutes and I'll only charge you $5.\n\nPork belly appetizer - pork belly is always delicious, and the pork rinds on top with hot-wing type sauce were a great compliment, as were the celery greens with blue cheese dressing.  This was my dinner, and I'm glad I chose it.  The portion of pork belly is very generous and it is easily a dinner if you also order an appetizer or dessert.\n\nDuck fries - WAY better duck fries in Cleveland at Bar Cento.\n\nScallops - just fine, but good lord, for just fine I could pay half the price!\n\nShort rib - average.  See scallops review above.\n\nDesserts - good!  The maple bacon ice cream is the standout.  But - be forewarned - we split this dessert among three people, and each got 1 and 1\/2 very small bites of ice cream.  It's a mini scoop - I estimate 1\/3 or 1\/4 the size of a scoop you'd get on an ice cream cone.  I wish I could get away with charging $6 for 5 bites of ice cream!  I guess if I had a show on Food Network I could.\n\nAll in all, I would say Lola was not worth the time or money.\n\nThis is only my second experience dining at a restaurant owned by a Food Network star, but it may be my last.  These guys\/ladies don't have time to put into their own restaurants - they're very busy with TV shows, appearances, etc.  I think they're a money trap.  My two cases in point are Lola and Mario Batali's Lupo in NYC, which wasn't just average - it was downright disgusting.\n\nIf you're into food tv, skip the celebrity restaurants and go to some of the places they mentioned back in the day on DDD or Best Thing I Ever Ate - before they started running out of awesome places and are just looking to fill a few days in a city.  My favorite place in Cleveland was Lucky's Diner.  LOVED IT!
