i was at HHM, wayne was my therapist & i returned for a massage and wayne was no longer there, and Amber the manager proceeded to say rude nasty things about my therapist when i never once asked why he was not there anymore . and blatantly told me i could leave and never come back if i didnt like the way she was talking and managing. i worry for peoples privacy and reputation with the damaging words that came out of this managers mouth. \ni will not be returning to HHM so long as this Manager is managing this office. You might want to re think who you leave your office in the hands of. i would have given it 0 stars but it wouldnt let me !
