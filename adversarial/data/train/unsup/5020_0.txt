Wonderful staff, amazzzzzing food, and great little Italian restaurant.  This is my favorite spot in Charlotte for pizza and Italian food.  I love the staff, very little turnover. Enjoyable experience with great food timing so you never feel rushed.  Pizza is hands down the best in Charlotte.  This is the only location I got to even though I live closer to another Portofino's.  This is the best!  Highly recommended for a date night or family dinner.
