i got a deal from living social or groupon, i forgot which one it was.  anyways, don't pay full price for the high roller.  you can always find deals or coupons online.  \n\ni went around midnight, and keep in mind they close at 2am.\nthe line was not long at midnight, on a Saturday, but then again, i suppose everyone else is in the club getting turnt and going home with strangers.  lol \n\nthe ride lasts around 30 mins, and the top of the peak sits at 550 ft?  it provides a nice view, but not the complete vegas strip. \n\nthey also have an upgrade, if you want to get your drink on... i know some of the cabins have an open bar and its aycd for roughly 30 mins.  i was scared to go on, because one has to wonder, if someone pukes inside, then you're stuck with the smell and might puke yourself.  haha.  honestly though, it might not be a bad idea to get access to the open bar and then after you finish, take a taxi to a nearby club and get the buzz going inside the club and not have to pay 20 bucks for a drink.  \n\ni'd recommend going on this, but once is enought.
