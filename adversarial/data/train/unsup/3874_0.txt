The trend continues.\nI know that my last review for this place is also a 3* however this one is a not so shiny 3*. \n\nHere are they key reasons why:\nPrice increase with a inverse correlation to portion. (fancy UNLV talk for more money and less food)\nThe mix and match is now $11.99\nThe bread is now $1.99\nMat-o-khir is now $1.99 (albeit you get 1\/2 a round of bread with it)\n\nFrequent eater punch card:\nThey changed it from meals to visits. In addition I told them that I forgot the card once or twice and they gave me a new one. The cards totaled more than enough for a free meal however, they did not honor it. \n\nThis place has been my default Kebob place in Vegas for nearly 5 years but I am slowly falling out of love with it as I no longer feel that it is a great value that it once was. I may have to search the valley for another spot to get my Kabob fix at. \n\nStill a fan of the food but don't like the direction that this place is going...
