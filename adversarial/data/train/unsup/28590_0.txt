I was visiting on business, and a  work colleague took me here (their favorite restaurant); it's located in an upscale outdoor retail and residence complex, Scottsdale Fashion Square, so on the plus side, they're situated in a good, vibrant location - suitable for people-watching! \n\nIt's a newer, larger-size restaurant, and kind of reminded me of something one might find here in the Bay Area - high ceilings, large open-air windows, well-dressed (yet casual) people, large bar, patio, animated conversations, etc. I liked the ambience - it wasn't too crowded, yet not deserted, either!\n\nThere was actually no wait, we were seated outdoors, and our server promptly took our drink order and also, served up some bread.\n\nI opted for the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad - ($15)\nMizuna Greens, Fresh Avocado, Mushrooms, Soy Caramel\n\n...extra avocado, of course!\n\nThe food was good, and my salad tasted really fresh - even the  tuna. I was not disappointed at all. \n\n...however, what I *was* disappointed in was the service. The food came out slowly, and after it was delivered, the server disappeared, and it was quite the effort for us to flag her down for drinks, etc. We were in a slight hurry, yet it was difficult to try to catch her for the bill.\n\nAfter we finished eating, it was a good 20-minute wait before we took off. Had it not been for this point, I prob would've given this place four stars!
