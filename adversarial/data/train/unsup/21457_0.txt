I was here two times for charity events and the property is pretty and the service was hit and miss. I am only reviewing the ballrooms, pool area, and event staff not the hotel or casino. (although the casino looks nice for Az standards) We had some issues with dinner service at a sit down dinner I recently attended but that might be a fluke. The pool area is very pretty.  Probably four stars if the dinner service did not mess up and the food was not that great. It is a beautiful property.
