Whether you're hiking, biking, running, or walking, you can find what you need at REI.  This location is more convenient for me to get to since I work in Henderson.  I can shop on my lunch hour with no problems.  I've been here more recently because I've been taking advantage of the free ship-to-store for online orders that I've made.  I love the fact that REI offers this option for its customers, secure in the knowledge that someone else isn't swiping your hiking shoes off your doorstep and taking off for the trails in your new kicks.  Another advantage of being an REI customer is the annual dividend check that you receive, your share of the co-op's annual profit.  The refund check arrives in March and is typically 10% back on purchases.  My dividend this year was about $47 so I promptly used it toward a pair of new hiking boots-score!  Check out REI Garage on line for more deals on items, too.  I found my new boots on there, used my dividend check, plus got another 20% off with an online coupon, so I really got a deal.  As you can probably tell, I love REI: they take care of their customers and offer a lot to help you opt outside.
