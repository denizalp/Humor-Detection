This rating is based on service and accountability.  And you can tell it's pretty bad.  Continue reading if you dare.\n\nMy main man (well my only man) needed some new running sneakers. Okay let me say 80% of the store has women's shoes and 20% is for men so there isn't a lot to choose from. I picked out two different brands because I am a woman and my style is marginally better than a man's.  First brand no incidences. The brand was Sauciny(???) whatever.  The next was ASCICS (???) spelling? Anyway I very innocently pulled out a box and HOLY TOLEDO! The edges are serrated.  I cut my finger and was bleeding everywhere. Quick dash to the ladies and trying to figure out how bad my wound was. Believe it or not-I LIVED! But it was bleeding profusely on a horror movie scale of blood loss 1-10, I was at a 4.  Which for a cut from a cardboard box is pretty major. We aren't buying that brand!  \n\nStand in line and get up to the cash register and I tell the two lovely ladies working that I am injured and cut myself on a box. And they laughed and told me about how they cut themselves all the time. (Suggestion-wear gloves when you stock if this a KNOWN issue.). I know DSW doesn't make the boxes but maybe they can give a heads up to the brands? And instead of telling me about your injuries ask me if I want to file an incident report or ask me if I need a bandaid?? Employees clearly saw me with a giant wad of toilet paper on my finger. No one assisted. Not a single one.\n\nThis was Sunday night at 5pm.  It's Tuesday I am still wearing a bandaid and do not have use of my finger tip- the pointer on my dominant hand.\n\nNot happy with the service at all!!!
