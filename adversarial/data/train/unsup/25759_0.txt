I bought my wedding dress here and the experience was amazing. My stylist worked so hard to find \"the dress,\" including not listening to a word I said about what I wanted (thank god), because I was clearly not the expert. Before I tried on 'the dress,\" I was horrified she brought it to me. Boy was I wrong.
