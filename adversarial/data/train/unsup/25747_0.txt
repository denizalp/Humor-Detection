Such a friendly place! The building is beautiful and the Lobby is very inviting. Would recommend them to everyone!\n\nJust wanted to mention that Dr. Popat put my nephews braces on himself and will be doing all of the care along this process. He's Harvard trained and right in our little central Phoenix corridor. How lucky are we to have him. \n\nWhen I had braces done my parents sought out the best orthodontist in the valley to make sure my sisters and I had perfect smiles. But I still only had assistants doing my adjustments. My teeth turned out great but I never really thought about it until I was at Dr. Popats and realized how involved he is in each patients care. \n\nI also love to support locally owned business and Popat orthodontics represents that to a T. It truly is a family run business. \n\nI wouldn't recommend anyone else. Take it upon yourself to give them a shot. I can absolutely promise you won't find anyone better.
