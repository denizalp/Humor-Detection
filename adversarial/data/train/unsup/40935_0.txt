I have nothing but great things to say about Heaven Scent Mobile Dog Grooming and it's Owner\/Groomer, Joanne.  I have a small 7-month old Morkie puppy that I am very reluctant to take to a traditional groomer so I thought I would give a mobile grooming service a try.  I have nothing against a brick-and-mortar groomer as I know some are excellent but I personally do not like dropping my puppy off in the morning and picking him up 4-5 hours later.  With Joanne, she drives up with her full-service \"spa-on-wheels\" and your dog is groomed right outside your front door!  She has groomed my puppy twice and each time he looks beautiful and smells wonderful!  Grooming a puppy is not easy but she definitely has the patience and experience to handle it.  You can truly see that she loves dogs and loves what she does.  Your precious baby will be in good hands with Joanne.  I do not hesitate recommending her to anyone!
