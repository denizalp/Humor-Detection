Again, great service - very friendly & easy to talk to, quality work, timely, and informative - all that good stuff.\n\nSo no joke... between the time I got the chip repaired and now, I got another chip from a rock, this time on Chandler Blvd of all places... and on our drive back from Vegas it was raining pretty hard and well... whoever installed the windshield last time clearly didn't seal it properly because i had drips of water running down the INSIDE of my windshield into my truck... UH? WTH?\n\nSo I hit the forum again and pinged Bryan and Jen - told them what was up - and that this time I needed a whole new glass and that I had full glass coverage with zero deductible thing...  \n\nJenn called my insurance company, got me on the 3-way and I did my info w\/ them and they gave her some industry number to get paid thing... and we scheduled the new glass for a few days out when I had some time.\n\nThis morning they showed up on time, showed em the stuff and without having to pull my truck out of my garage Bryan did the whole shebang in there, in the shade :)\n\nHe also pointed out the difference in the OEM molding they use versus the crap they pulled off my truck that the last guy used, and showed me why my old one was leaking - pretty easy to see why it leaked fyi... So the OEM molding is better and has a built in rain-channel which the old one didn't have and blah blah good stuff.\n\nAdded bonus - they pre-tinted the strip on the top of the windshield... WOOT!  Had that on my last car and loooved it - they added it on for me with no hassle :)  WIN!\n\nI'll be using them as long as I can - no issues here.\nNew blog post with new windshield pics up now:  http:\/\/post.ly\/j5pL\n\nAnd to the other guy (Louis F), with only one review... they did a pretty darn good job on my stuff... twice... just saying... *shrug*
