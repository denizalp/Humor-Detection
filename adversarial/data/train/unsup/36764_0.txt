Heading into Cleveland for the first time, we stopped at Grove City, Pennsylvania, and a guy working at one of the shops told us about Barrio. \n\nAs Canadians who love Mexican food, naturally we said hell yeah we're going to check it out.\n\nNot a single regret.\n\nPersonally, I like how this restaurant focuses on taco's only, allowing you to either get what they offer to put together or building your own custom taco.\n\nI can't remember now what I had, but I can remember the happiness in each bite. If I come back to Cleveland again, you bet I'm coming back to Barrio.
