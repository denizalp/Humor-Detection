Just not good.\n\nThis was my first time dining at Li's Bowl.  My lunch companion and I selected the Chicken Fried Rice, Eggdrop, and Wonton Soup.\n\nMy lunch companion said the egg drop soup was okay.  However, the won ton soup and Chicken fried rice was very bland and very greasy, yes even the soup was greasy. \n\nOverall just not good food. I'd like to end on a positive note. The service was outstanding. The staff is friendly and inviting and will explain everything on their menu.  The prices and serving portions can't be beat.  I just wish the food was a better quality.
