never have i ever had such a bad experience at a starbucks as i have at this one. i was a partner at starbucks for 5 years. i expect the same values and customer service from every location as i gave in the time i was with the company. \nsadly that is not the case with this location. \ni live right up the street and my wife and i still enjoy grabbing a venti iced coffee with 2 pumps white mocha and a little bit of soy creamer. it never fails when we show up at this location, that my drink is completley wrong. to top it off the partners there dont seem to care. it makes me sad that this is the case. i would not ever reccomend going to this location. its just another 2 minite drive north to farm and durango to get a better experience.
