When one in our party suggested we share, I think my reaction could only be described as a guffaw.  Seriously?  You want me to share this deliciousness with someone and NOT have it all for myself?  Please.  \n\nI had the toffee banoffee.  Banoffee is one of my favorite desserts from the UK, in line behind a good sticky toffee pudding.  I was not disappointed.  I was fending off even sideways glances at my sundae.  And there may have been low growling sounds, but I won't confirm or deny that they were coming from me.  \n\nThe ice cream was creamy and genuinely flavorful from the first spoonful to the last.  The toppings were generous and equally fresh and flavorful.  The bananas, miraculously, were a perfect level of ripeness - not a spot of brown to be seen.  I was a little sad when my spoon started scraping the bottom of the cup.\n\nThe shop has a fresh and bright vibe, and the counter staff were very helpful (offering taste samples) and super friendly.  Yes, it's more pricy than, say, a trip to the local DQ, but it's totally worth it.
