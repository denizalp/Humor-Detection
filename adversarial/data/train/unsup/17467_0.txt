I love my therapist. She's great, she's intelligent, she's helpful, she's insightful, she's just outright a wonderful assistant in my road to mental health. If you're using this place, do see Dr. Carol.\n\nHOWEVER: The Psych.\n\nDr. Leslie. No. Just NO! NO NO NO! I went in for a mild depression and needing a little help stabilizing. Dr. Carol wanted me on a mild mood stabilizer and a sleeping pill. When I went in to see Leslie, her tits were hanging out of her shirt damned near (not that I really minded that part) and after having a bit of a fit (the waiting room is THAT awful, there is one unisex bathroom and always a line of twitchy, irritated people waiting to use it because their doctors arent on time... again....) she tries to START my treatment on 4 Xanax and 775mg of Depakote a day. I'm not a psych, but I DO know that such a treatment is something you GRADUALLY BUILD TO, not START OFF with. Geez, lady, I DO have to function. I cant afford to sleep for three months because you didnt like the fact that I got pissed about the waiting room.\n\nMy husband and I were so scared of the prescription that we left it with the nurses up front. \n\nThey say the mark of a good doctor is not how many patients he can put on meds, but how many he can get off again. OBVIOUSLY Dr. Leslie has never heard of this concept.\n\nEven for as helpful as Dr. Carol has been, I'm seriously considering getting away from this place in case that crazy psych tries to deem me mentally unfit somehow and gets me carted off. What kind of crazy person is she? The way I see it, Dr. Leslie does more damage to the world by over medicating people than I ever could by simply being crabby and irritable.
