Off Da Hook Soul Food is a solid 3 to 3.5 stars but I will upgrade them to 4 stars based on the exceptional service we received. Don't judge a book by it's cover.  The same thing holds true for places to eat and that includes this place.  They are a very small \"hole in the wall\" kind of dinner.  If you blink twice while driving past them you may miss them.  They are a nice alternative to the usual dinner's in Phoenix. \n\nThey offer some of the basic Soul Food options with almost everything fried of course ~ pork chops, catfish, chicken.  No oxtail, rabbit, ham hocks or chitlins though.  Not that I order chitlins but it's hard to beat good rabbit and ham hocks when dinning at a Soul food place!  They offer some of the more popular Soul food types of sides such as collard greens, mac-n-cheese, yams, beans & rice, cabbage, and some others.  However they don't offer fried or cooked okra or turnips, which are Soul food staples.  Corn bread comes with your meal and they offer Kool Aide in addition to soda and tea.\n\nI had the fried Pork Chops with sides of mac-n-cheese and red beads in rice.  The breading on the Pork Chop was DELISH! It had a lot of crunch, with an excellent balance of seasoning that was \"finger licking good\".  The sides were ok, nothing special but good.  I wanted their Collard Greens, but they weren't ready which was unfortunate ~ maybe next time. \n\nWe also had their fried chicken and waffles.  WOWsers!  The fried chicken had the same or similar breading as did the Pork Chop.  The chicken was fried to almost  perfection and their Waffle had an great taste that wasn't too heavy and complimented the fried chicken very well.  Look out LoLo's!!  This place is just as good if not better!
