For all my stationery fanatics, Muji is one of the best cards and stationery store there is in Toronto. With cheap prices and a variety of notebooks, pens, pencils, and other supplies, their service is always consistent and good. In addition, I love how minimalistic and simple all their products are so that you can customize it to your liking.\n\nI have used Muji notebooks this year for school, one notebook for each course (lectures) if the prof doesn't talk too fast and it is honestly the best. The pages are so smooth and easy to write on and the lines are pretty thin so you don't have to write that big. Because the pens are  not that cheap per unit of pen (e.g. $2\/pen) and these gel pens do run out, I recommend finding a good ballpoint pen because it lasts longer. But Muji's pens are excellent for everything, especially card writing.
