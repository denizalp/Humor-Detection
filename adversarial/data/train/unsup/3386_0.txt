Come here if you wanna get your shit stolen!!!\n\nI came here a year ago and I was SHOCKED at how crowded it was.  I never made it to the dance floor, which might have been a good thing.\n\nBecause TONIGHT, I had my phone and credit card stolen (out of my wallet), my friend had her CASH stolen, and at the end of the night I wanted to make a report to the security guards\/lost and found but they did not give a f*ck there were groups outside waiting for at least 4 missing phones.  \n\nI have been coming to Vegas at least 3 times a year for the past 5 years, this has never happened to me at any nother club, TAO, XS, Surrender, Marquee, Light, 1OAK, Hakkasan, Jewel, etc.\n\n1 star for shitty service.
