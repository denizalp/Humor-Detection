Took my parents out for dinner here and it was a good experience overall. We shared two pizzas and a charcuterie platter with some appetizers.  I would try again for another dish but italian seems to be better in little Italy or vaughan.\n\nFood: 3\/5, toronto isn't the best for this type of meat platters unfortunately. It's not bad but not amazing compared to montreal.  The pizzas however were very tasty.\n\nService: 3\/5, average, no complaints \n\nAmbience: 3\/5, very glad we were seated downstairs because upstairs was mayhem and typical italian restaurant where you can't hear anything.\n\nPrice: 3\/5, typical, a bit overpriced as usual for Toronto but fair. It came to $150ish for four people.
