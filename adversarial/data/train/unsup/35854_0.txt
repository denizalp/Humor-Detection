My wife and I Found Little City Grille on Yelp and decide to try it out. We stopped there in our way to the Hoover Dam for breakfast Monday. We were not disappointed either. I had the corned beef hash and my wife had a couple eggs and an English muffin. We also split a Bacon Bloody Mary. I have to say it all delicious. The corned beef hash was cooked perfect and had lots of flavor. Corned beef wasn't stringy, but was very tender.. My wife's eggs also cooked perfect. The blood Mary was also really good not over powering. Could have been just a little spicier, but that it's just my preference. All in all I highly recommend them. If we are ever back in Nevada we will definitely stop there again.
