Distasteful for a restaurant that just opened. Came in with five people, the place is not busy, walked us to be seated in a table that offers one pot for five people. We requested to be seated elsewhere with an additional pot and they dare to charge $5 extra per pot. What place does that? As a regular hot pot customer, they just lost me as a customer. To think, they even charge $35 per person which is more than other Las Vegas hot pot places would charge. The manager refused to waive the $5 charge, that's just not right.
