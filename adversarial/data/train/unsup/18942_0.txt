I've been back a couple of more times since my initial review and I would have to say that this is a 3.5 star review. \n\nEverything great remains the same but there are a few details that I must share in order to keep this a 4 star experience. \n\nThe treadmill belts are completely worn out, they're smooth as table mats. These should be replaced as it appears that thousands of miles have already been logged on those belts. \n\nAlso, shampoo and soap and those little toiletries are no longer automatically replenished. That's the exciting part of staying at a hotel, the small shampoo bottles right?!? Well, I had to ask daily for those, which can be annoying. \n\nFinally and this is just my overly cautious side coming out - our bathroom mirror had a damaged corner which produced a knife like edge. Someone can easily suffer a gash if she\/he is not careful. \n\nSo Townplace, please tweak these things and keep this place a 4 start experience. Thank you!!!
