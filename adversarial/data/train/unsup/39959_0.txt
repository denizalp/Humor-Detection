Food was good, love the fries!! The Grand Marguarita was good and they definitely didn't cheap out on booze. The music was awesome, the service was great, and the place looks pretty chic despite the fact that the entrance looks slightly ghetto (been living in the area my whole life and always assumed that it was some sketchy bar). My only complaint would be that the prices were a bit too high for me. Nonetheless, I would totally suggest this place to anyone who wants some real good authentic Mexican food and is tired of Three Amigos.
