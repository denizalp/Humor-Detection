Wowzers, now this is an awesome gastropub. No ifs ands or buts about it, they have probably the best burger I have ever tasted here, ready for your enjoyment...\n\n~Fud\/Drink~\n\"The Burger\", as they call it on their menu, is one of the best burgers in the world...its ranked. Yep, I know. I am not a big burger person, especially in the latter part of my young life. I am much more content with a fish or chicken dish than a greasy burger. But I must say I will gladly cross the line drawn in the sand for this burger. Upon picking up an already half eaten burger, I immediately noticed the weight and density. I was floored. It is impressively heavy, packed with yummy mixed greens, shaved red onion and the choice cheese tonight being provolone. The chipotle mayo is sublime, mixing the beef together along with the pretzel bun. Overall, this definitely constitutes the afformentioned ranking...its damn good.\n\nPlus we enjoyed the burger and beer $10 special which they offer Wednesdays. The entire tab including my lone beer I ordered on the side would have come out to over $28, however the special shaved off $2 from the burger and an additional $6+  on our bill....IMPRESSIVE! This deal is on par with other nightly specials in the area... I fail to mention the fact that the beer selection is very good, they offer enough lighter varieties for me to try, but they offer something for every beer drinker.\n\n~Atmosphere\/Service~\nInside it may seem a bit cramped, but its not...the layout is quaint and you are surrounded by fun sings and album covers of indy bands. They have a few TV's with sports on, and the patio also provides a couple TV's as well. It is darker inside than a normal food spot, which lends to The Attics trademark chill vibe. Waitress was average in speed of service, nothing to write home about. I had no real questions to ask...next time I will pick their brains more. Awesome hangout bar, really relaxed atmosphere, once again.\n\n~Extras\/Rating~\nWednesday...$10...Beer....Burger....Special... JUST DO IT!\n\nThey get 5 stars. Why? Well, they have an amazing selection of crafts, an intimate setting and atmosphere, insanely tasty food, and heck, the best burger-beer deal in town..I mean, its the best burger and some of the best beer...IN TOWN, lol! Its a no-brainer. Bank it! Shoo-wop!
