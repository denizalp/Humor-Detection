Food services fast even when the restaurant is crowded. So that's bonus. But in general, I think the rating or reputation of this place is higher than reality. Food looks good, tastes okay though. Not as good as several Asian restaurants near PITT Campus. A fair score of 3. I could find or cook similar food. Won't visit again. But it's worth trying to know its standard.
