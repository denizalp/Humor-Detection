****Brunch Review****** \n\nThere's a reason why Verandah is located in the lobby of the 4 Seasons - your experience (food, service, ambiance) will be fantastic. And, that, it was for us. For starters, my man wanted lunch-type stuff, and I wanted breakfast, so the servers brought us both menus and said it would be no problem to serve either. Ah... I could get used to this... \n\nStar 1 - The Huevos Rancheros. Perfect combo of eggs, cheese, beans, and spices. Also, the fantastic servers (see Star 5 below) were able to whip up a spicier blend of the house salsa that is served as a side. After eating at a resto which prides itself on Mexi food (see my review of Hussong's) on the same weekend, I was pleasantly surprised at the authentic quality of this dish. \n\nStar 2 - the gluten free lemon pancakes. Yum and yum. You could taste the hint of lemon in each bite, but it was not too overpowering. Perfection. \n\nStar 3 - the mahi mahi soft tacos. Again, perfect fish-to-everything else ratio so that you could actually taste all of the ingredients and marvel at how well they worked together. Also, a special shout out to the accompanying guac. \n\nStar 4 - Beverages - First, let's start with the Latte, which I asked be served with a shot of hazelnut. This latte might just be the best I've had in Vegas. No sugar-additives needed, and it tasted very creamy, even though they substituted the real milk for almond milk. And (drum rolls please) -- their iced tea. With the iced tea ice cubes (so that the tea doesn't taste watered down), and the liquid sugar pour (so that each sip of tea tastes like the last one since the liquid sugar dissolves more quickly), it is deliciousness in a glass. \n\nStar 5 - Leo and Lucio - our servers. I should probably have broken them out into separate stars but I'm running out of stars here!! No request big or small was too much for them. The fact that we had 2 servers for 2 diners should alone tell you how far they will go to make sure you have a great meal. These two gents only helped make this meal that much more fantastic. \n\nLest you think we are a couple of barbarians, we did have a special situation which allowed us to sample many dishes at the same time. No, we did not eat everything we ordered at one seating.... that said, these were some of the best leftovers ever!
