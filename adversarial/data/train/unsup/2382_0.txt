Popped in here on a recent Saturday afternoon and was super excited to see the place jammed!  There is a huge long bar where you make your order.  (It looked to me as tho there is no table service.)\n\nThey have tasting flights available (IPA or Non-IPA available).  Beer preference is personal - we all have different likes and dislikes.  I couldn't find one I was in love with :-(  I tried all the IPAs and Non-IPAs.  Probably it had something more to do with the beer being luke-warm.  I get it that it is smokin hot out and it is probably hard to keep the beer super cold but geez.  \n\nI want to go back and try the beer again - I am sure there is a hidden gem that will fit my fussy palette. \n\nIt is a super venue with plentiful parking in the back and super nice bartenders.  TVs are all around the room so you can park it and have a few with your friends!  Love local breweries and I will definitely be back.
