Despite being conveniently located on Bay St. and having affordable lunch prices, I always end up wishing I didn't eat here after taking out their lunch boxes. \n\nYet, I still keep coming back for more. I must admit it, Taiwanese food is a bit of an Achilles' heel for me. It is what I grew up eating and sometimes I miss it so much that I am forced to resort to this restaurant. \n\nJust putting out there, their food is not AUTHENTIC Taiwanese food. The sour MSG aftertaste completely kills the food for me. Their food is also way too greasy and the sauce is mixed weirdly. It all tastes really artificial. \n\nDo not recommend this place, but what can you do when there is no edible Taiwanese food in town. Beggars can't be choosers.
