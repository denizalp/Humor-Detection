What is going on?? This is our corner store Dunkin usually we have good experiences at this location. I went two days in a row and both times I have left scratching my head wondering what just happened ? The first day I went I ordered like normal pulled up to the window to pay and receive my items and it seriously sounded like a girls slumber party was going on. All the workers were scrambling around laughing joking with each other and trying to figure out orders. Let me just add I'm not the fun police i think you should have fun at your job but please when you ask me to pay for a order that is not mine that's when it starts becoming annoying. It didn't stop there no one knew what i ordered and i had to repeat my order. Thankfully it was made quickly. After i paid with cash the girl forgot to give me my change back. I had to tell her i never got my change back. After i pulled away wondering how they train their employees i realized my drink was wrong. What a disaster but i figured i will try them again the next day maybe they hired brand new people and threw them in too soon. The next day i ordered my drink i payed with cash and the girl that gave me my change back said she ran out of coins so she was short and she apologized. I'm not sure if management has been changed or what is going on but they need to figure it out over there because this is crazytown. I'm taking a break from this location for awhile. Thankfully they built a Dutch bros pretty close. More money for a cup of joe but A class service!
