Alright. Went here for my best friend's birthday. He had reserved 2 tables for a 20+ group of people. \nI liked the atmosphere, and I'm no dancer, but I had fun trying to learn a dance at the start of their night. I also find it pretty cool that they offer dance lessons as a social element to the establishment. \nAnyway, I'm giving this place 2 stars because of the customer service portion of this experience. It wasn't bad when we went directly to the bar to get drinks, but I thought the point of having a table was for table service, as in more personalized customer service...? Someone correct me if I'm wrong on that, since I'll admit that I'm not a big club or dance hall and bar kinda person. \nServer that went by Lorelai (sp.) was honestly a pain to deal with or lack of. Every time I wanted a drink, I literally had to have one of my buddies (who happens to be the cute guy of group she seemed to talk to the most) to put in a drink order for me. That or send my boyfriend to the bar. I was not the only one in the group experiencing this either. Like wha...? Hahaha... I pay for my drinks, and I like being a friendly drinker, but you gotta supply the goods along with decent customer service. \nSmall portion of the night to celebrate the best friend's birthday, and we still had fun, but it was the only eye sore that I can't seem to ignore.
