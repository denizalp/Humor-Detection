I'm gonna go out on a whim and say you stumbled onto this restaurant by searching for 'steak and eggs'. High five for you! \n\nNothing says you've had a good night like some $4.99 steak and over easy yolk-porn.  It's a guarantee that the entire plate will be devoured in under 5 minutes. Time me if you don't believe me. heheh \n\nDon't complain about slow service and stop being picky about the quality. it's $4.99 and you're drunk, so just be happy and enjoy the rest of your night.
