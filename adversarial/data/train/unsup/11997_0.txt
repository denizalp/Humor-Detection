Unpalatable. \n\nI am a spicy food connoisseur. I like it extra hot  to eye-watering. However:\n\nMy throat and stomach are extremely sore right now from the \"spicy\" dishes at this place. Dear Thai Elephant Sadists: When you are running a restaurant, you need to know that when a customer requests a dish made \"spicy,\" which is on your menu and not a special request, this is not an invitation to a staff joke where you dump two tablespoons of crushed red pepper directly into a single order. I would like to think that the dish is cooked with the heat in it to enhance flavor, not just to show off to the non-Asian folk who DARE to have the NERVE to ask for it spicy. \"I'll show YOU what spicy means, DUBYA.\" Because I happen to be Asian, grew up on kimchee, and I can take it. Until today - this is just plain ridiculous. Who the FUCK would EVER eat it like this?? PLEASE see the photo I uploaded of this piece of broccoli with nothing but PURE CRUSHED CHILIS STUCK IN ITS BRANCHES.\n\nIf it's going to be super, ass-flaming spicy when you order it, they should tell you it's over-the-top and not intended for you to actually taste your food. I have been guzzling water and rinsing my mouth and it's going to be a few hours before I can even find something else to eat while my tastebuds and lips recover.
