Some people might scoff at the five stars I gave the Rowley but, having lived right around the block; this bar has been my savior. It's the perfect bar to visit alone when you don't want to be spotted by anyone you know. The bartenders remember what kind of bourbon you drink (Echo Springs) and will watch you play the bowling machine, laughing when you botch the split.\n\nAnd they open at five thirty in the morning. Awesome. I have been there for last call and then returned for first call. No one even noticed. Don't gentrify this place though, the local clientele own the Rowley. I was just lucky enough to be a resident too.
