My first time and definitely wouldn't be the last. The servings are huge so the price won't really matter. First off, it is always a busy place so be prepared to wait a little to be seated especially on weekends and on a nice summer day. If you're a large group it would be difficult to be seated right away. I ordered the paella and the pork schnitzel with sweet potato fries. Each order would probably be more than enough for two people so me and my friend weren't able to finish everything. They both come with either salad or rice I think. The service was quite fast considering it was busy and the food was amazing. I was inspired to make schnitzel myself. I've tried schnitzel in other places and this is by far my favorite. The paella was exactly how I wanted it to be. Really generous servings for the price of 18.99. Not bad. I am definitely coming back here when I hit the beach again.
