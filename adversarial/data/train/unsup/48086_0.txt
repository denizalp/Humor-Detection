They have passed out fliers in the past by the business around here and we had one sitting on our kitchen counter for a while.  So we finally decided to go.  \n\nThe reason why I didn't go before was I had a bad experience here during my pre-yelp life.  But you know me - always willing to give it another whirl.  Especially since a lot of time had passed and they were touting new owners\/management.\n\nOK - so we get there and I see that not much had changed there.  They still had canned drinks only.  No drink fountain.  No fear, I did drink a lot of water that morning.  The single can of soda made me feel sad.  I would have rather had water.\n\nIt took a while for us to be \"waited\" on. Huh-huh-huh... No, not funny.   We were the ones doing the waiting.   When we finally got to order, we opted for the the $5.00 Gyro special.  It took a very long time for the food to come.  When it finally came I immediately started eating. Not bad.  I am a sucker for gyro's and fries.  \n\nUnfortunately, service is part of the equation when I rate a business.  This place had close to no service.  I also felt ripped off because of the \"waiter\" service, I am obligated as a decent human being to live a tip. \n\nIf this place would invest in a real drink fountain, some more focus on SERVICE and allow people to order at the counter and pick their food up at the counter a-la fast food style, then I think it would be a winner.\n\nThey also tout a Brazilian menu items here and it did seem to bring a lot of business for their Brazilian food while we were there. Waiting. Watching. Waiting...\n\nI so hoped it would be a winner too because I need a good gyro supply by my work place.
