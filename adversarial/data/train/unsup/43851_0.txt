Great Place in the Venetian. It's surrounded by other great restaurants as well. \n\nPrior to arriving we made a reservation (on a Sunday Evening) which I think is a good idea since the place seemed rather busy. \n\nThe hostess could of been a bit more energetic but the server did a great job making up for it. \nThey explained the menu thoroughly and made us feel good. \nWe ordered a few of the biscuits dishes & some sides, all which were really good. \nThe hand crafted cocktails were also good from what my fianc√© told me. The presentation of them is what I really liked. \n\nOverall good place. From decor to the food!! Will definitely visit again next time I'm in town.
