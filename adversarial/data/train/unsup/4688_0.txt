It's not fancy. Actually kind of gives me flashbacks of an old burger place I used to go to as a little kid back in Nebraska. Put a big smile on my face when I walked inside Zack's.\n\nMy order: cheeseburger, chili dog and onion rings. Hey, I'm getting my wisdom teeth out in the AM and I am in the middle of a 30 day challenge at my gym. Trust me, I deserved all of that. And yes, I did eat it all.\n\nThe onion rings... oh dear God. Tremendous. The burger was okay. The chili dog was great. I really liked the flavor of the chili. Dirt cheap. I think I spent around seven bucks.\n\nI waited all of about five minutes for my food. The super sweet woman at the counter wished me luck on my wisdom teeth.\n\nMy one regret is that as I was walking out I noticed a couple sitting outside with drinks. I did not realize they have the good ice! You know what I'm talking about... the crushed up kind. It should be mandatory for all restaurants to have the good ice.\n\nThank you Zach's for a tremendous last meal before I go to the dentist. There's a reason the place is always packed. Keep doing what you're doing!
