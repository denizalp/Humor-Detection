Came here for a fun getaway with my hubby The setting is quaint and the valet service was great. The actual room and bedding\/towels were something you might find at a motel 6. Definitely not worth the high price tag. Not to mention the fact that we woke up to a huge cockroach on our pillow this morning. When this was mentioned to the management - she said that this is AZ and these things happen - and offered a measly credit on the valet parking. No. I would not recommend it and definitely not going back.
