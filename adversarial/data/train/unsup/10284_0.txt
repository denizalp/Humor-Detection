I was very much interested of purchasing a money clip from them which was advertised on line.  I called them and received their final price and await their invoice to come in and I can forward the funds to them.  I waited until Sunday night Monday morning realized they sold the item to some other party.  I felt very disappointed of their action.  When I contact them they do not respond back.\n No apology and no good reason why they did not want to sell to me.  They are extremely unprofessional sales staff and rude and they do not understand when an item has been sold it is sold but they gave my item to someone else.   I would never will. It anything from these crooks.
