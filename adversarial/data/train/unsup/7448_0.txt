I'm not normally one to let a business' really cool atmosphere or architecture influence my impression of the place more than its food or drinks (would I like the donuts at one of those stands with a huge donut shape on top more than any other donuts?), but I might have to make an exception for Copper Star. We stopped by earlier this week for Yelp office hours (thanks again, Gabi, for organizing) and got an iced latte. It was good, but what really impressed me about this place is that it's in an old converted gas station! I just think that is so fun and cool, and it adds so much to the place's charm. I didn't get to try any of the pastries or sandwiches, and I'd love to come back to try the peach latte that Sofia L raves about, for now, I'll just say that this is a local business with good espresso and friendly staff that's in an old gas station - how cool is that?!
