Great customer service\n\nI am so glad I have a Hi Health store located so close to home. Hi Health has a very good selection of products.  The staff is very helpful and polite.  They have a large selection of ready-to-eat food that I have not yet tried, but definitely plan to in the future.\n\nGreat products, competitive pricing, and knowledgeable staff it doesn't get any better than that.
