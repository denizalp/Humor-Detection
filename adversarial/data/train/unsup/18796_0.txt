On National Ice Cream Day I was in a mood to get melted ... I'm not talking about the heat of the blasting, unrelenting heat of the desert .. I wanted ice cream, my favorite dessert. I wanted to get melted at Melt. This tiny little hole in the wall along Roosevelt Row with a line out the door is where you will find amazing, unique flavors that are served up in a Chinese food takeout carton along with a cute fortune cookie atop. Yes. The line is daunting and the place is small, but the line moves pretty efficiently. OR the circle of standing people inside with seemingly no rhyme or reason. There was a little wait for the Ice Cream Waffle Sandwich my daughter ordered. I am thinking that's because there were only two guys working on this Saturday afternoon and the waffles are cooked upon the spot.. she got the Nutella flavored ice cream and it was large and so yummy! SHE did over order! I got the Cookie Dough... just enough sweet! Super creamy and a small is still almost 2 scoops! My husband got Fruity Pebbles and Banana Cream Pie .. Blech! BUT his taste is not mine and he finished his portion off! There are tables for sitting outside and that's fun to admire the artsy murals and walls while one gets .... melted!
