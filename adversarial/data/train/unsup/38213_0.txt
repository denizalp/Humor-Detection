April 2014 Dinner. $24.99 (weekday). Overall food quality 6\/10, good presentation 7\/10, restaurant environment and cleanliness 8\/10, variety 6\/10. \n\nOverall not amazed by anything in particular from this restaurant. Not a big selection on food and could tastes better. View is good if you sit by the window.\n\nGarlic shrimp was okay but not enough garlic.\nSteak, garlic mushroom barely flavourful and soaked in sauce.\nSashimi wasn't that awesome. \nArctic roll was hard, probably sat in fridge.\nTaro chips were fresh and good\nLad vegas roll is really just Philadelphia roll.\nDeep fried shrimp tastes like dim sum ones.\nBlack dragon roll comes in 8 pieces, beware.\nBeef tataki is a bit over cooked for tataki.\n\nNot impressed, wouldn't purposely come and definitely wouldn't pay weekend price for this. But they've got full bar with beer, wine, sake and cocktails (check weekly specials gor $4.99 cocktails)
