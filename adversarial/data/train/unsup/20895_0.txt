There are 2 of these in Southern California. With that being said, don't order something you can get in California. HELLO FOIE GRAS.\n\nShogun burger it is. A massive burger with a patty made of wagyu beef, a slab of unagi, and a beautifully seared slab of fatty rich foie gras - OH HOW I HAVE MISSED THEE. \n\nI ordered mine the only way a burger should be done (medium rare, DUH) and it came out perfect. The beef was juicy, unagi was sweet, while the foie gras was decadent. It got messy and all over the place, probably why there's always a line for the bathroom. My friend even warned me that I should sit closer to the table when our food came. Sound advice. \n\nThe parmesan truffle sweet potato fries were good, but not amazing. I am just a sucker for sweet potato fries. \n\nThere was no wait for us when we arrived. It was a Sunday during lunch, but then again it was just 2 of us and we had no problems with sitting at the bar. Service was top notch, (although there was a slight sexist incident.. I was dining with a pescetarian so obviously he had a fish burger. When our food came, the runner gave ME the fish burger and the shogun to my friend. I said \"other way around\" and he said \"oh I just assumed the shogun was his because it's meaty and manly. EXCUSE ME!? *rolleyes I digress)  and I would definitely wander off the strip for a Shogun burger again.
