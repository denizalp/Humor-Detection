I don't even remember what my main meal was, but I know I was happy with the salsa and guacamole. Since these are the two staples that I used to judge any Mexican restaurant, I would have to say that this place is definitely at least 3.5 stars. I also appreciated that all the waitstaff dressed up for Halloween, and we had a lovely nun serving us lunch.
