I've only been here once, but I definitely plan on going back! I had the Le Louvre burger with spinach, brie and bacon. Absolutely delicious. I went here for a birthday party, we had the upstairs for our group. I don't remember what time it closes, but I know some people got there late (around 10pm or so?) and couldn't order food, which I found a bit odd, most places stay open late. There are 35 different types of burger or topping groupings rather. With so many ways to have your burger, how could you not go back to try more?
