This was rated BEST eggs benedict. I unfortunately can not agree ONLY because the price was just outrageous! $16! The location was about 20 miles away from down town Phoenix located in a ritzy dirt road area that was fairly easy to find. The interior seemed upper class mid 90's. The waiter was attentive and the sticky buns served as appetizers were just as appealing as they were delicious. Would ONLY recommend if the price was lower and the location wasn't a day drive.
