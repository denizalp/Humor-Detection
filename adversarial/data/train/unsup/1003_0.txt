Love love love this restaurant.\nThe food is delish and the ambiance is soooooooc\nCharming. The iconic mountain is the backdrop for a very inviting and meandering patio filled with pretty plants and assorted interesting decor.\nService is well honed, food presented beautifully.\nThe sticky buns are fresh and gooey, their specialty, as old as the mountain.\nIf you've never been, the time is now before the Winter crowd blurs all the things that I find magical in this place.
