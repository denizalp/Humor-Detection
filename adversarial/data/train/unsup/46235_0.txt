One of the Best Dollar for Dollar dinners I've ever had.  The service was very good, the food excellent, and the ambiance very nice.  I don't know that there is better to be had at this price anywhere on the Strip.  The Maytag bleu cheese souffle is incredible if you get a chance to try it and the the heirloom beets (maybe seasonal) with it are amazing.  Very Good top to bottom.  I think my dates fish was a little over done but mine was great.
