Crocodile Rock has character; a night here is bound to be entertaining.  \n\nYes, it is rightly known for its cougars but the crowd is diverse and there for a good time.  The dance floor is small but it works.  What really makes it 4 stars for me is live band karaoke on Thursday.  Its hard to beat singing with your own live band. It can make work a bit rough the next day...
