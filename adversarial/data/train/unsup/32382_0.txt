What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? I'll just give you my experience. \n\nYears ago, some guys from my office got lunch here every so often. They raved about it, so I figured I'd go see what the fuss was all about. I randomly picked a couple of items from the menu: combo with #1 and #13 (carnitas and pollo diablo; pork fried rice and black beans). I was a goner from the first bite. \n\nI eventually changed my habitual order to replace #1 with #14 (machaca), but otherwise, I have never strayed. It's just so good, I don't want to even try anything else. I can understand why they have so many awards and mentions on their walls.\n\nWhy I love it:\n\n1) It's just plain GOOD. There's nothing else (that I know of) that's like it. You know when you have a unique favorite recipe, or a certain brand & flavor of ice cream that's incomparable to anything else, and when you're in the mood for it, nothing else will do? (Think \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle).\n\n2) Unpretentious. I'm a reverse snob: frou frou \"nouveau\" this or that really rubs me the wrong way. This place, a hidden jewel in an otherwise anonymous strip mall, is as down to earth as it gets. No fancy, uber-glam  seating here. \n\n3) Friendly staff.  This amazes me. They work lightning-fast, in a hot, steamy, loud, confined space, but they're always peppy and cheerful. No soup-nazis here.\n\nThis place is on my top 5 eats in Phoenix. If you ever try it, I can guarantee it won't be the first and last time.
