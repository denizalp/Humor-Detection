Oh my god. Yes, pretty much anybody can cook better than this, and anybody can pick better quality ingredients than this. \n\nTheir cooking is extremely oily, and they use the cheapest, grittiest, grainiest beef; the smallest, hives-inducing shrimp; the weirdest burnt garlic-Szechuan-wannabe seasoning in the vegetables; the weakest, most corn-starched clay pot I've ever seen.\n\nEnded up here because my visiting dad saw a misleading ad in the local Chinese newspaper and insisted that we eat here. \n\nTo add to your pain, you *will* get hit with a surprise, $1 per small bowl of white rice charge. There were three of these rice charges on our check. This is unscrupulous and out of place in the local Asian restaurant market.\n\nWhat a joke. Avoid at all costs.
