Quality: 5 stars. \nService: 5 stars. \nAbility to go here on a regular basis: 1 star. \n\nI moved to Phoenix from L.A., and one of the hardest things for me to get used to has been the dry cleaners here. Who would have thought that reusable bags and other green measures were so freakish in Phoenix? \n\nI was so excited to find ODC and their Groupon. $30 to spend on dry cleaning, I thought, sweet! But my bill was another $90 on top of that.... \n\nI might suggest to the owners that they not offer so many amenities to those of us who don't use them. If I drop my own clothes off, I shouldn't have to pay for everyone else who uses the delivery service. Nor do I particularly need \"free\" water at the dry cleaner (plastic bottles, hello?). And, if you use the reusable bags, why are you ALSO using plastic inside? \n\nMajor props to the staff for being really professional and nice. Love that the place is clean. Love that there are hanger recycling boxes available. Love the quality of the cleaning. \n\nBut, just can't do it.
