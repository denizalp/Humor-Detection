I discovered this biz through their Kijiji ad when I had to fix my Macbook Air and was given a large quote by the Apple store. \n\nThe owner Allen was very accommodating in arranging for me to drop off my laptop and it was fixed in 2 days at a price that was lower than another store that I also found online.\n\nI highly recommend this place to get your computers checked out and fixed.
