JUST ANOTHER AYCE SUSHI JOINT \n.\n**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge LV #3**\n.\nThis place LOOKED NICE so hubby & I thought we would make a quick stop & have a little bite... the interior was clean & small. The staff was nice. \n\nWe did not get the AYCE because we had already ate & just wanted some UNI & SALMON for dessert.... we made the wrong decision... we went in and sat down at the bar since we would be quick.  We might as well have gotten AYCE instead of A LA CARTE since our bill ended up being $45 which $7 short of the AYCE total.... then we could have at least tried some of the hot food to give the place some justice.\n\nUNI $7 - tasted like the scrap part of the uni... the parts of the UNI you can't even tell it is uni... I REALLY don't want to say this but I thought I was eating in a SEWER when I put it into my mouth.  So I had to force down the other piece with a WHOLE bunch of kizame wasabi & soy sauce.\n\nSALMON BELLY - this was their special for the day... hubby said it was super fishy.... this I'd coming from a man that critiques every sushi JOINT solely based on their salmon.... the most common fish that sells the most....\n\nI wish I could go back but if you ruin someone's palate w\/ bad uni.... it's hard to go back... the quality was BEYOND hiding behind the excuse of AYCE
