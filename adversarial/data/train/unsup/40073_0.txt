This place was recommended to me by someone who was there before and I was happy I followed this recommendation. I am surprised by one star review people gave this place, because my experience was excellent. The restaurant is clean and waiters are friendly and helpful. The restaurant was full of couples, families with kids, and tourists. We were there for breakfast and brunch two days in a row. They serve a freshly squeezed orange juice, which something I do not get to taste often in NYC restaurants. Greek yogurt with fruits and honey was exquisite: fresh thick yogurt topped with strawberries, bananas, blueberries, and raspberries. Yum! Also, French toast was absolutely delicious, so if it does not come with your dish, please order it from a la cart menu. I also had Eggsuberant (eggs, potatoes, pancakes with Maple syrup): delish! My friend had Montreal style omelette. Pretty much everything on the menu looked good and based on my experience, I am guessing it tastes good as well. Next time I am visiting Montreal, I am there!
