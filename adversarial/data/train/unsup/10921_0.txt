I receive calls from this company on a daily basis, sometimes twice a day.  I have contacted them several times asking to be removed from call list.  Have set my phone to reject calls.\nSad way to drum up business but as a result, I would never use nor recommend such a business that uses this tactic.  ALSO, I see their unit #21 driving down the 303 and I-10 freeway at speeds over 80, cutting in and out of lanes in front of people and even using the HOV when he is alone in the van.  Apparently he thinks because it's called Emergency Air he is in an actual emergency vehicle.
