I was pretty surprised at this place it was super comfy. People were slow dancing when we popped in here to meet Arik B. around 11:30, the bar was full but there was plenty of room everywhere else. The bathroom was super cool and spacious but they really could have fit 2 stalls in there. The bartenders were good looking and I really like the beer selection I would def hang here if I was in walking distance. The music could use some tweaking as it was pretty damn random and I cant even explain it you just have to go see for yourself. FYI I would not want to wear heels here, get tipsy and have a go at the stairs.
