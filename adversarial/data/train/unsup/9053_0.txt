*This is only a review of the dog runs at Charlie Frias.\n\nI didn't know that this park had dog runs, but when I pulled up I could kind of see why. It's tucked all the way in the back northeastern-most part of the park. The runs were much smaller than others that I've been to, but I was happy to see other dogs running around in the large dog area- something hit and miss with other parks. I was really surprised by how low the fences here are, it's not something I usually think about since my dogs tend to have short legs but it was even noticeable to me so I wouldn't recommend this park to dogs that can \"just almost\" clear your backyard fence. \n\nAlthough I may come back, it wouldn't be my first choice, or my second. You catch my drift.
