Simply THE BEST, hands down. The saddest part about leaving Phoenix was knowing that I wouldn't get my daily fix of delicious iced coffee from Tres Leches Cafe. An iced OG Tres Aztecas (mocha chocolatey goodness) or Flan de Leches pairs perfectly with a day of exploration under the Arizona sun. \n\nYou can also choose to enjoy your beverage with a little something from the small selection of pan dulces inside or outside of the homey space that is bursting with odes to Mexican culture, right down to the Frida Kahlo chair upholstery. What makes it even better is the great service. The staff is so personable, it almost feels like you're just hanging out at a friend's house.\n\nI have never experienced coffee quite like this and can't wait to head back for more. If you're in the Phoenix area, don't miss out! Be sure to make a trip to Tres Leches Cafe and try everything on the menu if you can.
