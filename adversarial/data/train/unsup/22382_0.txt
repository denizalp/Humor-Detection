Went here for the first time the other night. First impressions were that the restaurant was teeny tiny. It felt like a closet space turned into a restaurant which me and my husband decided that it would not be worth it to sit down as the atmosphere was too claustrophobic so we took our food to go which took 30 minutes to be ready. My husband got the Thai hot and I got be hot pad thai. My level hot pad thai was so hot that I could not enjoy the food and stopped eating it my husband who really enjoys hot and spicy food didn't like his either and we both felt like it was lacking flavor all together besides enormously spicy and too hot to consume in spiciness. We did get an order of crab puffs which we felt were good. He probably will not give this place another try.
