My mom had a moist and meaty brisket sandwich with a really crisp vinegar-based cole slaw. I enjoyed the dry rub ribs and BBQ beans. We also tried the G-Mac pasta salad with pasta shells, crunchy veggies and a light dressing which was so yummy. What a great start for a new place. We'll be back for the stuffed potato! Atmosphere is casual with picnic tables inside and out.
