The Matt's new location at 32nd st & Camelback had me excited that it was coming to my area way before it opened it's doors and tho it was later than anticipated, it was awesome. Back was the great food I'd experienced at the downtown Matt's during their first months of business. The place was crowded again this past Saturday morning around 8:00 when I arrived, but a true benefit of dining alone is no waiting. The server was pleasant and cheerful and FAST. I was seated at 8:05 ate my delicious pancakes and superb bacon and paid my tab all before 8:35. I'm hoping it stays this fabulous, as the downtown spot fell out of favor with after the first year.
