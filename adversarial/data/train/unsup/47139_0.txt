Beautiful store, nice doormen, polite and professional front desk people. Any dispensary can provide the products but only this place has the staff to make you feel special.\n  I love that it feels like an actual place to buy medicine rather than just another dispensary where bud-tenders are hanging out waiting for a hot babe but you showed up and they are pissed to have to serve you. \nThe prices are a tad high but the selection good. The flowers fresh, even the pre-rolls. This dispensary has more of the high-end products, and some of the really cool packaged products, like Huxton pre rolls, that your read about in MJ publications but can never find in most dispensaries.  IT IS WORTH THE TRIP from anywhere in the valley.
