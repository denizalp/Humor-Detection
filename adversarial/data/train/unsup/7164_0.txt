If I could give it less I would. I don't know what the hair dresser was doing but I left with my neck feeling like it had just received a brutal sun burn. Upon arriving back home I checked the mirror to see the back of my neck covered in small cuts, scratches, and burns. I understand that this is a value hair salon but I have never went in there expecting more than that; especially didn't expect to gains few battle scars in there either. The stylist seemed to be in a bad mood and definitely took it out on me. Look out for the red haired one with the lip ring because if she used clippers on you, be prepared to stop off at the drug store to get Polysporin to help heal you from your hair cut because you may or may not be leaving with wounds. Who would have ever expected that from a haircut? Absolutely ridiculous.
