Our experience with Charlie and his team was awesome!  Charlie had some great ideas for our patio space - his knowledge of dogs really helped us settle on the right concept for us and our puppy - and he responded quickly with a drawing and estimate.  He was also very accommodating with our schedules for appointments we had.\n\nWhen it came time to do the work, he showed up with the team that morning and made sure we were okay with everything.  His team worked quickly and cleaned up well.  Charlie was in contact with us through the two days it took to do the work, making sure we were happy with everything.  Our patio turned out even better than we had imagined!  We love it!
