Creative Paradise did everything I expected and more, we would highly recommend. My wife and I recently moved here from Wisconsin and needed some synthetic grass installed and some plants removed from the house we had just purchased. After reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I called and made an appointment. Kylee came over the next day and gave me the estimate with a drawing of the layout. It was a reasonable price and we agreed to have them perform the work. When Shane showed up with his crew the next week I asked him if he could tear out an another 7 plants\/trees? I know his crew wasn't expecting to add on anything to this job but they did it and even replanted one of our plants. The new synthetic grass looks fantastic and the thing that we were really impressed with was how clean his crew left our yard. We were expecting it to be pretty messy with all of the plant\/tree removal, but his crew actually left our yard cleaner than when they arrived. \nWe couln't be happier and would definately recommend Creative Paradise.
