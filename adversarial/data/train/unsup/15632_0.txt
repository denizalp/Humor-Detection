My girlfriend and I arrived at the Monte Carlo to see the Blue Man Group. We arrived and had a hard time locating the self-parking section. We looked for signs and only after driving through the Valet section of the Hotel did we see the self-parking parking structure. \n\nAs we pulled into the parking structure we observed a Security Guard in a 'Yellow' shirt driving around on a mountain bike. This helped our State of mind about leaving our suitcases and dry cleaning in the vehicle while we were inside the Casino for several hours, prior to walking away from out vehicle my girlfriend and I pulled a 'surfer' changing outfit routine inside of our vehicle. My girlfriend did not find it as amusing that as cars drove by I was pointing at her, it was funny and no harm no foul because they just thought I was a lunatic pointing at our car, my girlfriend was blocked by car doors. \n\nWe parked on the 2nd level and found a tunnel\/bridge that leads directly into the Casino. As soon as we walked into the Casino I asked the first employee I laid eyes on 'Where is the Blue Man Group Theater.' The employee was super helpful and directed us in the right direction. \n\nAs for the Casino itself it was a little bit too commercialized for my taste. As I have stated before I am more of the type of person that wants to kick it 'Old School' in Downtown Las Vegas. I tend to gravitate toward the closer surroundings of a Casino. I want to feel the energy while gambling instead of walking a maze of slot machines & roulette tables to get to a bathroom. \n\nI will be kicking myself in the butt because in the process of walking to the bathroom I said to myself put $20.00 on '24' on Roulette, I didn't and of course what hit but '24' dang you!!!!!!! \n\nWe did enjoy our time inside the Monte Carlo but I cannot imagine a situation where I would ever come back here to gamble. I would without question come back to see the Blue Man Group again, that was an awesome show and I applaud the Monte Carlo for bringing a show like this to their Hotel & Casino.\n\n***Side note I took a picture which is attached to this review of a food challenge being offered at the Monte Carlo, that picture is a must see!!!!!!!!***
