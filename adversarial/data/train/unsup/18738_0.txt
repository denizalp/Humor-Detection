Hotel is not bad and one of the top 5 hotels that I would stay in. Mainly I like staying here as its close to the middle of the strip that you can walk it. Vegas during the summer is super hot! It's only end of May and it was up to 95F! NYNY has good deals and you can be offered free buffet meals or room nights especially if you spend money gambling or slots. They have Starbucks within the hotel for those coffee people like me. They have many restaurants, stores and snack shops around. \n\nAs for the rooms, they are clean. Beds are comfy and clean; no bed bugs seen! They give you enough pillows. They have a safe in the room but no microwave or small frig. Bathrooms are clean but the last bathroom, the shower didn't work right. It was spitting water on the shower head and faucet.  I have only stayed at the Century and New York tower rooms. Easy to get to and close to the registration desk. I like this hotel. Will come again...
