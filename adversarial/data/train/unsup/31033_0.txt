Quite frankly the best show I've ever seen. Now granted, I'm a Beatles fan but this is an amazing experience.  I deliberately never listened to the LOVE album because of the different mixes of the music.  I wanted to hear it at the show first.  Unbelievable.  Down loaded the album as soon as I got back to hotel room and just love the mixes.\n\nMy wife who's not a Beatles fan said that it was amazing and awesome as well.
