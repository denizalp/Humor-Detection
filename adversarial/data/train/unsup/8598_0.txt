This is an above average sports bar that should be on the agenda of anyone who lives in surrounding neighborhoods. \n\nThe seating is expansive! Plenty of seats at the bar for when you're out with a few bros, and the patio was able to accommodate a large outing of a couple dozen people. \n\nThe beer selection is surprisingly great. They've got dozens of taps, and a few of them, such my Elysian Space Dust IPA, are examples of good lesser-known brews you don't run into every day. \n\nI really only tried some apps like mozzarella sticks or quesadillas, and they were OK. The menu is huge, so you'll find something that doesn't disappoint. \n\nI'd come out here to watch sports, get my beer snobbery on, or even play Cards Against Humanity. Nice job on giving me something fun to do in the north valley.
