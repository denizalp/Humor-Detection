Pizza usually takes 10-15 mins to make but it's fresh & hot. Love the kale salad and gotta order an mini AtoZ cookie for dessert! I love that this is location in Terminal D at Sky Harbor. There are always lines here so if you're in a rush to connect to your flight, watch out. It could take 10-15 minutes since most items are made to order. \n\nThe grapefruit sunrise bevy is fresh and tart. But the small is a bit pricey for $3.00.
