We ate several meals in Vegas and the one at I love this bar was the absolute best! We arrived just a bit before 9pm and at 9pm a live band started. Plenty of room for line dancing and awesome music. I had the bbq chicken salad that was full of flavor and fresh. The fried pickles are fried in a beer batter and a killer dipping sauce. The nachos with bbq pork were phenaminal and the special sangria burger was even better. Our waitress Michelle was the most friendly most energetic person in the place. Would return again and recommend to anyone looking for an amazing deal.
