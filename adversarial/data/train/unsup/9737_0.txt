I cannot, cannot, cannot stress how impressed I am by Honey B Hives.\n\nI tend to avoid 24hour restaurants and I've been trying to do so until there was absolutely nothing opened at 11PM on a Tuesday night. I've already tried Magic Noodle (which is definitely worth a try - take a peek at my review! [[shameless self-advertising]])\nBut I looked over the Yelp reviews of Honey B and decided to take a shot.\n\nThis restaurant is tucked behind a gas station, next to a bar, an Indian restaurant, and an adult video store.  After going over some oddly placed speed bumps I arrived at a very ordinary restaurant.\n\nInside is bright, it's clean, and it definitely smells like breakfast.\n\nThe server was polite and efficient - he seated us, got us our menus, and then took our orders on an iPad.  When he got me my take-out box he pulled the bag apart and placed it so it would be easier for me to fit the container into the bag.  \n\nI had the Working B Breakfast and I would've paid double the amount for what it costed me.  The pancakes are fluffy and happy (not like the soggy ones you get from 24 hour diners), the peameal, ham, and bacon were tasty and not too oil, the home fries (my boyfriend ate all of them), and the eggs were done perfectly for an over-easy.  The only thing that I was unsatisfactory was that they sprinkled a little powdered sugar onto my eggs from my pancakes and I was mad confused for a second or two.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs.  He destroyed everything on his plate and then helped me destroy the pull-pork poutine.\n\nI had to order thanks to the previous reviews and it was most definitely worth it.  The pulled-pork + fries + cheese combination was dynamite.  The fries were crisp, the gravy was 100% and everything mixed together is something I am re-ordering when I come back next time.\n\nThis meal costed me roughly $30.\n\nThis place was excellent from service, to decoration (read the chalkboard where the darts are haha), and to quality of food.  \n\nNever mind comparing it to other 24hour diners it is in the same league as higher end restaurants.  \n\nMy boyfriend has already issued his statement of returning here if he ever decides he needs late night drunk meals on the weekends. (Note: I will be sober driving and will kick him out of the restaurant myself if he disturbs the peace)
