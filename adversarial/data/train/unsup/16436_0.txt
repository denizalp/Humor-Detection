Don't let the candy coat on a shit pill fool ya.  Reality is, a Priceline customer (surprise!) gets discriminated on again.  Hey, InterContinental, if you hate Priceline that much, DON'T MAKE YOUR ROOMS AVAILABLE THERE.\n\nMy room was not ready at check-in.  Which was pretty normal, I guess, I mean I can be pretty understanding.  But when I explained that we had things to do and that we really wanted to be able to rest, otherwise we would not be back till later that night (like after 10 pm).  Met with a blank stare.  Alrighty then...so we check our bags.  Again, I wasn't about to let this cloud my judgment, after all, shit DOES indeed happen.\n\nBesides, the valet parking dude, Stephen, was one of the bright spots of the stay.  Completely cool, and when I explained, we were just in need of leaving our car for a few minutes to check in and drop our stuff off, he held onto our keys and said it would be no problem to watch it for us.  Which is another thing - why no quick parking for those checking in?  Do many of your guests just come in, park and not leave?  This is Cleveland, most people I suspect drive here...whatevs.\n\nSo here is why I believe Priceline customers are discriminated against.  EUROPEAN TWIN BEDS ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??!?!?!!!  I'm here with my husband, not a roommate, and we couldn't even share the bed.  Really? Of course, as I mentioned, we came in late after checking in, so we couldn't address these issues up front.  Besides, the beds were comfortable, and we just figured, whatever, we'll deal, we're only here one night.\n\nSo while we're getting ready for bed, I notice a message waiting for us on the phone.  I'm thinking: \"Oh, how nice, a welcome greeting.\"  Pretty standard for a fancy schmancy hotel. To say it was not what I expected, in fact complete opposite.  \"Good morning MR. Cooper.\" (I'm a MS, besides the point, clearly I was a woman checking in) \"This is so-and-so from the front desk.  We wanted to thank you for choosing InterContinental Hotels.\"  Again, I'm thinking, the next line will probably be, \"Please let us know what we can do to make your stay pleasant.\" \n\nHere is the next line.\n\n\"Can you just let us know when you are planning to check out tomorrow?\"\n\nWait, no, seriously.  THEY SAID THIS.  OK.  You assholes didn't have my room ready, force my husband and I to sleep in separate beds, and I have to deal with this BS at 11 pm?  I figured, at this time, the person who left the message was no longer there, not to mention, this is in BAD FUCKING TASTE.  They may as well just said: \"Good evening ma'am, thank you for coming, but when do you plan on leaving???\"\n\nOh.  But I should have called.  InterContinental's Housekeeping take on Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction wouldn't be \"ignored,\" KNOCKED ON MY DOOR AT 9:30 IN THE MORNING.  NINE FUCKING THIRTY. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!  Then you ask, \"When will you be checking out?\" \n\nYou guys were lucky I wasn't having sex with my husband, because clearly the \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign was also ignored. I mean, shit, that woulda been HELLA awkward. Besides, I should have just said, \"Twelve o'clock, like everyone else.\"  That should suffice.  \n\nYou know what was also ignored?  The fact that my goddamn bathroom needed TOILET PAPER.  TOILET PAPER PEOPLE.  The most basic of items in the bathroom, and I almost had to wipe my ass with a towel.  This is a four-star hotel, people. I had to take a roll off Helga the Housekeeper's cart.\n\nSo yes.  You're happy to take my money, but you don't treat me like a customer.  Very nice. I'll remember that next time I come to Cleveland.\n\nBut props to Stephen in the valet parking area, and to Kali at the front desk who actually was professional and courteous.  The rest of y'all can kick rocks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
