The office manager is a total nightmare. She is the most rude person we have ever met and the Dr. Jones does not care enough that she is running off the patients. Also all he cares about is selling his HCG shots, not about the over all health of his patients. I had to wait 5 weeks to get an appointment after being released from the hospital. They are one of the worst practices i have even seen.
