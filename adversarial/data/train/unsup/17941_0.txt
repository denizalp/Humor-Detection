Interestingly, all the reviews for this place are super good, which confuses me.  After an exceptionally horrible experience at Brick Street Bakery, I ended up here in desperation for a place with good service and good product.  I didn't really get either.  The woman behind the counter was very uninterested in the whole transaction; I gave one star however because she did offer me a sample of the iced tea before I purchased.  I was disappointed they can't make their teas into iced tea, they are all hot except for the tea-of-the-day, which is pre-sweetened with white sugar.  They have ice in store, so why can't they put ice in a hot tea? Not sure, but she said I couldn't.  The pre-sweetened tea is really, really sweet.  She told me it would get less sweet because it's mostly ice in the cup, but I didn't find that to be the case (the getting less sweet part; there was definitely 80:20 ice to tea).\n\nAfter pouring me the iced tea in a cup, which was bright red and filled to the brim, she took my money and informed me they didn't have any lids.  How I was supposed to then DRINK this tea, I'm not sure.  I was going to be carrying it for about another hour to my destination.  I asked her if she could pour it into a coffee cup, so at least I'd have a lid, and not sure why she didn't offer this as a choice to begin with.\n\nInstead of pouring the tea she had already made into another cup, she dumped the pre-poured amount back into the larger tea container, and then re-poured into the coffee cup.  It's not usually a good sign when places are putting already used product back into the communal \"new\" product....\n\nNice bathroom, though.
