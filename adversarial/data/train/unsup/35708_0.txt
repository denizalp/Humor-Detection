Just tried this new \"all you can taste\" or ala carte Japanese, Thai Restaurant for lunch on the recommendation of my son.  Decor was modern and pretty.  Food was very good and fresh.   Service fast, thanks to menu on iPad.  My husband is not a sushi fan but there were lots of choices for him to eat.  Thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and will defintely go back.  Good value for the money, especially for seniors.
