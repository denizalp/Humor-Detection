Came here for a late lunch. This is right across from Fremont Street in the east side of Downtown. \n\nI got a mango iced tea which is really good on a warm day. I went with the bacon cheeseburger single meat patty with cheese fries. The burger was descent. Reminds me of the other burger chain. Ahem. It was okay. The cheese fries were good. Drenched in cheese. The onion rings were crunchy and tasty. Pretty descent burgers. Food was about $30 including a milkshake my daughter got. \n\nOnce you order, you get a number and they bring you your food. The lady at the register was super nice and friendly. They also serve Coke products here. A plus in my book. There are plenty of tables to sit inside. Restaurant is cool and the best part is there is music playing from Justin Bieber to all the R&B hip hop music. I feel great vibes in here. Makes me want to dance. I am singing the words to Sorry by Justin Bieber. Love the music.
