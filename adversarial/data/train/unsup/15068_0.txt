(Lyrics - Mr Big - To Be With You)\n\nHula's Modern Tiki\nShow me what you got to eat\nDrinks up, Luau Pork\nA Longboard Lager can't be that bad\nWhen it's brewed, it's brewed\nHula's will make you breakfast too\nSo come on, foodies, come on over\nLet Bo Bites be the one to show you\n\nI'm the one who wants to eat with you \nDeep inside I hope you'll taste it too \nWaiting in a line for drinks and food\nJust to be the next to eat with you\n\nHula's Modern Tiki is fast becoming one of Phoenix's downtown staple.  Always open and always on the trend of making this happen.  Seasonal and daily specials so this is definitely one of those places that is worth the visit.\n\nHula's, like the name says, is a modern tiki restaurant.  The displays and decor are not as tacky though.  Actually well maintained and a lovely spot to to hang with friends or bring a drink date.  I love coming here for brunch!  $2 mimosas and the menu is a knockout!  \n\nWe started with some spicy edamame and crispy shrimp eggrolls.  The spicy edamame made me want to drink more haha cause it was SPICY!  Loved it! While the eggrolls were crispy and crunchy from the shell. the shrimp texture mellowed it out.  I ordered the Luau Pork for my main; thought it was okay, I didn't care for the porky taste I guess, but my friend ordered their jerk fish.  Hands down I was so jealous cause it was damn good! The jerk was nice and creamy and with a kicking spice as it should be.  \n\nOverall, service was very good and food was excellent as usual.  You can't ask for anything more from a restaurant.  Thanks Hula!  - Enjoy!
