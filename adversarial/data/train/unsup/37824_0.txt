The worst burger joint in Charlotte. The line wasn't that bad and that's the only reason I didn't give it 1 star. The food  was just okay. I could have went to McDonalds or better yet just cook a burger at home. The employees are in there talking about each other and one employee start d arguing with a guest. The young lady wen through the lobby with trash while this family was eating and was very rude to this young man and his family. I wished I had gotten her name it wasn't even me but it was very rude. This same young lady was talking about the manager and other people in the restaurant... customer service at its worst.
