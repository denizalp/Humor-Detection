So far my favorite boba tea place in Vegas. The texture and taste of the tapioca is different compared to all other boba tea places. The boba is a softer texture and sweeter, which is defiantly a thumbs up for being more flavorful. People suggested the Oolong tea, my preference is still milk tea, my go to drink. The place is always busy... But that just shows how popular it is, also the plaza Kung Fu is located in is a busy plaza itself with many Japanese restaurants. One thing cool about this place is you can adjust the percentage of how sweet you want your beverage. Overall, defiantly satisfying to my sweet tooth cravings.
