Staff from hostess to waiter to cashier were friendly and attentive. Waiter, Travis, was very nice, frequently filling water, soda, and checking on us. It took 20 minutes to get our food, which wasn't too bad. Kid liked his VIP meal which allows you to pick 4 out of 30 items and loved his apple carmel pie ala mode. He really liked his scrambled eggs and bacon was well cooked. I had the grown up grilled cheese which was good.
