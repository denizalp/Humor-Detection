** Crucial Disclosure: Don't eat here if you're wanting the men with large sticks of meat! Giggidy giggidy \n\nI wanted to treat my dad for Father's Day to this concept, but Fogo de Chao was booked solid yesterday. Boooo. Okay, I find an alternate and find Carvalho's and they have availability! Hot dog!\n\nI RSVP and we drive our merry selves to the restaurant. I walk in and the venue is pretty quiet and smaller than I would imagine. And, no gauchos weaving through the dining area! What?! I panic and ask our Server where these meat-pushers were in a high-pitched frenzy.\n\nShe politely answered that this restaurant is a Brazilian Kitchen, and they do offer similar cuisine, but don't have the same concept as others do. I nod nicely but pout\/sulk after she leaves. I feel like crying a little.\n\nAfter some internal dialogue and to not spoil my dad's special day, I pull myself together and make the best of it. I'm sure it's good, right?\n\nI quickly learned it was even better than \"good\"; it was fantastic! Comp plaintain chips were presented quickly and a genuine smile started appearing on my face. Dad and I ordered the same - Picanha Grelhado (grilled steak). \n\nIt was SO nicely done and had a superb flavor of spices and was grilled to perfection (but still rare, like I like it!). Was served w\/Brazilian potato salad and grilled pineapple ring. Plus, 2 hearts of palm (OMG, num!).\n\nI did have to doggy-bag the food I couldn't finish - it hit the spot later that evening. \n\nGreat decor and friendly service. I'll return back in the future.
