Went here for another lunch. Never disappointed. If you like light and healthier meals, this is perfect. They have a wide selection of salads, sandwiches, and soups. So I usually try a different salad each time. Their food always seems fresh. And the employees are always smiling and friendly.\n\nYou have to get a treat if you go there! I love their chocolate chip cookies but they have tons of other goodies as well.\n\nGreat casual lunch place for sure!
