We stopped here on impulse, after having lunch further south, and were pleasantly surprised with the experience. As the other reviewer noted, it is a small showroom for Polish-made pottery, with a larger warehouse space; in total, though, the area is what you'd expect for an early-20th-century store in a downtown location, so it isn't huge.\n\nTheir selection is impressive, though, and the staff were very helpful at explaining the patterns and pieces. For example, we noticed a few Christmas ornaments, and one of us has a relative who collects such things. We asked, and they pointed us to their larger collection of ornaments, sorting out which were on sale. Another example, we noted a small tea set, and a staff member went to find all the pre-bagged sets, to show the different pattern designs available, since they weren't on display.\n\nThe staff were friendly as well as helpful, and did not make us feel like we were inconveniencing them. They let us browse freely, pick up and examine pieces, explained the patterns and manufacturing, etc. I would definitely return if I were looking for housewares or gifts of such a unique origin.\n\nThey noted that 85% of their business is on the Internet, so I can understand the small location, but it was pretty easy to browse the shelves in the warehouse as well as the showroom. If you like pottery, or Poland, and are in the area, you should stop by. If you aren't in the area, check out their web site.
