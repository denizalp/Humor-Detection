I get this place is a staple in Madison. Everyone says to go here and try it, so I did. The space is huge, maybe too big as it felt a bit lonely with all that drafty space? I sat at the bar and ordered a tasting.\n\nGood: I like any bar that is proud to be a plain, simple, working class dive joint. I'm always comfortable in this setting, so while I found the place to be too big to be intimate, I did like the energy of the place and the other patrons there. It was a fun, young, lively crowd. The bartender was very friendly too.\n\nBad: food menu. Nothing remotely healthy to order. It's greasy bar food, so that means nachos, fries, etc. I wasn't feeling any of it the night I went so i did not order anything. It just didn't read appetizing to me.\n\nBeer. Not a fan. They offer a huge tasting as they apparently brew a ton of varieties. Not sure that's such a good thing? Much like I feel about Rogue Brewery, I think offering a ton of crappy to average beers is not good business. I'd rather they focus on a small variety of beers that taste great. Quality over quantity, people. The Old Glory Pale Ale was the one I enjoyed the most but it was totally average in the grand scheme of things. The Scottish Ale needs to be taken out back and shot and should never again see the light of day. :)
