Best tacos I've had in Charlotte, hands down. After living in Los Angeles, I've become accustomed to what a good authentic taco should taste like (no offense Cabo Fish Taco). I was so excited when I found this place in Charlotte! The best taco places are the ones like Tacos El Nevado. Right off a busy street, in a strip mall, small and full of customers. No matter what time of day you step into this place, there is a line out the door. Some people pick up orders, but they do have a seating area with servers who will take your order. The wait is not too bad. And the fact that they are always busy just shows you the local hispanic community approves! \n\nMy favorites - Carne Asada\/al Pastor tacos & Beef Milanese Torta (Mexican sandwhich).
