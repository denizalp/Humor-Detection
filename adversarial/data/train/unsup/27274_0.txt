O.k., totally bummed when CBCB left but was happy that another burger joint was going to be right around the corner. Wife and I came here to try it out and sadly, we won't be back. It was dead, no energy in the restaurant, the burgers are unique but WAY overpriced and just not to our liking. \n\nHad a beer, that was good but the food, again was priced a little too much for our liking. \n\nThey revamped the place but it's hard to compete with CBCB.
