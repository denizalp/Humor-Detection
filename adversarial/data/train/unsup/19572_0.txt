WHY WE WENT HERE:\n- my friend's bachelorette weekend in Vegas; this place was suggested to us by one of the cab drivers \n- because we were told this is a classic, the bride had everyone dress pin-up for our meal here\n\nTHE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):\n- in Old Vegas I believe, so farther down the popular area that people frequent on the strip\n\nTHE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):\n- very old school diner throughout the main area; the lounge\/bar area with the indoor bonfire was legit though and brought upon a different atmosphere\n\nTHE MENU:\n- traditional club breakfasts\n- Peppermill breakfast favorites\n- breakfast sides\n- Peppermill omelets\n- pancakes and waffles\n- appetizers\n- soups and salads\n- sandwiches\n- burgers\n- steaks\n- entrees\n- desserts\n- beverages, fruits & cereals\n- wine\n- beer\n\nWHAT I ORDERED (I can't speak for everyone because I don't recall):\n- savory ribeye steak\n\nTHE TASTE:\n- for the last portion of our trip I was craving steak, so the one I ordered was more than satisfactory\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\n- prompt, professional
