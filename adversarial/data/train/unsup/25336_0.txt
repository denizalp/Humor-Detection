Well, this place is now under new ownership.  I can't comment on the past owners, but the new owner, Dr. Wright, is amazing.  He interacts with my baby girl (Bella) in a way that makes her feel comfortable, even while giving her vaccines.  He is VERY thorough both in the work up and the explanation afterwards of what to expect\/watch out for, etc.  The office staff is very friendly, and greeted me as soon as I walked in the door.  I have followed Dr. Wright around the valley for a reason, he is very competent and able to undertake some pretty advanced medical cases.  You can't go wrong with this guy!
