Surprisingly good.  Actually, it's now my favorite Lau Lau in town.  It was perfect!\n\nNow, not to sound judgmental (but, in actuality, totally judgmental), but I've found Hawaiian places with pictures of the menu items on the wall to be total letdowns. \"Meh\" city, you might say.  So, I had few hopes of a satisfying meal at Lulu Hawaiian BBQ.  \n\nBut, the food turned out to be really good!  The Lau Lau plate was perfect, not overcooked at all.  The quality of the fish was also excellent, the perfect blend of fatty and lean.  I also enjoyed the macaroni salad as it wasn't too caked in mayo.  I would definitely get this again and again and again...\n\nThe restaurant is very casual, overall.  But, it's clean and the booths are comfortable.  If I'm ever in the North Las Vegas Walmart parking lot again, I'll stop by.
