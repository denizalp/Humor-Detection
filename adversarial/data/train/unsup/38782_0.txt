While the food and service are all excellent, Mooyah doesn't really do or have anything that separates it from places like Five Guys. The menu options, the way the food is prepared, the prices...I really felt like I was in a Five Guys location when I was eating at Mooyah\n\nAgain, the food is great and I would certainly recommend Mooyah, but they really should do something to differentiate themselves. Maybe offer some unique burger toppings, unique sides, etc.
