Hello, me and my wife visit claim jumper tonight to celebrate her birthday, when I arrive I told the young lady at the front door (Nicole) that today was my wife birthday, so we sat in the bar area for happy hour, when the server brought us drinks the margarita didn't taste right to my wife and asked the waitress to see if the bartender ( Gerry) can give us a sample of another drink instead of her wasting the drink, my wife told me that he slide the drink as if he was angry, not only that he came from behind the bar and spoke to everyone else except us. All i want it to do is celebrate her birthday not all this. I'm sorry if we ruin their night, but if I'm correct we were the customer. So much for a happy birthday celebration,
