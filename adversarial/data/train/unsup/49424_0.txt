We had two visits from Mojave. First, a very nice guy came and checked our AC. Since we bought our house, we didn't know what condition the AC was in since we moved in January. He checked everything and was so nice. He recommend getting the ducts cleaned. \nSecond visit was duct cleaning. Guy called to say he'd be here in 30 minutes, and hour and 15 minutes later he arrived. Took 4 hours during my son's prime nap time but the guy was nice about working around that. He did a good job my only complaint is the mess he left in the driveway. He washed all the vents, which is great, but now there is paint chips and dust clumps all over the driveway. Small thing but still annoying.\nI would definitely recommend these guys to anyone!
