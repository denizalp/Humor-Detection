After years of curiosity, we finally took the liberty to visit Primanti Bros on our way out of town. After quickly googling, \"Primanti Vegetarian,\" I was pleased to learn that they offer a variety of burgers including the Southwest Black Bean burger which can be substituted in place of the original. Pittsburg style includes coleslaw and fries on the burger. It was fantastic! However, we both felt like it was missing some sort of sauce. I contemplated adding ketchup, but then wasn't sure how it would mix with the coleslaw. \n\nThe burger was hearty and flavorful with a thicker than average patty. It had a slight kick to it and the coleslaw and fries were the perfect accompaniment.  This is an entire meal served on two extra thick slices of white bread. Enjoy!
