I should have done better 'due diligence' on the front end and maybe never have walked in here to begin with.  It is hard to be a pizza joint in this part of town considering all the outstanding competition in the neighborhood too.  Everything looked pre-made and not fresh.  All the pizzas were preheated with toppings on them ready to go, before you even get there, then they fire it in an oven when a pizza is ordered.  \n\nSince the pizzas didn't look particularly appetizing, I had asked about substituting capicola (which was on another sub on the menu) for the ham on the Italian sub and the server said they were already pre-prepared.  I opted for the barbeque chicken pizza the gentleman at the counter suggested.  The crust was not good; it was kind of like Boboli bread.  The servers were nice, but unfortunately I can not say the same for the food.
