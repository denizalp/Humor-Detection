While staying at a friend's farm in Belleville, Wisconsin, he mentioned Friday Night Fish Fry. My Californian friend and I raised our eyebrows and asked, \"Friday night what now?\"\n\nNeedless to say, we had to experience this Friday Night Fish Fry.\n\nOn the way there, the concept was explained to us. For those unfamiliar with Friday Night Fish Fry, here's a quick 411:\n\nThe Fish Fry is a classic Wisconsin tradition that originates from the state's Catholic settlers strictly adhering to the whole no meat on Friday rule. Soon, restaurants and pubs would be using the Friday Fish Fry concept as a marketing ploy to get patrons into the door. This is what led to the statewide phenomenon where everyone hits their favorite tavern for some fried fish every Friday.\n\nAs for Borland's, aside from being a real, living, breathing piece of precious Americana, the food is good. It's pretty standard fried fare, so I think Borland's charm lies more in its nostalgia.\n\nLike one reviewer mentioned, it's not really a place that sees a variety in customers. In fact, as we lined up for a table, we bumped into Grandma! Yes, the actual grandmother of the friend we were staying with. And I tasted Grandma's cookies, so I know she knows how to do things right.
