THEworst Room Service ever.\n\nThis hotel has everything i need, except room service. A few mixups from  the front desk, but otherwise a decent visit. \n\nI will more than likely only stay here or the 4 Seasons from this point forward, I just wont order room service....1.3 hours for coffee and fruit. 55 Minutes for a salad and pizza at dinner. Go out !\n\nI do love the decor, privacy and bathrooms here.
