I'd come here again. Definitely the sugar factory. The waiter, Anthony, was very patient, and willing to help & give recommendations...we had a party of 10 and he did great with making sure we had all we need. My burger wasn't what I expected it to be but they had no issue with fixing it and I'm happy with the overall service received.
