SLS is not a bad hotel, but that is only if they maintain their cheap prices. Would I ever stay here again? Probably not, but its certainly not one of the worst hotels to book. \n\nHere are some positives about the hotel:\n-the parking structure is pretty close in proximity to the hotel\n-the hotel is clean; the environment inside feels clean\n-The Umami burger is a nice add\n-The Bazaar Meat is located inside\n-clean and spacious bedrooms (I probably would not pay full price for this hotel)\n\nHere are some negatives about the hotel:\n-the hotel is at the very end of the strip\n-Club Life is nothing spectacular\n-small variety of slots machines\n-Room service menu is poor, especially during the late night hours\n-very little few shopping stores\n\nThe only thing that is keeping this hotel alive are the deals on the hotel rooms and the Bazaar by Jose Andres. If it weren't for these two, this hotel could literally go down the drain.\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^
