The golf range is really cool however the worst part about the place is the food. I had food poisoning from it. My family members had the same issues with top golfs food. I asked what everyone ate that made them sick and they all said they had appetizers chicken in it!!!! Stay away from the chicken. I'm giving this place 2 stars only because the range is cool but over priced!
