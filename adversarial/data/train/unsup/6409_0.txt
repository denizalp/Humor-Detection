Fell across this place looking for a now defunct fish chain (no judging, I had a rough week) & am so happy I did. I've had luck finding Vietnamese aka my fave Pho on the Westside but not Thai & am so happy I now have a go to. The spice level can be requested to your taste so if you don't enjoy molten you don't have to endure. Same for the opposite. If you like molten curry this place is for you too. Fresh, tasty & quick. Not much to look at honestly but it's clean & the Thai is legit. I had the Thai Chicken Curry & the hubs had the Pad Thai which we both really enjoyed. I'm definitely giving this place 2 thumbs up.
