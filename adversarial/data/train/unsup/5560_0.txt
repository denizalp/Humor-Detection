Considering how late the bars and clubs stay open (assuming they even close...), you'd think the Strip would have a lot more late night food options!  Earl of Sandwich, the (gross) 24-hour cafe at Paris, and Tequila Bar at Bally's...that's all we could come up with around our hotel after a long night of gambling and drinking.  Sad.\n\nSince we just wanted to grab something quick before rejoining our friends upstairs, I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla appetizer.  I figured it would be small and simple, but it was really simple.  After popping open the lid, I was greeted with four triangles of quesadilla with scoops of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side.  Really not that impressive, even though it was about what I had expected.  \n\nWhile they put in a decent amount of chicken, the taste was underwhelming - just not enough spice.  Had there been more cheese, it would have helped the flavor...but it would have made it even oilier.  It was already bad enough seeing the grease\/oil it left behind in the container, it was even worse seeing it again in the morning (\"Oh man...what the hell were we thinking...\").  For whatever reason, it reminded me of what you get from the food stands at sporting events.\n \nAlthough the food is pretty mediocre, I can't say Tequila Bar was terrible since my friend thought his burger was decent.  They have some cheap deals if you're looking to stay on a budget ($2 tacos it seems), but I would probably just go over to Earl of Sandwich for some late eats.  Otherwise, they might not be bad for some margaritas and cocktails - the ones we saw the bartender make looked pretty enticing.
