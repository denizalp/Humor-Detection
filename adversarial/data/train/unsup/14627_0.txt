I ordered to-go from here the other night because I was craving Thai food and absolutely LOVED what I ordered! BONUS: They are open on Sunday nights! Not all Thai places are open on Sundays so this made my day! \n\nI ordered a cup of their Tom Kha soup with chicken and always get a side of Jasmine rice to pour it over {makes it last a lot longer and fills you up!}. It was SO delicious and definitely competes with my fav spot in town. For my entree, I ordered the Pad Z U with beef and it may just be one of my new fav Thai dishes. It is made with the wide rice noodles and has a sauce very similar to Pad Thai. I LOVED the veggies in it and trust me, they did not skimp on the beef! The beef tasted fresh and lean, not chewy at all. The wide noodles are such a nice change and I think they will be a regular in my Thai food favorites rotation! \n\nThe best part - the portions were HUGE so I was able to stretch it out between 2 dinners and a lunch! Yes, please! I will absolutely be back to Thai Elephant!
