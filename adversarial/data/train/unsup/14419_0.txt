Now that I'm back in Ohio, I am back to, honestly, the best hairstylist I've EVER had.  Janine is amazing.  I completely trust anything she does with my hair.  I have followed her through three salons now, and when I lived in NYC, I considered scheduling trips back to Ohio every couple of months to have her do my hair.  She's that great.\nI spent years with long layered hair, but it was Janine that put in my funky highlights when I wanted something different, and changed hair colors, and went shorter...and shorter...to where i am now, which is probably the most fun haircut i've ever had.  \nThe latest Salon I've ventured to is Salon Blu in Mayfield.  The place has only been around since Nov 06, but I tell you- it will (and should) be around a long time.  It's small (in Ohio standards) but trendy and fun.  If you're a hair product whore, they carry all Bumble and Bumble products.  They carry one of the best color lines out there (Wella...i think..) and the staff is knowledgable, good listeners to what you want, and friendly.  No hoyty-toyty stuck up ness here.  They even went around and ordered food.  \n..crap.  i'm just realizing i didn't put in my four dollars for my sandwich.\nwell, tip them a lot next time to make up.\nthey also offer massages, facials, pedicures, manicures, the whole ball of wax.  (oh yeah- they do waxing too).\nthis salon is great.  reasonably priced.  and i tell you, janine rocks.\ni have cool hair.  and it's all because of this place.
