If you are a beer drinker..get the bucket of beers to save a few bucks.  I had the patty melt and it was delicious.   I seen someone's beef sandwich and it looked great.  Lots of meat.   As far as the music.  It rocked!  Drove from Cali to Vegas to see the show here.  Danny the owner did not skimp out on the sound quality.   It was top notch!   Girls..If you like rocker men..you will like this place!    \n\nReserve a table 2 weeks in advanced
