I have lived in many states throughout my life and have experienced several different dentists...when my husband and I moved to the east valley we found Dr. Heap and cannot even consider ever looking for another care provider. His entire staff are wonderful, helpful, friendly, and competent! Dr. Heap does magnificent work and I have never doubted any of his recommendations or treatments!
