We came in for some end-of-night drinkies and maybe something sweet.  I loved this place except for the champagne switch-a-roo.  My friend and I wanted a glass of champers and there was only 1 on the menu.  The guy comes back and says they're fresh out but he would open a bottle of something else but its $2 more.  Hmmmm.  I think he should have charged us the same rate but oh well.  The other friend got a beer that he liked.  We tried 2 desserts.  They were both good but one was a front runner.  The brownies.  Wow.  Little scrumptious bites in this yummy sauce.  Yummers!  We also tried the churros and chocolate.  They were ok.  Little churros baby churros in a pudding.  I wanted the chocolate to be richer like they do in Spain.  \nOur hotel was right across the street.  I'm surprised we only went here once!  Its a great place if you want just a glass or a flight to try.
