Checked this place out for lunch about a month after it opened (my review is a little late).\n\nThe food was great and the service was also perfect!\n\nWe ordered the empanadas and guac as appetizers. I had never tried guac and arenas together so I was hesitant but who am I kidding guac tastes magical on anything. Then we ordered the Grilled Steak Sandwich and the Herb Marinated Steak. Everything was delicious and filling!\n\nWill definitely stop by again if I'm craving Latin-inspired food in Vegas!
