My wife and I were looking for a place that advertised Prime Rib for $9.99 but wound up in this restaurant just because it looked nice. After walking through the casino and thinking yuck! We stumbled upon this diamond in the rough. \n\nWe were able to be seated without reservations. My wife ordered the petite Prime Rib and I thought about what petite would be (small) so I ordered the regular Prime Rib. When they brought her plate, her portions were the size that I thought I was ordering. The petite was a very generous portion. The waiter brought my plate and jokingly laughed and said \"You have to eat this in 15 minutes.\" MY eyes bugged out of my head and I thought about the show \"Man VS Food\"! That piece of meat was about 2\" thick and covered what seemed to be 3\/4 of the plate. But It was quite tasty. Needless to say that I didn't finish it and I didn't need to go out for dinner or lunch for the rest of the week! The garlic mashed potatoes were great, but I thought the vegetable portion was lacking based on the size of the meat portion.\n\nMy suggestion if you're ordering the Prime Rib. You'll be satisfied with the petite.
