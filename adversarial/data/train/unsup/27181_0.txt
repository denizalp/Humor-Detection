Was in Tempe to visit my daughter who is a student at ASU, she knows I like to shoot pool so she suggested Mill Cue Club. On a Saturday night Mill Ave. is SUPER crowded and so was  Mill Cue Club (barely room to walk). Don't let the name fool you, it's a bar (which is kind of small and narrow) that opens up into a pool room (which is HUGE with enough pool tables for everyone to get a game in for a cheap $$). No food, but a great sound system. Best part ? THE BAR STAFF and their service !! Drinks are served quickly with a smile for a great price and they actually taste like what their supposed too (not watered down). Good variety of liquor and if your not sure what you want, they make really great suggestions (I have no idea what's in a Strawberry Fields, but It was delicious) !\nSo, to the guy at the door who asked me for my ID with a smile (even though I am clearly \"old enough\") and to the \"Best Bar staff\" I've encountered in awhile (Yes I'm talking about you: HARPER, SHANNON & MIKE-love those dreads) THANK YOU for making sure my 1st visit to \"The Cue\" will definitely not be my last !!  This one's a \"can't miss\" on Mill Ave. .....
