They have the BEST sushi bowls, you can order online or in store. I usually get the surimi or steak over white rice w\/ creamy cilantro & sesame soy sauce, as well as mixed seaweed, baby spinach & the occasional roasted corn. Their portions are huge, I can never finish my food in one serving. Lol. Come here & try their bowls (my recommendation), or their sushi burritos (my coworkers rave over them). Either way, you will not be disappointed.
