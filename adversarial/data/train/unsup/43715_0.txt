DO NOTTTTTTT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! The biggest scammers on the planet! They scammed my mother for $1600 and the check engine light is still on! They couldn't fix the issue so they took her car to the dealership without permission, which she ended up paying another $800. Much more to the story but not enough room for it all. Well, we ended up calling the district manager JOHN to fix the situation and he said he would look into the situation. We called many many many times and he will not return calls or give last name. Such a shady shady place, please trust me when I say pick another shop!
