Two words, \"Total Chaos\"!  The check in line was ridiculous and completely disorganized.  We arrived 10 minutes prior to opening, and stood in line for 20 minutes.  The staff seemed to be moving very slowly, although there were lots of people showing up without advance jump times or filling out waivers that contributed to this.  Although you can reserve and pay in advance (we had purchased Groupons), you still had to wait in the same ridiculously long line.  The \"exclusive court for jumpers aged 8 and younger\" as referenced on the Groupon was not open yet. Everyone of all ages was piled into the open court and only two court supervisors were present.  Although they have \"rules\" about not double jumping (two in one trampoline square) and running from trampoline to trampoline, these rules were not enforced AT ALL.  I witnessed groups of teenagers bouncing through occupied squares that knocked down young children under the watchful eye of the court supervisors and not once did either call down the offenders. This area was an accident waiting to happen.  If you have young children, I do not recommend this area, which basically defeats the purpose of going there.  They have one foam pit open (another under construction) that was very well organized and young children can easily use this area without fear of being injured by inconsiderate people or incompetent staff.  This place has tremendous potential to be an amazing place that's fun for the whole family.  However, I recommend waiting for management to get the kinks worked out before going and plan to watch your young children carefully.
