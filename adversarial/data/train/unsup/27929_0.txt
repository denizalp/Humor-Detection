Went to Tryst on one of the first nights they opened back in 2010 - haven't been back since!\n\nThe $20 cover charge is a little much for the mediocre club. I can see what the attraction is for the younger crowd (20 year olds), as it's probably their priority to just drink a tonne and get jiggy with each other.\n\nI can say that for an older guy (but not too old), this place isn't the greatest. I'd prefer a nice pub to this over-hyped joint.\n\nNot the spot for me!
