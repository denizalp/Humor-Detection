Nature's BEST stairmaster. I am a long-distance runner, but no trails in California or DC could have mentally prepared me for this trail. It is about a mile to the peak and straight elevation all the way up. It felt about 100 stories tall (wiki says 1,200 feet!). Unlike Camelback, the steps are pretty solid. However, the rocks are uneven and jagged while also quite steep. I am a pretty tall woman, but I felt like I was doing lunges most of the time. The experience reminded me how much more I should be doing squats and lunges...\n\nIf you take note of the above, then you should be better prepared for the trail! The best time to come is perhaps an hour before sunset. That way, you can avoid the desert sun for the most part and partake in the beautiful sunset at the peak. We went 30 minutes before sunset and had to use our phones as flashlights on our way down. Exhilarating, yes - but in a Oh-God-Am-I-Going-To-Die-With-This-Next-Step sort of way. \n\nI wish I lived closer by - I imagine hiking this trail just a few times a month would be the best kind of work out for your glutes.
