Maybe just a bad night. Was quoted 45 minutes and waited 70. No bueno. Better to give more of an estimate and allow patrons to be relieved if shorter time. Kitchen's timing was off because 2 of our entrees were cold. No fault of our server, Nimit, who was honest and personable. Shouts out to him. Chips and salsa were consistent. Will not be in a hurry to return.
