Very nice venue for a music show. I won tickets to a free VIP set with Metric in June and the show and sound was really good. Their is a Subway near the venue for food but not much else.\nThe reason for one star knocked off is that the beer the venue was selling was labelled CANADIAN OLYMPICS 2010... This was in June 2012. I still drank it, but that's some crazy old beer they're selling there.
