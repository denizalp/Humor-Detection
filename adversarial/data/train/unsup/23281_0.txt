It's a biker bar. I love Harleys so this was so cool for me too see so many works of art lined up bike after bike after bike. One word... Beautiful. I was star stuck, I had just been to the infamous Jackson Barrot car show and there were a few cool bikes but this was like a showroom of awesome for the price of a tasty beverage. \n\nAt some point they announced,  \"if you are the owner of an orange Harley, it just fell over\" the crowd gasped including myself. It's ok it didn't even look scratched. \nIf you have a car and walk up they know so don't play they won't kill you unless you are a douche. \n\nThere was live music and a bunch of shops to buy things like corsets, patches, t-shirts, whips etc.\n I picked up a cute set of pasties for $5
