When I cheat I cheat at al Forno.  Save room, the cheesecake is special. Their homemade cheesecake is my ideal for New York style: rich, dense, smooth and creamy.  \n\nThe one thing I would change is the soda.  They serve Mexican soda, the glass bottle gives it an old-time feel, but the Diet Coke was flat or weird.  Maybe it does not travel well... There can be a bit of a wait.  We sometimes kill time in the comic shop next-door.  It's always worth the wait.   \n\nBack to the positive... The service and the pizza have something in common.  Neither try to be fake.  Each pie is obviously hand crafted.  That is mostly good, but some people will be put off if they mistake symmetry with quality.  In the same way the staff bring a little NY attitude to downtown Glendale.  I felt right at home, but my family is full of smart alecks.  I enjoyed the staff and the pizza.
