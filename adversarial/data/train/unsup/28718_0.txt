I am not sure how an order could get so screwed up but when we got to the window, we weren't given our kids happy meals so we first asked for that and the lady acted completely confused. The we asked for their apple juices. Then we just handed her our receipt to check our order which she didn't or apologize. Finally we had to turn back to get their apple slices. The manager was courteous but in light of the amount of mistakes on one order she did not address it appropriately. I don't expect much from McDonalds but 85% or better accuracy I do expect.
