OK, first of all:  THEY MOVED.  No longer located on Flamingo, they are now located right on the Strip.\n\nSecondly, the store was populated (the one time I was there) by two ditzy blondes who -- when you add them together -- MAY have had a two-digit IQ, and a brunette who was either smart enough not to open her mouth or dumb enough not to know she was supposed to talk to customers.\n\nOh, yeah, and there was a old(er) guy with salt-and-pepper hair (and a beard to match) who actually had to make the drinks, because the scantily-clad girls (one in a bustier and garter belt, one in a baby doll, and one in a bra and panties -- don't they know steamed milk can be HOT???) didn't know how to make a straight espresso, let alone something as complicated as a latte!  (OK, I answered my own question:  no, they DIDN'T realize steamed milk was hot -- they never touch the equipment!)\n\nTwo stars because the espresso was indeed better than Starbuck's.  Minus one star because there is no one there with enough intelligence to count out correct change without having someone help them.  Add one star because the girls were cute, in a really creepy, Humbert Humbert-and-Lolita, \"only in Vegas\" sort of way.  \n\nAnd I swear I really DID go for the coffee . . . it was recommended on the yelp! Vegas talk page!
