THIS PLACE IS NOT CLOSED PERMANENTLY!  They had a fire in the back and need a couple of months to fix.  Stay tuned for their re-opening!\n\nGreat lunch deals which include soup or mango salad, along with spring roll.  But the real highlight of the meal was the curry.  I had green curry chicken and my companion had the curry chicken pad thai.  Both dishes were creamy with the sweetness and fragrance of coconut.  Also, the chicken served in both dishes was breast meat and not overly dry.  The chef and owner are from Thailand which speaks to the authenticity of the dishes.\n\nMy only complaint was the soup was only okay.  \n\nBut, at $7.95 per set, it was delicious to my stomach and my wallet!
