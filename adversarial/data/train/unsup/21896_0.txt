Seriously, they've still got it. Those tight harmonies. Even some Motown moves! And they're mad funny!!\n\nThings to note:\n-GET the vip package (seats in the first 3 rows + meet and greet + a photo) It's worth every penny and not anywhere near as expensive as most artists' meet and greet\n-for the meet and greet you get a professional photo with them (they print out 2 wallets for you or you can buy a bigger one) but they don't let you use your own camera\n-they do allow cameras in the theater and people were flashing their lights all over the place though the tickets say it's not allowed\n-give yourself time to park and walk over, the terry factor theater is really far from the garage\/valet\n-they serve drinks and snacks there\n-they are lax about security so cameras or snacks are ok in your bag (usually)\n-whole concert is about 1.5 hours\n-they sing all their popular songs (minus four seasons of loneliness)\n-Marc Nelson from az yet joins them for a few acapella songs which is AWESOME\n-people run up to the front when they sing I'll make love to you and other songs. So just feel free to stand up and dance and talk to them and go up and give them a hug when they come off stage because they allow it all haha it's really fun!!\n\nBut definitely go! It's a great show!!!
