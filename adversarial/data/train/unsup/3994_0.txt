I never review but HAD to take time to make this one. I I came here on a spur of the moment. 70 for hour isn't horrible so said why not. To be fair the place was clean and smelled nice but this was the strangest massage I have ever gotten. Started out I had to unfold my own towel to get under. I believe the owner massaged me because she was the lady upfront who I paid too.  On the table it seen they massage you with st Ives and baby lotion they must mix. The massage probably wasn't the worst in the world but definitely the worst I've ever gotten.  She had long long nails that scratched me atleast 15 or more times. I will have balls marks on my back for a few days I'm sure. When she wasn't scratching me it felt good though. In the middle of my massage she just opens my door and leaves my room to go check on who walked in the front door (there is a loud bell) and left my door cracked open....she was incredibly rough on my neck and used the towel to massage my head (very awkward ) after about 5 minutes  (it don't know if she decided I wasn't dirty or what she started using her hands without the towel). Like I said the whole experience was so strange and I will not be back. I tried tipping her a 20 (which I thought was generous for what I just went through) and she said no 40. I said um no 20 is fair and she took it and said 40 next time yes I touch you. Um no Lady I won't be back....
