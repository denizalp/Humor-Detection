Very tasty, unassuming little restaurant serving delicious Cuban fare. f you are craving a Cuban sandwich, trust me on the fact that one order will be plenty for two. We also split an order of Carne Rellena, which are essentially two enormous potato balls (minus the hair ah ah!) filled with ground beef...\n\nMy friend and I were both stunned at the sight of the gigantic appetizer...We ended up splitting a half as we did not want it to spoil our appetite for the tasty Cubano paninis...\n\n...Last but not least, make sure you try one of the delightful postres (desserts) and in this case we had flan...All that food for fifteen bucks...so glad we split a Cuban sandwiich as sincerely one order s plentiful for two. Glad to have stumbled upon this place - just really surprised that they were not busier at lunchtime on a Friday.\n\nAccording to the menu, the restaurant also serves breakfast.\n\nWishing you much success!
