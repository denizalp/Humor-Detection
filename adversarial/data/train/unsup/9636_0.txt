By far one of the worst rental agencies I have ever dealt with. If you have problems with your neighbors don't expect them to help you out or even touch the situation. From being threatened to numerous noise complaints SRP never upheld their responsibility of a HOA or management company. Being forced to move out of your home, leaving the property in better condition than you moved into and having them steal part of your deposit, I would never recommend this company to anyone. June is extremely incompetent and has no clue what she is doing. Renters beware
