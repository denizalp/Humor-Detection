Huge selection of local and international beers on tap. I like the changing of the beer menu throughout the night! Awesome college type crowd with plenty groups of women! We didn't try any food, next time. Place can get pretty packed. We got there around 10 pm and was standing room only. A spot definitely worth coming back to.
