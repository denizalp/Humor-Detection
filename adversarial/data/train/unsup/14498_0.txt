Great views and even a glass hole in the floor on the balcony!\n\nVery upper class, if you look around you'll see a lot of 21 year old Donald Trumps. Not my crowd at all, drinks and expensive and the music is bad.\n\nWe used a groupon and got a free drink so that helped a bit :D nothing is stopping that terrible music though! The DJ should really take a hard look at his life and then think about ending it all.\n\nIn summary, great views and bring earplugs!!! 3 out of 5\n\nHttp:\/\/www.ginkosolutions.com
