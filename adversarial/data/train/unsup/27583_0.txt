We rented a 2014 Porsche from Rick last month and WOW. It was in perfect condition and Rick was wonderful to work with. He picked us up at the airport and once we were done with the rental dropped us off at the W. He is such a wonderful person with an awesome array of fun cars. Next time we visit we want the stingray :) thanks Rick!!!!
