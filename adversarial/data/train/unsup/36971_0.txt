Went here with hubby and friends day before Valentine's. Entire 7th Street Public Market was slammed with people. We all spread out in search of yummy eats, and hubby and I were drawn to Pure Pizza for the aroma. Ordered a medium thin crust pepperoni and onion pizza and grabbed a seat right in front at the small bar area. They make a classic Neapolitan crust pizza, nice and thin. The pizza has a nice puffy (not burnt) edge. We usually leave what we call \"pizza bones,\" the outer edge of a pizza that's typically without much flavor. We found we consumed the entire pizza. Pepperoni was quite good. We watched Gino make all the pizzas, and you could tell he had decades of experience (confirmed after speaking with him for a moment.) It was fun to watch him. Some complained of the wait time. Gino cranked the pizzas out very quickly. We saw he was limited by how many he was able to fit in the oven. A little kindness goes a long way, people. A smile and a thumbs up to Gino and the rest of the gang was appreciated, and we appreciated the hot, tasty pizza!
