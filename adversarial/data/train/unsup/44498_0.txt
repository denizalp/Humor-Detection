I had a breast augmentation and lift.this doctor was charming and i was inexperienced. He did the lift through the areola the material he used caused a reaction resulting in boils. He removed the blue color thread( which he never told me i may have this reaction because he said he didnt want to worry me. A doctor not telling a patient of what could go wrong seems like malpractice.\nHe removed the thread and left big scars when i said the lift and we both agreed, didnt work he said he would charge me extra to do the lift that all doctors do. Lolipop. I was extremely disappointed as this doctor never said the lift wouldn't work either. After doing my research I realized his doctor not only didnt warn the me the patient for side effects, or the possibility of the procedure not working but that it would make my boobs flat in appearance as well . Also, a very very important point he never ever mentioned I would not be able to breastfeed with the procedure. $8500 is what he charged me and every doctor ive been to since agrees this is a bad boob job. I was 29 very fit small breasted and never had kids so why he said i needed a lift is beyond me. And how would a patient such as myself be difficult to just increase the size?!?! I would never recommend anyone to this doctor
