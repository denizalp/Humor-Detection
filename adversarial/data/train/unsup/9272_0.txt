Go ahead...get in line....and go to TACO HEAVEN!  A taco is certainly not a taco at Mucha Lucha. This place left me amazed at the tacos that may also be found in heaven The choices and options made the combinations staggering. As you stand in line salivating...you think you have it all figured out till it's your turn and you want e everything on the menu. The three taco deal and 5 taco deals are what I went for. Left with my tastebuds singing in Spanish!!! THREE words: jalapeno cream cheese. *Mike drop*
