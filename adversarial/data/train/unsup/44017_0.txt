They have taller glasses than any casino I've been to. Their slots pay fairly decent. It's off the strip. The 1st floor of the garage is easy access. If you don't mind the walk to the front. I enjoy the promotions here & the gift giveways! The buffet has recently stepped up their game the last time we went. but usually It's a long line & horrible waiter service cause it's so packed when we do decide to go. But luckily it's worth it when you have food comps. The cafe is decent food. small portions.. horrible waiter service.\n\nWhile playing slots some waitresses don't provide the service I'd like. sometimes it takes up to 20 minutes for them to get back to us. & the iced coffee I ordered tastes horrible from the ice melting... yuck. On slow nights, I've sat there for over an hour & not one cocktail waitress walks by... I noticed they have stepped up their service a bit but still needs more work. \n\nI gave this 4 stars because they have been on my good side lately.
