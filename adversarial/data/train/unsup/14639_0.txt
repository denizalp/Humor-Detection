Review for pre halloween night.\n\nThey advertised a costume contest. We got there and the girl in the ticket window asked if we wanted to be in the contest and put our names down on a list with a lot of others on it. Asked what time the contest was, she said 2am.\n\nCome 2am and the DJ announces for everyone who wants in the contest to come to the dance floor. (The dance floor is not a dance floor. It is the walkway between the main huge room, which sits unused, and the outside smoking patio.) Everyone gets there and we wait. And wait. And wait. People start chanting \"Contest! Contest! Contest!\" Still nothing. Then the dj plays a Phil Collins song. WTF. Then at least two mins of DEAD air. I thought the dj would start the contest then. NOPE. Goes back to playing music. We waited until 3am and still no contest. A lot of people wearing decent costumes started leaving. By now we were pissed so we left also.\n\nDon't advertise a contest if you aren't going to have one. And don't pretend to have one, if you don't plan on giving out prizes. Or don't call people up to the contest only to not have it.\n\nTwo stars for place looks cool, and no cover, but seriously, this place needs work. Like why can't the big room you enter in have the dance floor? Why can't you give the dj a proper place to spin? Why do you have lighted stairways not roped off when you don't let people up on them?\n\nBouncers were cool though.
