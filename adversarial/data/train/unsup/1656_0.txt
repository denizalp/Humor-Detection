between checking in at aria, racing to buy ka tix close by, and having to get ready, we didn't have much time to grab a proper dinner.. we stopped by here to grab a bite before heading up to the room to get ready for the night.. \n\npicked up..\n-basil aioli panini: nothing special and took forever to get our order and there was no line! i didn't it was worth $12\n-gelato: pistachio, creme brulee, passionfruit sorbet.. good but not great..\n\nthe chocolates and other desserts looked enticing.. i was struggling to stop staring at them while waiting for the panini so i have to go back and try a few of them next time..
