My old AMD 1200 crashed so I came in for a new hard drive. I had difficulty formatting the new drive so I took it back and decided to purchase a new system. Ended up with an Intel P4 that cranks out at 3GHz and a 250 gig HD. I think the video board is 100 times better than my old PC because when I watch TV on WIN-TV it's like watching high definition and I don't even have hi def service from Cox. Got out the door for less than $300 and I'm a happy camper. Their prices and service are 100 times better than Frey's Electronics.
