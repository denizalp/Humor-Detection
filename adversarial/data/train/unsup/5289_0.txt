I came here because I had a sinus infection flair up while on an extended trip in Las Vegas. The reviews were spot on I came in as a walk in and had to wait only 15 or 20 minutes (not bad at all). The staff was very nice and professional. I felt the Dr. was very nice and spend time getting to know my past medical history and seemed to genuinely care about my health.  I did not feel like a number or rushed. I will continue to use his practice when I'm in Las Vegas.
