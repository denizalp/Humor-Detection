Not good! Went in to this restaurant on a double date with our best friends...on my birthday. Came out feeling like I aged 5 years. While I can't speak to most of the menu I can highly recommend NOT getting the Veggie Burrito bowl, and the chicken salad taco (we unfortunately we're there on Taco Tuesday) and the carnitas taco...The 1 fish bowl sized margarita we ordered (that was spilled in transit) was clumsy and unappealing. \nI give it one star for location which is its only saving attribute. Michael Symon's restaurant LOLA is right across the street...we should've gone there.
