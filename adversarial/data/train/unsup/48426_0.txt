Carne asada fries are fantastic! There tacos a delicious as well. Staff is always polite. Been coming here for about a year and I will continue to. Probably my only complaint would be they only take cash which is sometimes inconvenient but it's not that big of a problem. Definitely check this place out if you want cheap but delicious Mexican food.
