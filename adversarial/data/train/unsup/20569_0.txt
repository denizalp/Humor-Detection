This convention centre is far from downtown Toronto where majority of trade show goers are from. It's quite a hike. \n\nI drive but I feel sorry for non-drivers. \n\nThere are now two buildings. The halls can accommodate a small office convention to LARGE shows. The service? Meh. I find the staff not enthusiastic to help considering that placement of their show signs are bad. The desk was a snob when I asked for direction. \n\nParking, however, is plenty and FREE. Hear that Yelpers? Free parking? You can't get that from Metro Toronto Convention Centre. Parking attendants are efficient and helpful. \n\nI don't think that there's cafeteria inside and on shows that I've attended, the food court is composed of few tables, a big desk where food on sale are placed and a single cashier. It's like a \"collapsible\" food court. I don't have a better word - sorry. Hmm... food court in a box? You get the gist. \n\nSo to conclude, if you're a driver... come and be happy. Non-drivers from downtown Toronto, bring lots of water and reading materials... it's a long commute. Bring food.
