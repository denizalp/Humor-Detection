itchy skin or mosquitoes? \n\nchoose your poison... this very historic place looks creepy at night, upon arrival... in the morning, it turned out to look, not so bad... once inside, you'll find a few surprises... my team mates got the room with cat hair... she folded down the bed - cat hair... she dropped her sweater - cat hair...ugh!! she asked for another room, she got the room full of mosquitoes! NICE!! \n\n i settle in my room, it looks decent... not the best odor. thank GOD i brought my own scented candle!! after the shower, i was looking for a nice long sleep... grrrrrrr!! damn the spring in my back! i've had better sleep in my 328xi!!\n\neach room seems to be furnished with the smallest air conditioner ever made! i've tried to set the air conditioner to it's coldest, noticing the dead bugs on the inside of the window. hmm.. i'm starting to think - the hostels in Thailand were cleaner!!\n\ni know that Montreal is an old town... i believe the architect\/builders need to take a drug test, 'cause the more you drank, the more leveled the steps looked!!  for $40 more, i am willing not to suffer the way i did...
