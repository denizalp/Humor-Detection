good cheap produce. you can find all the chinese basics here. Just beware that the fresh seafood area does smell like seafood. Veggies are always fresh, just the cashier lines can be really long sometimes. This market is a little smaller in size and variety than some of the other asian grocery stores. There is also no hot food deli in here, that would make it even better.
