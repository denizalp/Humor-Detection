Had a spicy mocha here two years ago while visiting some friends in WI from GA. I never forgot about it and have made many attempts (not all bad) to recreate it at home since. Finally made it back to WI and had to come here again to see if it was as good as I remembered. It was! Plenty of spice but balanced, although be warned it gets spicier towards the bottom of the cup. It is delicious. Also had some chocolate pumpkin bread that was great.
