We loved this place.  Cute interior.  Salsa was universally liked by everyone at the table.  Service was quick and friendly.  Fajitas were pretty good...not the best I have had but good.  Sadly, they don't have mole on the menu (that is the first thing I look for on a Mex restaurant menu).  The menu is huge.  Dinner for 3 with tip was $55.
