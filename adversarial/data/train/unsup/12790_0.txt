Meh.  While I don't have any experience with the rental department, the sales department is needing some serious lessons in customer service.  Latest example - called to ask whether they carry an intervalometer for my camera, and was met with a 10 minute hold on the phone.. Here's the conversation after waiting 10 minutes:\n\n(Note - I found an intervalometer online for $39 bucks):\n\nSales guy: bla bla 99 dollars\n\nMe: Okay, thanks.  I think I will keep shopping around.\n\nSales guy: *click*!\n\nSeriously?  I won't be coming back to these guys, simply because they are pretentious jerks!
