We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting for our table and had great service. Once we got to our table it all changed. It took 30 minutes to get a drink. We waiting an hour and a half and asked our server to check on our food. She said it wasn't even close to being up. We watched multiple tables just get up and leave and we ended up doing the same. Spending over two hours in a restaurant and never being served your food is absolutely ridiculous.
