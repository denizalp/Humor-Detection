As a law student, I sort of enjoy the game of trying to verbally outflank the manipulative, high-pressure tactics of gym salesmen. As a human being, however, I find them sleazy and obnoxious. If you're like me in that regard, you'll probably be turned off when you go in to use a \"free 7-day pass\" and one salesman after another desperately struggles to get you to pay them some money (how much is negotiable, as with most gyms, and if you hem and haw enough, they'll upgrade you to a truly free, 14-day pass - sweet deal if you don't mind the guilt trip).\n\nAnother objection: a couple times, the employee who showed me around the gym pointed out the fact that \"a lot of good-looking girls work out\" there. As the ring on my finger indicates, I'm married - but even if I weren't, I can't imagine the female members appreciate being used as advertising props.\n\nApart from the slimy hard-sell, it's a pretty neat gym. They have a cardio room set up like a movie theater (it's like you're not even working out!), a wide variety of classes, and plenty of weights. Unfortunately for me, the pool and sauna are still under construction and won't open for another couple of weeks.\n\nOn principle, I won't buy a membership here - and I implore you to do likewise and find somewhere that doesn't embody the worst stereotypes of manipulative gym salesmanship. But if they hadn't tried so hard to pressure me, there's a pretty good chance I would have joined.
