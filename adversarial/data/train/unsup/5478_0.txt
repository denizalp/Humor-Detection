Basically this place really need to justify its prices. Ive been all over the country, and visited different parts of the world, spent years on the French Riviera, and cant figure out why this place is so expensive.\n\nNothing on the menu was perfect. I had to get my order custom made, and left kind of disappointed. The overall quality was pretty good, but I was expecting to discover something amazing, or at least win a cash prize.\n\nDecor was typical \"Spanish Style\", which they probably didnt have to spent a lot on since thats what all the places in the area are like, except the track homes and the strip malls.\n\nSo what I am asking Tonto Bar, is for you to give me a reason to come back. Also, keep in mind that I am vegetarian.
