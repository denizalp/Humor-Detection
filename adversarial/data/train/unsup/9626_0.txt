Happy Hours at Cadillac Ranch are my favorite. The HUGE outdoor patio is a big draw, so get there early. Happy hours are daily, plus ALL night on Mondays. A BIG plus, is half off all bottles of wines on Wednesdays (umm..hello?)\n\nI usually go for the appetizers and it's not the healthiest - but it's HAPPY HOUR!\n\nMargaritas are tasty - they don't skimp on the tequila!\n\nI'm a fan!
