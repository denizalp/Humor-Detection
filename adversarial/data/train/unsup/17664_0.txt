Words often used to describe adult stores: Sleazy, creepy, \"Honey don't touch that; crap, I need some Purell now!\" \n\nNot Fascinations. \n\nClean, brightly lit, blends in with other nearby retail stores, this may be one of the better adult stores on this side of town. I actually prefer this one to the Mill Avenue location as there's less traffic. \n\nThe way Fascinations is set up is a \"soft\" merchandising approach. In the front, things about as racy as you'd find at a Victoria's Secret, lubes, various condoms, bachelorette party goods.\n\nGo further back, you'll find almost every toy in the book. And many of them are on display kind of like a Best Buy: See all the bells and whistles before you buy it. Guys, there's stuff here for you too if that's up your alley. \n\nBelieve they still do movie rentals and \"love classes\".\n\nThe Dungeon is just meh; I blame 50 Shades of LAME for this (Twilight fan fiction meets BDSM; are you freaking kidding me). Would recommend another store for this. \n\nAs for the customer service? Fantastic! Don't be afraid to ask for help. These people are trained on all things sexual health for people of all sexual orientations, no judgment. \n\nMy only word of advice, if you're going to go during the day, be prepared for some overly helpful associates as this is the time the trainees get let out on the floor. \n\nIf you're skeeved out in any way, it MUST be you because this place is classier than the norm. If this describes you, maybe you ought avoid these places all together ... Or, just relax, because no one cares! \n\nDon't be shy, many people shop at Fascinations. How many Yelpers willing to admit it via check-in or review? Well, probably way more of us have stopped in, more than what's reflected by the 25 reviews and 50something filtered. \n\nRecommended for all your intimacy needs!
