I love Red Thai, they have awesome Red Curry. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review, the staff. I work nearby so we go at lunch time. They have a great lunch menu, great price, but it's dead. The staff is really good at holding up the bar with their bodies. Basically leaning on it all day. It's rare to get a smile out of them, it's more of a \"ugh, how many? sit here.\" and a dead pan face.\n\nI don't know if they inject sleeping pills in the water or what, but getting some sort of energy out of any of the servers would be a feat. It's also going to take the entire hour lunch, because of the staff. The food comes out quickly, there's no issue in the kitchen. It's how long they wait to get your drink order, then food order, then check, it's kind of silly.\n\nThank goodness that damn curry is so good, it makes up for the lack of customer service.
