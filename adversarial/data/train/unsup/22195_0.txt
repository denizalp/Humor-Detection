We were in town visiting and looking for a great coffee shop. The area this shop is in is an absolute gem. We loved the small, indoor market and the spice shop around the corner that was in walking distance. The issue was the actual coffee. Good espresso usually isn't too tough to find especially in an area that seems to do on site roasting or sources local but it proved to be tougher than anticipated. The espresso was honestly terrible. The service was decent and my husband got an amazing, and I mean amazing, tea from Rishi called Moroccan Mint. If you're looking for espresso and you like the deep almost maple syrup taste of a great one then this is not the place.
