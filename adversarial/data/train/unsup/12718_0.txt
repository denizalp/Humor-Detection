When there are hardly any independent Cafes in Markham... I am happy to settle for Second Cup. \n\nNot the best cappuccino I have but this Second Cup have great hours from 6 AM till 11 PM.. and have Free WIFI access. \n\nThe interior is a little run down.. and have some strange Middle Eastern theme decor.. sticking some silk cushions on the wall??? \n\nThe clientele seems like regulars and everyone knows each other. \n\nMy cappuccino was served in this big heavy mug... with little coffee and tons of foam......................
