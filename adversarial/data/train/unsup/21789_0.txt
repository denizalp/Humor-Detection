I suppose the rating is dependent on what you expect. I expected a bar that had a smoking patio since that is what they advertise.\nWhat it really is, is a bar that allows smoking IN the bar, and has huge screens on the front windows that (theoretically) will remove the smoke from the room.  It doesn't.\nThe smoking patio?  They must think this is a funny joke.  The \"patio\" door leads to the alley with the trash cans.\nI almost reported them to the Health Department.\nI picked this place to meet a friend and I don't give a damn how cheap the drinks are--and they ARE cheap, let me tell you!  I wouldn't step foot back in this bar without a gun to my back.\nI love dive bars.  Duct tape on the chairs? Okay, water stains on the ceiling?  Okay.\nThis?\nNO.
