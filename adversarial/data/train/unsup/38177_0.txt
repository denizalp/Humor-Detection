Is it fair to review a restaurant based on it's Valentines Day menu? Maybe not, but that's no excuse to serve the worst rib-eye steak I've eaten in my life: tough, sinewy, and cold. It was on par with the Sizzler (does that place even exist anymore?) The wild chantrelle tortelloni appetizer was lukewarm at best. The red velvet bread pudding for dessert was the best item on the menu if only because it was the warmest.
