FINALLY A PLACE THAT DOES BOBA RIGHT.\n\nNot sure if this owner is straight up from California, but this small shack knows their s***! I'm afraid to say that the Asian Corner Banh Mi joint will have some pretty legit competition.\n\nI literally ordered one thing off each section of their menu...and oh boyyy, a place that finally sells boba tea that is not powdered! \n\nTheir Banh Mi's are on point and their baguette is the perfect length coupled with their delicious home-style pate. Spring rolls were bomb, which comes with their savory\/sweet fish sauce on the side. \n\nY'all need to check this place out...shouting out to all those avid BOBA and BANH MI lovers.
