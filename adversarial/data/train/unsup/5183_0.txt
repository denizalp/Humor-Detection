I can't give it two stars and claim I've experienced better because honestly I haven't.  Cox was such a nightmare that this place is a step up.\n\nI ordered my directTV and centurylink together so I don't know if that makes any sort of difference.  They kind of seem like they are two seperate companies as I have log ins for both, but I'm able to pay my directTV through my centurylink account so now sure what's going on there.\n\nI set up to have the service installed and turned on via online chat with a Century link rep.  The person arrived as promised day of to set everything up.  He didn't take a long time to install it but the only part I did not like it when he set up the dish, he drilled so deep it split the wood on my roof!  I can see it when I stand under my patio, silver screws poking through.  I'm not sure how this will affect my shingles on the roof, if it will leak or what will happen.  Thank goodness is almost never rans in Phoenix and when it does it evaporates as it's falling to Earth.  Otherwise I'd be a little bit more concerned.\n\nHe was fast, he gave quick instructions on how to work the TV.  Other than the split roof I really have no other complaints.  The price is true to what they told me, I'm sure after the first year it will go up.  It's hard to find internet and cable service that doesn't go up after the first year.  Although I'm sure when I contract ends in a couple years I'll be cancelling my cable and sticking with using my internet and watching Netflix.
