I was in the area while scouting some bike trails yesterday and my Starbucks app pointed me toward this outlet.  It looks fairly new and it's a really nice store.\n\nI ordered my drink and then waited.  They were doing a good business at the drive through.  The part that amazed me was the fact there were four people working here yesterday.  One at the drive through register, one at the counter register and one making drinks.  The 4th person just stood around watching but I never saw her make a drink during the 5 minutes I waited.\n\nWouldn't it make sense to task her with the cold drinks--frappuccinos and such--and the other one could concentrate on the drinks that needed to be made at the espresso machine.  That's what you'd think but that's not what was going on here yesterday.  I felt sorry for the barista.  She was working very hard and I sensed she wasn't pleased with the lack of help.\n\nThe seating area was comfortable and the wifi was zippy.  That saved this from being a 2 star review but they really need to do something about the division of labor at this place.
