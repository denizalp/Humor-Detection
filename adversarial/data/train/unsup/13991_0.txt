Friendly staff. Been telling them for sometime 5 months about the gym equipment being out of calibration, broken or sounding like a howler monkey being molested on one of the ellipticals. I really wouldn't consider it an amenity if it's rundown and more than 50% of the equipment is broken. Please note that I will raise the stars and provide an update should they fix the situation with the gym. Really have no complaints about this place aside from the gym and the dog shit all over the place. Dropped it down to two stars since I'm not sure the pool ever gets cleaned. Another amenity fail. Now I have people that live here asking me for money to feed their kids. Asked the office and they didn't know what to do. Basically on my own with that issue.
