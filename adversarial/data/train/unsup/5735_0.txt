I've been coming here for 5 years.  There have been a few different owners.  Tonight was only the second night I've ever peed here.  Why?\nThe ladies' room floor was always sopping wet and the toilets didn't work.  Or, the lid was off the back.  Gross!\nThe sound used to SUCK.\nNew ownership for almost a year now.  I gotta say, Mardi Gras has really improved!\nThere's the Voodoo Lounge in front.  Used to be a comedy room I ran.  Really nicely painted and furnished.  It's the \"class\" part of the Mardi Gras.\nThen, the main room, where live music is played.  I've been several times in the past few weeks to see some of the bands play.  I cannot BELIEVE the improvement in the sound system!  The crowd isn't as \"haggard\" as it used to be, though I did meet some cool peeps back in the day.  \nI like peeing here now.
