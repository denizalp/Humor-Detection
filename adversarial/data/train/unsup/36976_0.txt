I have dry skin, very dry in winter, normal to dry during the summer. I also have very sensitive, acne prone skin. I purchased Brilliance NY last summer and it was perfect for me. They have a moisturizer even though it says intensive; it's not heavy at all. It moisturized my skin well, didn't clog pores, and didn't irritate my skin. I stopped using it when it got colder because it is very light. I recently gave it to my girlfriend who has serious skin sensitivity issues. She has been using it and likes it very much. I would highly recommend it to those who want a light moisturizer for their skin.
