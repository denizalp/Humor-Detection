VIP line was a plus, but the dance floor was WAY overcrowded. Drinks average $12. The mix of clubbers ranged from 21-70's. A little awkward dancing next to a 75 year old grinding on his lady then trying to grind you, but I can't blame him for having fun. Everyone loves Vegas. And good for him for trying to stay young. Decent music. Not much upbeat music but when he finally played some, the floor packed up. From rope to rope & bar to bar. So much I couldn't move. When we left he finally cranked the really good beats, maybe 20 seconds of each song. Slightly annoying to get into the groove & them change the song. DJ needed a little mixing work.
