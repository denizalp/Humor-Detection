Below average food, terrible customer service.  Lady at the counter is rude for no reason, we saw here fighting with two customers during the time we where there. \n\nAlso they dont like to take Yelp voucher, and made it seem like they did us a favor by accepting the voucher!!! \n\nNever going back again.
