I am SOOO thankful Dyanna L. insisted we come here for brunch a few weeks back... And after going back for a second visit for dinner after an Elite event downtown, Carson Kitchen has skyrocketed to the top of my list spots to dine downtown. \n\nI have been lucky on each of my visits to be seated at the chef's 'table' (really more of a counter), where I have had a full view of the kitchen and been able to interact with the fun and entertaining staff. \n\nService here has always been on point for me... I can't recall the name of the adorable, rockabilly-ish blonde that has been my waitress on every visit, but I adore her. She fits right in with the \"rock and roll hipster\" vibe Carson Kitchen has going on.\n\nLiterally EVERY item I have had here I would order again... but I do have some favorites:\n\nBacon Jam: Everything I could have wanted and then some. Salty, sweet, creamy AND crunchy... A culinary grand slam.\nTempura Green Beans: I have been craving the pepper jelly cream cheese served with the tempura green beans for weeks now. It is the perfect compliment to the addictive green beans.\nThe Secret Sunday Chicken Sandwich: Simple yet perfectly done... Juicy chicken, aioli with just a slight kick, delicious bun.\n\nPrices are very fair for the caliber of the food being served up. Carson Kitchen is a must when dining downtown in my opinion.
