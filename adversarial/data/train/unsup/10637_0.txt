Me my sister and my mother went dress shopping and we went in and they just gave us a snobby look . Not a very good first impression especially for someone who's there first time shopping for wedding dress. They didn't bother helping us at all . They never approached us asking what i wanted . As we were looking for some dresses another soon to be bride came in the store with her mother and sister . They asked if they were looking for anything in particular. She then showed them a picture of the dress she wanted . immediately after showing the desk lady she said \"well i don't know how it will look because your shoulder and hips are at the same length, you look like a rectangle honey .\" And i just felt disgusted by what she was saying to her . All in all we left the store . Never shopping there ever again . They are rude and they don't make you feel special at all .
