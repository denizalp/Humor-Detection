Best bagel place in Charlotte - you can tell because it is always packed on the weekends and it also has a prime location in Southend. Their bagels are steamed and delicious, you can't go wrong with any of their speciality sandwiches. My go to is either a classic bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel or the Angry Steve (egg, sausage, cheese, peppers, onions and spicy ranch). I will say they are small so get 2 if you are used to huge NYC bagels!
