Went here for some Laser Tattoo fading and the great thing about it was the price per session. I was quoted at 350 $ per session at other establishments and got it done here for less than 200 per sitting. Easy to book and quickly down to buisness.\n\nI would rather get my balls pierced than go through that again, if I had to describe it I would say it's kind of like being burned ...with a laser.  I will be getting more Tattoos but they will be better thought out. My old tattoo was faded quite well over 3 sessions; still visible but enough to get an effective cover up done. I went with the cover tattoo because it was better than the straight fading that can leave a mark . If I end up not liking this one I will reutrn to Keith for more fading but whatever that's future Alan's problem; screw that guy he's an asshole.\n\nCan't do 5 stars because it wasn't that fun .
