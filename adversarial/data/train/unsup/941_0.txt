Oh Canada, home of the two choice: WestJet and Air Canada. I fly with you both so frequently but time and time again, WestJet wins my loyalty. \n\nIs it because they respond to questions on Twitter? Or because they're smiling and merry on flights? Maybe it's that I actually enjoy reading their in flight magazine \"Up.\" Or perhaps it's just because they're sincere.  Anyway I slice it, WestJet is my home in the air. \n\nSometimes the satellite tv doesn't work, but when it does I'm always content. Watching Oprah on an airplane is indulgent indeed. \n\nAnd now I'd like to add that they actually get back to emails too. This past month I realized that by logging into my West Jet account didn't actually mean collecting frequent flier points (doh!). When I emailed about my dilemma, a real person emailed back and solved it within a couple of weeks, and that right there folks is friendly sky making!
