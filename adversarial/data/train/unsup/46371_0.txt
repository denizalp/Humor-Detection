My fianc√© and I come to Makers & Finders whenever we're in downtown Summerlin. Service is great, the homie Christian was a great server. The coffee is super good and the food is just as good. They also have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options which is always a good thing when done right and the are on point. Dinner menu and lunch menu are both fire. Try them next time you're in Downtown Sunmerlin!
