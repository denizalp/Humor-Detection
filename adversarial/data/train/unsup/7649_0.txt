I was pretty impressed with the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop! What I expected was your typical pawn shop and minimal parking - what I got was 5 star service!\n\nWe went to the Pawn Shop because it's part of a famous TV show called Pawn Stars. When we arrived, several courteous parking attendants were available letting us know free parking was available and to \"enjoy ourselves\". We were told not to miss Chumlee's newest painting of the guys on Mount Rushmore located on the back of the building....a fun sight to see and easily missed. \n\nThere were only a few people in line, so we moved in pretty quickly. Most of the items on display were at least $2,000 including original Picasso's, antique guns, Ancient Empire coins and plenty of other interesting sights to see. It's like a museum! The only affordable items were the souvenirs; t-shirts, mugs, keychains - the typical things. \n\nWe didn't see any of the guys from the show. I guess they only come in on occasion. However, the staff was very friendly and answered all of our touristy questions about the show. It was a fun experience!
