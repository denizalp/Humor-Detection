I had 6 month anniversary pictures done with Deacon as a special surprise with my girlfriend, and we couldn't be happier with the results! \n\nWhat started out as just a few shots together turned into almost two hours of pictures, laughing, and just generally having a great time. It felt like we were out with friends more than on a \"photo shoot.\" \n\nDeacon and Sarah came prepared, took the time to consult with both of us when it came to the clothing choices we brought (we were coached ahead of time what to bring \/ what normally looks good on camera), and made the whole shoot super comfortable. \n\nThe one thing I did like is that our pictures aren't the typical \"lets hold hands\" or \"lets sit by a tree\" kind of pictures. We shot against a grungy industrial alley, a graffiti wall, and on a busier street that had benches. It looked more like candid shots than your typical couples photos. \n\nAt the end of the day, we didn't get pictures, but memories of us having a great time captured on film.
