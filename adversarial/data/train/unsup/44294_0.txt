It is what it is.\n\nIt's no Scottsdale Fashion Square, but when I have to choose between a 10 mile drive to the REALLY NICE mall and the 1\/2 mile drive to Paradise Valley Mall, it's PV almost every time.\n\nThe store selection is decent- it  has a Dillards and Macy's plus plenty of other stores that my teen daughters enjoy. \n\nNeed a fast birthday gift?  The Game Daze is a big bonus!\n\nKids need a fast haircut?  MasterCuts does a decent job for a good price.\n\nUh, oh~  Someone outgrew their shoes, it's 8:30pm, and we need a new pair FAST!     Where to go-- Journey's is a Hop-Skip-Jump away.  Or Hot Topic. Or Tilly's.  Or Champs.  Or Lady Foot Locker.  Or Dillards.  Or Macy's.  Shall I go on?\n\nIf you need something specific, you'll likely find it here.  \n\nOf course my Fashionista child prefers Scottsdale Fashion, but once again, weighing the 60 minute round trip vs. a quick 'n easy trip down the street...  you know where we land. :-)\n\nThe Food Court is decent, and they have an independent theatre here.  One big perk:  you can park in covered parking, shop, see a movie, and go to the Public Library in one trip, no moving your car, just park and go.  \n\nA lot of effort has been made to update this facility.  There has been a massive amount of landscape update, and other changes to this area, to modernize and improve it.  The idea of a Costco here scared me, but it works fine.  Maybe \n\nThis is an older mall, once a shining jewel in the Phoenix mall world. But like most malls, demographics change, city expansion happens, newer, shinier, bigger and better get built elsewhere.  But don't write this location off yet.  I think it has a lot to offer and, with the effort expended here, likely a good neighborhood contender for the long-haul.
