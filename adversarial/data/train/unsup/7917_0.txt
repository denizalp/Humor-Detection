If you've ever been at the mercy of the STM, then you know how the whole system needs a major overhaul. However, in comparison to the MTA (New York City's public transport system), Montreal has it a lot better in some respects. So before having lived in NY I would have rated lower, but I can now appreciate the easy card system, the less sketchy subway stations, and the faster train rides. It's by no means a perfect system, but they do okay overall and I have come to appreciate what Montreal has in respect to public transportation (metro mostly).
