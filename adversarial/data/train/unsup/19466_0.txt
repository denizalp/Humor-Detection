I came here with a girl friend who was Jamaican. Despite the horrible articles I read about the owner, and cultural appropriation, We wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt. \n\nIt was a busy night we were treated at the door by a person of colour, but not Jamaican. We waited 15 mins for our table. Hostess was friendly. Servers felt new but friendly overall. \n\nThe menu has some Jamaican ingredients and is created by Gusto group chef Elio (not Jamaican  guy). It seems very Canadianized, crudit√©s, lettuce wraps and ice cream sundaes. \n\nWe ordered the jerk chicken, they prized themselves for wood fire. It's not pimento wood and the result is dry, bitter, blackened chicken. My friend had the pork, it was too pink for my taste but she didn't enjoy the dryness of it either. \n\nThe patties were dry, thick crust and small but pricey. Can find better in Kensington Market. \n\nThe Okra was very nice. But they didn't do anything to it except grilled it. Not very Caribbean tasting. \n\nLastly the fritters were ok but the sweet mango sauce was too sweet it did not go well together. \n\nThe cocktail drinks were fancy, pretty and not Jamaican at all. Stick to red stripe. \n\nI felt very embarrassed for the people who work here. They are oblivious to the cultural appropriation that is happening with this restaurant. They are bastardizing the history and respect for the Jamaican people and all that they have been through. I especially urge the people of colour who work here to wake up! This restaurant fronts 2, I say only 2 black people to the media. They hire a place holder Chef Donovan for all the photos bc he's Jamaican. And they use project leader woman to do Media\/social media bc she is of colour and knows how to speak better on behalf of Janet. \n\nYes a white person can make Jamaican food or Indian person can make a burrito or a Chinese person can make sushi. But when you hire Black skinned people as place holders to \"look\" Jamaican it's gone too far.
