While this may knock me down a few notches on the snob ladder, I would have to say that, if I took an honest look at myself and my drinking habits, my most purchased beer is Budweiser. Yes, Budweiser, my copper standard of beer. Nothing fancy, good to drink when playing guitar, gets the job done. And that's how I feel about Panini's (minus the guitar). Not the most amazing food or atmosphere, but if you're hungry and want a sandwich (or burger) and beer, this place will not let you down. I myself had a Reuben here that was damn near perfect. And there were some old dudes in the bar area that were already into their third or fourth beer at 11 in the morning on a Saturday. That is some Kamm's Corners shit right there.
