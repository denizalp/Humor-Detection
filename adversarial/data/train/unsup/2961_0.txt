Great service from Martin Taylor with a speeding ticket in Gaston county. He explained to me the best course of action,  what it would cost, and he took it from there. He went to court before my set date and the outcome was as he expected.  After it was all taken care of, he sent me a letter explaining the positive outcome and included copies of the court receipts.  Such a peace of mind to not have this disrupt my life and great knowing my insurance rates will not sky rocket.
