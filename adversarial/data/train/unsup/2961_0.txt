Looking to try a something new in the area when the pho craving struck. I came here with a friend who was in the mood for some bo kho. \n\nI ordered the rare steak and brisket pho and the order came out quickly. I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere was nice. The broth was flavorful. \n\nThe service was a little spotty but since we were chatting it wasn't to frustrating. If we were in a rush, I can see it getting on my nerves, overall I enjoyed my meal. My friend wasn't a fan of her stew and i would probably stick to their pho and vermicelli bowls in the future.
