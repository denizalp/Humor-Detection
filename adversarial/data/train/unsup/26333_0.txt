It's a very small shop in Old Town Scottsdale.  Kind-of disheveled feel, but actually perfect for that type of store, it doesn't feel commercial.  I really enjoyed browsing their store.  I was looking for a place I could bring my grandson to look through the mineral rocks and buy a few - it's the perfect place for a kid!  They must have a couple thousand different types of mineral rocks.  I downgraded to 4 stars ONLY because the CSR was disinterested in providing any assistance - stuck on her phone :-(.  Otherwise - a great place to go and pick out unusual items.
