I came in here for lunch with the mother of the spouse of a good friend of mine and her daughter as they had proclaimed that this was one of their \"go-to\" restaurants in Montreal. I can see why. It's a cutesy little trattoria that serves light Italian fare with some great pizza. I had a simple spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad to be followed by a dessert of apple pie. The pasta is made from scratch and was quite wholesome. Service was also good if a little too attentive at times. I'd come back, but since the place is small, I might advise against coming with too many people!
