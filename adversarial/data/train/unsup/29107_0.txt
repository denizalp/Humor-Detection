I would give him 10 stars if it were possible and I am not exaggerating. I had such a comfortable experience with  Dr. D it isn't even funny. I was so very scared to have my wisdom teeth extracted and I was even more nervous since I couldn't get the anesthesia because I had eaten 2.5 he's before my appointment (I wasn't told not to) but honestly I am glad that I did not get the anesthesia.. No I am not crazy lol. The anesthesia cost an extra few hundred dollars and he was litter ally done pulling all my teeth out within 6-8 mins. Plus it didn't hurt too much at all. I felt a 3-4 out of 10 of the pain. And seriously you have no idea how scared I was to get my wisdom teeth pulled. I will say that the numbing shots on the roof of my mouth were very uncomfortable and hurt a little more then him actually pulling my teeth. When I did Hiram a little from the teeth extraction, Dr. D would comfort me my gently rubbing my shoulder a little and saying its a lot of pressure it's a lot of pressure. He was amazing! I definitely recommend him. No yanking, no jabbing, just a smooth extraction. Thank you Dr. D !!!
