What's there to say?  The Orleans is kind of the odd stepchild of Vegas casinos.  On the one hand, it's incredibly large and designed to look like its big brothers on The Strip.  On the other, it's off The Strip so it appeals to locals.  I just get mixed signals when I'm here.  Is that a tourist or a fellow Las Vegan?  And why is that mardi gras robot waving at me?\n\nAs I've said, this is a very large casino and you could wander around here for awhile checking out the interesting slot machines.  There are also several restaurants, a buffet, and a food court none of which I have tried nor do I care to since they don't really seem appealing.  There are a few lounge and bar areas as well, but again, nothing really of note.\n\nThe Pros: \n-Large casino, feel like you're in a Strip casino without as many tourists\n-Lots of standard entertainment like bowling and a movie theater\n-Lots of shows, bands, and comedians preform here\n\nCons:\n-DÃ©cor needs some updating\n-Smoky\n-Weird old dudes that stare at me everywhere I go.  What's with the creepsters?\n\nGood for tourists if they have a car and want to save some money by not staying on The Strip.  Good for locals because it's large and there is a lot to do.  Not the best casino in Las Vegas but certainly not the worst.
