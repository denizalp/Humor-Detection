Ahhh bake code.\n\nFREE SAMPLES\nCan't walk by without stopping in for a round of samples. (Yes! they keep cute little baskets with cute little bread samples across the store. Workers generally do a pretty good job of pretending not to notice me casually stuffing my face.)\n\nFRENCH\/ASIAN FUSION\nBake code is a french - asian fusion bakery offerings everything from pineapple custard buns, sausage buns, to mochi-brown sugar bread loafs, matcha red bean rolls, parisian baguettes, crepe cake slices, cheese rounds, and oh of course...Cha Time.\n\nVARIETY OF SELECTION\nIt's a self-serve bakery - you grab a tray and load up. There's a small seating area across the cashier. Overall, prices run high for baked goods ($3 to 7 each item), and fair for desserts. My favorite was the mochi-brown sugar bread loafs, and cranberry cheese crowns. \nI once had a salted egg lava croissant. Looked amazing, but was waaayy too sweet.\nBaguettes are awesome, when they're available (30% of the time I'd say, depending on day of week, time of day, and the alignment of the stars). \n\nCASUAL HANGOUT\/TAKEOUT TREATS\nWhen I'm here, I'm either catching up with a friend over some Cha Time and dessert OR grabbing some baked goodies to go and enjoy at home. (and also free samples!) It's a lovely little venue, with outdoor seating in the warmer days. They have cute little lights strung about for the outdoor seating, and a large glass storefront with a lot of light for indoor seating.\n\nOverall, great place to grab a snack over coffee\/bubble tea or a treat to go.
