Incredible food\/service\/ambiance - 5 stars.\nWe went here with a party of about 40 and they pulled it off when we were over by about 10 people and an hour late!  The bar was just beautiful, great drinks (which we had plenty of waiting for our very late guests to arrive from LA!) and celebreties galore filled this place.  We had one of the best seafood platters I've ever had and after all the seafood and cocktails, I barely touched my bone-in rib-eye but the flavor was just amazing. Make sure you order the shrooms - ta die for.\n\nWe had a taste of every desert imaginable at the table and everything was heavenly, however, by that time,  well,, at that point,  they could have sliced up a twinkee and I would sit here at tell you it was the most incredible desert I've ever had.  haha  Trust me on the rest.\n\nPalms Hotel is one of my Fav Hotels to go to as a local anyways - head up to the Playboy lounge afterwards.  Enjoy!
