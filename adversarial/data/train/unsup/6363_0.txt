Known in folklore as a cure-all, the Vovomeenian johnnycake smorgasbord (not the right word to use, since it means bread and butter, but let's just run with it) offers life-replenishing powers for uninspired, hung over, and weary brunch soldiers. The legend says... \"Add four poached eggs to this. And a Portuguese doughnut.\" \n\nSo I did. The dish is just called \"johnnycakes.\" You know, john·ny·cake - noun - a flat cornmeal cake typically baked or fried on a griddle.\n\nI received two, plate-sized. Studded with corn. Stacked with fresh strawberries. Oh, and scoop of sweet rice pudding. Plus, two sausages. And a pitcher of prickly pear maple syrup. So, when you order the johnnycakes, know that it may be a working title, and that the definition is approximate at best. \n\nUse this flexibility to your advantage and continue adding brunch items with reckless abandon. Don't think about it.* I recommend four poached eggs and a doughnut.\n\n*Unless you have something to do in the next four hours, besides for nap.
