Crust is the place to go if you're hungry for carbs in Cleveland.. especially if you live on the near West Side. Their pizza slices are huge, but what I recommend even more, are their delicious, gigantic, totally-filling sandwiches. Hot and cold options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike, Crust has a number of tasty options you should consider for lunch.. or whatever meal it is you're calling it.. you won't be hungry after!\n\nI've eaten outside in the sun, but this is more of a stop in, order your sandwich and take it with you kind of place. Or call ahead. Not a fancy sit-down dinner.
