Quick dinner\/meeting.... we call it a meeting so it can be expensed. A solid beer list, including a few local brews. I opted for the Pasta Brio and it was delicious. Our waiter was spot on, never leaving us with an empty glass or bread basket. I've eaten a few of their other locations, and each visit has been a positive experience.
