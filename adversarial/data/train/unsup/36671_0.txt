I love In-N-Out and I truly am sad that a lot of other states don't get to experience this burger. This location was fast and accurate. Ordering may be as easy as 1-2-3, however, I like to make it a bit more complicated which can be a hit or miss depending on the teenager behind the register =\/ So, usually my order is correct 3 out of 5 times so I give this location a 5 for being on top of their game.\n\nMy \"simple\" order: #1 (Double-Double), well done, no onions, fried ketchup, fried mustard NO PICKLES (that's where they go wrong sometimes and I HATE pickles), cheese fries well done\/crispy, a lemon up, and a neopolitan shake. Oh, and extra spread for the fries...YUM!\n\nThey are pretty fast too...no matter how long the line is they keep a good pace going and rarely make the wait longer than 5 minutes.
