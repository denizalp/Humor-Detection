Well, I would not call this service......after waiting for a complete day to have my refrigerator serviced, Mario came by to take a look.  He moved my refrigerator to the side and claimed that the area around the coils needed to be cleaned (albeit that they had been cleaned in May 2012).  He did request an additional $40 for his service.  The refrigerator is not working, what am I to say......\n\nFinally he cleaned the coils and then made another recommendation that the water line be replaced by him for $20.00.  He was unable to find the water line, so much for the additional expenditure.\n\nHe said that he believed that it should operate efficiently, but the compressor may need to be replaced and to wait a day.  After one day, two trips later to buy dry ice and $$$ worth of spoiled food, he claimed to the service company - Platinum Home Warranty that my refrigerator was neglected.  Hello, it was cleaned and serviced last May, not exactly neglect.\n\nConsidering that I am recovering from surgery and must have the refrigerator in working order, I was not too excited to find out that I cannot leave the house, but now must find a new refrigerator.\n\nHe would not even answer my call to find out the status of his presumed second visit.\n\nHe not only solicited me for additional services outside of the $60.00 service call, he even solicited for his friend Marco the plumber.\n\nNext time I hope to have a repairman who can get it right the first time!
