Excellent show!\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is watch Broadway musicals. Jersey Boys has become one of my favorite of all time! Saw the Jersey Boys on stage while on their North American National Tour, watched not once but 4x! Originally saw my first Jersey Boys at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco in the spring of 2007.  What a performance! Watched them again when the tour came to Broadway Sacramento at the Community Center Theater three months later. In Las Vegas had to see the show again at the Palazzo in 2008 and again in 2010. Loved each time! What was amazing to me was the character of Tommy DeVito, whose role was played by Deven May, he was in each of the shows I watched, no understudies or substitutes.  Deven was the perfect Tommy role.  The role of Bob Gaudio, played perfectly by Erich Bergen, was part of the cast on three of the shows I saw. He is my favorite Jersey Boy. When hubby and I participated in a research at CBS Television City at the MGM in Las Vegas it looked like he was giving television a shot as he played a small role in the drama pilot, 'Madam Secretary'. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_details_review_search?userid=Hm0diOkWwpo9zotlJlqMUQ&q=television.   Anyway, I digress... \n\nJersey Boys was about four guys from New Jersey that would hit the top of the music charts over and over again with their quartet singing group, The Four Seasons. It is a sweet story of friendship, success, love and eventual break-up of the group. Frankie Valli, Bob Gaudio, Nick Massi, and Tommy DeVito are the Jersey Boys. Their story is true as each one narrates their own version on stage. The music you've heard before... hits like \"Sherry\" * \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" * \"Walk Like A Man\" * \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" * \"December, 1963 (Oh What A Night)\". Not only were the songs sang with traditional bass guitar, drums and keyboard but the songs toward the end included a horn section. It was great and fun to listen to (and even sing along with... quietly :)  The story is for mature audience so I would not recommend for children.\n\nAt the movies! I also saw the 2014 musical drama film directed and produced by Clint Eastwood.  The actor who played Frankie Valli was the original Frankie on Broadway in New York City. Jersey Boys has since moved from the Palazzo to their new home in Paris Las Vegas at the Jersey Boys Theater.  Definitely, Ces soirées-là!\n\nJERSEY BOYS LAS VEGAS PLAYED ITS FINAL PERFORMANCE ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2016\n\nReview #0337
