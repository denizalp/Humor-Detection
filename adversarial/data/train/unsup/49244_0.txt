This pace has been on my cheat meal list for a while now! \nOn a whim I tried it today and I'm glad it did. \n\nAmbiance\/atmosphere: this is a cute little shop reminiscent of a diner but it's not old fashioned\n\nService: admitted the menu and order process is a bit overwhelming  your first time in. They have several types of products and their own language. However the young lady working was extremely nice and helpful. I told her it was my first visit and she walked me through the order process and made suggestions. \n\n\nFood: I tried a blendini, which is a blend of Italian ice and custard with a topping mixed in and an Oreo ice cream Cookie sandwich. Both were really good. \n\nI'm glad I stopped in and I'll be back!
