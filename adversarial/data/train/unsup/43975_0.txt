Went for my birthday, ordered fried chicken, macaroni & cheese and bread pudding for dessert. \nThe chicken was really good, the skin was nice and crunchy while the inside remained juicy. The mac & cheese was good, a little to cheesy for me but it was tasty.\nI normally hate bread pudding but this bread pudding was absolutely delicious.\nMy aunt ordered just a plate of green beans and they were really good.\nOur server was really nice and a cutie, unfortunately I don't remember his name all I do know is he just moved to Vegas not too long ago and he is married.\nOverall I will definitely eat here again. \nOh I ordered 1 biscuit so I can see what the fuss was about and it was really good.
