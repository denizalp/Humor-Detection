Never, not even in my wildest dreams I thought I would give one star to a place where we spent $500 for a dinner for two. Never in my life I spent so much money for so little, mediocre food and was so hungry three hours later I had to stop somewhere else after the show to grab a snack.\n\nMaybe the fact we walked in with no reservation on a Friday night at 8pm and there were only three tables occupied should be a sign. But we wanted good sushi, so we ignored the red flag. Empty house on a Friday night in Vegas means something, and it means awful.\n\nTo start, our server was unenthusiastic and said they did not offer Omakase. We were a bit puzzled when he left but then he stopped half way and turned around and said \"well, depending on what you're looking for, we can work something out for about $150\/person\". He sounded like a sketchy used car dealer. We were like \"um, never mind, thanks\".\n\nWe ordered the small sashimi sample plate, small sushi sample plate and a steak dish. We asked him \"is this enough for the two of us\"? And he said \"absolutely\". When the food arrived our first reaction was \"is this part 1? Where's part 2?\". Obviously we had to order another small sample plate, and a bunch of other stuff. For the grace of God, the only good thing we got was the jalape√±o octopus. It had a lot of flavor and a great kick to it, awesome sauce we later used to dip our tasteless sushi in.\n\nOur server left without saying good bye (rude) and a new friendly and attentive server took over, praise The Lord. Her name is Bonnie. Bonnie was the only positive thing about our night. She was sweet, attentive, she listened well to our disappointment and was very apologetic. She said they get that complain quite often (that the portions were ridiculously small), which made us wonder why in the world don't they do anything about it? Bonnie was awesome.\n\nI understand the concept of fine dining because I worked as a sommelier for a fine dining restaurant back in San Diego. I understand that they dont serve huge portions and I get that sushi is a delicate art, therefore the quality is more important than the quantity. But when you drop $80 on a plate with 5 tiny slices of fish you really expect something mind blowing out of it. Leaving a restaurant still hungry after ordering more than 6 items when this is not a tapas place is simply unacceptable.\n\n$570 later (6 items and a bottle of unfiltered sake plus tip), we headed to our show. Feeling like the two most stupid people on earth for getting so ripped-off. I will never be back again.
