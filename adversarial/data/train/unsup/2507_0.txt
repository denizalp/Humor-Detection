Great food! But I would love to enjoy that food without the waitress in the corner doing nothing but \"trying to pickup a rich guy to support her daughter\" that's all I'm listening to right now. Its like a live soap opera, interesting but ANNOYING. She's working at the wrong restaurant. Our waitress was  nice and food was good.
