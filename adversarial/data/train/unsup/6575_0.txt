UPDATE: There's nothing more unprofessional than the owner contacting me privately through Yelp messages to rudely defend herself. I would never recommend this nail salon to anyone.\n\nWe came here during the day before my sister's bachelorette weekend in Vegas as we were intrigued by its high Yelp rating and close proximity to a restaurant nearby. It would've been a decent experience if my nail tech wasn't talking about me in Vietnamese, to another nail tech, without realizing I'm Vietnamese and fluent in the language. \n\nIt wasn't until the owner came over and asked if I was Asian, which I said yes to, and then if I was Vietnamese, which I also said yes to, but in perfect Vietnamese. At that point I saw my nail tech cringe and after that, she awkwardly tried to make small talk with me. \n\nRegardless of their poor hospitality, they're also really bad at doing nails. The owner did my eldest sister's nails, and when she smudged the pinky and was asked to fix it, just slopped on another layer of top coat. It came out lumpy so the male nail tech, Michael, had to redo it. The other nail tech who did my other sister's nails completely fudged up her pedicure and it wound up looking like something a three-year old could paint. My nails came out looking okay, but quickly chipped a few hours later. \n\nTLDR; if you're looking for a nail salon before your big Vegas weekend, don't come here.
