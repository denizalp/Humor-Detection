Komol has been on my radar for about a year and I finally stopped in Wednesday evening.  \n\nI knew from looking at the menu online that I wanted to try a duck dish.  I ordered the duck chili mint - boneless duck stir fried with garlic, hot peppers, and basil.  After reading the Yelp reviews of people I know, I opted for a spiciness level of 6 out of 10.  It turned out to be just about perfect considering the dish was spiced with red chilis and several slices of fresh jalape√±o.  Tasty indeed but not overwhelming.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the pumpkin in coconut milk.  It was fresh pumpkin cubes in sweetened and warmed coconut milk.  Very good!\n\nService was excellent.  When I asked the server about the size of a cup of soup, he told me it's generally too big for one person--people often split it--and I opted to skip having soup.  It was early and the restaurant was quiet, but everyone who works there was cheerful, greeted me, and had a big smile.\n\nThanks for the tips, Misti, Mamie, Holly, and Paolo!\n\nI have to go back and try some more.  It is good!
