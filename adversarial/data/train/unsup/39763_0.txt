This place has came a long way. A few years ago, there were nothing but under aged wannabe go-go dancer girls and boys who looked like they just got outta juvie. The tables and chairs looked like they belonged in a cheap restaurant. Now, there are actual lounge like couches, a couple tvs, a fairly decent DJ area, oh yeah, and the go-go dancers and juveniles are gone . I was here this past Saturday, from 930 til about 11 and it was almost completely dead. (I was also here about two months ago and it was empty as well) The DJ started the night playing country, which was awesome. Then when more people started to show up, it was nothing but rap music, which is lame. It would have been a better experience if the music was switched up, I also think it could potentially be a fun place to dance a little if the music was good. The employees are nice and check on you about every 15 min, your coals are included and get switched out for free, they give you 3 unless you request only 2. Both times my friends and I had the employees make any type of fruity tobacco at their discretion, and both times it was good!
