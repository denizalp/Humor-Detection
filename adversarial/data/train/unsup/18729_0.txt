Though a charming landmark in the much adored Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood, this theater is anything but capital. I was not around during the time the theater was out of commission, so perhaps its original state was more W. 65th street brothel\/fallout shelter than I can imagine, but I don't really understand the rave reviews about the remodeling and decor.\n     Thick, white paint covers most of the walls, and the wooden staircases are quite sterile and bare, with not even a coat of varnish or finish to add some shine to the walk toward your film.  Certainly, the outdoor marquee warmly lights up the neighborhood, and it is charming to have a local theater nearby, but as I traveled toward my movie, I began to wonder what all the hyperbolic fuss was about.\n     I was at the Capitol to see \"A Single Man,\" and when I entered the theater, there was, in fact, one single man sitting alone in the room.  This wouldn't have been anything but a rather literal coincidence at any other theater, but the lights were so bright and the room so small, that I felt like I was intruding on his space.  Rarely do I feel the need to make awkward conversation with strangers at the theater, but the design and lighting of the space made anonymity impossible; all patrons are essentially on stage as soon as they enter.  Approaching my seat, I felt like I'd suddenly been trapped on an elevator with this single man, and we'd have to survive on popcorn and JuJu Fruit until someone rescued us.  As others trickled in, patrons actually waved to them, as if to welcome them to our bizarrely shaped room and the unusual atmosphere into which they had just entered.\n        Real estate agents sometimes use the words \"quaint\" and \"intimate\" as euphemisms for the truth about the excruciatingly small properties they are peddling.  I have read the same terms about the experience of seeing a film at the Capitol Theatre, but I have no kind euphemisms for the seats that had a vice grip on my knees for the duration of the film.  I was substantially more comfortable on a Chinatown bus ride from NY to Philly squeezed tightly next to a snoring, obese fellow passenger than I was next to my date at the film.  Granted, I am tall, but I couldn't even put my feet down in front of me because of the lack of space.  I had to search the rows to find the one seat without a chair in front of it, as if I were some parishoner at a 17th century church imagined by Nathaniel Hawthorne.  I felt like the scarlet letter I was wearing was \"E\" for \"enormous,\" as I trolled the seats in bright light to find one that would accommodate the fact that I grew past the age of 7.\n        I appreciate the efforts of the Capitol Theater to provide quality films in a local, neighborhood setting, and their efforts to join the Detroit-Shoreway movement have not gone unnoticed.   I'm sure that I will return because I love this neighborhood and can smell the popcorn from Gypsy Bean, but next time I'll be sure to give myself an epidural before I sit down to watch.
