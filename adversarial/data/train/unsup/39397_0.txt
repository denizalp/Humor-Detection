Moo & Brew is a great concept. Burgers and beer? Sign me up. \n\nI like that this festival has a wide range of beers. However, most of the beers are the typical beers for most breweries, so I felt like it was hard for me to find something new. I wish they had all brought a \"one off\" or something to keep it interesting. I have a hard time spending $45 on a ticket when I know I can already get all the beers elsewhere. \n\nThe burger stands were good. I felt like only 4 stands for all of Charlotte and for the whole festival was a little low. The lines weren't bad, but I wanted to try more burgers. Also, you pay for a ticket and then still have to pay for burgers. I understand why this needs to be done, but if the beer is standard, can I get a token or two for at least one or two baby burgers along with my ticket price?\n\nOverall, I like this festival a lot and it is a good time. I just feel as though one time may be enough for me. I don't feel like I will need to go every year, as I am not sure there will be anything new to experience. \n\nAnother upset with this festival= cash only (which you need for the burgers). They did not notify me of this until I entered the gate and then they said no re-entry. And there was no ATM! (or one that I was aware of)\n\nBang Bang is the best!
