I decided to go to this location because its closer than the Scottsdale one where I originally got my contact lens prescription. Next time I will drive to Scottsdale to avoid the terrible service. Ended up waiting nearly 30 minutes just to get my new contacts. There was only one guy working the optical department and a massive amount of people and phone calls coming in. Obviously they need to staff better because you could tell he was getting flustered and was blatantly rude to a couple of the customers ahead of me. For my new (disposable) contacts it was $50. $50 for a two-week prescription! Are you freaking kidding me? Needless to say I went in with a headache and left with a migraine.\n\nOh and on top of that I thought getting a slice of delicious Costco pizza would help after such a crap experience but alas I was wrong. The lady at the food court (again there was only ONE person working) was rude and I felt I was in a drill line. She literally threw my receipt at me. Well, geeze thanks. Oh and the pizza definitely didn't taste like the Costco pizza I'm used to.\n\nFurthermore, what the hell is wrong with people who live over here? Not only were the employees rude but so were the customers.\n\nThree strikes and I'm out of there.
