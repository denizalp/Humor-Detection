Food was ok. Way overpriced! The service was ok, nothing special. I've received much better service from lower scale restaurants by a mile. The service wasn't bad, just not attentive. The food is way too expensive for no reason. I can think of at least 5 higher class restaurants with better food quality, better service, less expensive. I don't think I would ever come back.\n\nThis is post your comment, Jeff. \n - 1. I never argued with anyone regarding pricing, I just showed you that the Yelp menu differed from\nyours. As a matter of fact, I didn't even tell her the pricing was different, I just showed it personally to you. Nor did I mention in my review that you made the mistake of showing the public two different menu prices.  \n\n2. It's never professional to use vulgar language in a review, this reveals immaturity and inability to receive constructive criticism - the first thing you mentioned to me was tell you how I felt. \n\n3. Your wife's service was not bad, I never said her service was bad, just not attentive like I mentioned above. I've had much less experienced waiters\/waitresses that provided me with better service. \n\n4. It's nothing to take personal, it's something to learn and improve from.\n\n5. If leaving an honest review of something that didn't meet my expectations defines that I'm a bad human being, I think you need to reconsider what the definition of being a good\/bad human being is.\n\n6. Are customers not entitled to order what they want? There is a reason why we didn't finish the food that we didn't box and also a reason why that tip was left. Also, if you look at other reviews that were not to your liking, you will notice there is a consistency with what I reviewed as well. \n\n7. 5 restaurants that are less expensive and better. Also, their ambiance is much more elegant except Greek life. One thing you did great on is the way your restaurant was set up outside. \nMaggiano\nPersian room\nPostino\nSwitch\nOpa Greek Life
