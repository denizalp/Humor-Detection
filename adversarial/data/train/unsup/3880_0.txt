This place is so good. From the exceptionally calm and helpful front desk to the amazing massage therapist to Dr Hayes himself, this place rocks. I've never experienced more instantaneous pain relief than I have going to this Chiro. Doesn't seem to matter what's wrong with me - he pops me back into place and off I go. \n\nI highly recommend him
