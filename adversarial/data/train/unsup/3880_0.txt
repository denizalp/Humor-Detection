So to support our local small businesses we decided to give this new Hawaiian Restaurant a shot. \nWe try not to judge a book by its cover. Its not in the best location and there is no parking lot so street parking it is. \nInside this small establishment was quite unexpected. Cracked ceiling tiles to the faded green seats and sticky tables. It also greeted us with dirty carpet throughout the dining area. \n\nWe walked in and decided on what to eat. \n\nI had the Loco Moco. It was ok. Maybe im spoiled from the other Hawaiian restaurants but the patty was dry and had no flavor. The gravy was ok. Not as flavor full as I had hoped. Over-medium egg...who screws that up? But thats all it was. Rice, Patty, Gravy & Egg.. Where is the Mac Salad?? For the price I paid I thought it wouldve came with it. \n\nMy wife ordered the Bento Box. Which included Teri Beef, Mochiko Chicken, Hot Dog, Pork Hash (1pc) & Chow Fun.\nTeri Beef - The beef tasted raw but the teri sauce was trying to hide most of its flavor. Ate 2 of the 4 pieces. \nMochiko Chicken - It was good. Dry but good. \nHot Dog - Not a Redondo but it was a beef hot dog. \nPork Hash - It was good. The meat was dry also. And not a flavorful like the ones you can get at Chinese Restaurants. \nChow Fun - Stir fried with veggies. This was the best thing in the bento box. \n\nAs I sit here in the restaurant writing this review the lady placed other peoples order on our table and walks away...\n\nIf you want overpriced mediocre Hawaiian food then come try it. But I'll guarantee you'll be better off somewhere else. \nGood Luck to this business.
