I finally checked this place out with my girlfriend, and loved it.  It feels like a small town grocer.  The selection was interestingly varied.  Yes, the prices are a bit on the high side; however, one must take into consideration that they are a small independent store, which carries organic and specialty items.  The employees were polite and helpful.  I feel the store name is not quite accurate, though I shall not down rate for that.  \n   Overall, I'd definitely recommend this shop to others.
