I was looking for a specific bed by Jonathan Louis that not many stores carry, I found out that Levin carried the bed.  On two occasions I visited the Oakwood store and both times not one person asked if they could help me.  I walked through the entire store and not one person asked if I needed help.  On the second visit I asked an sales associate for help just for the hell of it.  He was not very informative and lacked knowledge of the bed.  I asked him why no would had asked if I needed help and his excuse was, oh everyone is busy marking furniture for the big sale tomorrow.  I said oh really.  Sooooo, I politely thanked him and left the store.  On Saturday morning, I drove to Fairlawn and was met by a very nice, and so knowledgeable lady that helped me over and above.  Tonya S.  I thank you so very much for all your help and expertise.  You are one awesome sales associate.  Just as an FYI to any readers or Oakwood store associates, I went to Fairlawn on the day of the BIG SALE..  Tonya S., I'll be back to make all my future purchases and I will referr all my family and friends to you.  Thank you for all of your help, you made spending all that money for the bed well worth it.  Now, I'll be sooooo happy when my bed is delivered.
