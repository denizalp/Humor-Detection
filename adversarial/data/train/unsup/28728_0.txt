This is probably my favorite place to grab a bite to eat because of the quality of food and the convenience. Although, recently I've noticed that lately it seems that the meals are not getting the attention they need in the preparation process. Usually the amount of chicken you get in the BBQ meal is sufficient, but lately the amount I've been receiving seems to have significantly decreased in comparison to when this restaurant first opened. Also, the Naan bread used to be baked perfectly but now it's literally burnt to a crisp and it's almost like a cracker rather than bread. I would absolutely recommend this place and give it a full 5 stars if these matters could be fixed.
