I went to Reb Robin on Friday (Veterans Day observed) and say they had the \"Table Set for One\" on display for customers to observe. I thought that was very heartwarming given the Holiday and I love how they included that touch to honor Veterans. On top of that the service the waitress provided was exceptional. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name but she was the nicest lady who did her best to ensure we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. When the food came it was exactly how we ordered and fresh off the grill. Amazing service, great food, and they honored our veterans.. what more can you ask for? Great job Red Robin!
