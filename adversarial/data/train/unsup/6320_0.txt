First Wolfgang Puck experience and it was superb!! I had the quail dish and it was the most delicious plate of bird I've ever had! service is top notch and they take very good care of their customers here! Don't forget to save room for dessert!\n\nComing dressed extra nice will help you bypass the line and get you a table inside!
