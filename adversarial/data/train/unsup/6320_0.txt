I purchased a 2016 Salem Villa from Avalon RV in Medina, Ohio on 9\/14\/2016.  The trailer was delivered by Avalon RV to Holiday Camplands in Andover, Ohio on 9\/18\/2016.  On delivery, the furnace fuse was blown.  The next day, I purchased a new fuse and attempted to replace.  When the ends of the fuse touched the panel, it immediately sparked and blew. \n\nI reported the issue to Avalon RV on 9\/19\/2016 but the service department was closed.  I called again on 9\/21\/2016.  \n\nI contacted Avalon RV again multiple times on 9\/22\/2016, but did not receive a return call until 9\/24\/2016 after I e-mailed the General Manager on 9\/23\/2016.  On 9\/24\/2016, the service department informed me that they only service units in a 50-mile radius of their shop. They offered technical assistance over the phone.\n\nOn 9\/25\/2016, I paid out of pocket for a local electrician to troubleshoot the issue.  He found that there are likely two short-circuits in the wiring and possibly a bad electrical board in the furnace compartment.\n\nThe product was delivered in this condition, and now the dealership is not only non-responsive, but is refusing to service a product that was damaged upon delivery.
