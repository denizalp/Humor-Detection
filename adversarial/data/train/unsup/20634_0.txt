Imagine how it is when you are feed like are in a factory assemble line?\nImagine waitress just throw food on your table without stopping?\nImagine you are in a small crowded restaurant when the only goal of the waitstaffs is to get you out ASAP so more customers can be served?\n\nHanabi Sushi is the place to be! Runned by Korean sushi chef owner with 1 Korean waitress and one Mandarian speaking waitress.\n\nThe price here is really cheap.. you can get a all day specials for $6.95 or a lunch special for $4.95  which included salad, soup, appetitizers, main course and ice cream at a lighting speed!\n\nAfter I order, my salad and appetitizer and Korean congee appeared on my table in the count of 5! Then in less than 5 minute my table is full of food!\n\nThe miso soup is really strange mixture of bean sprout, shredded carrot and tofu.. it is a huge bowl and does not taste like miso soup at all!\n\nAnother disappointment is there are only Salmon for Sashimi.. so in my combo B ($10.95) I have only Salmon instead of a mix Sashimi. The sushi roll I found the rice are little hard and they are not the real round sushi rice. \n\nTempera has 2 shrimps and 2 yams.. they tasted ok.. for the price I paid..at least the shrimps are fresh.\n\nServices here is fast and impersonal.\n\nIt will be a good place if you are starving student on a limited budget and just want to stuff yourself with food... but if you looking for quality over quantities, go somewhere else.\n\nThey accepts all credit cards.
