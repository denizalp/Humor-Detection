My boyfriend's car battery needed to be replaced and we decided to come here for the following reasons:\n\n1) We had a $20 off coupon for Autozone and the shop honored it.\n\n2) Bank of America cash rewards credit card is currently offering 5% cash back at Autozone. \n\n3) It was close to where we were planning to have dinner at. \n\nWe were extremely satisfied with our customer experience at Autozone.  EJ helped my bf find the type of battery for his car and it is their policy to install the battery free of charge if we purchase it from them. EJ had been working on cars since he was 16 and was very knowledgeable.  He was very personable and patient when answering our questions (like a natural people person). He also had this happy demeanor about him! In short, we had an excellent customer experience with EJ and shopping at AutoZone.\n\nWe highly recommend this location.  Another plus is that this location is open 24 hours!\n\nThere are at least 10 parking spots right outside the shop!
