We've been coming here for the past 3 years and honestly, it's an inexpensive alternative to the typical Las Vegas brand of entertainment that ask for your $$$. Every time we come here, we leave with lots of stuffed animals for the kiddos.\nThis past trip my wife wanted me to win her a large stuffed animal. Not a problem, says I. I was her knight in shining armor! I ended up winning her a large rainbow colored owl. \nThen my second son saw them: those little annoying fidget spinners. I don't know how many we won (I think about 4 of them). \nEither way, it was fun and we will keep coming back so the kiddos can enjoy themselves at a low cost!!!
