I came here after work today to do carry out. I only come here for one item and that's the Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls. They are addicting and filling even though it only comes with three rolls. These have chicken,lettuce, fresh mint, carrots, peanuts ,rice noodles, with a taste of lime vinaigrette rolled in a rice wrapper. It comes with sweet chili sauce and Thai peanut sauce on the side. My personal favorite is the peanut sauce. \nI enjoy doing carry out because it's ready for me to pick up right after work. When I call in my order it's quick and fast because by my phone number they can tell what I ordered last time. I was recently made aware that they also have a frequent diner card there too. I just started using it today so I don't know their point system. If it means every once in a while I can get these rolls for free then I'm in!
