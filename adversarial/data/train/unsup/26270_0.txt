This is a great little noodle shop! Despite its small menu (soup noodles OR zhajiangmian) the taste is exactly what you'd expect from a traditional noodle shop that serves hand-pulled noodles.\n\nThe place is very small and busy so it's best to get there early before it fills up. Portions are also extremely generous and definitely hard to finish a large on your own. Service is usually surprisingly fast as the place is very well staffed for its size.
