OH boy, Doughboy!  Use to have the pizza on a regular basis when worked nearby but sad to say that was a few years ago.  We were in the area and took a pizza home.  Delicious with a thicker crust and a nice sauce.  If you are in the area a good stop.\nTake out only.  They do have pizza by the slice.
