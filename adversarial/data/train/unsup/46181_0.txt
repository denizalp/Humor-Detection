This is one of my favourite coffee shops in Toronto. They serve great coffee and know what they're doing. I loved the vanilla bean latte. I would come here to study or chat with friends. Definitely would recommend studying here, as the natural lighting and comfortable seating make for a great space for concentration, especially sipping on a perfectly frothed latte. Thanks again!
