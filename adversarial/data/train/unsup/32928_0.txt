If you are in the mood for outdoor fun, this store has all the equipment, the clothes, and gizmo's and gadgets to help you enjoy it. My husband and I love to come in and browse every department. \n\nWe used to fish a lot, but since our move to the valley there is less time for that, but none the less looking at all of their fishing supplies gives us pleasure and perhaps one day we'll go fishing again. \n\nBut there are other departments to enjoy, they have a large selection of men's, women's and children's clothing, everything from everyday wear to the serious hiker, or camper. They took out the fine jewelry department, but they have kept the house wares with plenty of blankets, bathroom decor, and wind chimes. Perfect for my sister and her hubby since they are so \"western\", (they have cowboy themed bath towels), there is even cooking items. Like blueberry pancake batter and hot sauces, dutch oven apple pie, and canned corn and relishes. \n\nThe upstairs has a nice selection of hand guns, riffles, an indoor shooting range, archery equipment, and all of the things needed to enjoy them. Since this store is connected to the Silverton Casino, once you're done browsing or buying, you can stop by the casino for a little gambling or dinner. Be sure to check out the two choppers just outside the store, as seen on the show, \"American choppers\" these bikes are awesome.
