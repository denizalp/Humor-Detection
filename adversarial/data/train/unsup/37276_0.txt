On my second and last night in vegas, my suite was not serviced by 6pm so i called housekeeping and complained. Returned to my suite at 8pm and had to call again because suite still had not been serviced. Spoke to three managers and only got excuses. This is unacceptable for the price paid for a suite. I was expecting some type of compensation and all I received were excuses.
