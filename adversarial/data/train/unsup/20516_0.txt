I love this store! It very close and convenient! It's clean and friendly with beautiful produce! Checking out is normally quick and smooth. They are quick to help you with anything. Once an employee over heard me talking about how they were out of my milk and approached me and told me he had some in the back. He got the milk for me immediately. \nMy only issue is the outrageous process on the oils. Any oil what so ever is very over priced. That's a big bummer for me since I use and depend on them a lot. I purchase then for other locations and online.
