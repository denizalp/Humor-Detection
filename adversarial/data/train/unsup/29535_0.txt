Both my glasses and contact prescriptions were wrong after my initial visit. I brought in my old prescription (from my old eye doctor from Charlotte), they re-ordered my contacts with the prescription I brought in from my previous doctor and now I can see. To top it off, they billed my insurance incorrectly and want me to pay for my exam out of pocket. Would NOT recommend this office. Very disappointed.
