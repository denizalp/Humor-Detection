First time patient (finally made it by) Was referred there by the clinic (precision on camelback) when renewing my card- I dig that they do deli style, but I don't really like the packaging. The place I usually go to uses nice plastic recyclable pop top containers which don't crush the flower and also keep the smell in (my car stank after the 10 minute ride home) Additionally, the buds were very well-trimmed from the jar, but they didn't cut off the stems for me. \n\nTyler was a nice 'tender and gave me good recommendations. The lobby is pretty fancy and when I went there were plenty of parking spaces around the back. I do appreciate there being a security guard at the entrance. A bit pricey (we are paying for the guard's salary and rent on camelback\/7th street after all) I would give 4.5 stars if I could. The selection seemed pretty good as far as flower goes and the back area was nice and quiet.\n\nOverall nice experience, ftp special (bogo up to a quarter) is a great deal. This location is really close to my house so if I have a little extra $ and not a lot of time Swell will be where I go.
