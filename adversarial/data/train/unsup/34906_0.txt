The Museum of Inuit Art (MIA) is a hidden little gem located on the first floor of the Harbourfront Centre.  Admission is $5 for seniors and students, and $6 for adults. When I visited in August 2009, the weekends allowed free admission since it was being sponsored by a corporate bank. \n\nFrom the mall, you can view a number of paintings through the glass windows. The rest of the gallery is petite, but has enough pieces to distinguish between various mediums and stylistic differences between Inuit groups. What I found most rewarding in this collection were small whale bone sculptures and the contemporary and abstract Inuit art, something that is not often depicted in popular culture. \n\nIf you walk through and read the displays, as well as taking time to view some of the many videos playing by the gift shop, an average visit may take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. As well, there is a small kids' section in the back, which occasionally plays films from the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).\n\nWorthwhile for every single Canadian to partake in.
