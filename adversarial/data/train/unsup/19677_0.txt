Watch out, they have gotten so many bad reviews that they have changed the name of the store.  I swear I felt like I was dealing with a gypsy fortune teller.  I supposedly met with the owner of the company.  She would not let me go when I told her I needed to leave.  Very high pressure sales tactics!  I did not realize that their receipt said \"NO REFUNDS\" \n\nThey now call themselves EUPHORIE STORE.
