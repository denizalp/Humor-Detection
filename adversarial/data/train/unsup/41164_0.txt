Interesting. I guess everyone has different experiences with this company. In my case I just needed to do a quick move as I had a deadline to move out and I was running out of time. I just needed all the big furniture moved using someone else's muscles and backbones. A friend suggested I rent a truck and spend a weekend doing it with his help - but when I did the math, it seemed worth it to pay a little more and leave the heavy lifting to someone else. The chiropractor bills alone would probably cost more than the service these guys provide. These guys give you a range of about an hour for when they'll show up. Luckily for me they showed up near the end of that range because I was still staging all the furniture near the entrance to help accelerate the whole process. The bulk of the time was taken up by the actual drive across town. Everything else was very quick and smooth. The two folks that did my move were VERY professional and quite obviously very experienced as they suggested things I didn't even consider to make the move go smoothly. The best part about it was that it was so quick and smooth I was able to go to work just an hour later than usual rather than having to take the whole day off just to do this.
