The real deal when it comes to Thai in Vegas. Forget the wait at Lotus!! Not worth it.\n\nOpen late (until 3am!), staff is super friendly and food is authentic. I can't even remember what the food we had was called. I let my Thai friend do all the ordering. My only request was papaya salad, and that was so good. Everything else was amazing too. I wish I had a bigger stomach or a second stomach so I could eat more. \n\nI would recommend you come here with a small group so you can try a variety of things. Great wine list too.
