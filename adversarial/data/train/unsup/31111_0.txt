My go to place for relaxation (ie booze) after work! They have a wide (and I mean wide!) selection of beer from all over the world! I usually go for German beer but if you're unsure of what you want to get, the server would be more than happy to make some suggestions for you.\n\nThe poutine tastes pretty decent too!
