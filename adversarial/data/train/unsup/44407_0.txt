I think I've been here a good 3 or 4 times - mostly on poker comps and mostly already with a good buzz going as I'm entering the place so take this with a grain of salt. (When you've got the munchies after hitting the bottle, even a bag of cheetos is gonna seem like a 3 course meal).\n\nTry to get a seat on the outside balcony overlooking the strip. That way you can enjoy the food and the pirate show. The crowds that gather for it are ridiculous but if you're in the restaurant you're gonna have a great view.\n\nThe food itself is obviously overpriced and seems a little rich which is probably why it tastes great. I don't remember seeing anything extraordinary on the menu but everything I've ever tried here, from the rolls, to kobe sliders to the chocolate balls in a bag (dessert) were all at least pretty good. Some were great.\n\nThe service has been kind of spotty. We've been sat down before and then asked to change tables, been forgotten by our waiters occasionally, etc.\n\nWith all that in mind its still a fun place with a sexy atmosphere. I would come back here time and time again.
