This place is such a fun find. I got the turkey and Brie sandwich that was $8. Good size, it was served on a fresh baguette with cranberry preserves and was so delicious. I also got the pommes frites which was such a great side of fries and garlic aioli. Highly recommend getting and order (or two) of those. Their iced latte was yummy as well. My friend and I shared an order of their beignets.... and oh my goodness exactly what you want in a beignet. Overall everything tasted great and I have no complaints about anything.
