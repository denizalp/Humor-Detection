I was beyond starving when I arrived here.  From the modern and clean appearance, I figured I was in for a delicious meal.  They kept the menu pretty simple, which is nice when you're tired of making decisions and just want to eat.  Besides hamburgers, they offer grilled chicken and veggie burger.  I especially liked how they offer a small version of the bugers vs the regular version.   \n\nI went for the small cheeseburger combo ($9) that comes with a drink and fries.  After ordering, you get to decide what goes on the burger (eek...more decisions!) but I kept it simple with just lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and ketchup.  Even with this small version, I still had trouble finishing the entire meal.  Perhaps my body was already in starvation mode and had shrunk my stomach.  The burger was a bit dry and bland.  The home cut fries looked good, but the taste didn't follow suit.  Moral of the meal: All that glitters is not gold.\n\nParking:  The parking at the mall parking garage was packed, but we managed to find a spot.
