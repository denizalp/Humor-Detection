I scream, You scream, We all scream for Ice Cream!! I love ice cream and I am a fan of Baskin Robbins. This particular location is small with just a few tables for seating, but not really a big deal. What was an issue was the cleanliness, the tables were dirty, the counter was dirty and the floor needed to be swept. But that issue did not deter me from enjoying the ice cream yumminess. I let the girl know I needed a minute to decide and she gave me the time needed to stare at the deliciousness that sat behind the glass. Finally I ordered 1 scoop of the pistachio almond on a sugar cone. YUM! The service is fast, friendly and efficient.\nI will be back for a treat.
