Place has been pretty good for sushi when I have gone out with my coworkers, but I think quality has been hit or miss.I was greeted right away and asked for a table since the bar was full. As I passed by for a possible table of 4, I was parked in a corner right up next to the cash register. Tight. I was worried my co-worker would have to squeeze into their seat and sure enough it was. I asked about the empty table that we walked by earlier, but that was only for four people. Oh well, we were both too hungry to be too picky. Had the all you can eat sushi lunch as usual and it started pretty good. Ordered the Seafood Salad in both spicy and mild. It's basically all fish without the rice. Nice, but you get only one order per person with AYCE. The spicy Seafood Salad was a little too spicy for me, but the mild was much better. Ordered the Harry Potter roll and that was my least favorite. No real outstanding flavor and the fish did not taste sushi quality. The more simple sushi options like tuna, salmon, and whit tuna rolls were better than the Harry Potter on, but still not getting that really clean ocean taste that I have had here before. Plenty of servers though. So I was able to get service pretty quick, although me sitting right next to the register might have something to do with it as different severs had to close out checks and tables. A plus maybe? The Eel handroll, had rice, cucumbers, avocado, and eel. One of my avocado slice still had the skin on as I was eating it. Boo. My coworker said her Eel handroll was fine though. \n\nOverall, service here is good and friendly. I would come back for the Seafood Salad alone as that was the freshest tasting item we had. Unfortunately, my friend and I did not feel well after our lunch and concluded it's from the not also fresh batch of rolls we had last. My friend said may not come back, but I might give it another try at a later date in hopes today was an off day.
