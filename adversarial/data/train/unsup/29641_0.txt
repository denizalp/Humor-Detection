Horrible location. Walked in to fax some papers with my 1 year old son in my arms and the man behind the counter was helping an older gentleman and I was next. When he finished with him, the employee looked at me, smiled, and walked off. Hello? Wasn't I next in line? He never asked if I needed anything nor said that someone else would be up to assist me. Instead I had to tote my son around to find someone to help me. Finally I found the \"greeter\" and she said she had no idea how to work the fax machine but she would call someone up for me. The person that came to help me was a snotty teenage girl that didn't say one word to me, just grabbed my papers, walked to the fax machine and told me \"there's a lot of papers, it's going to take a long time. When you see all of the papers on the pullout rack then your fax is done\" and then she walked off. I went to find her again to ask how much longer and she was in the middle of the store talking to two of her friends that had come in to visit her and she made eye contact with me and literally bolted to the other side of the store lol!!! OfficeMax you have some GREAT employees. Will not be coming back here ever again.
