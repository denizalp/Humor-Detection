Stopped in for a drink on a Wednesday nite and this place was packed! \nHad a nice selection of craft beer and was happy with our choices. \nThe Mr and I had just come from a Johnny Cash tribute show (not great, but that's a whole different review!) and were happier with the duo that was on stage playing than what we had just seen! \nThe atmosphere was awesome, and the only reason for a missing star was where we were seated. We seemed in the way and awkward but I will definitely be back! Loved this place.
