I've always enjoyed dining in this location in its previous incarnations and it seems that the dining pleasure will continue with this reboot. The new owners have done a good job with new decorative touches and with maintaining the bright spacious ambiance of the place. My yelp friends Rand, Scott, Monica, and I tried the Sunday lunch buffet and I thoroughly enjoyed pretty much everything I had. I started with mussels in a gingery herbal broth and proceeded to sample each of the main offerings - the flavorful pad thai, the delicious eggplant and tofu dish, the spicy curries, and other meat and vegetable dishes - all very good. The lively young hostess made sure that our water glasses were always filled and the dishes taken away as we went back to the serving area for more helpings. I'm looking forward to literally many happy returns to this restaurant.
