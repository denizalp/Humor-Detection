This place saved my life and sanity.  I made the huge mistake of going to this horrible and terrible salon called Visual Impact Salon in Scottsdale.  The person who did my hair was a nightmare.  My first time getting extensions and of course I didn't know what to do. I trusted the stylist and shouldn't have.  She put straight hair in wavy hair, she did colors that she swore matched my hair and they didn't. The cut was wrong, beads were falling out and the salon and manager were blaming me!!!\n\nBy the time I made it to Modern Hair Junkie I was crying daily as I watched my extensions fall out daily, making it to 100 pieces that came out in TWO WEEKS!!!  Thankfully Modern Hair Junkie was able to fix it, taking out all the ratty extensions that were also horribly placed in at unusual places.\n\nMy hair was also terribly dry from the blow out the other salon did, too bad the stylist had no clue what she was doing then either. MHJ was able to fix the dryness, the bad extensions, and made my hair look good again.\n\nI suggest you STEER CLEAR of VISUAL IMPACT SALON and their so called stylist Rachel Reedy.  GO TO MODER HAIR JUNKIE, not only did they do an amazing job, they were friendly, extremely funny, and it was a great atmosphere like family there. If the trauma ever wears off from what Visual Impact's Rachel Reedy did to me, then I'll get extensions again by this Salon for sure. They've got me as a client for life.
