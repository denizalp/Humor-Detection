Came to see JLO (limited engagement) in concert. Can you say WOW!  One of the best concerts I've gone to. She is an AMAZING performer and HOT! \n\nJLO encouraged the taking of pictures and videos. So bring it to capture and remember the moments. \n\nThe concert theater itself was not too large. One can still enjoy the show even from the last row. It was kind of weird how they maintained the lines going into the concert theater. But it was manageable, no pushing or shoving or cutting the lines. \n\nThey take pictures as you enter for souvenirs to be purchased after the concert.  However it was horrible to pick them up. There was no line structure or enough people to handle the crowd.  And the prices are expensive. Still a great place to see a concert.
