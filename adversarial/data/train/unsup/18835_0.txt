Duration: 4 1\/2 hours\nService: Alright\n\nThis was the first time I have ever traveled with Sunwing. I was travelling to Veradero, Cuba with a group of friends. I tend to travel a couple of times during the year overseas- generally with internationally known companies so this was an experience. (Note: there's rumours that Sunwing is expanding their company and there will be flights all around Europe)\n\nOn the flight, they offer their clients champagne for FREE to celebrate the vacation. I thought that incentive was cute. There's an option to upgrade your seat of $25, pretty much an upgrade for for leg space. A lot of times within a 4-5 hour flight the airline does not include food. But to my surprise they gave us food and dessert. It isn't as fancy as a regular flight but good enough to put you to sleep right after. \n\nOverall the flight was decent except for the landing. I thought I was going to die; I am dramatic but the landing for the flight was terrible. Good thing they had a different pilot for my flight back to Toronto. \n\nTo be honest, it wasn't a terrible flight at all- maybe just the landing. I mean for the amount of money you're paying for the flight, don't expect it be to Cathay Pacific whether the service or space of the seats. \n\nVerdict: 2.5
