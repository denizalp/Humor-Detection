This'd place was a real good. The service was right there. Very helpful. The port house was pretty good, could have been a little thick. I don't think it was true to weight. I had the Kobe A5 grade filet. That was just outstanding. So worth it. Don't be afraid to spend on yourself. You won't be disappointed.
