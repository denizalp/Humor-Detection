I am so embarrassed that it has taken me so LONG to thank the wonderful technician at this Midas Shop! I came in JUST before their closing and during my spring break trip. I was en route to the airport to return my rental car that had gotten a flat (I'd changed the flat) but the tire and wheel were going to cost me at car rental. Monty Brown did EVERYTHING in his power to get a replacement (5pm in a Saturday!) and took so much time calling my car rental co, insurance etc to try and help me.  He is EXACTLY the kind of employee every employer wants and searches for. Consummate professional and gentleman.  Nice job, James Thomasson (mngr) for having an awesome employee and person on your shop! Thank you, Monty
