The pizza is good ,but not great, the service is almost always slow and the place is generally a dump, yet for some reason I can't stop going back.  Maybe it's the fact that it's on my way to campus.  Maybe it's because it's the only place i've found near campus where I can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.  Maybe I just get a kick out of the fact that the middle aged balding guy (manager?) is almost always yelling at one of the mexican dudes in the back.  For whatever unknown, illlogical reason I just like this place!
