Have always been a big fan of Del Taco, but this location was not what I was used too.  The service was bad and the food was just ok.  Good for a quick bite, but not much more.  Why did they get rid of the Macho Taco?  Was the best item on the menu, even if they will make you a deluxe taco they claim is the same thing.  Just OK.
