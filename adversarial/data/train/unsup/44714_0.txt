Wow, what a great buffet! The food selection was wonderful! I had way too much to eat, but I couldn't help myself... Haha \nFrom the lobster tails to the shrimp to the crab to the Chinese to the Sushi to the Prime Rib and chicken to the dessert... Isn't that ridiculous?!?! lol I ate way to much!!!\nBut do you know what was the best thing about this dinner???  It was our waitress, Kimberly!!!  She was AWESOME!!!  If you ever come here, ask for Kimberly's section...
