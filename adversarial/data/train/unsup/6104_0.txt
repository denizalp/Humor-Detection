Average dim-sum restaurant amongst many in Chinatown. But this one is ALL DAY DIM SUM. I came to Rol-San because they had many reviews on yelp compared to the other dim-sum places (perhaps because they're \"all-day\"). I was seated immediately, given an \"order-card\" and got to work. I ordered 10 dishes ranging from veggies, meat, soup, and a milk tart dessert. My total came out to be around $50, they also charge each person $1 for tea! The dim-sum dishes were either a hit or miss, but my favorite had to be the rice noodle with donut inside. Service was decent, and I have no complaints there. However, I'll stick with NYC dim-sum from now on, theres just something about the dim-sum carts rolling around with piping hot dishes that just makes my mouth water!
