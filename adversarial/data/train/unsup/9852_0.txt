A must see for the history buff!  I wish their history of Las Vegas feature was more extensive, but still impressive what they had.  Overall, it was a bit of information overload so give yourself plenty of time.\n\nI definitely recommend spending the extra for the hands-on \"Use of Force\" simulation.  That was cool!  In addition to the scenarios, the conversation with former law enforcement was very informative.  All staff members were engaged and pleasant.\n\nIt's very close to the Fremont Experience.
