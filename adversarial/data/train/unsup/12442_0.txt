Kudos to everyone in their department! We come here all the time and its never a 5 minute venture. We always pick the employees brain about all our home needs! David was very patient with us.. He helped us for like 30 minutes with what we needed. Plumbing is no picnic but it'll be a lot easier now with the help we received!  We then went over to the wood department and Taylor helped us out with picking the perfect wood for my rabbit to snack on! Great customer service all around.
