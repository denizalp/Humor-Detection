I ordered my fiance a small, fall arrangement. It was supposed to be full of gerber daisies, with each one costing around $3. Therefore, I was told that for 7 gerber daisies, along with some other berries and filler flowers, the total would come to around $23. \n\nThe arrangement showed up with TWO gerber daisies, pathetic looking fillers, and they charged me $35. I won't call here again.
