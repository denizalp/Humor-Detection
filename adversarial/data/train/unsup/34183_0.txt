Well I finally got to try Owen's yesterday and I have to say it was pretty good. I'm usually in this area whenever I go to the dentist or get my hair done and failed to realize how close it was to both of those places for me!! Owen's is tucked away in the same strip as the Polished nail salon - right across the street from Atherton. All this time and I never paid attention!\n\nI got to Owen's around 9:45 on a Saturday morning and was expecting to be met with a long line but thankfully it was not the case. I placed my order for a standard bacon & egg (no cheese please!) on an everything, a plain bagel (not toasted, only sliced), and coffee. For those three items, my total came to $9.36 which I found slightly ridiculous but whatevs. For the price, I didn't like the fact that there's only two coffee choices - decaf or regular. No flavored coffees to choose from but there's a slew of flavored creamers and half and half cups and sugars.\n\nOnce you place your order, you move over to the side to wait until your number is called out. Even though there was a good amount of people working behind the counter and not too busy, myself and others still had to wait a bit for our orders to be called. As I waited, I saw that they started to get busier and the line to place an order was getting longer. Once my number was called, I was very hungry and eager to jump right into my sandwich. I could feel the heat from the sandwich through the bag. And that sucker was HOT! like fresh out of the steamer hot. The bagel was nice and chewy but the everything bagel flavor was very underwhelming.\n\nI'm looking forward to going back and trying one of their signature sandwich creations just so I can really get a taste of an authentic Owen's bagel sandwich experience.
