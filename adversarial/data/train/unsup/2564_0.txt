I wasn't too thrilled when FedEx took over Kinko's a half dozen years ago, but they have gradually won me over.  \n\nOne of the best things I've found about the merger with FedEx is the ability now to pickup packages at any of their locations if you missed your home delivery.  WOW!\n\nI've stopped here many times, for a copy, or to pick up the odd business supply.  Everyone has been nice and helpful, while the prices seem in line with what one would expect to pay at Staples, etc.  \n\nThis location is conveniently location off the Raintree exit of the 101, and has a Paradise Bakery and NYPD Pizza nearby.
