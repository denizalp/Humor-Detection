I've heard that they are one of the better seafood buffets in Vegas so even though they are not on the strip, we drove above the bridge to try out the seafood buffet there.\n\nWe got the tix @ $10 discount per person at tix4tonight .. (but we had to be in before 6 which was OK because we were going to a show @ 7:30)\n\nso ended up paying $30+ per person I think ? \n\nthey do have a lot of seafood selection available, but didn't exactly taste good. .. I mean I was eating the seafood there because I wanted to get my money's worth, not because they were particularly good.\n\nIf you can get the discount tix, they might be OK but next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going back to Bellagio or Wynn for the seafood buffet ...
