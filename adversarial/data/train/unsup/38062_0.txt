In general, the food is well prepared here. I have a couple issues. #1 - They need to have place-mats on the tables and at the bar. I ordered coffee and needed the spoon to stir in the cream. I didn't have anywhere to set my wet spoon, nor the fork and knife except on the bare surface of the bar. I don't like doing this because of germs and what not. The bar was wiped down with a rag, but how clean is that rag? I don't set my silverware on a surface like that. So now I have to do a little balancing act by propping the fork and spoon on the edge of my knife. I could have set it on the napkin, but I don't feel okay with that either considering that I will be wiping my lips with it. A place-mat solves the issue. They could charge local businesses money for advertising space on the place-mat. It wouldn't cost them anything. #2 - The breakfast potatoes are not cooked to order. In fact, them come frozen. They aren't dicing any potatoes in that kitchen. They come straight out of a plastic bag and right into a fryer. They might even be pre-seasoned. These potatoes are kind of like little fried children's snacks. A traditional, diced, breakfast potato with onion and peppers would be much better. These little frozen potato nuggets are not good. I don't know why people seem to like them.
