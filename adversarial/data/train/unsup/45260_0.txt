Fresh ingredients used to make food fast, and always piping hot.  This has been a go-to location for me for years.  It's not your traditional \"everything is battered in MSG and fried\" kind of Chinese place.  Top items are Kung Pao anything, Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken.\n\nCustomer service here is also impeccable.  The owner is seemingly always on the premises and is concerned about the quality of your meal.  In fact, I see the same employees year after year, so I imagine he treats them as well as the customers.
