Perfect Pear is really conveniently located for ASU students, right past Oreganos. Its always pretty quiet, and there is never a wait. They have an expansive patio and good-sized indoor area as well, so it is really good for large groups, especially if you don't have a reservation. Chances are that you will be able to sit down right away. The best part is that it is so dang cute! They have beautiful string lights and the patio is so nicely decorated.\n\nEvery time I have gone here, I have gotten different kinds of their pasta. Its nothing to special, but definitely satisfying and fine for what you're paying for. I like their gma's mac n' cheese (probably because I'm a mac n' cheese fiend.) They also have a pretty good drink menu, and I haven't been dissapointed from any of the drinks I've had there. I personally like their pear mule, it has a good kick with the right amount of alcohol. Their desserts are also pretty good! This is a good place for birthday dinners and things of that nature.
