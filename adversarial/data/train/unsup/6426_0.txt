4.5 stars*****\n\n\nOH THANK GOODNESS the Boba gods have answered my prayers!!!!!!\n\nI have been so depressed about the lack of boba around Glendale, I think I have literally tried every milk tea at every asian restaurant, market, bakery in this area and all were no bueno! Watered down, powdered, too sweet, not sweet enough.. ARGH!\n\nBut this place is not only totally trendy with its red, gold and green paint, cute quotes on the wall, funky furniture, and hip hop music playing in the background... they also have good boba! Snacks too! SOOOO many options! And to top it all off, wonderful service!\n\nI got the honey black milk tea, my friend got the green tea with lychee jelly, and we got an order of popcorn chicken. My friend's tea was delicious, not too sweet and the lychee jelly was the real deal. You can tell they use real tea; it does not taste watered down. I'm used to popcorn chicken served with chilli powder in a bag with an oversized toothpick, but Bomboba's idea of chicken is served on a tray with a side of sweet and sour sauce and veggies. Think mini chicken tenders. Tasty (and probably healthier too) and priced fairly. My drink initially came out under-sweetened but I asked the person behind the counter to add a bit more honey and they fixed it for me, no questions asked. Someone even approached our table later and asked if everything was to my liking now, and it sure was! I like that they blend and not just shake their drinks before adding ice (even their milk teas). It makes the consistency of the tea a little frothier which I love. They also have frozen yogurt with all the topping options and some other yummy eats on their menu like eggrolls, spring rolls, mozzarella sticks, etc. \n\nOverall this place totally gets my approval! Spread the word, Imma make sure Bomboba is here to stay!\n\nP.S. They have stamp cards too, ask for one!!!!
