I was really excited about trying this place especially after the good reviews but I have to honestly say it was the most bland barbacoa taco I have ever eaten.  It literally tasted like a roast from the oven with a ton of lettuce on it.  The fish taco was more like a fish bite taco.  The fish was nicely breaded and flavored well but it was a fish nugget.  Maybe I was here on an off day but it was the most bland Mexican food I have ever eaten in my life.  The salsa bar was good and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.  Well the staff was nice too.
