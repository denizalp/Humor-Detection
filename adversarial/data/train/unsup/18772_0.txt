Food was pretty good, it's something you always know what to expect for taste.\n\nJulie was our waitress, she was very prompt and managed her busy section well.\n\nI wish the loud mouth male stripper behind us would have shut up or at least lowered his voice and kept his f-bombs to himself. Not everyone cares to know you learned so many moves from magic mike. PS you're not going to get famous being a male stripper at some low budget club. Yea I heard every word you said. PSS don't bank with wells fargo, they suck.\n\nI had to red velvet pancakes, they were sub par compared to babystacks! \n\nReturn factor: meh, maybe...just maybe.
