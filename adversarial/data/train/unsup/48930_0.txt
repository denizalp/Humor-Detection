This place has the potential of being real good with all the hyper for his shows from the food network. \n\nWent for breakfast and was disappointed. First ordered a coffee, and they had no cream or milk for my coffee. My fianc√© and I ordered chilaquiles and they weren't that great. Maybe I was comparing them to much like my Mexican mother in law's.\n\nBut then I look over and there is a couple drinking coffee with creamer.\n\nSo needless to say I had high hopes for this place but it was a big disappointment. Maybe will go back again and try lunch and dinner.
