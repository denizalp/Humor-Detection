I like Lavelle, but it is a bit too much. Yes, this place is really expensive, but the views make up for it. The restaurant is perched on top of a King St. apartment complex, with a 360 panoramic view of downtown Toronto. \n\nThe crowd is very basic and pretentious, but how can you blame them when Lavelle probably has the most instagrammable restaurant views in the city? Just to give you an idea of the restaurant and its crowd: \n1. Definitely saw spotted a bunch of Toronto's instagram celebrities trying to get their best OOTD shots. \n2. A bunch of trust fund babies brought a lion cub (yes a real life baby lion!!!!) into the restaurant and then stupidly blogged about it afterwards. (Makes you wonder what the bouncers were doing?!)\n3. Way too many dudes with boat shoes. Boat shoes are for boats please. \n4. Saw a couple slaying a salsa dancing. \n5. The pool is so shallow that the water comes up to your ankles. \n\nNeedless to say this lounge is a bit much to take in, but in small doses, actually pretty fun.
