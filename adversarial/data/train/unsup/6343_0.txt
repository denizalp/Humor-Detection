Nice people, but when you take in 3 pairs of $150 jeans to have them shortened and they say yes we can keep the original hem apparently they think that means to cut off the original hem and stitch the alteration as close to they originally looked as possible. Everywhere else in the world that's called matching the stitch (which is usually cheaper) but not keeping the hem. Two totally different things and matching stitching isn't worth $10 per alteration. One last thing, they didn't even match the thread color and width well. Original is a faded yellow and they used a shiny bright yellow. Looks totally sloppy.\n\nThey refused a refund and said they would fix it at the same price with the actual hem... If we went through a box of a ton of alterations scraps and matched it. Total scam artists. Too bad cash was paid or they would be getting a challenge from my credit card. \n\nI found them by yelp and hopefully other people consider this review before giving these dishonest business people any money.
