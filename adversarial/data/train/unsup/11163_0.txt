I was in the mood for Japanese bbq so I randomly yelped this place.  So happy I found it!\n\nI called for reservation for 03.21.16 (Monday) but the lady who answered said \"is your party more than 8 people?\" I said \"no 5.  I wanted to make reservations for tonight at 10\". She was like \"oh no reservation. Just walk in\"\n\nThat was weird. Are you not able to make reservations for under 8 people or what??  Any who I got there at 10pm and there was a 30 minute wait. We were able to sit down around 1040ish and by that time the restaurant was half empty.  \n\nTIP:  make sure you talk to a competent hostess who is able to make reservations because I've read the reviews and you're able to.  Or else go after 11pm so there's no wait.\n\n- Kobe style beef\n- prime kalbi\n- flat iron garlic\n- premium tongue\n- pork toro\n\nAll of the meat was very very good and tender.  I recommend them all!
