Skip this.\n\nThey just have two rooms worth of exhibits. About the size of two living rooms. So when you pay about $18, you would think they would put at least the best art in these two room, but not so at the BGFA.\n\nFor example, I came here for the Picasso Creatures and Creativity. They had way better art at the Picasso Restaurant then at the BGFA. At least I had a fine dinner and got to experience several paintings rather than random sketches at the BGFA.\n\nNo matter how much I tried to stay as long as I could to get my monies worth, I spent only about 15 minutes at the BGFA. And that was a stretch.
