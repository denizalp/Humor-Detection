Just had my very first appointment here today with Cindy. I've been searching for a new salon because my favorite nail tech moved. So I decided to give this one a try since it's conveniently 5 mins away from my workplace and I can stop by here before I head home! \n\nI walked in about 10 mins earlier than my appointment.. the place was very clean and organized. It wasn't busy at\nthe time so they took me right away. Cindy was very nice. She looked at my nails and complimented them! and as a first time customer she told me how much the services would cost before she did anything. \n\nEverything went well, I told her what shape I wanted and she made sure I liked it before she went on. I did notice one of my nails was not straight, if I hadn't told her I would have walked out with a crooked nail. But she fixed it and everything was all good. Also, when she was removing my cuticles she accidentally cut me.. but it was weird because I didn't feel it.. and when I looked at it, it was a tiny little cut (I've had worse experiences with nail techs cutting me, this was no biggie). She apologized, but I wasn't even worried because it was so tiny and it didn't hurt or anything.\n\nOverall, I had a pretty good experience. I will be sure to come back again soon!
