Loved the food! The biggest show stoppers for me were the turkey dumplings and the wagyu beef.  Omg... So delicious, so flavourful, everything about both dishes were absolute perfection. They were like flavour explosions! The Kentucky fried squid was very good as well. It had just the right amount of sauce on it, not drenched and not dry.... Just right to give the right flavour and squid cooked perfectly!  We had the beef short rib which was tasty, but the dumplings and wagyu were so exceptional that I can't stop thinking about them! We also got the asparagus but it was too spicy for me (but I am a total spiciness wimp...I always get zero spiciness if I have a choice so I'm not a good judge of spicy stuff.) The key lime pie was beautiful and tasted great too, I loved the meringue pieces, yummy and beautiful! I'm really shocked at the bad reviews, the staff were super friendly and attentive and the food was amazing! Maybe it was just growing pains of just opening? I definitely want to try their Sunday family style next time!
