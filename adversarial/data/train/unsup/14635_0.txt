Convenient, great assortment of items and brands, a Krogers subsidiary, so all foods familiar from King Soopers and City Market can be found here.\n\nSelection was good, employees were helpful and friendly. They offered a Frys Membership Card which allows savings on groceries & gas. Check out their Community Rewards Program too! \n\nNewer options- Click List & Home Delivery Services. \n\nBakery now makes yummy fresh pretzels. Amongst all their other fresh baked goods.\n\n\nBTW: If you have not tried this Fry's sushi kiosk inside this Fry's market you've missed some honestly good sushi at a great price. The fish is always fresh, made daily and they have a good selection. The rice is not perfectly sticky, but with fresh nicely prepared sushi and sashimi and rolls they get high marks. We grab this for dinner about once a month, have for years. You could sit and eat there without much or no ambience as table seating is on the side of the produce dept. Take it to go with the rest of your groceries! LOL
