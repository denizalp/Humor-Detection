I truly love Osaka. I was extremely please when I discovered it had reopened after a fire. It's close to home and you get a complimentary, wickedly peeled and presented orange at the end of your meal to cleanse the palate.\n\nI always get the same thing here... miso, wakame, tempura and the Hawaiian Volcano Roll (see my pic). Yup. It's on fire! It's warm, crispy and covered in that Japanese mayo stuff. And it's on fire!\n\nHint: Don't eat the Hawaiian Volcano Roll too quickly. Because... well you already know.
