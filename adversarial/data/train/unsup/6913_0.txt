Unfortunately, Shake Shack was just alright for me.  The East Coast burger did not WOW me. \n\nLots of tables throughout and quick service. \n\nOrder your food at the counter and have a seat.  \nThe burger I had was just alright.  I've had better.  I also ordered a hot dog and that too was just alright.  Lastly, I had the vanilla custard and meh I've had better.
