I'm glad they were able to serve such a large party without much hassle to us. So I commend the staff. As for the food, it tasted very generic as I can't remember which one was the best... I think I remember the apple salad. Yes that one! The calamari, fetta, baked zitti, etc were generic. Although I think the caprese was nice and the chicken parm as well. But for the amount of money spent, I felt like the only thing going for this place was the large family portion style and the fact that it wasn't terrible Italian food. Definitely been to places with better food.
