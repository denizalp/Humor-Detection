This place is urban upscale but with a laid back friendly bustling atmosphere, we walked in with no reservation went to the bar and proceeded to talk to a passing by hostess who promptly got us a table when asked. No waiting!!! My girlfriend and I both ordered the prime rib and this was by far the best we have EVER had. The wine was good the service was also attentive to everything and she got a nice tip for her trouble. A truly wonderful night with a woman I truly love!
