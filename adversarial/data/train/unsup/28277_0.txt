I have used Yelp and Open Table for years. This time I found a fabulous little gem right close to home. The Cannery has Waverly's Steak House. The atmosphere is fabulous. The service impeccable Frederick was attentive, fruendly and had an A+ sense of humor. \nFood range was 30+. But let tell you they have a little gem on the menu. It has a meal deal of all things. For $30 you can get soup or salad. Steak and Shrimp, with potatoes and asparagus , and a chocolate lovers dream.  Amazingly tender New York steak however it may change as it is a Chefs Choice. Try it you will not be disappointed if you do. Blessings all.
