Yep, she gone and done it again! This woman is nothing but a flat out Thief!\nWe were stung in 2010 when she went out of business for the first time, as said before how she was allowed to restart her business again shortly after is beyond belief.\nA Thief and a liar through and through. \nFeeling really sorry for her victims right now and can't for the life of me figure out why the Attorney Generals office has not been involved since she started up her business shortly after her last bankruptcy.\nHopefully this will be the last we see of her,most likely she move to another state and start all over again with your moneys.
