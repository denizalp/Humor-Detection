Staff was very attentive and the seafood was fresh. I highly recommend the lobster pasta in the 3 course lunch menu. The views of the strip from the restaurant is phenomenal. Truly a fine dining experience at The Cosmopolitan. The staff had our reservation from open table ready as soon as we got there.
