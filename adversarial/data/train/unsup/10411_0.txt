I've visited this store on a couple different occasions. It is definitely in a prime location. Like others have mentioned the atmosphere is very modern and creative. For instance, they have suggestions for almost any occasion. I liked the section on what wine to buy for \"breakups\" or something like that. Funny. \n\nThe disappointing element was customer service. On the various times I have walked in, I was never greeted. Granted, there were other customers so I didn't expect the employee to drop what he was doing. However, once he was finished helping others I did think a little acknowledgment was appropriate (i.e., eye-contact, smile, nod). I also sent an email trying to find a particular wine for a gift and I never received a response. \n\nThree strikes...this place is on my \"out\" list.
