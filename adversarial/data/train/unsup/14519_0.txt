As a traveler and boba drinker, I have been to many places. Cafe Teaze is the first of its kind in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is great, delicious drinks and great tasting food at a reasonable price! The staff is very polite, helpful & gorgeous. I would recommend this place to people looking for a place to hang out, drink tea and experience something new.
