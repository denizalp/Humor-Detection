This club is horrible. I came with my cousins because we had to kill some time and we didn't want to gamble. We paid $20 to get it (it was around 1am). As soon as we got in, I wanted to get out. It was kind of dead. The only people there were older women. The music sucked. \n\nOnly positive thing there was when I took a shot. 2 seconds of fun.
