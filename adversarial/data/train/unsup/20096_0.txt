Terrible place to bring your car to. I wouldn't take your car here to get worked on if you want it to get fixed in a timely manner or get it fixed properly. Owners are crooks and make you pay for work you never got done on your car. The store motto should me \"flatline where you take your car to die\" the name of the business is fitting.
