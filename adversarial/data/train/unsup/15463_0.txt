I grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Pasties were a once-a-week meal for me my entire childhood - specifically the Oggie-style pastie (with ketchup). The Cornish Pasty Co. version of the Oggie is spot on, and better than the dozens that I get FedEx'd to my house over the holidays. The par-baked $6 version of the Oggie that they sell is very appealing. I will be buying them by the dozen - and locally - this is fantastic!\n\nThank the food Gods for the Cornish Pasty Co. \nGreat execution and made with love. Beautiful egg-brushed crust, and the perfect thickness with quality ingredients. Keep it up guys!
