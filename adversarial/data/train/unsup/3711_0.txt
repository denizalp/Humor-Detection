Too funny, first of all Julia S and I set out today to use my coupon book and where do we end up? Cafe International with no coupon. We get way suckered into fun. We just can't help it. Julia S told me she wanted to go to Cafe International because taxis were always outside, little did we know  some of the Cafe International family drives cabs.  A man with a Carolina Cab jacket sat us and gave us menus.  I loved this.\n\nWe sit down to a crazy, festive little restaurant, with a bar and a tiny room off to the side with a pool table. Very interesting. They stay open till 2a and serve food til midnight. So if you need to get your injera  (Injera is a yeast-risen flat bread with a unique, slightly spongy texture.) on before midnight, this is the place.\n\nWe shared a veggie plate with salad, greens, lentil mush mix and a potato, carrot, onion mixture. I have to say, I loved it, it's quirky and comforting. If you haven't eaten Ethiopian food, you don't get a fork, just go for it, scoop up everything with the blanket of bread and most importantly, the food is served on the injera, start with the injera with the food on it. These are the best bites. Don't wait til you are full to start enjoying the most perfect bites.\n\nIt was also very inexpensive, our lunch was $10. I have been craving Ethiopian food for two weeks, you would think that I had my fill, it's really just unleashed the beast. I want more.
