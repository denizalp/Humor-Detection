Oh where to start. So, I went here with some friends. There were 6 of us total. \n\nFirst impression: the place is small. Like really small. I overheard the waiter telling the cook that they had 2 tables of 6 with reservations tonight and the cook was worried that they might not have enough food. Small.\n\nYou walk in to the bar area. The floor seems slanted, chairs are crooked, and (sitting in the corner of the bar where we were) smells faintly of cat pee. The building was obviously once a house, so whatever, it seemed dated (really dated), but clean.\n\nWe ordered drinks at the bar and they took a surprisingly long time considering that we were the only people there. \n\n\nDining room: Really really dated. The chairs reminded me of something from a college dorm rec area in the 70's or 80's. Nothing was necessarily what I would call \"Nice\".\n\nMenu: Ok, so here is the confusing part. You are in this \"Bistro\" with dated furniture, and broken bar stools, but then the dinners average $25. When I think bistro, I think sandwiches and salads, fresh light food etc. Nope, none of that here. \n\nFood: we ordered one of each appetizer. calamari was ok, fried gouda was a chunk of cheese slightly warm with 2.5 small crackers, the other app had meat in it, so I don't know about that one. Salads were expensive and ridiculously small, like the asparagus salad had 3-4 sprigs of asparagus. For dinner I had shrimp and scallops.... Not great. It was, what seemed like 2 scallops sliced 3 times each to look like 6 scallops, and 3 pieces of shrimp halved to seem like 6 pieces of shrimp. It was in an overpowering cheese sauce reminiscent of boxed mac and cheese with a little white wine added to it.\n\nService: Really bad! Our waitress was an older woman and she was just plain rude! At one point one of the other women at the table asked why the bread was hard when the last plate of bread wasn't and she completely snapped at her. WTF? Seriously? \n\nOverall: I'll never go back.
