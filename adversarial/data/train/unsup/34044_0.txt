Always enjoyed myself at every Digital Dreams Festival. All Dreamers are always super friendly and social. Never encountered any issues during my time here. They had 3 different stages where you can watch and dance to your favourite DJs: the Dream Stage, Echo Beach and the Bacardi House. This year they had lots of food trucks so you have more options that isn't pizza or street meat. They have different vendors for drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic. I'm not really a fan of Bud Light but they DO sponsor this awesome event so I let it slide. I loved how they had a bouncy castle and a bubble soccer type of thing in a shallow inflatable pool. It was hilarious watching different people, who I'm sure were awfully sweaty, run at each other and go flying in the other direction! Hahaha! Some people come all decked out in a costume or any festival appropriate gear. You can bring glowsticks, inflatables, flower crowns and so much more! It's always a good time and I will most likely attend every year they do this, even when I'm old, grey haired and arthritic. Woooooorth iiiiittt!
