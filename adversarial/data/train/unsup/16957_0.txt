This boutique hotel is just okay, the extra star is for the wonderful limo service.   We landed at Macaraan Airport, the driver, Rick met us at baggage claim.   He took our bags off of the conveyor, and then we walked swiftly to our silver limo.    So nice for a change.     Within 10 minutes, we arrived at the hotel, tourists were waving at us like movie stars.   Lol.    The bell hop met us at the curb and took our luggage and us up to the 32nd floor.   \n\nThen the best part is over.  The room is okay, kind of outdated.    There is free food in concierge lounge, but the servers are unhappy and cranky, making the atmosphere tense.     I just grabbed some drinks and food, gulped them down and ran out quick.  \n\nWi-Fi is good, no interrupted service.  The limo ride back to the airport was also pleasant.   If I stay at Hotel 32 again, it would be just because of the limousine and wi-fi.
