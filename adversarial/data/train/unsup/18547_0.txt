I like this mall and will definitely return here the next time I visit Las Vegas.  Many locals warned me that this mall is \"ghetto\" but I disagree.  This mall is similar to a hometown mall or a typical mall in a suburban neighborhood.  I think the mall seems ghetto because they're comparing it to the upscale malls on the Las Vegas Strip or the nicer, well maintained outlets.  Coming here was actually a nice break from the busy Las Vegas Strip and the outlet malls.  It's quieter here and the prices at the stores are a little lower compared to the Strip.  There's ample parking and also a few good places to get a quick bite to eat.  \n\nA few of the stores they have are Sears, Macy's, Bath and Body Works, Charlotte Russe, Cotton On, Radio Shack, etc.  I recommend coming here if you want to a quiet and calm shopping experience and are looking to save a few bucks.
