OK, so, sometimes the stars just line up right.  My wife and I had a great experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Lyndhurst, OH.  \n\nWe pulled in to the parking lot that looked more like a beehive at rush hour.  In our 1st pass a choice spot is staring at us mockingly (thinking there's certainly a wheelchair symbol adorning it).  Nope, we pulled right in.  Now we're 50ft from the door and already wondering what the \"little people\" are doing.  \n\nThe mass of patrons was akin to Black Monday on the floor of the NYSE waiting to get the little flashy \"you got a table\" doohickeys.  We get our doohickey after a few flying elbows and head to the bar.  Again the place is packed.  Startlingly and without explanation the bartender gets MY attention to get our drink order.  Huh?  Do they think I'm Michael Jordan (only a tad shorter with a melanin deficiency)?  No sooner do our martinis hit our lips a table becomes available right behind us.  Our waiter, Dan, tells us we can pop a squat right here for dinner instead of waiting out our assigned 45min doohickey Purgatory.  Assuming this is some sort of cruel joke, we sit anyway.\n\nWe experience one of the best orders of calamari in our vaunted calamari eating careers.  Our dinner orders were taken swiftly and arrived in a timely fashion.  For the 1st time ever I asked for a take-out box because I wanted to re-experience my dinner (Caramel Chicken) yet again tomorrow.  \n\nOur server, Dan, allowed us the right amount of privacy and attentiveness making the whole experience that much better.  Since we were stuffed to the gills, we opted to take our cheesecake to go.\n\nI can't promise the same experience if you go to The Cheesecake Factory.  But now I know it's at least possible!\n\nP.S.  Thank you Jim and Michelle for the gift card.
