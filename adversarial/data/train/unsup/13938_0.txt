After perusing the selection at Kay's in the West Towne Mall, my friend and I were pretty disappointed - both with the selection they offered and with the quality of customer service. So, we trekked across the street to Jared, and let's just say that the grass is definitely greener on the other side. (:\n\nThe customer service at Jared is fantastic. As soon as we walked through the door (which is actually quite intimidating, given the scale of the store), we were greeted by one of the employees. I wish I remembered her name, because she was fabulous! \n\nShe patiently waded through an entire selection of diamond bands with us...and then put up with our girly squealing over how great our new baubles looked! :D She also offered great suggestions in terms of sizing\/styles\/etc of the pieces we were considering. \n\nAdditionally, I love that they do ring-sizing in-store. My friend and I both needed our rings re-sized, and we were able to pick up our rings in the SAME day - after only putting in the re-sizing request 3 hours prior. HOW AWESOME IS THAT??\n\nAll in all, Madison's Jared branch is great! It also helps that they have a refreshment corner where they offer coffee, tea, and hot cocoa. It makes jewelry shopping that much better when you have something warm sloshing around in your belly. (: \n\nI don't have any qualms about purchasing another piece of jewelry from Jared, and I'm hoping to put my $100 reward in to good use before February!!
