If you're looking for a great breakfast for $10-$20 then you NEED to visit. Always super crowded but it's for a good reason. This place is awesome. The prices are fair and you get LARGE portions. While most places have dwindled down their plate sizes this place has stuck true to filling you up. I'm a big eater and i've never left here without a to-go box.
