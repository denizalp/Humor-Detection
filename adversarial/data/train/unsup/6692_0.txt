This restaurant is in a great location, right across from the fountains, and has the French sidewalk cafe feel.  The French onion soup was very tasty, a bit sweeter than most, which was fine and lots of cheese, which is great.  The escargot was good, with enough butter anything tastes good.  The skate was a very good entree choice but the filet mignon was over cooked, such as a shame.  The desserts were excellent as you would expect, the creme brulee and the profiteroles.  Overall I would have given them a 5 as the ambiance, location, appetizers, and desserts were all a 5 but the entrees, filet in particular, were a 3.
