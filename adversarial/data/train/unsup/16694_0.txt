Spicy and tasty! \n\nA friend and I came in tonight and we were seated at a booth. The restaurant was fairly empty, but it took a while for our server to get us our water for some reason. Got the sliced pork appetizer, sweet and sour cabbage, and crispy spicy chicken. (We had originally wanted sauteed water spinach instead of the cabbage, but it wasn't available.) Portions were fairly large. The sliced pork isn't as spicy as it might seem and the crispy chicken is definitely as spicy as it looks, but both were great. I wasn't a fan of the sweet and sour cabbage though; I thought it was too...sweet and sour? It tasted a little weird to me. At one point I got attacked by an extra spicy pepper (not sure from which dish, unfortunately, so I could not warn my friend). Water and rice did not help. My mouth was on fire and some tears rolled down my face. I totally made eye contact with one of the chefs who had just sat down a few tables away as I was sucking air into my mouth to cool it down. I'm sure he tried to hide a smile. He knew what he did. \n\nThe ceiling lights down the center of the dining area looked like tree branches and all the furniture was wooden, so it kinda felt like we were in a giant tree house. Not gonna lie, in terms of interior, Sichuan Gourmet really stands out from other restaurants on Atwood.\n\nI'd definitely prefer this location to the one in Squirrel Hill. The flavors are stronger and the interior is way cooler. \n\nTaste | 4\nAtmosphere | 4 \nPresentation | 3 \nService | 3\nOVERALL | 3.5
