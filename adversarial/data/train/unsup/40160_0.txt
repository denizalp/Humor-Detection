a true hidden gem! we are staying at the HIE and decided to give Sammy's a try since we wanted a real breakfast. I got the cheese omelette and my husband got the ham and cheese omelette. both were cooked fresh to order in front of us along with the hashbrowns. everything was delicious and Sammy is a great guy! our only regret is not trying this place sooner because we leave tomorrow.
