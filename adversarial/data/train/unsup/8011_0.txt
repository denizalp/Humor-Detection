This place is a gem!  It's nestled between Joe's Farm Grill and the Agritopia urban farm.  Small inside--tends to fill up rather quickly during peak hours--but there is lots of great outdoor seating which you can take advantage of during the 355\/356 days of beautiful weather here in Arizona ;) \n\nPretty much everything I've tried here is good.  Great breakfast and lunch sandwiches, drinks, and baked goods.  The fo-nuts (baked donuts) are literally to die for!  They're my fave thing here.  I'm not a fan of the cupcakes, although they are adorably cute--all decked out with glittery frosting etc.  They were a bit too dry and hard for my liking...but maybe I just went on an off day.\n\nThis is a great place to study, meet friends to chat, or just sit by yourself and read the paper or a good book.  Cool, moody music is usually playing.  Young, hipster kids work the counter.  It's nice to have a local coffee shop\/bakery that doesn't scream \"corporate America.\"
