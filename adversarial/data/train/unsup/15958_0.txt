Magnum's is a pocket universe - the first verified case of the existence of a twilight zone. It's where you would meet Columbo before he finishes the case; it's where a Miller Lite drinker gets Scotch or Whiskey; it's where you realize the why behind someone wanting to smuggle Cuban Cigars - it's a world of it's own.\n\nThe price will depend on your fancy and how deep down the rabbit hole of sophistication you want to go. The service will be instructive and heavenly, helping you make the perfect cigar and drink choice that was ordained by a higher power before the existence of the universe. \n\nThis place gives meaning to the world is your oyster. I am not going to simply ask you to go here, I am going to plead with you. Please go to Magnum's. There's a world before and after Magnums, and you want to be in the latter.
