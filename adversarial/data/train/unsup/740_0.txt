I had the worst nail experience there yesterday. The salon is very dirty. The techs go back and forth from scrubbing feet to doing your nails without sanitizing their hands. The nail tech filling my acrylics shaved my nails down so much that my SKIN was showing in layers THROUGH MY NAILS and I was BLEEDING. I had told her I was in pain and clearly bleeding. She ignored me and kept saying, \"No mam\". I finally had to completely tell her to stop all together. By then the acrylic was on my nails and it looked terrible. Completely uneven and misshapen. She called the manager over who was rude and insisting my nails were fine. If you know about nail enhancements you know a good job does NOT DAMAGE your real nails! I was in there for over 2 hours because I made them soak off the acrylic to show the manager how terrible she treated my nails! He said I was lying until he SAW MY NAILS and had no response. He was very rude and uneducated. Wouldn't tell me who the owner was. He in fact is the owner and told me the business had no owner and he was hired by another manager. Completely idiotic and unprofessional. I would never recommend this nails salon to anyone. My nails are so damaged its unbelievable.
