Limited seating (6 tables that can sit parties of 4 and bar seating). 6 ramen style options, rice bowls, and appetizers. Around $7 per bowl. It's small!\nMy family pretty much tried all the different styles and we all agreed it was SUPERRRRR SALTY. Eggs are add-ons. I don't understand why it's so popular here, we all had to drink water with every slurp. The spicy ramen wasn't spicy, just a spoonful of hot sauce. Tea is $3.\n\nYeah, won't be back. I wouldn't mind trying another place down closer to the strip. Private parking lot that's a tight squeeze with several other Asian cuisines around.
