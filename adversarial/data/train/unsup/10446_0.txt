I'm sorry, Tasty Kabob, you are no longer by go-to venue for meat on a stick.\n\nThe kafta and kibbee are the best I've ever had, super savory and perfectly spiced. Chicken is - rarity of rarities - tender and juicy while at the same time well-seasoned and seared on the outside. Hummus had great flavor, although I will take Pita Jungle's any day for texture\/consistency.\n\nAn all around fabulous meal for the money.  And a huge amount of it!\n\nIf they hadn't let a color-blind kindergartner do the interior design (cartoon flames!?) it would be a near-perfect skewered-beast experience.
