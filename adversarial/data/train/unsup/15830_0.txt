As far as dim sum goes, C-Fu has always been the last option for me.  While the restaurant itself is definitely had better days and has an air of out dated elegance, the food is pretty white-washed and Americanized.  \n\nIf I am to drag myself out of bed for dim sum on my precious weekend, I expect hot steamy food and delicious steam to waft over me.  Instead, the food is always mediocre and warm at best.  Don't arrive too early for dim sum or you'll get the leftover steamers from the prior day.  While their food isn't downright disgusting, the targeted audience has definitely changed the past few years.  I say come around 11pm so you get the fresh dishes of the day. \n\nI will say that their custard buns are probably the best --- specifically the pineapple baos.
