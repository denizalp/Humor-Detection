Disclaimer: No food ordered, just making a quick review based on service and the establishment itself.\n\nIt's a pretty dark, old looking bar in a prime location on Main Street. I came here in a party of 3 after dining at Inspire next door. We had just wanted to find a new place to watch the NBA Finals game as Inspire was closing for the evening. \n\nAny customer would understand upon walking in that Main's is not a sports bar - but they did have the game playing on all their TVs. Ideally they'd have the TV audio on too, which they did, albeit at a minimal volume that only the keenest of listeners would be able to hear. Again, not a knock on Main's because they are clearly not a sports bar, but just some information for those hoping to catch a game here. \n\nIt was karaoke night on the Sunday evening of our visit. The volume was good in that it wasn't so loud that it distracted from the game. \n\nService was good - our waitress could be often seen walking by our area though we were in the back section that was otherwise empty. \n\nSeeing other reviews makes me really want to come back for the brunch. I hope I get the chance to in the future because my first experience here was quite pleasant.
