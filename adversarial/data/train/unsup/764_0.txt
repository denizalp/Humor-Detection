Spitfire somehow combines almost all of my favorite things about my favorite bars in San Francisco all at once.  The only two things I don't like are that it doesn't have a patio (a very minor thing) and it's not in the SF Bay Area (major bummer dude, like totally).\n\nThere's a non-functioning pinball machine, a stage with a chain link fence in front of it on which punk bands often play and flat screen TVs that are usually showing something like stand-up routines and Adult Swim in CCTV.  If you're particularly sensitive to cigarette smoke, you might want to reconsider going in.\n\nAbove all else though is their kick-ass slogan - \"fuck hippies, fuck yuppies and fuck you!\"  For my SF Bay Area bretheren, I'll put it this way - it's a combo of Zeitgeist and Lucky 13 without all the hipsters, holier-than-thou attitude and the pot (it is Cleveland after all).  \n\nChristmas Ale (a wonderful bitter & spiced elixir of 7.5% alcoholic goodness) is available on tap during the holiday season...as if one needed another reason to go here...
