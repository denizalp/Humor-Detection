My usual go to lash lady went out of town, but I needed my lashes done, bad. I found this place through yelp, and so glad I did!  \n\nUpon arrival, I signed a few forms and checked it. They had all kinds of refreshments for their customer, so I helped myself to come Belgian cookies (which were delicious). \n\nI was taken in right at my appointment time, and was worked on by Jenny. Jenny is FANTASTIC!!! She brought out all the different types of lashes, and explained each different lash they offered. She allowed me to chose my preferred length, thickness and curl. She also showed me pictures to give me a better idea of how it'd look. I thought this was wonderful! She was so concerned of making sure that I chose what I wanted for me. \n\nAfter about 45 min, my lashes came our PERFECT!  I am sooo pleased by my lashes, that I will definitely be back here for all my fills! I'm so glad I found this place, and jenny!!!
