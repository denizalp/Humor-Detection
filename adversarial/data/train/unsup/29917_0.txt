Very pricey. This is going to sound crazy - went to BBQ place but we ordered catfish sandwich & shrimp 'mo-boy. Lived in Houston & miss my po-boys. \n\nWhen I called I asked if it was large enough to share & was told it was. NO! It was a reg sz hamburger bun. Also I ordered both with the sauce on the side, that didn't happen. The fish\/shrimp cooked great & great flavor but lettuce, pickle, sauce & green peppers (thought that last one was odd) overpowered. Mac n cheese was bland & needed seasoning. Other guest got BBQ pork sandwich - didn't try meat, but sauce was good. Cornbread was dry & lacked flavor. Sweet tater casserole was good & flavorful. \n\nIt was $35 for 3 of us to eat. Don't think I will be going back anytime soon.
