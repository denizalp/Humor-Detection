The wait time for receiving an appointment is rather too long. And the receptionist Alexis and Molly are really rude.\n\n I had called up for an appointment and I was told that there was a vacancy on 31st. I wanted to double check my schedule, so I called up again just after 5 mins (literally just 5 mins). Molly (another receptionist) told me that no appointments were available till 8th without even looking for availability. When I told her that Alexis had told me about a availability on 31st, she wanted to check (oh god!). After having me on hold for 5 mins, Alexis returned and told me that there is no availability till 8th and I could have an appointment with Carlie (assistant). Really poor service and rude behavior.\nReally unprofessional.
