Montreal's secret Garden- an escape from city life - Admission was 16$ with a 4$ discount if you're a local. Fare includes entry into the insectarium. I would recommend buying the tickets online to save the walk to the ticketing booth.\n\nThere were several gardens to tour including the First Nations, Alpine, Japanese, etc.. Chinese garden is currently under construction. Every park was breathtaking! Zen by the pond and waterfalls. There were benches tucked away in every spot for your reading or relaxing pleasure. There were more shaded trails for those wanting to hide from the sun! \n\nThe summer 2017 lineup includes live musical performances every Sunday - gets pretty packed as people bring their lawn chairs and picnic mats. \nGood for the family.\n\nA 2 hour tour will usually cover the whole Park!
