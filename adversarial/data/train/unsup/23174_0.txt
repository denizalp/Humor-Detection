A community favorite, Great Harvest Bread provides fresh locally made carb goodness. The store has a country chic feel to it and the variety varies by day. There is a weekly board that lets you know what breads are made for each day of the week. For example, Challah bread is made on Fridays. Popular seasonal items like the pumpkin spice bread are sold by the mini loaf. \n\nThere is also a cutting board behind the counter where they let you sample some of the bread. Off to the left, there are honey sticks, jars of local honey, fruit jams and even stylish greeting cards if you decide to gift some of their goodies. They also offer some sandwiches, but I have yet to try them. Definitely would recommend the breads though.
