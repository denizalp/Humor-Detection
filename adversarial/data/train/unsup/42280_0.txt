I can't say enough good things about the staff at Wildflower and the consistently good food. Simply stated, they always hit a home run. Fresh salads, great sandwiches and a great selection of hearty soups (my favorite!) and yummy desserts and cookies, \nBike parking out front is really handy when we're on our weekend bike rides and stop in for breakfast or lunch, plenty of car parking too, so it's really never a problem, unlike some other shopping centers in the area.\nCompared to similar restaurants, Wildflower is a friendlier, homier place for me. I think the staff makes the effort to get to know the regulars and to be friendly with all the customers. It is, and will remain, my \"go-to\" place for any meal because of those great qualities: great food, friendliness, cleanliness, and fun. Oh, and Wi-Fi too!
