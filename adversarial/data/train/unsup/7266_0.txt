Don't get me wrong the wax was done well...painful but flawless....reception asked me \"how was it??\" Which is inappropriate following a Brazilian.  If you've ever had one you'd know that with that kind of question you just want to ask \"how the hell do you think it was?\"  Then they over charged me $15 dollars.  I canceled my appointment and they called me to ask why so I let them know and they gave me a credit to my acct. which was nice I might come back because the wax was so good.  The front desk was awful hopefully they find new girls for that position.
