5 stars to my first Vegas buffet! \n\nI got a 2 for 1 buffet by staying at TI and for $30, my girlfriend and I enjoyed a lotttt of food for dinner. We got there around 6:30 and were very surprised there was only 4 people on front of us. \n\nI personally had Chinese, Seafood and BBQ plates and all of them were great. The chef who made pasta for my girlfriend was very friendly and professional. \n\nOh and the dessert section.... amazing.\n\nOur waitress provided great service and we left very pleased. Excited to return next time for maybe some breakfast or lunch.
