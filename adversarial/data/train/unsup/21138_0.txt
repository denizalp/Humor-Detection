I've been coming to this PC since it opened and prefer it over the Rainbow location even with the few hiccups that I have experienced. The hiccups being they didn't have my balloon order ready for pick up at the time promised and merchandise isn't always priced which is really frustrating. Last week when I stopped in to grab a few things for a party they had some good deals going on like buy 3 get 1 free on serving trays, but they had the prices in the wrong spot for the different sizes as well the lids. Also I had to take 2 other items to the register for a price check because they weren't marked. On the plus side, I did find what I needed and then some and the girl working was courteous. This location isn't cluttered like others and is well stocked. They have plenty of different themes and supplies for your party and while some stuff is overpriced there is also plenty that's priced fair especially when you really want to go all out with a certain theme.
