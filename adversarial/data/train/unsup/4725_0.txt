This is a store that focuses on specialty items of superb quality. The selection of fresh produce, wines, and specialty items is good. There is a pretty complete bakery filled with yummy pastries, pies, and cookies. They have a meat counter with organic meats. The prices is are quite a bit higher than you'd pay at a grocery store, but the quality is much better.
