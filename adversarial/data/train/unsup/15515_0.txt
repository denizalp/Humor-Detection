I love Mr. Tofu. On the suggestion of so many friends and great reviews I decided to expand my new found love of Korean flavors and put myself into the hands of Mr. Tofu.\n\n I have spent the last year trying out many restaurants within the genre of my new favorite culinary flavor which is Korean style food. Mr. Tofu so far has been the place that I can often find myself dining at more than once a week. The food is really fresh and as so many others have said: delicious. \n\nOn top of it all the prices are among the best I have seen. I often head straight for the dolsot bibimbap, and I'm a huge fan of their pickled jalapenos condiment, which I have seen no where else thus far. \n\nTwo of us usually get out of there under $30 and usually with little or no room left in our bellies for more. It has a home-made flavor that you can really taste. The service is always kind and happy to serve you a great meal. Smiles and fast delivery of this quality goodness is another reason we go back so often. I am new to the Korean culinary delights, but so far Mr. Tofu is my favorite. \n\nCatch me there and Happy Eating!
