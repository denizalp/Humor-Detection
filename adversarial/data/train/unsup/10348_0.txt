I eat a lot of Korean cuisine and definitely love this place (50% of my diet actually lol). For $30, you get to eat top notch beef. I agree that the portion is not big and they only limit it to 1 serving for the top notch beef. However, it is big enough to fill up the party of two. I came here twice (Thursday and then again on Saturday). The service was definitely much better during the weekdays. It is understandable since they were much busier. My only complain is their ventilation system. It is extremely hard not to walk out completely covered with BBQ smell & the A\/C isn't high enough. Other than that, I will say you definitely get enough food for the amount of money you will spend.
