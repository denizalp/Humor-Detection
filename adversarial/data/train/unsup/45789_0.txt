Danielle does such a great job on my nails. I've been here twice now! I did have to wait a little for my scheduled appointment, but the salon was very busy and I don't mind to wait for good work! \nVincent did amazing at my pedicure. It was a strong massage that I thoroughly enjoyed after my workout this morning! \nThis salon is priced on the higher end - but I don't mind paying for what I get!
