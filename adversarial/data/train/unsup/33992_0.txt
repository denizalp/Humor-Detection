Love supporting small businesses and I'm so glad I found this little place to do so! \nFood is delicious, I tried a little.of everything and these pastries are on point. \nI enjoyed it all, even the mac and cheese! \nThe owner is a sweetheart as well and was there working alone on a Friday night! That's some great commitment and I will be back for sure!
