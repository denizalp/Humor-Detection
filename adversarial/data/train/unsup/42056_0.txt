I've been here a couple of times and I think it's time to leave a review. This place is great! I've had one time that I wasn't super pleased with my masseuse. Overall, the place is beautiful, relaxing and easy to schedule with! I called in at 11am to book a same day appointment. They did great getting two people in on a Friday. It's a great location too! Right off the freeway and I'm sure anyone that works down the street at Intel could appreciate the close escape. Pierre did an amazing job as did the lady that did my boyfriend. Thank you for what you do!
