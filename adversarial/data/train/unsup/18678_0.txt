Patio season has arrived! \nThis is my go to walk-to-able neighborhood bar and in the summer it's the first patio I look forward to visiting! \nThey have a great wooden lattice over half the patio that defuses light and lots of greenery. It looks like this year they've added a tree to the middle of the patio which will add shade and atmosphere as it grows. \nPlenty of bike parking and street parking if it's too far to walk for you. \nThey have a great beer tap list that is shorter than some but offers plenty of variety and options. They also offer a few bottles and great artisan cocktails, \nI've tried a few of their appetizers and entrees. I really enjoy their veggie burger, their fish fry and their gourmet grilled cheese. \nMy only complaint is the fact that they are cash only even though they take all their orders on fancy tablets... It just doesn't make sense to me. They do have an ATM on the premises but it's a real bummer to pay a fee. They do take checks, I guess it's just a little old fashioned for my taste! This place gets 5 stars for atmosphere and quality.
