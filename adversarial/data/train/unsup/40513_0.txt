My fiance and I were looking for a counter height breakfast table. Went to Ashley and the Roomstore. Found that their selections were decent but expensive even with sales going on. Found the Furniture Stop and found exactly what we were looking for. So we got a 5 piece set with a leef. Also has storage and a shelf underneath the table top. Solid wood with a beautiful finish. We also purchased 2 counter height bar stools for our island. So all together with Tax we were under $900. Heather was our sales rep and she was fantastic. The Furniture Stop is a family owned company not like the others. Truly recommend going buy and at least checking them out.
