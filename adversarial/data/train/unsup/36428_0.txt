Wow. Literally amazingly delicious. \nI was excited to try and was blown away. Not only was delivery faster than expected but all six flavors of cookie were delightful. Only weak link was white widow, kind of bland. But I ADORED fruity pebbles, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Confetti Wap flavors. I am so impressed. Will definitely order again.
