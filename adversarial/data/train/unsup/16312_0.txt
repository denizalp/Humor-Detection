From the Instagram-worthy dragon in the lobby to the cool industrial-pirate-ship style theater, Ka just oozes unique coolness from the moment you walk in. Unfortunately, I can't say that this is my favorite Cirque show in town- the characters are interesting, the performers are talented, and I really like the costumes, but there's not much of a storyline and some parts seemed to drag.\n\n I really enjoyed the underwater scene, the jungle scene, and the gold couple- they had such chemistry! The beach scene with the animals was some comic relief, and I want to recreate the crab costume myself. I would come again if the opportunity presented itself, but it wouldn't be my first pick to take visiting friends from out of town.
