In general, I would say this is an average military medical center. The Emergency Room is treated more as an urgent care clinic than an \"emergency\" room, however. They have a system that includes a \"fast track\" for non-emergent quick fixes.... This includes a 3-bed area where those deemed quick fixes can be in and out as quickly as possible. That's great and all unless you have a more serious issue and you're being held up waiting and watching several people who came in after you waltz in and out in no time... We waited in the waiting room for 6 hours for our 6-month-old with a 104 temp to be seen by a Doctor. I would have understood the wait more if we didn't watch about 20 people who came in after us get treated and leave before we were even taken back. Also, once we were finally back, our daughter was barely given a 2-minute checkup. Just a little frustrating... Something is wrong with this overall picture. \n\nLabor and delivery would get 4 stars... They lost a star when they failed to get me out of my stinky, dirty L&D room and into a post partum room in a timely manner. If it weren't for my mom being there, I would have been lying in gross birthing fluids the entire NINE (9) hour wait for our room. And no, they weren't backed up. We finally got a room when we had visitors come. I wish they would have come sooner!!! Maybe they would have moved me sooner?! \n\nOther than that, labs and pharmacy are your average long waits you'd expect.
