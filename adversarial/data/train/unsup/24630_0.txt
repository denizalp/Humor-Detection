I don't even know where to start with this review. I have been here on multiple occasions, because this is Bae's family's favorite restaurant. On one of the occasions I ordered chicken fried steak with brown gravy. Call me weird but I like my brown gravy. They brought me chicken fried chicken with brown gravy, when I asked to have it corrected they brought me chicken fried steak with white gravy. Tonight we took the oldest for her 15th birthday. We made it a point to say \"birthday girl\" in front of the waiter several times but he failed to even say Happy Birthday let alone do the whole birthday dessert deal. The youngest had the kids meal, which comes with a drink. She ordered the special lemonade with no refills. We were charged the full price and she was never offered the drink that came with the meal. When we pointed that out, our waiter said \"well, I brought her a water\". To top it all off, I ordered a $5.25 drink off the back of the cocktail menu. The receipt came out $7.50 because \"that's the happy hour menu\" which nowhere even indicated it's happy hour.  He was really attentive, but his flippant reaction to our questions on the unexpectedly overpriced bill was disappointing. As we were trying to leave he hovered a foot a way so he could grab the bill, which is such a major faux pas and rude.
