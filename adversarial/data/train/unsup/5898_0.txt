Last night I was excited to take my gf here for her birthday. I had made reservations online and even called in ahead of time to make sure my seats were reserved. I also heard some good things from some of my foodie friends. \n\nAs I walked in the hostess greeted me while on the phone. She asked me would I like to sit at the sushi bar. I told her that we would like to sit at a table. She said I would have to wait a few minutes which became about 15 minutes. I was already pretty annoyed that I had to wait for my seat when I had made reservations. \nFinally she walks us to our table and as I was walking I notice that there are empty tables. That even made me more upset than I already was. \n\nWe sit down and we are greeted by our waitress after I had to flag another one down so we could order. As I was ordering. It was actually harder then I thought because it seemed like we didn't understand eachother. When we finally got our order in, we waited a bit and the food came. Food was good but not worth what you pay for. I had ordered a dessert, the ny cheesescake. I got a plate with 2 small pieces with a scoop of green tea ice cream for $8! I was very disappointed. \n\nI had a very bad experience and I think I will never ever go there again. To me the money I spent was definitely not worth the service I had to deal with. Although the one male English speaking waiter was very helpful. Other then him, they can get rid of the waitress and start with the hostess. \n\nHow do they say 'bye' in Japanese? Oh yea. 'Sayonara'
