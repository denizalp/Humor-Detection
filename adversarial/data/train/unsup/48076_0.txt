If you judge on taste alone, there is nothing to complain about.  Their food is out of this world regardless of the location.  \n\nI'm not crazy about the seating arrangement in the new spot and I miss being able to sit at the bar and watch them cook.  I was hoping the new spot would allow for more seating to cut down on the wait times but it didn't.  Still, it's so good it's worth waiting for and sitting anywhere.  The best dining option in RH to me...and I'm not a big breakfast fan.
