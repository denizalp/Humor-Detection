Worst drive through experience ever... Let me start by saying I'm a chubby kid, I've eaten some McD's in my day. At this location I sat in line for 20 minutes, with only 3 cars ahead of me, only to receive some of the worst nuggets ever! My wife threw hers out before we got home, and I say to myself they can't be that bad, right?!? Wrong. I offered one to my dog, who, before today, had never talked. He looked me right in the face and said, \"Are you F'n kidding me with that?\"\n\nLong story short, it's so bad it will make your dog talk.
