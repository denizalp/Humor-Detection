It isn't very common to find a Japanese restaurant that is actually Japanese owned and doesn't have a sushi menu.  The location for this little shack is terrible, but it truly is a diamond in the rough when it comes to Japanese comfort food. \n\nI almost thought that it was closed when I first pulled up and walked in.  But the owner came out, greeted me, and had me pick a seat.  The decor was lack luster and very typical of older Asians.  Ahh, you non-Asians will just never understand.  \n\nWhen I looked at the menu, I was overwhelmed by the yakisoba, udon, ramen, and sukiyaki dishes I could choose from.  I was like a kid in the the candy store.  I ordered the beef sukiyaki and when it arrived, I couldn't have been happier.  \n\nThe vegetables were fresh tasting and cooked to perfection.  Every other restaurant I've been to undercooks or overcooks something. The broth wasn't too salty, and the beef didn't taste cheap.  I know that's a weird way to describe it, but it wasn't Chinese restaurant beef.  I also loved that you got miso soup and a salad with the entree. The price was reasonable and the portions were massive.   \n\nI left completely satisifed and impregnated with a lovely Japanese food baby.  I haven't had a chance to go back, but I definitely will.
