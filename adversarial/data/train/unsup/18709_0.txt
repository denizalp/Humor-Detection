I went to Heart Sushi today for AYCE sushi. I have previously visit Heart sushi in Heartland Town Centre and loved it! But this place was horrible! Seaweed salad smelt foul I couldnt even eat it. Salmon was dry! Beef short ribs were fatty. And service was slow. Once upside the sushi pizza and General Tao Chicken were crispy!
