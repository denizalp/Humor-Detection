This place is amazing... I've always passed by and wanted to try and I'm glad I did. Everything is made from scratch even down to the drinks. The tacos are delicious and Rebecca, Brittany and staff are very personable. I am definitely going back and bringing more guests with me so they can have the Diego Pops experience!! Dot forget happy hour 3-6 Mon-Fri and all day Sunday!!
