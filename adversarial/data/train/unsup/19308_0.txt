A little rough for our first visit, but I will definitely be returning to give them another go.\n\nThe first people in on a Sunday, we ordered some waters and the tuna tartar, pot stickers were a first choice but our server couldn't tell me if they were made in house or not (and for 6 bucks I can buy a whole bag of frozen ones at the store). My water came with not sure how old celery fibers glued to the inside of the glass, oh well. The tartar comes pre-portioned on fried wontons, nice, but kind of made me wish I was eating eez\/cowfish's nachos. \n\nAs we waited for our meal I started to watch the kitchen, one employee was on the phone behind the line, and another (he seemed to be the manager) was definitely eating something while assembling our food. Not the best etiquette for an open kitchen, or any kitchen, but I guess they didn't think the only table in the restaurant would notice.\n\nI ordered the tuna burger, it was good, but waaaaaay too many sprouts. My tuna looked like they had attempted to sear it before the cooking surface was hot enough, so there wasn't much texture to it, or any blackening, but the flavor was still nice. My dining partner ordered the Kalbi burger. He asked for it medium rare, it definitely arrived almost medium well, super juicy though, and still really tasty! I was torn between the tuna and the banh mi so I asked for a bit of the pickled veg to satisfy that craving... definitely sweeter than expected, and didn't really pack the vinegar punch, but they may just taste perfect with the rest of the burger.\n\nAs for the decor... well while our server wasn't tending to us she was helping glue mirrors on the wall, and the bathroom art definitely wasn't made by anyone skilled in the art of craft adhesives, unless large globs of dried glue all over was the point. Oh well.\n\nLoved the krupuk over fries decision, and definitely enjoyed the flavor combinations, so ill be back to try more!
