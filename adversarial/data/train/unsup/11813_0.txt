Not sure what's up with the 4 stars for this place. I ordered dosa and idli today and I am just disappointed with the amount of sambhar that came with this. By no means the sambhar will suffice for even one idli let alone the other two.\n\nGodavari, if you are aiming to maintain the clientele in the current pricing, pay close attention to the amount of accompniments with entrees. I am never returning to this business
