My wife sent me over to make a purchase.  The lady helping me was quick in finding what I was looking for and friendly.  \n\nThe only minus I would give this place is that the person I was dealing with said they didn't have bags.  It was raining outside.  Luckily I had made a purchase just before going here and had a bag already.  If I'm going to be spending $100 in your store you should have bags for your customers.
