Our first and last time staying here.. HORRIBLE service and honesty doesn't live in his hotel.\n\nI had booked for our room on Bookit.com (for dates 05\/12-05\/15\/2016) a few days prior to us coming out to Vegas. We should have received a king size bed, instead we got something else...\n\nWe arrived on Thursday and instead of getting our king size bed we had paid for, we were placed into what seems like 2 double twin size bed. We were given an option to upgrade our room and it would cost us $30 more per night, which I opted not to because I know what I booked for and what I paid for.  When I asked, the lady told me, \"we are out of King size beds right now, we can place you in one tomorrow after it becomes available, we will call you.\" \n\nThe lady who checked us in took down my phone number down and never once did we received a call that day. We waited ALL day on Friday.\n\n Saturday comes, my fiance walks down to talk to them, the tall white guy manager tells him, we can move you to another room now - at this point we were done, we spent 2 nights out of our 3 nights in the room we did not want already... So my fiance told the manager no, the manager then offers us what sounded like a great way to make it up to customers. He said, they will remove the daily resort fee off ($28\/day).. So we agreed to it.. Please explain to me how me and my fiance who's a little over six feet tall and weighs 205 pounds is supposed to fit in a little bed that seems to be the size of a twin size bed?? We're not overweight people. And we're not ones to complain, and if honesty was given to us, we would've been okay with it.\n\n Sunday comes around for check out, we were still charged a resort fee of $56.00 for 2 days. When I asked why, the guy (after speaking to his Manager (same manager as Saturday) who didn't even have the audacity to come speak to his customers after telling my fiance something different) told us that they only waived one of the resort fee of $28.00 and that I was still responsible for the $56.00 resort fee. \n\nWished our experience could've been better, but it wasnt. I'll be taking my business elsewhere. \n\nThanks,\n\nHotel Guest Room # 1281
