COFFEE & BEER\n\nLocated in an amazingly ugly new shopping complex way out Sahara.  The empty dirt lot looked a whole lot better.\n\nThe minute you get out of the car you're blasted with music-like sounds from speakers attached to the light poles.  Bet the nearby residents love that!  Why would you need tunes in the parking lot?\n\nThe store is incredibly noisy and nerve wracking.  Not fun at all.  \n\nUpon entering the first thing I saw was a large sign on the wall:  Salads.  No salads to be found, only lunch meat.  I had to ask where the heck the salads were.  The signs on the wall only suggest the general direction of the item being highlighted.  The \"Fine Wine\" sign is over the beer cooler.\n\nI found a good buy on New Belgium Rampant.  I was more than ready to down a couple of brewskis after a few minutes in this awful place.\n\nI'm not a connoisseur of fine coffee but their $9.99 organic French roast impressed me.  I doubt that good beer & coffee are reason enough for a repeat visit, however.  \n\nI was so put off by the tinny music and employees shouting and shrieking over the PA system I didn't spend much time here.  Note to staff:  When you have a PA system you don't have to yell into the microphone.  That's why you have a PA system.\n\nSprouts should be everything a traditional supermarket isn't.  That's what Sprouts is, but in a BAD way.
