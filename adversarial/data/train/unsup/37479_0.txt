I just had what was most definitely the worst service I've ever experienced.  I was with a group of friends celebrating a birthday, so yes, there was a large group of us, approximately 15 people. However, the waitress, Brittney, originally only took half of our table's order, we received our food and had eaten half of it before she came back to take the other half's order. I had not even realized that happened until we all looked across the table to notice that nobody  on the other side of the table had food, at all. No excuse or explanation was given when she finally returned. She never refilled our water, and only came around for drink orders twice in the 2.5 hours I was there.  \n\nThe food runner spilled food and drinks on multiple people and shouted out the food because there was no rhyme or reason to how it came out. When we were finished she brought bills to half the table before disappearing for 30 minutes (ironically, she gave the bills first to the group that got their food last), put people's orders on the wrong bill, then when there were only 3 of us left still waiting on our bills she came out and asked us what we had ordered because she had no clue.  My bill still came out wrong.  \n\nI understand having a large table can be a challenge sometimes, but to only take the order of half the table is inexcusable. We asked the food runner AND manager for help with our bills, neither one would help. The manager was too busy sitting down at other tables talking to customers. \n\nThe food was good, the drinks okay, and the music, while good was way too loud for the small space so we had to yell to be heard by the person sitting next to us. \n\nWe will not be back.
