On our last trip to Las Vegas, we decided to finally give this place a try. I had read and heard amazing things about Bouchon for brunch. Being a Sunday morning, I figure we would be waiting a good amount of time to be seated but the wait was bearable, only 10 minutes. \n\nThis place is pretty big and has plenty of wonderful lighting coming from outside with some windows having the view of the Venetian gardens. During our wait we decided to go roam around and check out the beautiful pool and hot tubs in this area.\n\nFOOD:\n*French toast $12- I love that this french toast wasn't like your typical french toast slices. This stack is bread pudding style with some sweet apples layered in it along with some custard. The french toast was soft with just the right amount of sweetness.\n\n\n*Pastry Basket $13- Beignet, apple crisp, almond and chocolate and muffin. The beignet was alright (I've had better.. ahem disneyland ahem). It was a little on the tougher side rather than being soft and fluffy. The apple crisp was good but it didn't blow me a way. I wish it was a bit sweeter. The muffin was probably one of the bestest muffins I've ever had haha. The almond and chocolate pastry though, amazing!! Totally loved it. The roasted almonds, just enough chocolate hints in the delicious pastry to make me swoon. \n\n*Coffee: not as bold as I would like it but it was refilled a good amount of times by our server. \n\nWould love to go back and try out their omelette or maybe even their croque madame which is a grilled ham, egg and cheese sandwich. \n\nThe reason why I deducted a star was the service. Although our server was on top of our order, I felt like they were a bit distant and not as friendly as I would think they should be during our brunch, she was extra nice to the table next to us though which made me feel like she didn't value us as much. Would this hold me back from coming here again? No. I would totally love to come back and get some more bread love in me.
