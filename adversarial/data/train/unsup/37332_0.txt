From the outside, this place is not that noticeable.  But inside, it is huge.  Biggest Sketchers store I have been to and lots to choose from.\n\nMy negative is that the prices are no better than anywhere else. I didn't find exactly what I wanted and ended up going to the Sketchers in the Venetian, which opened recently. Prices were better and I found what I wanted.  Plus, the salespeople were more personable.\n\nGood place to go to and Sketchers is a good product, but bigger doesn't necessarily mean better, no matter what some women think. :)
