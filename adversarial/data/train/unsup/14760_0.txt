I have waited patiently since the grand opening for the right time to dine here, the location is new and the anticipation before opening was all the buzzzzz. I tried the seasonal menu and ordered the carved turkey Beni  carved turkey, cornbread caked with a side of potatoes and smothered with fried leeks, sounds delicious right??? What I received was.. carved turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy.. my order was way wrong. It sound yummy but was completely heavy and non complimentary of flavors. When our waitress asked how our food was I asked her politely if my order was incorrect. After minutes of scrambling and confusion the manager came to our table to tell us they ran out of cornbread cakes. So simple yet not communicated to me because I happily would have ordered another dish. \nSecond, we ordered carved turkey with stuffing waffles and we received a regular Belgian waffle. Totally bogus. No comp, no apologies, no communication. \nLong story short, we happily won't return.
