Big Fan! This is my favorite place to be on the weekends. I love digging through the old records. Such a great selection. The staff is really nice and they always suggest new rad music that I didn't know about. This is where anyone looking for Christmas gifts for me should come. When my Fianc√© was looking for someone to repair my vintage record player the cool kids at Lunchbox hooked him up with a neighborhood guy who works on them in his free time. They even showed me how to change the needle on my record player when I bent it. Kudos Lunchbox... you're the dopiest!
