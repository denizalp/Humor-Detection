What can you do with One Hour?\n... You can sit down with a book and order a tea beverage.\n... Catch up with friends...\n... Sink into a beanbag chair and do nothing.\n\nIf you were Jack Bauer, you could diffuse a bomb, save the president, and expose an international terrorist group.\n\nAnyways, there are very few bubble tea places that I like downtown.  One Hour offers a beautiful and modern space to relax.  This place is huge.  I didn't even notice the (much nicer) back room until I got up to look for a restroom.\n\nThe service is friendly, but this place is still very new.\nA few weeks ago, I showed up at 9pm and the place was closed.\nSo, I called today to check if they were open before showing up.\n\nAt first I loved the idea of bean bag chairs. \"Oh! What fun!\"\nWhich later turned into \"Oh! My back!\" as I sank further to the floor.\n\nThe menu was much smaller than expected.\nIt has basic flavours of bubble tea and maybe 5 food items.\n\nWe ordered some One Hour specialty drinks.\nThe lemon-honey with aloe was pretty tasty!  \nIt was perfectly sour and sweet, and the aloe bits were way better than tapioca.\n\nThe banana tea looked good.  But unfortunately it was more ice than banana.  And the chocolate cookie stick garnish was a bit oddly placed.\n\nThe food was very simple and a bit more expensive than it should be.\nBut it's a fancy bubble tea place, so I'm not surprised.\n\nThe spicy wonton is not at all spicy.  But it's hot and hits the spot if you want some comfort food.  It's a snack so if you're hungry, it probably won't be enough.\n\nThe spicy beef noodles were surprisingly good.  Served warm (not hot), garnished with the same sauce as the wontons.\nA soy, vinegar, sesame sauce which was light and well balanced and topped with heaps of green onions.\n\nI like this place.  I hope that they will keep adding items to their menu.\nThis is one of my go-to places for tea downtown!
