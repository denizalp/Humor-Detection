Beautiful Hotel inside and out. The room is perfectly designed. one of the better rooms on the strip. Front desk staff also pretty awesome. Grazie club is worth signing up with great comps. Fantastic restaurants, good pool, good nightlife. I took a star away for several reasons. that dont mean a whole lot in the grand scheme of things.\n1. Parking- kind of round about\n2. Valet not convenient at all, might as well park your own car.\n3. hotel bars. suck. service not equal to other services in the hotel.\n4. Pretty high limit tables throughout. i mean im Not looking for 5 dollar tables but 100 roulette?
