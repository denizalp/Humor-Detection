We rented a property for 3 years they managed at a high end complex.  Mike was good about taking care of problems but he either left or went to a different office.  The new manager got a lot of this messed up.  The also tried to screw us on our deposit, but failed to provide evidence of any discrepancies on our part.  We were entitled to a copy of the final walk through which had no discrepancies or violations and it was never provided.  She tried to gig us twice for the cleaning deposit we had already paid.  I would warn you as a prospective renter to carefully review the contract and question some of the demands.
