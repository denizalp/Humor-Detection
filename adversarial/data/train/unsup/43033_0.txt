Excellent dentist. Dr. Kim is very professional and he runs his business properly. He has taken good care of my teeth after my previous dentist screwed them up. One thing I especially love about him is that he lets my teeth heal rather than insisting that they need work done right away. My husband and myself both have anxiety at the dental office and he is very good at making us comfortable and relaxed. I really appreciate all of his concern and care for my family.
