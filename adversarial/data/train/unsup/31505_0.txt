I have been using Regal for about 10 years now.  I have been dry cleaning my clothes here in the valley for 20.  BY FAR the best dry cleaners I have ever used and not over-priced whatsoever.  Other dry cleaners provided average service and over time destroyed my clothes.  At Regal, the service is quick and friendly, the owner is pleasant and readily available and when something is torn or lost (only happened twice in a decade mind you) they accepted responsibility and were quick to resolve the situation fairly.  I love Regal cleaners!  -- DBT
