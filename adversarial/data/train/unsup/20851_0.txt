So your in Vegas trying to convince your poor boyfriend to take you to see yet another Cirque Du Soleil show, and then maybe make him pay exorbident cover charges to watch you get hit on by college kids while he buys you overpriced girl-tini's at tryst. You could be selfish and say \"oh well thats his job\" or you could offer up a nice little \"spend a night drinking chocotinis with me at tryst, and I'll spend a day with you at Lagasse's stadium, watching sports, drinking beer and eating nachos, deal?\"  If you think he's a keeper make the deal, you'll earn a ton of girlie brownie points!\n\nLagasses stadium is very friendly to even the most nonsports fans. This is  from someone who considers Superbowl Sunday just a day to show off her super crispy yet nice n saucy hot wing cooking skills........The set up reminded me of giant living room, a giant living room in your most well off friends house mind you, but definitely still a cozy living room where you can comfortably nod off on a huge overstuffed couch while your other but not neccesarily better half gets his sports fix in.\n\nThe food was typical bar food \"kicked up a notch\" ala Emeril. Ahi tuna melts, shrimp salad sammies, grilled ribeye and horseradish mashed potatoes..... They probably need to bring him back to clean up the menu and the cooking a little, I liked the food, but for the price I thought they could have done a little better. My shrimp salad only had two shrimp......In the end I couldnt be mad about it though as this place still beats sitting in any of the other dark, dingy, smokey sports books around town by a long shot! Take my word for it, or since your in Vegas- bet on it!
