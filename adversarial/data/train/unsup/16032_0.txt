I finally got to try this place out.  After years of knowing about it and not doing anything about that I got my day.\n\nMeat!  Lots and lots of delicious meat!  \n\nThe salad bar was great, but I knew that I didn't come here for that.  I tried my best to be brief at the bar, but I couldn't resist.  Wonderful selection of veggies and cheeses.  Smoked salmon as well.  The hearts of palm were crunchy, the artichoke hearts were wonderful.  I was in love, but I was ready for meat.\n\nFirst they clear your plate and throw down some side dishes.  Truthfully none of the sides looked tempting.  It was a small portion, but I bet if we wanted more, we'd get it.  \n\nThe second you flip that button to allow meat, they come running over.  Skewers upon skewers of meat.  All of them were wonderful but some were better than others.  Stay away from the bacon wrapped filet and Parmesan crusted pork.  Both were not that good.  I also noticed that I prefer the meat when it's straight out of the flame.  If it sits around more than 15 minutes, it's not as good.\n\nWhat I really liked about the place was the service.  Top notch.  They let us know right away that they work as a team.  So if we didn't see the server that first waited on us, we could ask anyone.  That was true.  There were about 6 people helping us at all times.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the place was I felt a little rushed.  The rest of my party was done eating and I was still trucking.  Not only did they clear the table while I was still eating, the waiter even presented the desserts.  Dessert was the last thing on my mind while they were still bringing me meat.  \n\nHowever the dessert (if you can make it) were spectacular.  We had the creme brule and the molten chocolate cake.  Both were fabulous.\n\nOverall, I'd come back here again and again and again.  It was wonderful
