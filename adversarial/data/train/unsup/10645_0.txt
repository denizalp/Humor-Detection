Biaggio's has the best garlic knots I've ever eaten!\nThey were so soft, hot, buttery, and fluffy, melt in yo mouf status. I could eat like two orders of those! \n\nMy wife and I shared the White pizza (no racial, that's what it was called) which included mozzarella and ricotta cheese, olive oil, garlic, and we also added pepperoni to it. It was a simple yet tasty pizza, and the ricotta gave it a nice touch. \n\nAlso got an order of their wings, and its sauce came on the side which I prefer anyways. The wings were hot and crispy to the touch, and the buffalo sauce was fantastic!\n\nWe dined in, and the service was outstanding. We'll definitely be back, especially for those garlic knots!
