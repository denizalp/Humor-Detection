I'm a Drake fangirl so dining at this restaurant was a must while I was visiting the 6. FYI, for those from the States, Chef Susur Lee's status is comparable to Bobby Flay (Fun Fact: They had an Iron Chef battle and they tied!). Pro tip: Make a reservation via OpenTable!\n\nI would describe the cuisine as Asian comfort food. Our server suggested 4-5 plates but we were feeling stuffed after 4. Their drink menu is also very extensive and consists of several different wines and cocktails. You can also choose from a 5 or 9 oz. glass of wine, or the whole bottle! We ordered: guacamole (I would probably do without the olives, but that's just me), freshly chucked oysters which came with all of the fixins', grilled octopus with potato salad and the mushroom medley and black truffle pappardelle and it was ALL flavorful, hearty and delicious.\n\nThe restaurant itself is cozy and romantic and ideal for a date night. Hiphop and r&b songs are playing softly in the background and there are even fuzzy chairs to sit on! The service was on point throughout our meal and we felt very welcomed there. There's also 6 memorabilia and a glow sign that says \"6 on a wave\" in emojis downstairs right by the bathroom.\n\nDefinitely a must try when you're in the 6.
