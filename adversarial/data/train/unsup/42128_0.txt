While shopping at the Canal Shops my mother and I were stopped by a very nice young lady at Brilliance. She had some samples and then had my mom go in for some eye cream sample. After the application her eyes looked great. After hearing about the products my mother decided to think it over as they were a little costly ($550). She was given the full court press to stay and buy right then and there. That is when she became concerned. It almost became uncomfortable. She stood her ground and decided to think it over and possibly come back. After about an hour I looked at her and noticed that her under eye area was chalky white. Every place the sample had been put on was this very off putting white paste like substance. She tried to wash it off in a bathroom but it was like glue. And her eyes looked worse than before. \nSo needless to say she did not go back and buy the product. The whole experience was odd to say the least. Glad she did not spend the cash on a product that would not work for her.
