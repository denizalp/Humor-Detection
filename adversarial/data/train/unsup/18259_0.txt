Let's face it...I brought this on myself. Who the hell decides it's a good idea to save like $20 by stopping in Vegas on the way from Nashville to Los Angeles. I do...I suppose. I had a two hour layover at McCarran on a Saturday morning right after CES. The thing about this airport is it's freaking tiny...I mean it's huge but really the ceilings are soooo low and there's hardly any seating so most people are sprawled along the hallways. There are slot machines around every corner which you think might be kind of fun until you realize they're shitty machines and most people sitting at them are asleep because there is no where else to sit! In fact most people in the place were either hung over, drunk or asleep. Again to be expected in Vegas. Also in my particular case the airplane was in the air for 40 minutes between Vegas and LA and the stop over was completely pointless really. I will never make that mistake again.
