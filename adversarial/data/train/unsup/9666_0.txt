Your throat hurts? Coughing out a lung or two while gambling at Vegas?  Well come on by and get some Golden Throat Lozenge!  My sister and friend claims it's the best thing since the creation of the toilet!  It could be yours for a very low price. \n\nThis location was cluttered and tight, and the moment you walk in you'll be hit with the smelled of ancient Chinese medicine.  The smell alone will cure any ailments that you might have.  Simply Amazing!\n\nGreat variety of medicines for anything you can muster up, great variety of teas too!! White for beauty, green for weight, black for health and every shade in between.  Flower type teas they have too.  Fuse them all together and throw some mushrooms and ginger and a lotus root with a splash of honey and it could even give cancer a challenge.  Just kidding.  Bat wings, rat tail and a venom sac of some lizard.. just kidding just over reacting here.  I was so convincing talking with my sister at the store other customers thought I was working there and wanted my suggestions.  \n\nOverall a good place with a great selection, and reasonably priced goods.  Give them a try if you're not feeling to well!
