I go to a different LVAC 3 times a week but today I came here with a friend; the gym itself is awesome but the kids playroom was a disaster. The kid jungle gym was closed so they had almost 50 kids clamoring over a couple computers and a movie; it was so uncool. My kid was bored and called me after 20 minutes so no real workout for me. With this place being shiny and new you would think they would keep on their equipment.
