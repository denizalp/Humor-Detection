Being a pretty girl in Vegas, no problems.\nBeing a pretty girl with 2 other pretty girl friends, definitely no problems.\nHelps knowing a promoter and comped admission. \nWent here on Halloween day. Great dance party. The DJ definitely brought the beats. The views were breathtaking of the mountains in the background and it was still 80 degrees outside. Drinks are cheaper than most Manhattan rooftop bars. Oh and they brought in McDonalds cheeseburgers. There were a lot of very drunk appreciative people.  Win, Win all around.
