I know some of our wedding guests were talking about yelping our band, so I'm jumping on now to make sure I get the FTR (First to Review)...\n\nI allowed Jared (my husband and yes I still love saying that), to choose this band for our wedding.  While we attempted to go hear them play once at the Blue Martini, it turned out to be an off night, so we missed them.  But I trusted him and I'm sure glad I did... They were incredible!\n\nThis band had the dance floor packed from the minute the ballroom doors opened until they packed up to leave... they played a wide range of music from Stevie Wonder to AC\/DC to Black Eyed Peas and a ton in between.  They also chimed in when appropriate during my Dad's FOB (Father of the Bride) speech... they were on it!\n\nWe couldn't be more pleased with The Instant Classics' performance at our wedding... our only complaint was that the night had to end!\n\nIf you're looking for a band for a special occasion, give them a call... (and tell them Gabi and Jared sent you). Or if you want to go see them perform, I know they have a few regular gigs around the Valley - go check them out.  We are forever fans and look forward to seeing them again real soon!
