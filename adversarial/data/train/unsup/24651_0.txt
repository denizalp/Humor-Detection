As I tell you this incredible  story of this restaurant this evening consider this ... \n                      Would you want to dine at a place that could care less about the value of \"every single\" customer?\"\n                      Would you dine at a place that all they care about is how many people they can get in and out of the door?\n                      Would you dine at a place that would lie to you about reservations or tells you a different \"story\" about the reservations when you get there?Even after you spoke with them earlier that very day? OF COURSE you would not!\n                        Makes me wonder with this Walmart Attitude( who cares about you there is plenty more coming in the door) for the diner what about the food? Seems like this would certainly carry over. I mean if you could care less about the diner then you could care less about the preparation of the Food!\n                         To make a long story short about a month ago I called this place for reservations for a Unofficial YELP event I spoke with the Kitchen manager I told him the number of people the time and date his reply\" No problem just give me a call the day of to see if you can give him a more accurate number \" Sorry never been to a restaurant that after you made reservations they wanted \" YOU\" to call them back to make sure of the number.I have had restaurant call to confirm my reservation never anything about numbers of people.\n                           So I get there this evening and first they acted like I did not have a reservation for our group then with a painful conversation  \" it\" was decided that I did WHAT? I called you about a month ago and then today! So a new seemed like untrained and inexperienced  manager ( Maybe she should go back to Burger King hopefully she was a better manager there)came up and explained\" You have to wait until at least have your party comes before we can seat you?\"\n                          I reminded her that I set this up a month ago nothing was said about this and called today and nothing was said about it I told her there was about a 1000 places to dine within a 20 mile radius and we could have went to any of those had we knew this was going to be like a ROOT CANAL !!!\n                           She left and she said\" Let me check on your table \" after about 20 minutes she never came back. I told the 14 hostesses that we will go else where and left .\n                            So Would you go to a restaurant like this? NO ! I have had less reservation problems with having a birthday party at Chucky Cheese!\n                Cheddar's TERRIBLE !!!
