I was extremely disappointed with my visit to this restaurant last Saturday. The service was incredibly poor. We were greeted by a wine server and he delivered our choices quickly. All down hill after that. He never did come back to offer us more wine, water etc... Our server asked for our orders and never told us of the specials (I heard her tell another table later). After taking our order she NEVER spoke to us again. Everything dropped at our table was said without a word and then she would bolt. NO one ever asked us how our meal was (which was terrible) and when I ate barely any of my meal the wine server returned to clear the plates again without a word. There was tons of food on the plate and yet he dumped all the napkins, utensil etc... in the bowl without asking if it should be bagged up. Luckily I never would have been taken it home. Ordered mussels that lacked any flavour at all, and there was no broth in the bowl. I ordered clam linguine. It was dull, watery, and looked and tasted like they dumped a can of flavourless clams on top. My husband didn't mind his veal parm, but it certainly wasn't anything to write home about. For a $110 meal I expect MUCH better. Avoid this place, there are tons of nicer Italian restaurants in the area.
