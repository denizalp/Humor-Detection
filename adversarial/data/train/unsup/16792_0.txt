HMMMM, how should I begin a Review of this type......Oh yea, THIS KICKED ASS!\n For One Price you get picked up at destination close to your place of residence then shuttled to three or more LOCAL Breweries all over the city where the Brew Masters are waiting to chat and sample you on all of their latest Craft Creations. \n NEED MORE? Ok, you also get lunch or dinner depending on the tour!  If you have ever eaten at any of the breweries in town you know the food is quite tasty so this is a BIG PLUS after all of the beer sampling.  THE BEST PART?  *It's all included!  \nThe company owner John Alvarado and his drivers are friendly and knowledgeable, the shuttle buses are clean and orderly, the destinations are Carefully Chosen for Quality and when you plan on enjoying your evening with a few pints, nothing beats a designated driver.  Truly a Blast and Well Worth the Spend.\nARIZONA BREWERY TOURS ROCKS!  5 BIG TASTY STARS!
