This location is in the southwest corner of \"The Las Vegas Outlet Mall South \" There is plenty of parking, the coffee is a bit bitter and the waiter didn't seem to be to attentive to refill it. Nice mugs with the logo on it to drink from. The food arrived but at the table next to us. The food is great though. Once the table location was established. Had to ask for a coffee refill. They are getting busy with a lunch time crowd. Still trying to make up my mind wether I will return.
