3.5 stars.  Portions were very generous, but pretty pricey for Chinese... Oh Vegas!  I was tempted to order the $20 bowl of pho that ppl were raving about but couldn't convince myself it would be worth $20... \n\nWent w the Yunnan noodle soup - so glad I did!!  Very flavorful - spicy, garlicky the and fishballs were cooked perfectly... However, msg overload as it was way too salty and I drank several cups of tea and water during my meal. \n\nDon't waste your time or $ on the pork and duck egg congee... Meh.\n\nMy gf ordered one of the chicken noodle soups and it was uber plain, don't recommend that either.
