I ordered a small cone which yielded two massive C-cup-sized scoops of Green Tea and Greg's signature Roasted Marshmallow ($4). For a visual of how top heavy this cone was, think of Tori Spelling post-boob job.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the Roasted Marshmallow flavor, I found the ice cream to be so rich and excessively creamy it was like licking a ball of sweet butter. I like my green tea ice cream intensely green and chock full of matcha. Greg's version, a mere celadon in color, was pretty weak. \n\nGreg's is OK given the dearth of choices in the neighborhood but not worth waiting for in those insane line-ups. However, given a choice between Greg's or Baskin Robbins down the street, I'd choose Greg's.
