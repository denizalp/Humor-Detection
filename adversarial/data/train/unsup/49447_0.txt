We visited this past weekend  for a surprise party for a friend. There was 22 people in our party and the waitress did a great job keeping up on everyone's drink orders.  The menu had plenty of choices for drinks and food.\nThe only issue we had was that 5 of us ordered burgers  that were served about 10-15 minutes after everyone else was served.  The burgers must've been forgotten on the grill as they were all charred.  We did mention to the waitress but was given the excuse that they are cooked over a open flame. Which would be fine if the order was for well done.\nThe ready of the food looked very good.  I just won't order a burger there again.\n\nWe will be back as it is a neat place and the staff is friendly.
