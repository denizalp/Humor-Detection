My son and I love the soda shoppe not just because it reminds me of the fifties and the original soda shops, the great and unique food, and the prices, but the staff. Sarah, a serving specialist, is as cute as they come and a really personable teenager. Julie is very kind and friendly and makes a fantastic banana split. Amada who is in charge is a dynamic person, full of energy and gorgeous. She is the queen of banana splits. I love the staff and so does John, Jr. It's our place to eat lunch. We love drawing cartoons on napkins for the staff and watch them smile.
