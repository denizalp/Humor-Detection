Oh dear, where to begin.\n\nI ordered the fish tacos and it was absolutely terrible. It was slaughtered in spicy sauce (that had no flavour), but was in my best guess, used to mask what little taste the tacos had. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it.... \n\nMy server was probably a 15 year old, and this gig is probably her first job. She kept \"checking up on us\", but every time she came over to ask how we were doing, I would have to give her a friendly reminder and ask her for more water (when every time she approached us, my glass was half empty). My friend asked for ice (because the water was room temperature), which would've been the first hint that the water being served is too warm. However, she never took that hint and continued to serve the same pitcher of warm water.\n\nAt the end of my meal, I went to the washroom and came out to see my server hiding out in the washroom texting on her phone....\n\nTerrible food and terrible service. I wouldn't come back nor recommend this place. You're better off at a Wendy's.
