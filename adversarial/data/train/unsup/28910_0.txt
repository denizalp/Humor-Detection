This is always the place to stay in Vegas. The rooms are large and have all the amenities. The penthouse suites are a perfect upgrade for special occasions with nice meeting rooms and a sound system to fill the big square footage. Most of all, unlike other hurried front desks, there is awesome personal customer service, thank you Keoki!
