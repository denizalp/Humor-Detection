If I could rate this rate this restaurant less than 1 star, I would. I've never been in a restaurant that has been this disorganized, ever.\n\nBeyond having to wait for a table to be set in a near empty restaurant, and the seat staff not knowing what tables were available without having to personally go upstairs and come back down, I should have known to leave then. The menu was fairly uninspiring, and the food of my neighbour's was presented like a whopper from burger king.  Having been asked by the same server whether i had been helped placing an order 3 times, all threes times with the same answer of no, a young server finally came to my beckon! Going past my judgement and her lack of knowledge of what was behind the bar, I managed to order a drink and settled with the 'Jerk' sandwich...I was confused if whether that was a description of the chef who made it, or if that was supposed to be the seasoning used on the sandwich. It was flavourless and loaded in what seemed like Mayonnaise, an interesting choice for a jerk sandwich. The bread, as mentioned in another review, was stale and hard to bite in to. I'm not sure if they had a dessert menu, as after waiting 20 minutes for the table to be cleared, i decided to just ask for the bill. \n\nThe mish-mash of furniture, utensils, salt and pepper shakers (missing at most tables) made it feel like it was laid out by an amateur, or on a budget that didn't quite fit for new furniture. It's a pity as this restaurant is taking up a great location, and has the word 'potential' written all over it. If the owner reads reviews: Toss your menu, Train \/ hire some experienced staff, and pick one style of furniture for the room! Brampton needs more quality non-franchised restaurants with personality...just pick a different personality!
