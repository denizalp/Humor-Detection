I was referred to Dr. Or by a friend in my nursing program. I highly recommend him because he takes the time to go over all of my health concerns and no complaint was ever too trivial. He is very thorough in his examinations and spends a lot of time for patient teaching. This is one of the distinguishing factors that separates him from many other PCPs I've dealt with. I didn't feel like I was being rushed out for the next patient \n\nHis office accepted my school health insurance, which was awesome. I was only charged a co-pay for each visit. I also never waited more than 10 mins! Shocking, right?\n\nAlso, I sent my BF to Dr. Or for his Hyperthyroidism and the meds he was prescribed definitely decreased a lot of the symptoms my BF had. Less than 2 weeks into the treatment and my BF NO longer had palpitations, tremors, & the rapid weight loss! \n\nDr. Or is great, intelligent and personable! I would recommend him to anyone!
