Interesting decor, delicious mushroom and Swiss cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. It's somewhat overpriced for what it is. Service was fine; it didn't take too long to get cocktails or our food. \n\nIt seems a bit overrated...maybe we'll try the Fireside Lounge part next time just for the atmosphere\/drinks.
