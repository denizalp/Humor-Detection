What the heck? Are you kidding me?\n\nThis place is teensy tiny. You walk up the stairs, to the left there's a dancefloor the size of my living room with a disco ball hanging and various tables surrounding it. To the right there's a circular bar with other tables surrounding that. Then there's a bathroom... that's it.\n\nNo balcony?? No view?? No theme?! Okay.. just some go-go dancers and a disco ball?\n\nPlus the music was some hip-hop\/rap that you can't even dance to.\n\nWe only came here to get passes to TAO, as our promoter told us he would only give it to us after visiting Eve. Plus, the girls got in free but the boys paid $20 each. NOT WORTH IT!\n\nWho cares if this is Eva Longoria's club? That's probably the only reason there are people in it. Terrible.
