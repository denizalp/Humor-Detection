Small place, not the cleanest but that's a given for restaurants in Chinatown .. \n¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯\n\nSERVICE SUCKS! \nNo one greeted or acknowledged us at the door, only 2 two-seater tables were taken, was not busy at all - so no excuse.\n\nTook another 10 mins to place an order.\n\nSeries of \"hands in the air, like we just don't care\" to get her attention throughout the whole time. I just don't find it necessary to wait that long to be seated, to get our order taken, to ask for water, and to get our check.\n\nWe ordered a few boba drinks, the hazelnut toast, potstickers, and red bean with green tea snow ice.\n\nBoba - wasn't impressive.\n\nHazelnut Toast - poorly executed, nothing special and it was JUST hazelnut spread on toast.\n\nPotstickers - comes with about 8 pieces, pan-fried, wasn't a fan of the open sides ; little one liked it, so must be \"ok\".\n\nRed Bean with Green Tea Snow Ice - the green tea shaved ice was really good, green tea flavor definitely stood out. I found the whole thing to be TOO sweet, especially after 4-5 bites because the ice was sweet, the red bean was sweet, then they top it off with condensed milk. Good but talk about DIABETES!\nIt came in the cute, heart-shaped, medium sized bowl -- I'm a sucker for cutesy details!\n\nWill I come back? Not on purpose..
