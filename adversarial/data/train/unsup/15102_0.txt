I have traveled the Midwest to find a place such as this.... THE WORLDS WORST RESTAURANT. \n\nSome would say I am a sadomasochist for bad food, horrible service, and a restaurant that (quite frankly) smells like poo (this is not artistic license, when you walk in the first set of doors just breathe in and remember this review haunting you from the interwebs). Well after eating here I would have to agree.\n\nIf it is fried they can make it, only not well.\n\nStay far far away. It is like a diner from hell, wrapped in a hand basket, dipped in batter, fried, served cold because it takes 30mins to get anything out of the kitchen.
