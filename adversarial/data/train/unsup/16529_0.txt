I will try to be as fair about this review as I can be. \n\nThe good points. This hotel is certainly impressive, and the accommodations are top notch. It is certainly in keeping with the root Italian word of this Hotel's sobriquet, which is Bella! Something extraordinarily beautiful that it is unforgettable. You sigh at beholding such beauty.\n\nHowever, my sigh comes from the extravagant price of the suite that did not quite deliver on our expectations.\n\nWe arrived during a very busy holiday weekend, and the only room available was a Private Suite at $600 \/ night. I politely asked what type of amenities came with this room, and I was provided with a well written brochure outlining the impressive size and view of this quite expensive room. \n\nNeedless to say, we were quite impressed and handed the lady my American Express Card.\n\nAs we were escorted upstairs, we had very high expectations as to what this room would be like. \n\nWe have stayed in many suites in many hotels in Las Vegas, and we were informed that this was going to be better than any of them.\n\nWhen the door swung open, we were greeted with what amounted to a nice comfortable suite whose description did not align itself with what we saw, and summarily experienced. The suite was smaller than what we expected, and it's layout actually was not as functional. There were too many hidden corners. Instead of a nice expansive view, we had a room that was like a maze. \n\nHonestly, in all the times that I have stayed in LV, this was the most disappointing experience I have ever had seeing as that I was paying a lot for this room.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be staying in another Bellagio Suite ever again. \n\nNot for even half what they charged us for this Suite. \n\nThere are much better hotels in LV than this for 1\/3 the price that are so much better.
