I don't know why we've never eaten here before. We have been in for drinks before heading to Avenue B and liked the space. Oh wait, Avenue B IS the reason I've not eaten here before! One of my fav places. But now I have options! So good!!!\n\nSweet corn ice cream. The last part of my meal, the first thing I think about. Doesn't sound like something you'd order, right? But holy crap was it AMAZING!! Wow. \n\nWe went here for our anniversary hoping for a great dining experience and that's just what we had! From the moment we valet parked the car at the door ($3!) to the moment we left, every bit was spectacular. Food, atmosphere, service.. all spot on. I started with the Korean fried chicken app with whipped miso, gochujang (have no idea what that is but it's damn tasty) and a fried egg on top. Decadent. My wife opted for the melon salad, a seemingly innocent, mundane sounding choice but I'm here to tell you it was anything but! When did you last have a meat pickle of hangar steak? Just what I thought. OMG. \n\nEntrees were the scallops for my wife and swordfish for me. Ok, I know what you're thinking. Boring. Ha. You would be SO WRONG!!  I rarely order swordfish but this preparation was so intricate and layered with flavors that I'm not sure I'll ever have its equal. The raisin chutney on there just knocked my socks off. And my wife's scallops? Huge, so fresh, perfectly cooked with complex flavors that kept you wanting more. I admit to having a couple bites...\nAnd yes, the biscuits people rave about were indeed good. \n\nAnd for those reviewers who have complained about pricing I say this - get the burger. It's inexpensive. But if you want a high quality meal, fair pricing, superbly prepared food, and a memorable experience, get here. I'll be back. And it will be before my next anniversary!!
