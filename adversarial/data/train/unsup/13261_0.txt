I understand being busy, but I don't understand being rude to your customers. My wife and I had a very bad experience at their food court thanks to one of the very rude employees named Sarah, who needs to be re-trained on how to be polite. After having to deal with a person like that, I am seriously considering not renewing my membership. I have been a Costco member for 23 years in 2 different states, but after today, I am not sure it's worth it. ::::::::: UPDATE ::::::::: My wife and I decided to no longer shop at Costco.
