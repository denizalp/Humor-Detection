Service department knew exactly what TV I was calling about that broke. They intentionally sell junk then told me to google the manufacturer and call them since I didnt buy their warranty. TV is 60 days old and already broke down LOL. Its under the 90 day warranty. When they thought I DID have the \"extended warranty\" they were already telling me it wasn't covered LOL. So anyone thinking of buying from these junk merchants or their extended warranties that cover nothing....good luck! Stick with Wal Mart or Best Buy. Frys is a rip off
