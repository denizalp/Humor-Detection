Beautiful location and fantastic food!  I was in pretty bad shape when I visited here (my Grandma had just passed away that evening) and our server was so sweet.  She helped me with my tears by bringing me delicious drinks!  My steak was heavenly and the sides were fantastic.  I don't think you can go wrong at any Fleming's!  I wish I could remember what I had but it was a pretty stressful day.  I do remember loving it though!  My drink was the Farmer's Daughter and they go down like water.
