Words cannot describe the truly unique journey you go through on their tasting menu. I'm not even going to try. It is a show, an experience, and a memory that will last for decades.\n\nSo I will say this:\n\nWe paid $99\/ea for the 12 course tasting menu, another $64 for 5 wine pairings. \nTo me that is a lot of money for dinner. I think this is one of the most expensive meals I have ever had. \n\nIt is WORtH EVERY PENNY though, In fact sitting back and reflecting I would value the meal I received that night at $450 per person. No joke, if tomorrow they increased the price to $299 for the 12 course meal and wine went to $149 I wouldn't even hesitate pulling out my American Express. They would deserve it. The food is so incredible and the service exquisite. I have never felt so highly valued. I think we had 3-4 waitstaff taking care of us. I tipped 45% and felt they deserved more.\n\nThis place is so good I am going to take my wife and fly non-stop from San Francisco to Montreal, have dinner and stay the night and fly back the next day. \n\nThis restaurant is truly world class. It surpassed my every expectation and I will be back annually for anniversaries and\/or very special occasions.
