I recently had my wedding at the wedgewood and it was amazing! Megan and Kendall handled everything for me and made it totally stress free! Dj Matt was amazing....best dj I have ever seen if you want a good party make sure he is there!!! The food was great! Alexis my banquet captain did and amazing job as well. I would definitely recommend the Wedgwood for any event you might be having. The entire staff was amazing:))\n\nThank you so much for making my wedding such an amazing one:)
