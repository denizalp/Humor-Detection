Seriously amazing ice cream. I was in Chandler for the evening and I'm SO glad my friends and I went to McMahon's to satisfy our sweet tooth. When we walked in, there was another family being helped and we weren't greeted immediately but soon enough we were offered a multitude of samples. Jim (the owner) and his two employees let us try all of the flavors our hearts desired and were very catering even when I decided I wanted a cone instead of a cup (after seeing how good it looked, obviously). This place definitely has a homey, mom and pop vibe, especially with the board games at each table. The ice cream itself is awesome too - great flavor selection. It is super, super rich and they hand out pretty hefty scoops so make sure you come on an empty stomach!
