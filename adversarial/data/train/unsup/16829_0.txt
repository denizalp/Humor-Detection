Called on phone and received qoute for adding dust skirt for two car garage using their skirt material, and labor for them putting skirt on one car garage door with skirt that I provided, and a tune up. After speaking with a manager ,I was qouted a price that I thought was very reasonable. When the repairman came to the house he would not honor the qoute and said he could not  do it for the price I was qouted over the phone. I had him repair the two door at the price he told me it would cost. Later I called back and checked to see if I had misunderstood the qoute. They told me I had interperted the quote correctly. I asked a manager to call me back, but I never got a call back. I was satisfied with the work. It was done quickly. But the company should stand by their phone quote. I will go to another company next time.
