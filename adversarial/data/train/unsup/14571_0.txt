I just got another hair cut from her today (for the third time in 3 months). I actually find myself getting excited, not anxious, about getting my hair cut because she's so consistent and good!\n\nI swear I'm not related to her. Yelp about her to your friends. It's businesses like this that Yelp should spotlight.
