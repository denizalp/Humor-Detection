This is the first time I have ever been here.  I really liked it.\n We had a great waiter, but then he was cut and we got a replacement. Though she also was very good.\nOur Burgers were fantastic! Cooked fully well and very fresh.\nAlso, our waiter brewed a fresh pot of coffee for me.\nEndless fries as well, can you believe that.\nThey also have this great new program, a royalty program. Sign me up I can't wait  . A free Burger the month of your Birthday and for every 9 burgers you get your 10th free. \nClean bathrooms,as I went in there to wash my hands before we ate.\nThey have a TV in the Floor near the waiting area,which I have never seen before.\n I thought it was really Cool!
