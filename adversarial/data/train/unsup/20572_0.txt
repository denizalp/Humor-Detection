It's a blustery, cold day in downtown Cleveland, and the only relief I could think of was a piping hot bowl of soup.  So I headed back to Zoup and man am I glad I did!  I tried the Pumpkin Pie Bisque and it was quite possibly the best soup I've ever had in my life.  It was creamy and delicious and had the right blend of sweet and savory.  If not for the humiliation of my friend Jamie, I probably would've licked the container clean.\n\nI also ventured even further from my usual order and tried one of their combos -- so much food!  Definitely puts Panera to shame, and I love me some Panera.  The salad greens were crispy and fresh, and, well you already know how I feel about my soup selection.  I capped my meal off with a fresh roll and a pop and now I feel like I could pass out at my desk from sheer contention and utter fullness.\n\nBe sure to get yourself to Zoup before the Pumpkin Pie Bisque is gone.  You'll never be able to forgive yourself if you miss it.
