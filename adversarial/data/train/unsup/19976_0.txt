Thanks Yelp for another amazing recommendation! We talked up to Mr. Mama's on a Saturday morning and was immediately created by a gentleman who opened the door for us and guided us to our table. Everyone was friendly and cheerful making us feel right at home. \n\nService here is beyond 5 stars and the food is just as good. We took other Yelper's advise and got the Country Fried Steak. Good thing we shared because portions here are HUGE! We were told their gravy is made with three kinds of meat plus honey and asked if we wanted samples before we ordered. Our waitress Julie was thoughtful and detailed when it comes to checking up on us and making sure everything was perfect. \n\nLeaving Mr. Mama's was no different than arriving. We said our goodbyes and the door was popped opened as we walked out. Service like this is hard to come by and makes for a memorable meal.
