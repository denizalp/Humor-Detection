Amazing ice cream and dessert place all year round!\n\nI had their Bangkok brownie soft serve and their Japanese cheese tart, and omg the thai milk tea flavour was on point! Their cheese tart imo was better than Pablo's ( I was very disappointed in my first Pablo experience in Korea...). Every time I come back, there's always a new innovation or ice cream flavour so I definitely recommend coming often!
