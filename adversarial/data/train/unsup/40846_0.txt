My husband had been to this chain in FL years ago and was eager to try it out here in AZ.  Unfortunately, it was not how he remembered.  I had never been but was disappointed by the experience.  \n\nThe food did not look or taste fresh and seemed overpriced.  Service was very slow.\n\nWith so many other restaurant choices in the Valley, we will not be returning here.
