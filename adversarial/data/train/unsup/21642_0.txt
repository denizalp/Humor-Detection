1. They have a smoking and non smoking room\n2. Non-smoking too crowded on Sunday matinee, so forced to the smoking      ballroom ( wasn't that bad after adjusting)\n3. Bingo can be expensive. Electronic packages are $15, $50 and $75 and if you get the cheap package, you will miss half the games. \n4. You can still buy paper, but again with paper ($3, $5 and $10) you will sit out 1\/3 of the games. \nFood - got some decent hot crispy fries for a buck. Everything in that food zone is pretty much under 5 bucks, but not sure of the quality (the 50 cent guacamole was good)\nCrowd ; mostly over 60 with trolls at the ready and daubers loaded in a cute six pack carrying case. Male caller was better than female caller.\n\nRegulars were complaining about machines that always break, but at this session there were at least 300 people playing so things happen, but it is tough to win big because you need to get BINGO really quick and on the right number to get high payouts. A guy next to us did win $500, but that was the biggest win of the night.\n\nI can't see how loud rock music after midnite would make BINGO more fun, but if your looking for something different, it is fun for a stretch. Less fun in 2015 as all you do is stare at the electronic machine in front of you these days.
