I enjoy Hungry Howie's Pizza in general but this particular location is horrible.  The female who answers the phone seemed put out or unwilling when I tried to order a pizza for delivery.  \n\nWhy would she say they do not deliver to my location when my order was delivered to my same exact location 2 weeks prior?  Be prepared to give your first and last name, address, zip code, city and state, major cross streets,blood type, thumb print, retina scan, hair sample, cheek swab, and shoe size when you call to order? Seriously, why all the questions? Ordering a pizza should be an uncomplicated effort.
