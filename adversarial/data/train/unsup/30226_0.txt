Ikea is a great place to buy furniture and accessories to decorate your space without breaking the bank. I decorated almost my entire home office with stuff I bought at IKEA. Putting together their stuff can take hours, but if you set your mind to it you can definitely do it yourself. I did. It might not be really high quality, but it's definitely sufficient for the average person, and the results are worth the trip.
