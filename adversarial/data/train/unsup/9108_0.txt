They food was awesome and our server was fun and friendly! The atmosphere was fun and loud! We had the Nachos and Margaritas! The nachos were great and tasted super fresh. The Margaritas were cold and just the right to the taste! We go here everytime we come to Vegas and we enjoy ourselves... Thank you guys! See you soon...
