Okay, this place doesn't suck balls at all! The chef really knows what he's doing when he puts a exquisite dish together. Chef Ramir invited me and my boyfriend back to Yonaka last night and it was the most memorable night ever.\n\nRamir went over top and created a special dinner for us. It was way more than we thought! Everything that we tasted was unique and delicious. \n\nIt was great to see my friend Julie and she was our server also! She and the Yonaka family made us feel comfortable and were very attentive throughout the dinner. They even came out with the candle lit dessert for my boyfriend! That really caught me by surprise. \n\nEverything was more perfect! It was all smiles and no tears. Austin and I couldn't be more happier with Yonaka. \n\nThank you everyone and especially Ramir for making such a effort for an amazing night at Yonaka.
