Farm Basket is one of those jewels that you have to uncover from the earth, clean and wash, then chisel and shape to get the desired gem. The guys at work kept talking about how great this place was and when I finally tried it I was disappointed at how I got a smooshed bun wrapped around a KFC original piece-looking chic-fil-a. The fries were heavily seasoned but looked like someone cooked them ahead of time and with a STRONG hand grabbed them, then through it in the bag. I made fun of the guys for liking such a terrible place. I sat and thought. ...what would make this taste better? Hmmmm, throw away that complementary cranberry sauce, add mustard to the mayo, lettuce, tomato,  onions, a sturdy Togo container and WAHLAH! A whole new sandwich. I couldn't believe I was eating from the same place! I enjoyed my new Farm Basket upgrade.
