Well hot damn, this is a legit noodle shop. At noon on a Sunday, the young man was hand making noodles just to be dropped in my soup. The beef was plentiful and tender, and the noodles cooked just right. Not too much cabbage.\n\nI wasn't as lucky as some of the others with the broth, which wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped, but perhaps it's because I was there too early. A good broth takes a long time. \n\nI wouldn't hesitate recommending this place to any noodle soup fan.
