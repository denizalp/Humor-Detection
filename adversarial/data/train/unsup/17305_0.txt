Wow. Ruth's Chris really hit it out of the park. Seriously, there's a lot of steakhouses in Cleveland, but I think my steak from Ruth's was one of the best I've had in the city. Immediately when I entered, I had a positive impression that this restaurant was polished, friendly and set high standards. I love Mike K's comment that the atmosphere is very classy and quiet-- this is true. Quiet is my happy place. They also have a gorgeous private room upstairs adorned with chandeliers and spacious seating.\n\nI have so many great things to say about this steak house. My friend and I started with the lobster bisque, which was creamy and rich without being overpowering. My petite filet (the 8 oz steak) had a fantastic seasoning to it (I was so full afterward). Our server was knowledgeable about accompanying wines, which by the way, are offered in great selection. In general, our service was outstanding, and when the manager came by to see how everything was, I felt he was genuinely interested in us. I'm looking forward to coming back this weekend for Mother's Day brunch. I'm happy Ruth's made the jump into 200 Public Square-- a building I love and want to see flourish!
