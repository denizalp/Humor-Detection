I haven't been to other groomers, I should say that to start. But I have seen my friends' dogs after getting groomed and oftentimes they aren't happy with the results. My pup was so adorable to start but once he got his dapper haircut at The Spaw he was the most adorable thing on the planet (see photo for proof.) \nIt's super easy to book appointments and as far as I know, they're open even in the middle of the night (Vegas style), for a fee, of course. \nFacility looks super clean and has a cute little waiting area and plenty of healthy dog chews up front. \nI found the prices to be competitive with other groomers in the area and she offers great first timer discounts. She also clearly cares about the animals. \nParking is pretty simple in the lot and it's an easy to access shop from Jones and 215. I would recommend The Spaw for your dog grooming needs!
