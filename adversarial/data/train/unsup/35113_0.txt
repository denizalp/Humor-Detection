went back for a couple of times this last week and was very impressed by not only the food but the staff!  Much better w\/o our grandsons-but they even enjoyed it despite their typical kid behavior.\n\nLoved the \"healthy\" chicken hash w\/ egg whites on the first trip. Hubby had the greek omelet that morning.  It looked so good that I \"healthied\" it up by switching egg whites, tomato slices and took out the cheese-still looked and tasted great!
