Great place for some real nice comfort foods. This place was way better than i expected.\n\nTried the Prime Rib and French Onion Quesadilla and is was really good. Not overly stuffed with cheese and nice thick chunks of meat. Came with some nice fresh pico de gayo which i'm a sucker for everywhere.\n\nNor Easter Burger is one of the best burgers I have had in Vegas. Thick and juicy meat, pastrami, and a perfectly cooked egg on top. What else could you ask for? Did i mention they can come with waffle fries? Perfection.\n\nService wasn't all there though. Guy was kind of rude and didn't seem to want to be there. The room I sat in was kind of dark also. Other than that i would definitely go back.
