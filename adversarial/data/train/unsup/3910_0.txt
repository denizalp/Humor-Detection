Came in here to try Flava Flav's wings.  It seems that Flava Flav makes some spices from home and brings a batch into the restaurant from time to time.  It's sort of confusing that they are called wings, because it is fried chicken without any sort of sauce.  They'll give you some franks red hot on the side though.  nothing special about this chicken at all really.  and for 99 cents per wing its pretty expensive\n\nI ordered the wings and also ordered a meatball sandwich.  The meatball sandwich came on a HOT DOG BUN!!!! WTF.  Everyone at my table started laughing when they saw the hot dog bun.  Oh, and they charged me over 6 dollars for my hot dog bun sandwich.\n\nI'm never going back to this place.
