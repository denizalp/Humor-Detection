Super average buffet. We wanted to do a buffet because we were starving, but we had JUST come back from Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam and had been driving all day and were just hungry and didn't want to change and get ready to go out and go somewhere nice. Yelp told me that this was a decent buffet for the price so we went. Also we didn't want to wait in a long line but ended up waiting for almost an hour anyways. \n\nThere were lots of drunk obnoxious people standing at this bar nearby and they were so annoying that everyone was complaining. Not sure if the management eventually did anything or if they left on their own. \n\nThe best part was the Asian section and the gelato.
