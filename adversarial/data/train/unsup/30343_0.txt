I work at the Hobby in the parking lot. My son and I have been waiting for this place to open since we saw the sign. Happy to make it in on grand opening day. We both got the AYCE special. Super delicious. Our server was great too. Never had to try to find her to ask for anything, she was on top of it. We will be regulars!!
