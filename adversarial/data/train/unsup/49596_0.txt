Such a cute inmate space, loved sitting at the bar and chatting with the chefs. Ordered several delicious rolls and the shrimp fried rice. The rice had a unique smoked taste to it, absolutely delicious. We couldn't say no to fried ice cream, the classic vanilla was delicious!!! Absolutely will go again.
