The slightly feminist\/mostly old fashioned me feels torn in many directions upon writing this review. You see, I expect if not demand equal treatment in most instances however.... what I really like is to be wooed.\n\nLet me just start off by saying that Society Cleaners indeed \"does it right\" as Thomas S. stated. I brought 7 basic button down long sleeved dress shirts and two pencil skirts in to be dry cleaned and everything came out beautifully.\n \nMy problem is this: When you advertise a special of $1.89 per shirt for anything over 3, you should put a little asterisk next to it stating that this is for men only. \nThat's right, my buttons are on the opposite side and my shirts are tiny compared to most men (which apparently requires hand pressing) but I'm not sure if that warrants a $4.00 per shirt difference. Not only do I not feel wooed, I don't feel equal. My wallet would go as far to say it feels a little molested even.\n\nMaybe this is Society's way of paying me back for all those free dinners (har de har har) I don't know but it's an annoyance that drops a five star rating to three. It's the year 2010 dry cleaning people... work on this please.
