I lived 15 years of adult life with entering a Buca De Beppos - why didn't I keep the streak going? \n\nThe best thing I can say is that the food is OK - that's why they get 2 stars. Nothing our table ordered (Apple Gorgonzola salad, stuffed mushrooms, baked ziti, garlic bread, Chicken Salta-something) was a standout dish, but it also wasn't bad enough to send back - lacked seasoning, but was technically what was described in the menu. \n\nI don't mind the charm of a dingy, family run restaurant. But trying to infuse that charm into a corporate restaurant? It borders on creepy with too much nude art, barfy carpet, dusty wine bottles, and even a bust of the pope. An aura of old and filthy was what they were going for? It's hard not to see the pope's dead eyes as judging you as a glutton when there's red sauce on your chin.\n\nThe service was good, but our table was too small, and with the family style we straight ran out of space. Weird problem. Couldn't wait to leave. Didn't take pictures of the food. Wasn't sad when my leftovers got left at my in-laws. Buca De no thanks.
