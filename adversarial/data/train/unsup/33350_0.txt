We come down here every May to stay with our kids and look forward to eating at Saigon kitchen,  I order shaken beef. I have ordered steak all over this country and this is truly the best fillet and sauce for the money in this world. The owner Dennis is a master of sauces. Thanks Denny for always treating us so good and our kids the Bailey's.
