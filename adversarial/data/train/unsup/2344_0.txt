Usually I don't write reviews for places like Sephora but this one I just had to! I've had VIB Rouge status for this entire year but I had never taken advantage of the perks like the free custom makeovers! I recently got one back home and it was amazing so I made an appointment ahead of my Vegas trip so it could be fantastic and professional. 8\/9 4:15pm was my appointment time and I'm kicking myself for not being able to remember my amazing MUA, she was blond, beautiful and a nursing student. Also rocking the most AMAZING colored blue brows that I don't have the balls to do.\n\nI showed up on time and she began her magic on me. A lot of gorgeous oranges, and bronzes to match my dress. I also had to write that I bumped this place up to a 5 star place because she asked if they were any samples I'd like of and I said I thought I was good but she gave me a NU makeup removing oil anyway and I was like OMG why didn't I think of that? I usually only get foundations or skincare creams as samples to test out how long they wear or to ensure I don't have a reaction. Anyways, just out of sheer brilliance of the lady, I had to write a review. This particular's Sephora's MUA is amazing, highly recommend!
