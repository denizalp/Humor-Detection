The Bellagio's Gallery of Fine Arts is one of those visits that you need to make whether if you're local or a visitor.  Reading the reviews on Yelp is very helpful before visiting BGFA.  And if you're reading this now, you passed step one.  BGFA looks like a fairly sized exhibit on the outside, but don't let that fool you.  A couple of steps inside and you're wowed with the fact that BGFA is small.  This was my thoughts the first time I've ever visited BGFA.\n\nPrices for the exhibit is about $15 (current exhibit is $16).  There's local nights which is half price, which is big deal. Once you're in you're given an audio hand-held and can tour BGFA at your own pace.\n\nI've been here for the Monet Exhibit, which I thought was fantastic.  I loved it and even paid the full price because I forgot locals get discounts.  My most recent visit was Andy Warhol's exhibit and this time got in during Local's night.  Regarding the Andy Warhol exhibit itself, it's really not for everyone.  You have to be a fan of Warhol to love this exhibit.  And even if you're a huge fan, you need to keep in mind that only a select pieces of his artwork is displayed here. In other words, your favorite pieces may or may not be on display.  I once dated someone that was a huge fan so you can say I was forced to love some of his work.  \n\nPS: When you exit, don't forget to stop by Jeff Mitchum's Gallery.  His work is on display or you can review his books that showcase his art. Some comfortable seating too.
