Peanut Butter and Jelly Shake? Count me in!!\n\n....actually...the shake wasn't too bad.....but I had to get my fat kid urges outta the way and try it lol...\n\nI ended up grabbin a salad of some sort....my friends actually had better food than I did....really good hot dogs and the burgers seemed rather tasty....\n\nWe sat towards the back of the room and I have to say the atmosphere was quite nice....fireplaces and water features were quite pretty....\n\nGood service overall and great place to go for lunch....=)\n\nNot sure how the dinner menu would be....but if you're lookin for a nice spin on American Food.....give this Rio Restaurant a go....
