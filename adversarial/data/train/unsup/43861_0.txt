We've ordered delivery from this location many times in the past 15 years. Today i traveled all day and hadn't eaten much, so my husband promised my favorires when i got home. The internet order promised 30-45 minites. Well after an hour, he called to check and they said the order was \"just about\" to leave the store. He headed out to pick up something else. I still wanted my pizza, so i called back. They put me on hold for a manager and then I got cut off. I called back. They pffered a discount on our next order (teally? who would order again?) I said I wanted the price of the order credited to our account. At this point the guy started yellong at me about how pizza places get busy and they have no control over what time the internet order promises. He said I should call someone, but i couldn't understand the name. When I asked, he screamed he was busy and hung up on me.\n\nWe had fried chicken from Giant Eagle. Will drive to any other place for pizza in the future.\n\nLong live customer service.
