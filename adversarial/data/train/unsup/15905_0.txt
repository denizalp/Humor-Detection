In the end, it's your weekly grocery shop.  But what an extraordinary way to do the job.  In no particular order of my delights:\n\n1. In bad weather I don't have to go outside--I can drive from my condo garage to the Loblaws underground parking, and get free parking for 90 minutes with a $20 purchase, hardly a difficult task.\n\n2. The red cart has its own cute escalator.  If I were a kid i'd want to ride up in the cart, but I'm not and it's not permitted anyhow.\n\n3. There's live music sometimes.  I missed the opera singer, the check-out woman told me.  Hope she'll be back.\n\n4. The produce section has all kinds of beautiful stuff I haven't seen before, such as mini veggies, dried mushrooms by the pound, a section for Asian greens, at least 12 kinds of tomatoes, nuts.  There's plenty of room for carts--you don't feel like you are bumping into people.  And the display is so colourful and lovely and low enough so you can scan the entire section for what you want.\n\n5. The fish sparkles.\n\n6. They bake all their artisanal breads in house and you can smell the baking.\n\n7. Meat is vacuum packed so you can pop it in the freezer.\n\n8. Prices don't seem any higher than other Loblaws stores.  I do spend more, but that might stop when I'm more used to the novelties.\n\n9. On one of the aisle floors you can see the red circle that indicates \"center ice.\"  Kinda thrilling be standing there with a cartful of groceries.  \n\n10. Enough open cash registers so there's no wait to check out.\n\nI'm not even mentioning the tables where you can eat fresh baked goods, gelato, sushi or  sandwiches, the friendly employees who will run and find what you don't see, or the fact that heretofore I shopped regularly at a No Frills, so this place seems like heaven.  But if heaven has grocery stores, they're probably just like this one.
