Can I say something that needs to be said, and I know I'll get grief for saying it? ....((counts backwards from 10)).... *breathes*  SPROUTS IS NOT #!@#'ing COSTCO, PEOPLE! Every #!@#'ing time I'm in there, people have their shopping carts stockpiled to the ceiling with stuff from every corner of the store. More stuff than you'd regularly buy at a 'regular' supermarket. Why? I'm pretty sure it will all still be there when you come back. Any time I'm in there to buy just one or two items...yes, just one or two items (so sue me), I have to wait for what seems like eternity for all the stockpiles to get unloaded from the shopping carts. I could drive to Sedona, do the vortex thing, drive back, and the line still wouldn't move. The traffic on I-17 moves faster. The blood flow in Rush Limbaugh's arteries moves faster. And, then, thanks to you impulse shoppers stockpiling every thing in sight like it's Black Friday at Wal-Mart, when I finally get to the checkout, the clerk is so bloomin' exhausted, they're all rude. I've never had a friendly checkout experience at Sprouts. I'm sure if I went there first thing in the moring, I'd get a smile and some good customer service, but now, it's not very bloody likely. So, remember: Stockpile your stuff at Costco. Not Sprouts. The customers behind you thank you. \n\nYou don't run into this 'slower-than-a-snail' customer-clogging at Trader Joe's or A.J.'s, yet, it seems to mar my Sprouts experience every time I'm in there. \n \nThis would have, could have, should have been a 5-star review, but thanks to every who just *has* to buy up everything on every shelf and slowing things down considerably for everyone else, it's only a 3-star review. I just dread going to Sprouts lately.
