I was at a Doctors appointment near by and needed to get a few things for dinner. I remember I had been to this location about 12 years ago, maybe that long ago. \n\nIt is a bit smaller than I remember but maybe because the one by my house is such a big full market place. Nonetheless, it had some good deals. It had all the necessary items. \n\nI loved seeing their full fresh flower section. It's always my favorite, unless there's a cheese tasting bar, but this location does not, so the flowers were my fave part. ;)\n\nYou will find what you need and be in and out. I had to browse around to see if there was anything my local store didn't have, just in case. It was a good quick trip.
