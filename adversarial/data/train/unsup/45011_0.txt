I think we stopped into the Container Store shortly after they first opened (replacing the Joseph Beth Booksellers store). One thing you can say about them is that there is no false advertising in the name: The store offers containers. Containers in every shape and size, for just about anything you can imagine.\n\nUnfortunately for most of us (and ultimately, for them), just about everything you may need on a regular basis can be found elsewhere - say at a Wal-Mart - for a good deal cheaper. Sure, there are fancier containers here, and special containers and whatnot, but when you are buying shoebox containers, why pay 50% more for each when you are buying dozens and they are going to sit in your closet?\n\nAs to service, the web site actually has better service than the store. I don't think a single person in the store said so much as hello while we were there. We have ordered online, and even had problems (cracked lids and such) - a call to the service line results in a shipped replacement in no time, without so much as a question, and no need to leave the house or even put on pants. Nice.
