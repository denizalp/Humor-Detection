I come here probably 4-6x a week. Before\/after school and work. I'd say they are the best boba\/tea\/coffee shop in Vegas. Their boba is super fresh and their teas\/coffees are brewed to perfection. Would definitely recommend this place, their prices are reasonable.\n\nNot only are the drinks extremely tasty, their customer service is 5\/5, The \"we'll swap your drink if you don't like it\" policy came quite apealing. The staff are all friendly and make you feel at home. \n\nTry their cold brew with sea salt creme. (Don't mix it, drink it from the top ) or the Okinawa with boba. SO BOMB.
