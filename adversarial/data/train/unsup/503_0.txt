If you're looking to get some authentic Filipino food, then Fiesta Filipina should be on your list of Pinoy places to try out.\n\nThe decor was quaint, wooden, and very reminiscent of traditional Phillipine household decor. I really liked the vibe of this place; the staff was all friendly and ordering went smoothly. \n\nIt's a turo-turo place (tagalog translation: to point), so you basically point to the dish you want to order and then you pay at the end of the line. It's an easy way to try a lot of different foods in one place, to be honest. Don't expect super fancy dining either, what you see is what you get -- traditional Filipino dishes. \n\nI had the two item combo plate which comes with steamed rice and two choices of entrees. I picked the sinigang na bangus (milkfish in a soup that has a tamarind base) and the classic Filipino beefsteak. What a good deal because it was under $10!\n\nThe portioning for the sinigang na bangus was one fish steak with some soup, but they could've thrown in some veggies other than ginger. It had the superb sour taste, which means they put the right amount of sampalok (tamarind) in the soup.\n\nThe beefsteak was PERFECT! It had the strong kalamansi taste (more citrusy) which went well with the tenderness of the beef and sweetness of the white onion. It really was marinated to the right taste... It's making my mouth water just thinking about it! It's THE perfect pairing to your steamed rice. The steamed rice, however, was a little more on the wet side, which isn't ideal but still good to eat.\n\nThis is a good showcase of Filipino heritage. The kind of food they have out is the kind of food you actually have to (and want to!) try within the Filipino food realm. \nOh, and they have good BBQ skewers! Ang sarap!
