This place is on the 2nd floor of the Ivey's building uptown.  I guess I don't get out much because I thought Bombay Cuisine was still in that building.  At any rate, I had a combo of a veggie entree and and chicken entree with rice and naan.  The food was pretty good, but the naan was dreadful....not fresh at all....I know this is their 'xpress' location but I like my naan fresh!  3 stars.
