Yo, listen: perusing these reviews, I notice that everyone has some lame and mostly difficultly judgmental anti-whatever just-being-funny-you-can't-take-a-joke opinion about Spirit. I just want to say that Spirit is rad as hell and it doesn't matter who you are.\n\nThe bartenders are cool; the beer list is worthwhile, the cocktails are cheap. The food menu is a gem; the pizza crust is always crispy, the grilled cheese and tomato soup hits the spot. The downstairs has music and installations. The upstairs has weirdo events.\n\nThe crowd that this place pulls is eclectic. From well-dressed yuppies to hipsters to older Yinzers to the random wanderers, everyone is always smiling and having a good time. The dance floor doesn't always fill up, but if you want to dance, then dance!\n\nThis place is so accepting of all types of people from all types of backgrounds with all types of interests, and their diverse list of events only furthers that mentality. They don't judge, so why would you?
