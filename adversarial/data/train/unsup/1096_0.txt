This place is good. Mitch is a good dude. Steve is very knowledgeable about cars and is good at breaking down what work was done. \n\nOverall, it was quick and reliable service. I would give it 4.5 stars if there was a 1\/2 star. The only thing keeping it from five stars is the fact that they're a little pricey--at least from my previous experience.
