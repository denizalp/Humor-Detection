This restaurant is located close to the Route 202 - very convenient. The food is OK, the staff was friendly and the prices were appropriate for their market. This chain, in my opinion, is targeted for health conscious yoga chicks that want something light. They hit that mark.\n\nIf a big, burly, and hungry construction guy were to visit, I recommend the sandwich, soup and extra side plus desert. Only then would he leave \"feeling full\".\n\nOne annoying thing: people leave their food wrappers and containers on the table. It looks tacky. This restaurant should either put in some garbage cans or have their staff clean better and faster.
