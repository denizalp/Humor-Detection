You get the best cuts in the city....Phoenix veterans will tighten your fades up...especially here at Fros fades \nI live 30 minutes away and always call in advance as they stay busy.....no relenting with these guys though. \nYou know you are in a nice place if Blacks, whites, Hispanics and my fellow Guidos are waiting for a haircut. \nEach barber has a following here but Marquise is the only one that has and will cut my hair...\nGive them a try...\nThey don't promise a quiet relaxing spot when you are getting your hair cut, but one that will leave you ready..\nIt's reminds me of the barber shop in coming to America..politics, football, basketball, and everything under the sun. \nP.s it's in the hood...it stays exciting lol.
