Holy Matlock - it's like checking into a retirement community! \n\nYour enjoyment of this place will depend on your age bracket and what you paid per night. Over 55 and under $150? You'll love it. I'm not knocking the place but adjust your expectations as follows:\n\n*The website bills this place as a \"premier luxury resort\". Uhhh..no. It's a \"premier luxury\" resort in the same way a Mariott Courtyard is, which is to say, it's better then a Days Inn.\n*The people that work here are SUPER nice. \n*There is shuffleboard, a putting green and lots of people wearing visors and using golf carts to get around\n*My room was clean, big and the carpet had been replaced in recent memory. The couch however, was PLAYED OUT. \n*Great showers, ok beds\n*Super loud plumbing, thin walls and the awful loud AC don't make this a place for great rest, despite the tranquil setting. Updates are needed.\n*Depending on where your casita is, you could have a long, long walk from the parking lot.\n*There are several decent restaurants and a Trader Joes within a 10 minute walk\n*Don't whine about the \"resort fee\" - every place here has one. My room did have free wireless, so I guess that's something. \n\nThis is an older resort and could stand some updating so don't expect the Canyon Ranch Spa, especially considering the relatively affordable price point. I like to think it's the kind of place Mr & Mrs Roper from Three's Company would have gone for some R&R back in the day.
