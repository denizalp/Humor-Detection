I love The Gin Mill! It is a friendly neighborhood bar without the pretentiousness of the \"dive\" bars, which is ironic in and of itself, but I digress. \n\nThe drinks are cheap (my 3 double Jameson\/Ginger Ales and two shots of Jameson came out to $30). My 2 \"double\" Jameson\/ginger ales..which I HIGHLY doubt were doubles, at Aces and Ales were $20. That is what sets a good neighborhood\/low key bar from the pretentious hipster bars or the bars on the strip where you are aware of your impending rape.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed, people are singing the good ol boy songs. Some take it upon themselves to come by and introduce themselves. The bartender immediately came over to ensure that we were not being bothered. I really liked our bartender. She had a fun, spunky and real attitude. She even charged my phone for me! Her 30% tip was well deserved. \n\nIt is a smoky bar, they do serve food, they have a jukebox and pool tables. It does get rowdy, but the atmosphere overall was very relaxed with everyone just enjoying themselves.
