Stopped in on a Sunday night and the place was packed! \n\nTook a while to get a beer but that was understandable considering the crowd. Bar seemed a bit understaffed. \n\nIf you enjoy country music this is the place for you. \n\nThey have booths with tap handles where you are able to choose 2-3 beers I believe and a liquor to have for your group. Couldn't figure out prices but it seemed really cool if you were with a large group. \n\nFun place. I would really like to go there with a large group and take advantage of a booth!
