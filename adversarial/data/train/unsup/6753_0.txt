I have seen the same guy at the counter for years. I have seen him argue with customers in the past.I really thought nothing of it because honestly it has nothing to do with me. But the other day he copped a serious attitude I literally wanted to smack him. This guy obviously is a A** hole. He charged me a dollar for a 1\" piece of tape I didn't need. Then he doesn't even put the dollar in the register I think this guy is charging people for tape and pocketing the money this guy is a scam artist. I don't care about the buck. It's the principle. Lol he does it again I'm getting arrested for assault just kidding but seriously if you go in here beware of the dudes prick ways.
