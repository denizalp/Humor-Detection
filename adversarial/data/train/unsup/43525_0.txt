I stayed here recently for a work event and felt that the hotel did just an okay job. I was able to get a room relatively close to the elevators and the entrance to the convention center. The rooms seem to have been remodeled since I stayed here last a few years ago.  \n\nA few annoying things - there are a couple of stairs that go down from the bed to the seating area.  There was a light there so I guess you don't trip.  But it was so bright in my room at night, I actually had to cover the light with the trash can so I could sleep.  Also, one day the maid never came and I had to arrange for them to come when I was at dinner. \n\nThough overall, the rooms are nice and I had decent service from the hotel staff.  There is always a guard that checks keys so there is a bit of security for the rooms.  \n\nLots of restaurant choices and I guess the pool is nice.  I never made it out there since I was in town for work.  Spa is nice.
