This location has made a complete turn around. Always clean and never smelly. I think new management must have taken over. I wanted to wait a while (like a year+) before writing this review and they have kept up the great job.\nThe staff is always moving and wiping down machines, scrubbing floors, keeping bathroom area clean.\nI am truly happy to frequent this location.\n$10-$20\/ month plus annual fee of about $60 is worth it for a great no frills gym membership.
