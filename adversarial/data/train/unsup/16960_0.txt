Hey, I'm a hipster: I need my martini. So I bypassed the health-smoothies on the left side of the menu that were the focus of the waiter's spiel. They did look appealing I guess. But I wasn't in the mood for a spa experience.\n\nSo the martini came without olives. As did the kale and mushroom pizza on whole wheat crust. \n\nBut both tasted great. Even my kid thought enough of the kale pizza to eat half of it. He's four, and roasted kale is usually a hard sell. \n\nAnyway, quick service, pleasant surroundings. Family-friendly enough to make me feel comfortable with my kid (despite the occasional stares of couples who probably have Childfree.org stickers on their BMW's, where the man is tallying stock options and the woman is trying to silence the wails of her empty and yearning womb. Of course I'm used to that.)\n\nAnyway, I liked the place. I'll be back. I don't think I like it as much as I liked Coffee Plantation when it was in the same spot 15 years ago. But never mind this old fart. Sawgrass smoothies are where it's at today!
