I know I enjoy food when I think about how good it was later..like days and days later. It has been about a week and I am still craving the Mac n' Cheese I inhaled during my Happy Hour visit. The Macaroni was cooked to perfection, the cheese was the perfect consistency and texture, and the addition of spicy sausage really set the dish apart. \n\nWhile the service was impossibly slow, every waiter I came in contact with was extremely nice. But nice or not, I was sucking on melted ice for half the night while I waited to get my drinks refilled. No bueno. \n\nThe atmosphere was relaxing and casual, and the bathrooms were fabulous!! Well lit, great aroma, and my choice between cloth hand towels or paper. The bathroom had well placed mirrors which made the space feel big and clean.\n\nI will definitely come back, but next time I might sneak in my own drink.
