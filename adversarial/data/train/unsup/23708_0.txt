I loved this place in the past, but promise to never go back again.  Had an appt at 11:30am, arrived around 11:20am, not a very personable reception, but who cares.  Was left unattended for the next 20 minutes, finally she walks out with food in her mouth an I ask if i should reschedule, I wait for her to chew her food an I'm told \"well I was just going to ask if you wanted to\".  What?  Of course I don't want to, but it seems that is my only alternative.  I left and drove 8 miles to another location.  YIKES..
