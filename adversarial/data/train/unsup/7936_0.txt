This place was amazing. The food and atmosphere were just what we were looking for. Terry or server was the best. He was amazing!! While taking care of our table he was engaging and always on top of whatever we needed at any point. If you come ask for Terry you won't be disappointed and you will walk away after having a great experience with delicious food.
