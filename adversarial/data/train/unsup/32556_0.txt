So happy it finally opened. The neighborhood was waiting and waiting. I go in there at least three times a week. Football is a for sure. 50% OFF Drinks $5 Food Menu. Their new breakfast menu has amazing peanut butter and chocolate pancakes. And there is a breakfast happy hour 50% Off 6am-10am. Only place I go to game, drink and eat. Love this place!!!!!
