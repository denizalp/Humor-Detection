WUV WUV WUV.\n\nI always hit up ABC stores for some hard liqs\/bubbly for my Vegas nights! The bottles are not extremely overpriced and the selection cannot be beat. They also have a good variety of snacks; some that you cannot even find in NYC (Hot Funyuns baby!)\n\nAlso, if you are a broke phi broke college student like I was my first time in Vegas, they also sell some decent prepackaged sandwiches for something redonks like $4. Not a bad option if you are trying to save some moolah :)\n\nChoice of free Las Vegas tote or mug if you spend $100+!\n\nI also bought this ridiculously adorable Hello Kitty in a flapper costume in front of a slot machine key chain from here. Amazing.
