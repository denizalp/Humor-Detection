This place is amazing. Miss Jill and her staff are wonderful with the children! My little one is taking the kinderdance program and having a blast. She gets 20 min of tap, 20 min of ballet, 20 min of tumbling. It's a perfect intro to figure out what she likes and it keeps her busy.\n\nThe studio itself is clean and open. The instruction is professional and fun. As for the lobby unfortunately it is a little cramped. There are only nine places to sit for parents waiting. Parents may have an easier time dropping off child instead of waiting.\n\nThis studio also offers fun events like parents night out and party's to raise money for charity.\n\nI highly recommend this place and they really do make you feel like a family!
