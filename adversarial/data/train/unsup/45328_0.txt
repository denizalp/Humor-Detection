As a lover of the old timey time, I was a little shocked to have never heard of this little Vegas gem before! I got an invite from one of my gal pals who had come down for the Viva Las Vegas convention in Vegas. We loaded up a couple of cars and headed out to have dinner at a fancy restaurant that was seen in a couple of epic movies. I honestly was expecting an old formerly fashionable diner. \n\nWe are driving by and I am aaamazed by the fancy classic neon lights outside. We step in and I am speechless...I talk a lot so it's kinda hard for this to happen to me. \n \nThis restaurant contains all of the old classic Vegas glamour that you'd expect in the movies. It was like I had stepped into a scene of a classic movie. We put our names in for a table and we go into the bar to get drinks while our table gets set up. I was expecting, a bar with a couple of stools. To my amazement...we walked into neon dreams and magic mirrors! To top it off, there was a section in the bar with a mini pool that was on FIRE!\n\nThe servers and staff were all super friendly and amazing. We managed to order one round of drinks before our table was ready. \n\nWe get seated on a giant table and the giant menu makes it super hard to pick a meal. I went for a chicken sandwich with fries. My heart really wanted some shortcake with ice cream. It was late and I needed to eat food and dessert wasn't going to cut it. \n\nOur food starts coming out and the portions are huuuuge! My fries were so super tasty, it's like they had some kind of magical breading on them. The chicken in my sandwich was perfectly cooked. I was able to eat half of my food and I got the rest to-go.\n\nI was really hoping that we'd be able to come back for dinner on another day. Peppermill. we will see each other another day!
