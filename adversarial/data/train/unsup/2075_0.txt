So my lease was up and we decided to stay one more year. We where told that we can get upgrades so we chose to get are carpets done because my daughter is  hard on carpet. I was excited to have a professional clean the  stains. What I got was the least cleaning possible. The guy  was done cleaning three rooms in  10 to 15 min and acted like he did not want to be there. I just don't understand if you clean carpets for a living wouldn't you take the time to check details and  check your work before you leave? He didn't ask me if I wanted the stains removed. My friend does carpets and I know they can remove most stains with red stain remover and a rag with an iron on top of the stains to remove them.
