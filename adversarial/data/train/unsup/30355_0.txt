***updated***\nMy husband liked it so much, he went back an hour after this was posted, ha! Twice in one day. The Akropolis pizza is really good and the crust is my favorite part. I knew we would be back just not a few hours later haha. It's excellent \n\nCouldn't be happier that I finally tried this place! Had a crazy craving for a Cheesesteak and it did not disappoint! So delish and the chicken gyro lunch combo is so perfect. We literally live .3mi away, so we will be here a lot. Cannot wait to try everything else on the menu. The staff is amazing too! So very welcoming. Must try!! You guys are awesome!
