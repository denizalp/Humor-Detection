i don't consider standing in line for a buffet the pinacle of a civilised life but this is a great buffet.  i think buffets are bad-- you eat more than you normally would because it is \"all you can eat\" v. \"all that you should eat\"  the food was amazingly delicious and i ate way more than i should have.  the champagne--rather their sparkling was out of place--it was a not very nice bottle of California sparkling-- if no one else noticed i did.
