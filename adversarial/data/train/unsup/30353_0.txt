Yelp was spot on with this one. Small, simple place with fast and friendly service and cheap, delicious food. \n\nShrimp wonton soup is the way to go. The wontons are huge, succulent, and have plenty of shrimp meat. The noodles and broth weren't the best quality, but you come for the wontons. Next time I'll probably hold the noodles and hope they just give me a bowl full of wontons.\n\nIt's a great place to grab a quick and satisfying bite. Not \"roll-me-out-the-door\" portions but filling enough.\n\nOne of the better places on my ongoing Toronto\/Markham foodie adventure.\n\nNote: As with every Asian-y plaza, parking is a bitch. Especially at peak lunch times. You've been warned.
