I have no idea how anybody makes any money here!  Competition is stiff and I guess taking cash helps as the underground economy here must be a world in itself.\nDo you really need a dozen+ optical places with even more cell phone places?  And how many juice joints do you need?  One at every corner?  It's not Starbucks in Seattle!!!!\nFrom what I understand, many of the places are owned by the same peeps and they let you think you are doing your shopping best at getting deals.\nNone the less, if you need something - PMALLs got it!  Or they will find it for you - Cash!\nCheers!
