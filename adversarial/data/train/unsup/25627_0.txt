The doughnuts. If you haven't been here in the morning for a doughnut or what I believe is their unique creation, the cretzel, you are missing out! The flavor options are unique and absolutely tantalize your taste buds! Last month I popped in and had a lemon curd filled\/blackberry iced doughnut and this morning I had sweet black bean filled\/black sesame iced- now that was a combo I've never had before and it was just awesome! \n\nOh, and that cretzel? Such a great idea- I really hope it's been trademarked (if that's even possible) because it's going to become the next \"cronut\"
