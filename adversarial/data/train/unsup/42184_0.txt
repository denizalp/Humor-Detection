Although I can see the appeal of the red velvet pancakes (oh don't worry, I plan to return for those at some point) I opted to get the Grown Up pancake, which were fluffy, laced with dried lavender, semi-sweet chocolate chips and sprinkles of sea salt. It was an amazing combination of floral, sweet and salty all in one. Topped off with the pure maple syrup and this is a winning dish. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a pancake but looking for something more complex.\n\nMy only complaint would be the portion size of the pancakes seems a bit large (I could barely get through two). I doubt most people would complain about that but for me I hate seeing food wasted.\n\nMy date had the smoked salmon eggs bennies (one of my personal favourite items to order at brunch) and they looked delish. If I wasn't so into my pancakes I probably would have stolen some. \n\nI also had an iced americano, which was perfect for the unusually hot day outside. Perfect pairing to counteract the sweetness of dessert for breakfast items.\n\nI love their menu design (yes I'm a menu nerd) and the service was attentive without being intrusive. I did overhear the waitress say that although brunch is their main attraction, dinner is the chef's true baby so seems worth checking out even past brunch hours.
