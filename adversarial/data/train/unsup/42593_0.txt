Awesome food.   Was looking for a quick place to grab a bite to eat and decided to try this place due to great (well deserved) reviews.   The staff are so friendly and welcoming.   The food was delicious!   Our table had the cod, cheeseburger, cod, fries, coleslaw, onion rings and turkey sandwich. Tried everything and was happily impressed.
