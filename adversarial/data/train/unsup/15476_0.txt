Enter the dragon..the first casino to cater Asian customers has finally hatched and like a true Vegas local I had to check it out. This place is actually not on the strip, close enough I guess, which makes it a locals and tourist casino at the same time. The casino itself is kind of small, I guess we're getting used to megaresorts openings that the size seems to disappoint but it  quickly grows on you as soon as you ran into the first employee and they start treating you as a regular even tough that's your first time there.\n Played at the bar for a while and when hunger struck I decided to try some of their authentic chinese food which led me into the dragon's alley. \nDragons alley is like a cafeteria, you walk around choosing small dishes and pay a la carte. The problem is that you don't know the price of the items until the cashier rings you up and it is then that you realise how they came up with the restaurants name. What I ate totally did not match the bill.\n I had a great time and I'm sure I will be back for some gambling and some gin and tonics. I'll just hang on the main floor and will definitely stay away from the alley.
