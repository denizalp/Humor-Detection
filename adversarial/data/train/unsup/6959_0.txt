Ugh..... ah crap ... The corn husk bicycle riding , tree hugging , yelpers will hate me forever after this review... \n\nBut I must be true to myself and post it...... \n\nI hate myself for this: \n\nTEN THOUSANDS VILLAGES IS A HIGH PRICED GIFT SHOP FOR RUBES, OR THOSE WHO FEEL GUILTY OF THEIR SUCCESS AND WANT TO DUMP MONEY TO ABSOLVE THEIR SUPPOSED SINS! \n\nWheeey...that was hard,.... anyway \n\nThe girl and walk into a smallish retail space that has all this African crap. \n\nDrums, tins, bowls, plates, jewelry, costumes, carved wooden animals. \n\nThe prices are HUGE.... expensive by Macy's standards. \n\nEven if I bought into this crap I could not find one item I could put in my house w\/o having to explain : \"The Kingii bear soul whistle was produced by starving indigent Kenyan vegans who are saving money to attend art school in NYC next year!! \" \n\nWTFFFFFFF.....$90 for a drum I can buy at Pier One or World Market for far less..... \n\nLesson: Supply and Demand AND Value vs Price \n\nFor Gods sake \n\nDo I get a receipt for my taxes for a donation to some vague country if i spend this money \n\nAm I employing African people by paying 150% more for the same goods elsewhere.... Do I get a gold star? \n\nWe whisper to each other as we check out various totally non essential items...not comfortable at all in this small space as the owner suggests ( think: your crazy Aunt, watching you) you pick out a cool fucking bell or hand sized fertility statue ...WTF \n\nWell the mid 50's white, female, well coiffed, multi ring wearing, and smartly dressed shop keeper kept trying to ask us to buy...perhaps an African Shaker for $45.00 ... hmmm  charity or exploitation? \n\nPlease visit to see this place for yourself and you decide.\n\nPeace
