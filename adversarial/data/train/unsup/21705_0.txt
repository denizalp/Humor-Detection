It takes guts to be a steakhouse with a pink exterior, red velvet brocade wallpaper and an entrance through the kitchen. I give them five stars just for having the balls to pull that off -- and for being able to pull it off for nearly 60 years. \n\nYes, this place is a Phoenix landmark. Anything over 20 years is considered a landmark here, so this place is actually ancient by Phoenix standards. Although I've lived in Phoenix my entire 31 (almost 32) years, I never had the pleasure to dine at Durant's until about a year ago.  I came for a work dinner and was pleased to have had a great first experience.\n\nMy second experience at Durant's was for lunch. And this time, the experience was better than great, it was fantastic! I had the French Dip, which is one of my favorite sandwiches. I've tired them at many different places, and have found a few that were pretty decent.  But that was until I tried Durant's French Dip. Holy Cow!  The meat was so tender it literally melted in my mouth.  And there was plenty of it!  I seriously don't know how I managed to eat what I did.  It didn't look like that much, but man oh man, it was piled on there. And to add to the deliciousness of the French Dip, I got sweet potato fries.  Yowzer!  What a decadent meal. I needed a serious siesta afterward.\n\nBoth visits to Durant's were true culinary and mouthwatering pleasures. It is a little pricey for an all-the-time spot, but for a special occasion, it is definitely the place to go. Plus, it has got history and panache. And who the hell doesn't like both those things in a restaurant?!
