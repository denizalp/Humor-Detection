Came here on a Monday night, around 7, and kind of surprised that the place wasn't more crowded! Besides us, there were only a table or two outside and some patrons at the bar. \n\nOrdered the old fashion burger, wanted provolone cheese at first but the server told me they don't have provolone. I think provolone is a pretty common cheese, so it was weird that they didn't have it. The service was quick and professional, and the food was also very good! It was a good size burger so you can easily fill up without having to get fries or onion rings on the side. (The burger just came by itself with no fries FYI) \n\nOverall it was a good dining experience!
