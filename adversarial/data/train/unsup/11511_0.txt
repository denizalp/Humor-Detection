The plates were delicious. They have a lot to choose from and more than most in terms of vegan and gluten free options. The scallops were disappointing thankfully the ravioli on the plate saved what could have been true disaster. The other dishes were lovely, to list a few of my favs; romain, duck, bread with spreads, the ravioli, and the lamb. All were wonderful. The environment was warm and welcoming with a bit of rustic antique glam. The only reason for my four stars is that the configuration of the menu was almost unreadable. I have never been so confused by the setup of a menu in my life. Nor do I want to pay top dollar for food I check off of a list using a pencil. It made me feel as if I was at burgatory, looking forward to watching this place blossom into a beautiful staple in Bloomfield. I truly believe it is here to stay! cheers to that!
