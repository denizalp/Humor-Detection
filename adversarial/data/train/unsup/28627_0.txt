This was a decent hotel. Stayed here because it was close to the airport and cheaper than a nice hotel on the strip. They have a nice pool and hot tub which I didn't have time to use but it looked great. The room was spacious and fairly clean. Everything was new and modern looking. The staff weren't the most friendly but I have no complaints. Parking is free, breakfast is free (but not very good).
