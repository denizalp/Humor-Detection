THIS COMPANY IS GREAT! We wanted to get a full home security system done asap on our home. After making multiple calls to different companies and having the same uneasy feeling, my coworker recommended JPG Security. After reading reviews, I filled out the online information form and received a call from Jim within 5 minutes! He was so professional and came to do the home inspection the day after. I felt completely comfortable with this company protecting my home. They came out the very next day and got the system up and working! I had a couple of further questions that evening and they responded right away and even sent another tech out the next day to ensure that all my questions were answered. I cannot be more satisfied with the service provided. We even added a thermostat to control our a\/c and heat from our phones. Definitely recommend this company for you home security needs.
