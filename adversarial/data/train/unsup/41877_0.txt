Great location and atmosphere. The staff was very friendly to the four of us and helped us with any questions and recommendations. The drink menu is fantastic. The beer list itself is reason to go back. \n\nWe ordered a charcuterie plate and chips. The charcuterie plate could be a little fuller but the items on it were delicious. I had a lot of fun there and am looking forward to going back.
