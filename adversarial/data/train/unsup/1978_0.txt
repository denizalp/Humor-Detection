Came here to celebrate our daughter's birthday.\n\nThe ambiance of this restaurant is classy and with the dimmed lighting made it hard to read the menus! Thank god for our phone LED lights!\n\nThe wine selection is one of the biggest in the GTA I must say!\nThe wine menu looked more like a King James Bible!\n\nThe wine sommelier Wendy was very helpful in helping us to decide what we wanted.\n\nWe started with several appetizers and they were devoured by our hungry group.\n\nFor the mains, I had the long bone ribeye, my wife, the Truffle Risotto (which was excellent), my son (salmon.. which was great), our friend had the gnocchi, very tasty indeed!  They made a couple of mistakes with the ribeye as our friend's was done too rare for his liking but they quickly rectified it and came back to keep reporting to us that it is being redone and will be served to us very shortly.  Lots of extras like free Foie Gras appetizer, dessert and champagne!  The polenta plate was a great appetizer!\n\nHad a tour of the wine cellar as well, very informative indeed!  Wendy is one of the few sommeliers and has been with Via Allegro for 17 years!  \n\nWe love this place and have frequented it many times over the years.  Never failed us but a little heavy on the wallet!
