While I was visiting Ohio I ended up eating here more than I would had like to because the people I was staying with like this place. \n\nHad the spinach, mushroom and feta cheese omelet with hash brown and wheat toast.. My omelette was cook in way too much butter or margarine it totally kill the taste of the other ingredients. The toast had way to much butter too .. I felt like my arteries just clogged up from this buttery breakfast.\n\nI tried the Gyro the next day and it was just blah! nothing special. \n\nThe service was excellent very attentive and nice and the prices are super affordable.
