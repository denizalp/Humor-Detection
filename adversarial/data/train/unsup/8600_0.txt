This place is great! I moved in a while back and I am very happy here. The leasing office is very accommodating, friendly, helpful and polite. I transferred to a different apartment in the complex and they were so helpful and fixed everything I asked for quickly.  They really care about their tenants being happy and I appreciate that greatly. The office manager Paula is great! She really listens and is willing to do what she can to help. The leasing agents are also fantastic! They are very friendly and any requests you ask for gets done quickly. The maintenance team is super nice and quick to get things done. The apartments are quiet and the rooms are spacious. The area is also great, right by a grocery store and a shopping center. I would recommend this place!
