Visitors in town, we weren't sure of which restaurant to select and choose Walnut Grill from previous Yelp reviews and after scrolling their online menu which appeared very promising. We were not disappointed! The restaurant is spacious and beautiful and the service very good, however it was the food that was the most exceptional. My husband enjoyed encrusted Atlantic cod while I ordered the Korean barbecue bowl with salmon and we shared the calamari for an appetizer. Absolutely delicious every bite. Highly recommended!
