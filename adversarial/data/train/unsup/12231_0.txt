With a name like lardo, its gotta be good.  Here piggy piggy!\n\nSadly there is no lardo sandwich (Italian cured pork fatback, thin slices of which melt like butter when popped into your mouth), the porchetta is equally piggy and outstanding in its own right.  Thick slices of juicy, rosemary scented, well seasoned roasted pork with crispy fat, atop a briny caper mayo, bright, herbaceous, zesty gremolata and topped with a generous handful of peppery arugula and a hit of parm all between a sturdy, chewy ciabatta roll.  \n\nWant to drool more?  The Pho'rench dip takes a generous portion of thinly shaved roast beef quickly dunked in a steaming pho broth then sandwiched between layers of sweet hoisin and mildly spicy sambal mayo, topped with Thai basil, bean sprouts, fresh sliced chilies all in the same chewy ciabatta roll.  A side of beefy pho broth perfumed with fresh cilantro and lime for dipping.  Hand held pho and good eats.\n\nA handful of other sandwiches and specials (they was no pig ear and bleu cheese on my visit), offered.  Fries if you must.\n\nFriendly fast food counter service.  Open til 4am on Fri and Sat.\n\nPart of the Block 16 Urban Food Hall, courtesy of the Cosmo, who has done an exceptional job bringing together some of the trendiest new eateries together in one place, this is the spot for outstanding sammies and Strip affordable prices.
