I stopped here for lunch hoping to have some French dejeuner and stock up on some French groceries! The lunch was good- stinky but tasty cheese in the croque Madame and quiche, and the salad was fresh and had French style vinaigrette. We were a little disappointed by the lack of actual French groceries :( the cheese selection was not too far above Trader Joes, they didn't even have all of the classics like Beaufort, and classic ch√®vre. Also they had a very small selection for the patisserie and boulangerie. To summarize, it was good, but I was just hoping for more variety overall.
