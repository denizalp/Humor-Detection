What an awesome concept. Build your own bibim bap bowl. \nFirst, choose the style of bowl you would like, classic or hot stone.\nSecond, you get a choice of rice, either white or purple (mix of various grains).\nThird, choose your protein (beef, chicken, spicy pork, tofu or salmon)\nFourth, choose your veggies, up to four.\nFifth, choose your sauce (original spicy, sweet and spicy, sriracha mayo, teriyaki or bean paste).\nLastly, top it off with sesame oil, fried egg, sesame seed or seaweed strip.\n\nAnd that's it! If you chose the hot stone then there is a little wait while they heat the bowl up. If you got classic then you'll get your bowl right away. Infused water is complimentary along with some sort of corn tea.\n\nThe only suggestion for improvement would be to heat the stone bowl more. This way the rice gets cooked to crispy which is why you would get the stone bowl. Other than that, a great find for healthy and quick food that is reasonably priced. A must eat for me when in Vegas.
