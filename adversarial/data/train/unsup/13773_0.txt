If you're over 25 and look it, get your coffee somewhere else. \n\nMy wife and I stopped in after lunch at Third Space. Just wanted a quick latte. Strong negative vibe. Felt like we were intruding and weren't welcome there.\n\nMaybe we looked like her parents, or her parole officer , or something but it was the most uncomfortable I've been as a customer in recent memory. \n\nPlenty of other better choices nearby.
