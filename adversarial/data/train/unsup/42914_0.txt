This is truly the best place in Vegas. Worth your drive if north west is far. I have tried over 6 places and no one comes close to the service, friendliness and price as lavish does. \n\nWhy? They have sooooo many colors to pick from. \nAll their technicians take their time. And make sure you are satisfied. Plus it's a very clean establishment.  \n\nBecause this place is well known, making an appointment will help you not wait. Or you can be like me and show up at 9:30 during the week. Less wait and easier if it's a last minute thought. \n\nLeon is my favorite. He is GREAT GREAT GREAT
