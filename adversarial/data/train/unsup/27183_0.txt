Port is one of my favourite watering holes in the GTA, and not just because it's relatively close to home. They have a very classy and cozy atmosphere, especially in the lounge area, and one of the nicest patios I've seen, right on Frenchman's Bay. It's a great place to enjoy a drink and watch the sun set.\n\nTheir food menu is a bit limited and changes with the seasons. The taste is good but I find myself going elsewhere for dinner for more choices. Food prices have increased over the years I've been going there to make it easier to choose somewhere else for dinner. Their lunch menu is a lot more reasonable.\n\nHigh marks for location and ambiance. Menu and prices could be better. I will, however, continue to enjoy the sunsets from their patio and lounge.
