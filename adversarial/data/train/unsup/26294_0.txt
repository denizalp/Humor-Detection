Really a great place: airy and contemporary decor, pleasant staff and attentive service. Not the fastest food service as all the items are made from scratch and fresh ingredients.  The appetizers are awesome such as the \"butchers block\" and corn soup to die for.  This place is great for just drinks or full blown dinner.
