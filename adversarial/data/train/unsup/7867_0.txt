Kams, HQ of Bros and Slags. This place sucks it smells like vomit and alcohol. Literally, I saw someone puke on the floor and rather the employees cleaning it up everyone stepped on it and smeared it around, I guess that's called teamwork. Also, I truly believe they only sell one type of beer, Kam's special ale, which is disguised as other taps. Worst of all bros flock to this place like it's their own personal lek. So if your looking for place to get hammered, drink on the street its cleaner.
