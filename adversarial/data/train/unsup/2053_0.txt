Stopped into Sun Devil after a recommendation from my mom when I needed to have a connector to my battery looked at, and a standard oil change. First of all, right away they were super welcoming and friendly. I could tell when I walked in that they were definitely busy because almost all of the lifts were full, and the parking lot was almost totally full, but I came in with my car without an appointment, they didn't make it seem like it was an inconvenience (which I have experienced at other places when I have come in during busy times). They gave me an estimated hour wait for my car to be finished, and it was done in a little over 40 minutes! The waiting area had current reading material, and there was complimentary coffee. I am used to paying nearly $50 for my oil changes at Jiffy Lube...I know nothing about cars, so I will openly admit now that I was sucked into their marketing and seeing them all over town. I was literally SHOCKED when it only cost me $17.03 for them to fix the part on my battery, and for my oil change (this was after the $5 Yelp check-in discount). Definitely will be a longtime customer after today's experience...I highly suggest taking your car here. They are friendly, honest, reasonable and really put the customer first!
