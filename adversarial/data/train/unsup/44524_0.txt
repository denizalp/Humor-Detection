Simon is so unprofessional. I interviewed for a position he did not smile nor shake my hand when I walked in his office, he barely looked up from my resume to look at me. I waited for 40 minutes before he saw me and then I was out of this VERY awkward interview within 5 minutes. THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME! He DID offer me some other position with crappy hours that I was not even applying for. If you go for an interview be sure to ask questions about the specific position. All the girls at the front desk were very nice and helpful(why I gave 1 star). Simon was either having a bad day or he is just a jerk with zero people skills.
