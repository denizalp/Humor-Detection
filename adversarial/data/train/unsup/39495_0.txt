I just returned from a three-night stay at The Venetian for a conference. Check-in was faster than expected given the large number of people checking in and out. My room was huge and had a separate sitting area with a couch and desk. The bathroom was large and included a giant tub. The hotel offers smoking and non-smoking rooms. The room was clean and I was thrilled that it did not stink of carpet freshener as many non-smoking rooms do. \n\nThe hotel is located right on the strip and has a huge selection of restaurants to choose from. Thomas Keller's Bourchon is located on the 10th floor and there are several Bouchon bakeries throughout for delicious, French pastries for breakfast. For those wanting to grab and go there are several JuiceFarms as well as a Coffee bean and Tealeaf. Restaurant options run the gamut from Italian to American to French. I had a great dinner at DB Brasserie and lunch at Bouchon. \n\nThe Venetian Canal shops offer a wide range of retail offerings ranging from Burberry to Barney's New York to 7 for all Mankind. What's best about the shops is the shopping experience as you wander along cobblestones with an illuminated and painted ceiling and architecture that's designed to create an experience similar to shopping in Venice. There is a canal with gondolas on the second floor of the hotel! It's pretty hard to fathom, but amazing to view or experience. On any given day you might come across an opera or mime performance along the way. It's a unique shopping experience unlike any other, and there are lots of great dining options along the way.\n\nI didn't gamble, but the casino seemed to offer everything a gambler would want.
