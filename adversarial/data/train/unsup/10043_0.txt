Happy Birthday C. This is really C's favorite restaurant. For his birthday dinner it was a no brainer. Islands here we come. We arrived around 6:30 and there was a few minute wait. No biggy. Our server was Amy. She was awesome. Spot on, great personality, attentive. Kudos.\nC ordered his usual, Jr. Wave w\/ Cheese ($5.70). The patty was seasoned correctly, cooked correctly and as in the past, C commented that it's one of the best kid's burgers in town. C had also asked for some pickles on the side. He ended up with 14 pickle slices in a little ramekin. Nice.\nK and Grandma C both had the Hawaiian ($10.59). A juicy patty with Teriyaki sauce, a big slab of Pineapple, oowey gooey melted Swiss cheese, lettuce, onion, Tomato and mayo. K gets hers medium and G.C. gets hers well done. Both were exactly how they wanted them.\nI ordered the Hula ($10.59). Basically, a mushroom Swiss burger with lettuce and tomato. I leave off the mayo and add Avocado ($1.60). Yummy. The patty was very tasty, nice medium rare, cheese was melted and there were a good number of mushrooms. Winner winner yummy Hula burger dinner.\nThe fries, well, they were awesome too. Some of my favorite fries around. Amy brought us our refill when we asked and they were hot and fresh, straight out of the fryer. Yummy stuff.\nGreat service, great burgers, great fries, reasonable prices, clean facility. 5 Stars.
