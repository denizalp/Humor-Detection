My wife, family and friends have been coming here for about two years.  We've never been disappointed.  The young ladies working here are fabulous.  A nice selection of food, always deliciously prepared.  Half-priced appetizers every day of the workweek can't be beat.  Nice selection of beer.  Friendly, comfortable setting.  We'd been going to Archibald's for about 10 years before discovering King Henry's.  We were sorry to leave Archie's behind, but the food and service at King Henry's are far superior, particularly since Archie's changed ownership.  King Henry's is easily our favorite pub.
