\"Mediocre\" would be pushing it.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that the name is almost entirely unrepresentative of the type of cuisine they generally provide (it's not a szechuan-specialty restaurant), the food I ordered was some of the most miserable I've eaten in this town.\n\nThe potstickers were swimming in grease, a gummy dough filled with a mushy filling that I wasn't entirely sure was thoroughly cooked-through.  The Chinese-restaurant-standard of Sweet-and-Sour chicken was overbattered and overcooked to the point that it was tough, dry and actually difficult to bite through, and it was not redeemed by the tub of fluorescent red, one-note sauce.  My salt-and-pepper squid special was fortunately fried well, although consisted of little more than fried squid served on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce, and was seasoned primarily with salt and a generous portion of badly-scorched garlic.  When the dominant flavor of a dish is \"burnt garlic\" you've got a problem.  While I could probably forgive one or two flecks of the stuff, it was a pretty substantial helping.  \n\nI've been reliably informed that this is a companion restaurant to an unspecified longtime east-side stalwart, which makes it even more baffling that some of these newbie mistakes would be allowed to slip out of the kitchen.    Some of the other reviews demonstrate wildly uneven food quality.  \n\nI've asked friends who've tried the place out to validate that my experience wasn't an anomaly.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Each of them left displeased too.  \n\nOn the plus side, they gave me like 7 fortune cookies and had free almond cookies.  So if you like cookies, I guess there's that.
