Why 3 stars? Because I was so sadly disappointed.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nOn a 1-10 scale, my anticipatory hype for visiting this place was a 40. I love red meat. I love Argentinian food. The menu was basically if I were able to custom design my favorite 15 things in the world. How could this go wrong???\n\nUgh. The meat was oh so burnt. I went with the Carne Sandwich, and to be totally honest, it was barely edible. Even my peppers were burnt to a crisp. I should have gone back and asked them to re-make it, but I was in a hurry to get to the Pirates game.\n\nSo why 3 stars, and not 1 or 2? Because I try to be fair and not kill a business based on one experience that seems to clearly not be the norm. \n\nIf I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, this will be my first stop. I have faith that I had a bizzaro world experience.
