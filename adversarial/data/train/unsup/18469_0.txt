Jeeze oh Pete you'd thot I brought in a box of lobster tails last Friday morning?????\nThere weren't many people in the office for Good Friday so I grabbed just short of two dozen thinking I would be taking home  a few when the office closed...\nYeah right...\nThey saw the label on the box and went all Spider Monkey crazy and NOTHING was left after about an hour....\n\nHoly crap coworkers....Sure I got the obligatory \"thanks buddy\" and \"oooh I LOOOOOOOOOOVE Jack Frost\"!  But you'da thunk that these people hadn't EVER had a doughnut before...\nSo now I sit here rethinking putting out extra Easter candy as the Maelstrom might return... \nI think I will be fine though as commercial candy does NOT compare to Jack Frost Donuts....\nRight?
