We couldn't believe how nice and helpful the owners are.  They guided us into our spot and helped us get set up even though it was over 110Â° outside.  I would give them 5 Stars on that alone.  They really helped us.  We were only supposed to be there for a week but something came up and we stayed 3 weeks.  Their laundry room was as nice as most any parks we have been in and the couple other guests that we met were also very nice.  Although most of the RV Parks in this area are more just places to park than camp grounds. We had plenty of room for our 38' 5th wheel.   We had good internet the whole time we were there, despite the fact the sign up method is different than most parks.  But the owner told us that's what kept it up and running fast for everyone.   The price was much better than most of the surrounding parks which we liked because we didn't want to pay for a lot of stuff we didn't need like a bingo hall and potlucks.  It is one of the smaller parks in the area which we like and surrounded by Mega Parks with over 2,000 spaces in many of them.  We will be going back there again when we are in the area because of the nice friendly people.
