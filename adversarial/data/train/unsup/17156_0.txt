I really miss the food truck, but the truck is no more so I occasionally venture over to southend to satisfy my Roots craving.  This location is within a neighborhood so I'm sure they get lots of foot traffic, which I'm sure is good for business.  They offer a limited menu that usually includes a breakfast burrito that sometimes changes pretty often.  The roots hash that they served on the truck is usually offered on the weekend, and is along with the breakfast burrito my favorites.  It doesn't matter which breakfast burrito they offer, it will be delicious, the only issue I had a few times was that when they decide to change it up and show the ingredients on the board they may forget an ingredient or two or give me something I didn't order.  Also, they go back and forth when I ask for egg whites, sometimes it's no problem other times they say it's not an option....fine no problem, just be consistent.  I have tried some of the breakfast specials as well and still no complaints with the food and the zucchini bread is good also, so for me 4 stars for the food less stars for consistency and service which was never an issue on the truck.
