On my recent trip to Vegas, Social House was recommended by a friend.  I must say that they didn't recommend it enough.  Every single thing we had was deliciously perfect from the spicy scallop roll to the absolutely amazing short ribs.  The service was excellent and neither my boyfriend nor me wanted the meal to end.  We could have sat there and continued eating for hours, but alas, Vegas called.
