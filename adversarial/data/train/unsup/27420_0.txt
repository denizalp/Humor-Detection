I tried this takeout yesterday. I was sort of disappointed because I wanted to order the dinner size portions to feed a few people but was told I could only order from the lunch specials. Fine but not everything was available. The woman was helpful enough. I have been eating India food for 20 years so I mostly know what I like. The prices are a little steep especially for lunch menus.  All in all it is nice to finally have an Indian place closer than Charlotte, but I think driving to charlotte for my buffet is definitely worth the trip over this place.
