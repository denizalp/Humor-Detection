We had heard there is a good deli in the Tivoli Village. We stopped in on the way home from the airport for lunch,  and we're happy to report that it is true. I had a standard reuben while my wife had liver pat√© and onion. Both were delicious. The only drawback was the beer selection was waiting on a delivery. Plain cheesecake rounded out the lunch. All in all, very good! We stopped in again for cream puffs and canoli after dinner at another location. Both were outstanding.
