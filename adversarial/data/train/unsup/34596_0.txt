What a treat the \"Happy Family\" entree is! Tasty mix of Chicken, Beef, Shrimp and veggies. Not only is the owner, Mr Woo, super friendly, but he's also a decorated veteran. Support your local veteran entrepreneur and try this place out. It's a gem of small town eatery in this giant metropolis of anonymity.
