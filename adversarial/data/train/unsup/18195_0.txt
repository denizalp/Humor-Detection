First of all, I don't know how people could have a bad experience with these guys. Maybe it was the old management that sucked or maybe the other Yelpers were in a methamphetamine induced, basil gangliatic, semi-psychotic visceral rage state. One of those things are probably true.\n\nAnyways, turn around was super fast and they did the job nicely. I have a bunch of delicate electronics and other fragile nonsense but they handled is very well. A+++
