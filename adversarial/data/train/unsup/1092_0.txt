Tried it out and won't be back...\nThey advertise 49$ introductory offer and then tell you oricing changed in september.\nI asked for deep tissue massage. They book me for 11 and then tell me they cant do 11. Have another masseuse at 12. Ok...i still want deep tissue.\nGet there and dont start my massage till 1213 or so.\nShe tells me she doesnt do firm massages. Ok???\nBasically got a body rub with 2 warm towels.\nShe is fine for swedish maybe but i was pretty clear i wanted deep tissue. \nFrint desk needs to get it together. Dont book just to fill a spot. Then when you ask me how the massage was and i say it was just ok.  You ask me why...i say i wanted deep tissue and then you tell me she doesnt do deep tissue? No apology, just take my money and get me out the door cause you have a lobby of people waiting. I did still give a 15$ tip cause its not the masseuse fault. Left out all names too. Just totally annoyed at how you treat a first time ever customer who said on the message i am looking to buy a membership as i live 9 minutes from you and get a massage every 2 weeks.
