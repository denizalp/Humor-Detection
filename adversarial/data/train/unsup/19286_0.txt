This place is pretty weird. I was looking to grab boba after having lunch at the Viet Noodle Bar. I usually get my Thai Tea at iSweet in the same plaza as VNB but they werent open til 1 PM and I just couldnt wait 40 mins for it.\n\nLike everyone says, this place is very distracted, unorganized and...odd. Yes, they sell boba supplies at the same place and still, its a cafe with a couple tables and the drink menu.\n\nWhen I went, there was a lady shopping for boba supplies and the owners were preoccupied with her that he did not give much attention to me. I ordered a Thai Tea and it was about $4 something and I thought for the size and the taste of drink, it was a bit overpriced. \n\nIt was interesting to visit this boba place but I dont think I will come back here. The owners were nice and all, but the drink was just ok.
