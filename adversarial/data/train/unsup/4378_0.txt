First of all, I ordered a grande chicken meal which comes with a quart sweet tea. We pull up to the window in which I was informed they ran out of sweet tea quarts, but said they can do 2 large cups in place of it. LOL! Two seconds later, she came back to the window and asked if she can just give us sugar since they \"ran out\" of sweet tea! What the? It's the dinner rush and you're already out of sweet tea? We asked how long it would take to get it brewed and she said \"5 minutes\"... and to park in the front. We pull around to the front and of course no sign of parking! 15 minutes later, the cashier comes outside with the food along with 2 large cups of sweet tea LOL! I was like, \"Wow! I wasn't able to get the quart since a new batch was made?\" Her response... \"We ran out of the containers too!\" Lmaoooooo!!! SMH!!! We looked in the bag (after she walked away) and the biscuits were missing that was ordered on the side! Ugggghhhhhhh!! We went back thru the drive thru since there were no cars and ordered 6 biscuits! We pulled up to the window (a new cashier) and I handed him my receipt and said my biscuits were missing! His face got all SOUR as if it was MY fault the biscuits jumped out of the bag! We could see him thru the window stuffing 6 biscuits into the bag as if he wanted them to break apart! \n\nNEVER AGAIN AT THIS LOCATION!!!!!!!
