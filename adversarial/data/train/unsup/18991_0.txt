Most people admire Elvis for his incredible music talent or his movie star good looks.  I admire the man most for fathering the Fat Elvis.  I've had it as a sandwich.  I've had it as an ice cream (Shout out to the Dairy Kastle in Louisville) and now . . . I've had it as a doughnut.  \n\nGot a dozen to go for some visiting family.  I could leave the Key Lime Pie and S'mores.  They were just eh.  But the Fat Elvis and apparently the Peanut butter cheesecake -- because I wasn't fast enough to get a bite of that one -- are incredible.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the fruity pebbles covered doughnut.  This location is 24\/7, but if you are trying to do this as breakfast, roll out early.  On Saturday at 8 a.m., the line was out the door and they were selling doughnuts faster than they could fry them.  Grab a fork and prepare to feel like Elvis right before the end.
