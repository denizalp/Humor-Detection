The Eggs Bernadette are a revelation. Poached eggs on top of wilted spinach, peameal bacon, and a hash brown, all covered with bearnaise sauce. The peameal is beautifully seared, the pork fat rendered out and impregnating the spinach, hash brown, and sauce. There's a wonderful flavour of slightly sweet, perfectly browned pork that runs through the entire dish - a flavour I normally associate with Chinatown, like roast pork from BBQ joints or deep fried pork dumplings at dim sum. Entirely unexpected at brunch, but entirely delicious.
