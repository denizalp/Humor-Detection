Say what you want, Encanto Park is a well done plot of community free fun. \n\nIt can get a little sketchy at night but that's because you are a wimp. Grow some gonads and enjoy the perks of downtown living!\n\nI have been here numerous times and enjoy the setting. I would however like them to stock the water with fish regularly. It's a lot of water with almost zero fish.
