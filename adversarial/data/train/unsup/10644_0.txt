The above review is simply untrue.  I recently made a purchase for a large dollar amount using Pay Pal.  I apparently double clicked when approving the transaction and the payment came out twice instead of just once.  It takes 4 days afer resolving the issue for the money to be deposited back into your account.  Desert Schools charged me $180 worth of $30 Non Sufficient fund fees, 4 of which in in just one day.  They offered to overturn $30 worth of fees.  I am outraged.  They charged me $180 to loan me about $300 for 3 days. This is a predatory practice.  I have been a customer of Desert Schools since the early 1990's and things sure have changed since then.  I am happy to pay 1 flat fee per day, but $120 in one day is absurd.  I am truly offended by there lack of understanding and lack of compassion in this situation. I felt like I was back at Chase or Bank of America. I am searching for another bank that shuns this practice, please let me know if you know of any! I will be writing my congressmen in hopes of preventing this from happening to you.   A $180 mouse click, who knew?
