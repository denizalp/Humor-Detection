I don't shop at Whole Foods often especially this one as I live in Mississauga and this location would be way too far. I was in the area recently and was needing to buy dessert before heading over to a friend's house, I thought of Whole Foods since their presentation and selection is pretty awesome and there is a great variety! I know the friend that I was visiting also enjoys shopping at this grocery chain so i decided to see what they had at this location. I already had a dessert in mind but unfortunately they did not sell it at this store. I opted for a very delicious looking fruit tart, the staff was very helpful as I often time ask for recommendations. As I am a true believer that you should be knowledgeable with what you do and\/or where you work, the staff was super helpful and now I already know what I want to bring for another party or gathering. Let's just hope I can find this one in Mississauga!\n\nJust in case you are wondering...it is one of their new items- apple almond tart..mm yum!
