Stellar replaced the water heater at my house several years ago.  Paul (the owner) & his crew showed up on time, and installed the new unit for a very competitive price (which I'd gleaned from the co's frequent listings\/postings on a certain c-list website we've all heard about).  They also brought the unit up-to-code by brazing in a hard-piped drain line, for a fairly nominal up-charge.\n\nThe 6-year (manufacturer's) warranty \"documentation\" seemed a bit cheesy, in that someone from Stellar simply hand-wrote the install date on a sticker placed atop the unit, but I can't fault them much for that, and in fact recently had them install another Bradford White unit at my girlfriend's home in Gilbert.
