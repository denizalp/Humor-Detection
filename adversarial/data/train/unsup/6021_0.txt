Yea you see it, two stars. We arrived around 6, it wasn't too busy, plenty of seats at the bar and around the lounge. The three of us went up to the bar to grab a drink, and the male bartender, probably pushing 50, wearing a Afflication shirt two sizes too small and attempting to pull off a faux hawk, asks us what we would like. I ask if they have a specialty cocktail menu, he says no, not in a joking manner but kinda rough and rude. I could have sworn I read in reviews they had specialty cocktails, but ok, so then I ask what kind of Pinot Noir they have, he responds back to me, \"Oh you must be the difficult friend\" Excuse me? Yes I am picky when it comes to wine and specialty cocktails and that's the reason I ask BEFORE ordering a drink. I should have walked out then and there but my two friends wanted to stay and check out the lounge area. So after we sat there for a little bit, I didn't even finish my wine (I was given O.P.P, others people Pinot) we decided to leave. After leaving Bar & Bistro and having a wonderful experience over there with the bartender and the cocktails, I wouldn't give this guy another dime.
