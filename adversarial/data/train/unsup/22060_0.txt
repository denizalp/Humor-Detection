This is a little Japanese restaurant. The new location is larger than the old one. I didn't like the interior. \nThere was nothing interesting, there are some drawings on the walls that I didn't like at all. The service was not bad though. \nFood portions were large. I didn't like the plastic plates (boxes). People, how can you speak about healthy food, when the food is in plastic boxes?????? \nAfter eating I can say that this can be called everything, but not Japanese food. Well, the fried rice was good, the salad are so-so. The meat was not bad, but not the best either. Nothing impressing.
