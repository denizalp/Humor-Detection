I have eating at several Chinese places in the Chandler area.  This place is by FAR the best. Super fast delivery, excellent portions, and fresh ingredients.   I had Mongolian beef and my wife had an order of pot stickers and crab rangoons.  Everything was perfect super crisp green onions, nothing soggy.  The beef was real beef, not processed grey meat product.
