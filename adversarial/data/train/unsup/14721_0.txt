This place is horrible, everyone in the staff has an attitude problem. I made an appointment with Dr. Norris to check out a horrible rash that I had, and to see if there was anyway she can treat me for my back pain. She didn't acknowledge my aching back whatsoever, and her answer for my rash was \"I've never seen anything like that before.\" Then she left the room and her assistant let me know that I was only getting checked up and I left with no satisfaction. They simply do not care about patients at all. I would rate them no stars if I was allowed to.
