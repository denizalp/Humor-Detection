I was recommended to Dr. Berry as I have terrible migraine headaches. I have been going to him for a little over 2 months. He is VERY thorough in his knowledge! I had never heard of a chiro with emphasis in neurology. It made sense to get to the route of the reason for the headaches. I am so glad that I found him!
