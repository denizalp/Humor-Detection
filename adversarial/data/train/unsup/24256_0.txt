Had such a sweet joyful surprise of walking by Vin Mon Lapin and seeing the doors open for the first time, and getting to enjoy the very first service of this beautiful new Little Italy addition to the Joe Beef, Liverpool House, Vin Papillion family.\n\nThe space is cosy and perfect, the leather benches are comforting and low enough that everything kind of feels like a family party. \n\nThe service is the highest caliber; so friendly and charming and professional and quick and smooth. Always nearby, never rushing, making dining dreams come true. \n\nMost importantly the wine and food. We ordered basically every not-raw, pescatarian menu item to meet our table's needs, and we loved what tried, and were happy we could eat well even with restrictions. There really weren't vegan options though, so careful there, and not a lot of fresh vegetable flavours. The emphasis is on rich local ingredients. We loved the mushroom bolognese on toast, so impeccably fresh and rich and delicate. Everything was good but that was the most memorable dish for me, so I'll leave you the rest to discover for yourselves. I love the emphasis here on natural wines, there are so many incredible flavours to discover and your waiters can take you through a universe of options. We tried a rose sparkling that was dry and bright and really special. \n\nThey are open now, and not doing reservations, so just go!
