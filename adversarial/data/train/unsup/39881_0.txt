Finally was able to try this gem in Vegas. Came here with my family Halloween weekend for dinner. It's got that OG diner feel. The place is quite big, didn't need to wait too long to be seated. The biggest positive of Peppermill are the extremely generous portion sizes. Seemed like all the orders are big enough for 2. The service here was good as well. They have such a wide variety of items it hard to decide what you want. Personally, I ordered the Maserati Omelette! The pics on yelp are as advertised. Tasted great, it says it's 3 eggs but it felt more like 4-5 eggs! The food was definitely up to par. Peppermill is a spot that many people know of or rave about so definitely give it a try. Just make sure you're hungry or definitely get ready for a to go box. It's the perfect spot for late night dining and when you have the munchies!
