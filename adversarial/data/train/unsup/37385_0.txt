We rented bikes for the ride from Pittsburgh to D.C. on the GAP and C&O Canal Towpath. From our first conversation with Golden Triangle we could tell they were informative, organized and very enthusiastic about setting people up for the ride. Our bikes were perfect for the trip, and, since we were traveling from California and carrying all our own stuff, having everything provided --lock, helmets, tubes, pump and panniers-- was just what we needed. They even scrounged around for mirrors for us. The bikes didn't come with them and we're in the habit of using them so they pulled a couple off the shelf and made them work --with a lot of fuss and smiles. Their list of partners along the trail was very helpful and everyone we dealt with on that list was great. Even the location is perfect. It's right off the trail. These guys are the contact you want for getting set up on this trip.
