This is a great place for a child's birthday party.  You supply the cake and goodie bags-- Bay Lanes does the rest.  They provide pizza, pop, snazzy bowling shoes, decorated space and really nice, accommodating service.  AND it is very economical-- you pay for the number of kids who show.  You can choose one or two games per child.  AND you don't have to clean up!!!\n\nThe kids really loved bowling together-- especially with bumpers blocking the gutters!  After the games, the owner passes around a bowling pin used during the games.  All the kids sign it and present it to the birthday child as a souvenir.\n\nYears ago this place used to be a real dive-- smelly, dirty and generally pretty run down.  Now, it's very, very clean.  They have new shoes, automatic scoring and a non-stickey bar.  It's still an older bowling alley, but a well-kept one.\n\nThe owners are really nice-- helping out with whatever we needed for the party.  One little girl got the time wrong and showed up as the other kids were leaving.  She was heartbroken and began sobbing.  The owners felt so bad for her that they gave her a free game of bowling on the spot and a coupon to come back and play a free game anytime.
