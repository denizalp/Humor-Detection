Um... this place is amazing.\n\nI had no idea this store even existed until I randomly decided to go in after browsing around at Eva B, which is pretty much right next door. \nLooking in from outside, you wouldn't gain much of a clue as to what this place is about since they aren't big on window display. Nope, aesthetics are not on the radar here. Once you go inside, though, you'll be blown away at: a) the actual size of this place and, b) the amount of STUFF. This is an industrial supply store, full of the most obscure tools, parts, etc and has everything -EVERYTHING- you could ever want before you knew you wanted it. \nI'm a DIY builder (artist) of mechanical, electronics, whatever and I seriously wish I'd found this place a lot sooner. Today I located an extremely hard to come by brass nut that I desperately needed to finish hooking up the latest appliance I'm working on. I had a hallelujah moment so hard, the guys working there thought I was a full-on lunatic. \nEverything is super cheap, super organized, and well-stocked. I'll be going here FIRST the next time I need parts. Also, all kinds of camping, fishing and other gear, too. Put it on your go-to list.
