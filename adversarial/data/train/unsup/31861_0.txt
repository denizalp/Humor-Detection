Border Grill is an oasis of calm amidst the hustle and bustle of Mandalay Bay. In need of a gluten free lunch during the AWEA Windpower conference, I found this charming spot near the convention center, grabbed a seat at the bar, and proceeded to relax and let the excellent staff take care of me for the next hour.\n\nAlmost everything on the menu is or can be made gluten free. The chips and salsa are a nice way to start your meal, and I washed them down with a hand-muddled traditional mojito. Delicious!\n\nThe bartender recommended the Border Classics for my meal. This tasty sampler plate is a good way to try a little of the Mexican-inspired menu. You get two chicken tacos, two plantain empanadas, and two green corn tamales. I enjoyed every single bite. Highly recommended, even if you don't have a gluten allergy.
