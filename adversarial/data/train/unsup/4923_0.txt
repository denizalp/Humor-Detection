NO NO NO. This place is not \"New\" it's been renovated. Old and dirty. No service in the room. Wifi is slow. My view is looking at a concrete wall. You'd think there would be a coffee maker. The glasses were dirty. And by dirty I don't mean water spots. I'm talking about dirt in the glass. No towels at the pool... Then to top it all off some alarm went off for an hour last night at 5am...
