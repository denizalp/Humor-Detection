Crazy amount of choices to eat. Something for everyone. It's not just a fast food burger joint. It's more like a diner. Giant portions of food and everything made fresh. Great service. I can't wait to go back to try other things. And there's a drive thru in case I'm being lazy or the kids are sleeping in the car!
