First time here. Here for lunch with family. Found on Yelp Review with attractive rating and many reviews.\n\nParking was fairly easy to find in a shaded parking structure. There were parking spaces available right in front of the restaurant, but we decided to park in the parking structure. \n\nThe hostess was welcoming. The restaurant presentation was a mix between industry and classic. Loved the ambiance! \n\nWe ordered Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken, Gyro sandwich, Bacon Cheeseburger, Sweet potato cannelloni, and Piccante flat bread. The server brought complimentary bread with pesto sauce which was surprisingly good! It was the BEST bread from any of the restaurants I've ever visited in my entire life! \n\nThe my unsweetened Black tropical ice tea. The tea was excellent as well as the rest of the dishes. We couldn't believe every single dish was so great!!\n\nOur server, Mike, was top of the notch server!
