I came here for HH with my boyfriend. They offer $1 oysters and $2 domestic beers. A FANTASTIC DEAL if you ask me. So the boyfriend and I absolutely indulged ourselves with some off the strip oysters and brew. \n\nI always love a good deal. The food wasn't bad. It was pretty slow in the restaurant. Service wasn't bad, but it wasn't above and beyond extraordinary. \n\nThe prices seemed ok for all their boil packages, but again we only came here for their HH specials which are absolutely worth it.
