Not great, but good food. Reasonable delivery time. I'm stayin at the Hampton Downtown Cleveland. They are good enough that I ordered from them two nights while staying here. Was not very impressed with either the egg drop or wonton soup. Its just typical westernized Chinese food. Real good prices tho.
