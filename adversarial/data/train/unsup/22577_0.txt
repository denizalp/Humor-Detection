Change of dinner plans since another place was too busy. The place used to be called Jalisco's, but I'm not sure if it's under new management. The place is very closely and decorated with charming cantina decor. I was greeted right away and was taken to a table. She was still setting up the placemats and asked us if I wanted to start ordering. I haven't even sat down yet, but ok. The waitress asked if I wanted to start with a cheese dip or avocado. I asked how much it was and it was $7.99 each. I went with the cheese dip and by then I was able to actually sit at the table. \n\nThe waiter came by and asked for drinks and orders. I went with the pork in green chili sauce with corn tortillas and my S.O. went with the al pastor quesadilla. The cheese dip that came out was room temp and portion was very small for the price. Asked if the cheese dip was supposed to be hot and waiter said yes. Informed waiter it was not hot and he took it back to reheat. The pork in green chili was tasty, but only had a small amount of meat and the rest were onions and bell peppers. The al pastor quesadilla was good though. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere is welcoming and bright. Service started a bit off, but the rest of the service was good. Some menu items would be worth trying again, but for the price, the value could be better.
