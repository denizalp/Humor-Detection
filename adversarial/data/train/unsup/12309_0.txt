I normally don't review fast food chains but the service here was horrible. \n\nI ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and wings shortly after 1pm and sat down to wait. A few minutes later a guy comes rushing out from the kitchen with a long order list for a large delivery. Over 20 minutes later they finish the order and then start my order!! By the end I had waited over half an hour and when I picked up I asked if it was going to be free since it took more than 30 minutes. She laughed because she thought I was joking but when she saw I wasn't she said I was lucky to get it in half an hour because they usually take an hour. \n\nWHAT?!?
