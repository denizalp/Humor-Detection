I just ordered a Dewars before a Garfunkel concert. The bartender took out a \"soda gun\", pushed a button and \"dispensed\" my scotch\/whiskey blend. Classy!\n\nIt was a 1oz pour, literally wet the bottom of my plastic cup about a 1\/4 inch tall, slid it over and asked for $7.50 plus tip. Mouth watering!\n\nDo you tip the guy at Wendy's who dispenses your soda? Needless to say for a casino to reduce something as basic and enjoyable as ordering a scotch to this, bullocks!\n\nDon't typically leave negative reviews, drink before you get here.
