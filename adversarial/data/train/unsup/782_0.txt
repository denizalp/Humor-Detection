What a hilarious ordeal.\n\nMy brother and I showed up after 1 AM and the bouncers asked us to pay for the cover.  My brother tersely answered that there's no way we're paying for a cover when we just want to drink a beer.  He said it a little more rudely than that, but I should probably use nice language in this review and all that.  Immediately the bouncers somehow changed their minds and let us in for free, on the condition that we were not to leave the terrace.\n\nWe ordered some beers and lounged on the couch for a while, people-watching.  There was a weird eccentric old man in 1920s regalia taking creepy photos of every hot blonde chick in the place.  Not to be crude, but there is no way of describing what the dance floor in any other way - half the people on it were larger than the average bear and dancing their hearts out, and the other half were skinnier than a bulimic margarita and judging by the looks on their faces you'd think their fathers had just died.  People drunkenly yelled at us every once in a while and we yelled back.  Everything was blurry and all of it was amusing and fun.  The dance floor also had a fog machine and lasers and all of that fancy crap that your cover is supposed to pay for.\n\nAt the end of the night everyone poured out and some blonde chicks told me I sounded like I was speaking Dutch (I was speaking French to my brother).  Then they told me that Dutch people sound like they're deaf when they talk.\n\nA hilarious ordeal.
