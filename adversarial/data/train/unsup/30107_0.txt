This is the best restaurant that I have been to in Henderson. Love it! The chef treated us like we were regulars. We will be.The wait staff were do awesome. I have celiac disease and they made sure I could eat. My son absolutely loved the eggplant silano. I cannot wait to bring my husband. Whenever we want Italian, this restaurant is worth the drive.
