This place has some nice items. I did not see too many sectional pieces as this is what I was looking for. I was blown away.. I mean literally blown away at the prices of the furniture. One chaise lounge, like $2000 bucks. Really, are they gold plated? And the sales rep made sure to tell us that everything was marked down in the place 30%. I have been frantically shopping for outside furniture and let me tell you there are way better deals and quality furniture for what you will find here. Even the pads for the chairs were like $300. I am not afraid to spend some money on items that are worth it. But, the prices are so out of this world I guess maybe only Elton John or Britney Spears can shop here. I don't know..
