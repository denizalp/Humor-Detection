I have Dr. Tolan. If you want fast service, don't go to him. Don't go to this office. You never get threw to the Drs when you need them after surgeries. They make your appointment at 2 and you don't get in till 3:30. Might as well make my appointment for later if you can't handle the flow of patients. They were out of network for my insurance and they don't do monthly payments. I had to get my surgery done and they took out my tonsil stones and deviated septum. It didn't make a difference in my breathing. Have to go somewhere else to get yet another surgery.
