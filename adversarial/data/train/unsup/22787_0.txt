I've read the reviews and I've heard the stories but Nothing Bundt Cakes is worth all the hype and adulation they receive. I was at a gathering of friends two weeks ago and someone brought some bundtinis, which are basically a smaller version of a bundt cake that looks like a cupcake. I tried one and it was heaven in the palm of my hands, I ate another and another and before you know it, I had had 5 bundtinis in 20 minutes. Yes, I was ashamed of myself. They were so moist and delicious and the buttercream is crazy good. I just couldn't believe that I was addicted to these little cupcakes just like that. I have definitely tried other places cupcake places in the Fort Mill area, so my review is definitely not biased. \n\nI ask the host where she got them from, and she said Nothing Bundt Cakes...Nothing Bundt cakes? Next, I come to Yelp and read the reviews, nothing but glowing reviews. So, I take a trip to Nothing Bundt Cakes in Tega Cay and it's a quaint shop that is well laid out and everything is displayed nicely. They have everything you can imagine from Special order cakes, regular bundt cakes, accessories and so on. They also deliver but there is a delivery charge. The customer service is the best I've experienced from any cupcake place in the Tega Cay\/Fort Mill area. Some of you may be wondering is this place better than a competitor in Baxter village and my answer is YES, hands down. Some places get overhyped and become complacent but Nothing Bundt Cakes is now my new favorite destination for all things dessert. I assure you, you won't be disappointed.
