Food was horrible. I would think paying $72 for two people I would get a little bit better food but that was not the case. Nothing there is fresh and I'm still throwing up from all this. The shrimp had a horrible taste to it. Tasted basically how a refrigerator would smell like. I brought it up to the girl at the front and she just stares at me. Not giving one care. I would not recommend this place at all! High price, bad food!
