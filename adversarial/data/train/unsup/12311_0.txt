1) customer service is awesome; everyone is always so friendly, greet you when you walk in, always friendly to my baby, always asking if I need help with anything. \n\n2) love the pharmacy guys here; they are so patient with the elderly customers, I love it; super friendly even tho you can tell they are overworked. \n\n3) minus a star because seems like a lot of the folks who work at CVS also smoke; while that is not the problem, they tend to stand RIGHT outside the entrance door so you walk through the cloud of SMOKE going in and coming out.  Not good for baby.  Sorry, minus a *STAR*
