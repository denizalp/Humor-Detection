Not a frequent flyer anymore but when I need to park at an off site locations I have found Parking Spot2 to be and excellent one.  Easy in and out and shuttles run very frequently so your wait to and from airport is minimal.  Drivers and cashiers have always been friendly.  Have used this location for years even prior to Parking Spot 2 acquiring them and never had a problem.
