My experience at The Skin Loft was so great! I was able to make a same day appointment which I loved. My appointment was with Calli for the 75 minute enhanced skin treatment. I did two of the enhancements (microdermabrasion & high frequency) and they exceeded my expectations. The facial & massage were so relaxing. My face feels so smooth and refreshed. My skin has been really dry - and today it is the softest it's ever been. Also, the room was ADORABLE. Can't wait to go back!
