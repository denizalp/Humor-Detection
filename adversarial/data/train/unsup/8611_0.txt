Pretty easy to get to from 90 and 480.  Has everything I need besides a gluten free gagball store.  A shop that restores flamethrowers would be sweet too.  I still am trying to get used the new food court being moved from the other end.  Great choices. 2 different Chinese places show its diversity.  Even on holiday times this mall doesn't seem too crowded to get my strut on and spend my dough from moonlighting as a male escort.  There is a bar attached to the mall itself and Fatheads is right up the road.  Throw back a few pints and cruise the lingere section at Macys.  Keep it sleezy, my friends...
