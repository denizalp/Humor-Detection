By far the best fast food burger place along with shake shack. I'm not as much of a huge fan of the fries though they are awesome when ordered animal style.\n\nOnly reservation I have about this Vegas location in particular is that they messed up my order and were not willing to correct it unless I paid. Quite odd for a chain that well known. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.
