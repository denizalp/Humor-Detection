If you want a bad hair cut and have a barber talk your head off, this is the place. The cut I got from here was so bad I had to wear a cap.  That barber covered his mistakes by gelling my hair to the stiffness of a helmet.  I only realized it when my friends looked at me in shock.  I think even my dog was grinning at me thinking \"pay back\".  I had to spend extra money to correct this bad hair cut.  This Village Barber Shop has their own village idiot.  The other barbers may be good but I do not want to take a chance.
