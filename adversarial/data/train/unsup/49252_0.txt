Do not EVER get a lip wax from the Shadyside European Wax Center in Pittsburgh, PA. The technician used multiple layers of wax and ultimately peeled a layer of my skin off and burned my face in the process. Three days later and the area is far from healed. Furthermore, the manager Daiana has no sense of urgency about addressing or resolving this issue. Go elsewhere!
