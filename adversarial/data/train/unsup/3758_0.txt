If you're seeking those small release films (i.e. foreign films, indie flicks etc.) Regal Manor Twin is the place to go. I've dropped by here to see a few different films, most recently \"The Girl Who Played With Fire\", part of the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson.\n\nThe theatre itself isn't too much to write home about - it's older, not super clean and hosts only two theatres. Pricing is roughly the same as other local Regal theatres, but the reason it's a four star and not a three star, IMO, is the selection of indie flicks. While they only play two at a time, the selection changes over every few weeks - giving movie goers a chance to make a trip to see that selective release. \n\nThe concessions are just as tasty as other Regal theaters and the seats are pretty comfy, albeit a bit lower than other theaters. That's worth noting for those of us who are vertically challenged. Employees aren't the most chipper here, but really, it doesn't bother me too much. \n\nFYI to all: As Jason mentioned, the bathrooms are upstairs and for the ladies, there are only two stalls. So, hold it afterwards and head next store to Panera if you're in a crowded theater! \n\nYay for a local, classic theater with interesting flicks.
