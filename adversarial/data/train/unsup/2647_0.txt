This is going to be short as there's nothing outstanding about this restaurant. \n\nI only come here for the chili chicken (dry) - make sure you have something to drink!!! \nThere's also the caution warning of overload of oil of the noodles.\n& the waitress is kinda bitchy (but that's okay if you get take-out).
