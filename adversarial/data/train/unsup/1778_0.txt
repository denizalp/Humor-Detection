Boil places are apparently the thing right now...\nMy first experience was in Vegas this summer and I enjoyed it so decided to try this place on Yonge St. \n\nI thought at first that they were closed: Thursday night around 9pm, not a single patron inside and an  employee moping the floor by the entrance.\nShe waved us in so on we went...\n\nThe service was nice. Better actually than I expected for this sort of casual place. Our server explained the menu options which incorporated an asian twist to the southern seafood offering.\n\nWe opted for the sizzle beef plate and shrimp boil.\nAdded corn, sausage and potatoes.\n\nEverything was served very quickly. In fact, I wish they'd taken more time since it felt like the food would have been more flavourful if given the time to really soak in their \"Kracken\" sauce.\n\nWith so many options available I don't think I'll be back for dinner but the prices are good enough that I'd certainly do lunch.
