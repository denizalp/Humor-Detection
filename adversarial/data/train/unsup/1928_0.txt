It's a hit or miss kind of place.  If you chance it when there's a store wide end of season clearance sale, you're in luck.  I found so many good things here.  You have ti weed through all the outlet crap to find designer pieces.  I have a Narcisso Rodriguez pleated gold lam√© skirt for a fraction of the price.  Armani Exchange vision wear had a surplus and it ended up here last time.  Too bad I lost it and in need of replacement soon.\n\nAs for the men's department,  it was disappointing to see to many junky styles.  Other than that, the kids section is pretty good!\n\nThis is really a decent store.
