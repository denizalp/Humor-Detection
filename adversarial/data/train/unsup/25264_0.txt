One of my all time favorite places to eat. The food is fantastic and Mario and his family are so much fun to see when you're there. This is a small place with a big heart. I love everything about this restaurant - try the sangria for sure and you can't go wrong whether you have pizza or an entree. Tell them that Kisha says hi :D
