Not only do I love the reasonably priced delicious food but I adore the staff! Did you ever meet an utterly charming and excellent server who made you feel like royalty? Well, please go over to PJ and make the acquaintance of Tia! You will be as taken with her as I was. I was so bummed - the parking lot was a mess because they were doing the blacktop. I was so annoyed.  But then, Tia smiled and got me a drink. I honestly thought we were friends but she treats everyone with great care and courtesy. My blood pressure returned to normal in a blink of an eye. The Mediterranean salad eas split between me and my friend and then to the movie to see The One I Love. The one I love is Tia. Thank you!! YOU HAVE THE GIFT!
