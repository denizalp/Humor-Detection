Just had the Mahi Mahi tacos here.  Very delicious.  The meal was well prepared, full of flavor and yet light...not something you find commonly at a Mexican restaurant.  I often do not choose this as a go to meal due to the heaviness of this kind of cuisine.  The ingredients all seemed very fresh.  I would recommend this place without hesitation.  Plus I love strolling around Tivoli Village.
