It's been more than a year since my last visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Being it December, I decided on coming back to have another Beef Wellington since it seemed like the perfect meal for the holidays.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food was top notch, my waiter almost killed the experience because he was pretty slow and at times was no where to be found when I needed him.  The most bizarre part was how I sat at my table for a good 20 minutes without a menu.  Not a big deal, since I already knew what I would be ordering, but I just thought it was strange how I wouldn't have a menu right off the bat to look at.  My waiter did do what he was scripted to do like explain all the meats from the cart (The Meat Wagon! --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1h8BxQw).  It's still impressive to look at, but if you've been there before like I have, it does drag down the ordering process for me.\n\nWith all that said though, I still had an amazing meal.\n\nKurobuta Pork Belly -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1c2cjnM\nw\/ cheesy grits, tomato jam, onion pork jus\nThis was a really good appetizer to start off with.  The pork belly just melted in my mouth like butter!!  Interesting take on a southern dish.\n\nBeef Wellington -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/19j6hfQ\nStill the best tasting Beef Wellington I've ever had.  Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!  Wellington was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was juicy and full of flavor.\n\nFrench Press Coffee -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1hGdgBV (pic from my last review)\nSame coffee and and flavor spoons as my last visit.  This time I used both the Amaretto and Baileys flavor spoons.  Still was a great way to cap off my meal.\n\nAll in all, it was a very good dinner but the service from my waiter was under par.  It's really too bad I have to downgrade to 4 stars, but maybe next time I come by I'll have a more attentive waiter.  Still worth visiting if you're in Vegas and want a great dining experience.
