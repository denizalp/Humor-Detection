Typical 'celebrity' restaurant in a big casino. Good place to eat, as long as it's on someone else's dime.\n\nTHE ROSES: Fun concept, especially in the bar. There are a battery of large TVs above the bar that offer you a selection of sports and better gangster flicks to watch while you wait for your table. While I was there, I enjoyed scenes from \"The Godfather, Part II\", and \"Copland\". Given the noise level in the bar, it would be nice to have the closed captioning turned on, though; there is no way in heck you're gonna hear the dialogue. Food is actually quite good; served family-style (at least on my visits), everything was uniformly quite tasty and well-presented. Service is quite good as well.\n\nTHE THORNS: Very loud; not the place you want to go for a quiet, intimate meal. The other big thorn is that while the food and service are quite good, I honestly do think the prices are a bit steep for what you're getting. Unfortunately, this is the New Vegas Model; where the casinos used to offer great dining deals to get folks in the door, these days the larger casinos apparently have no problems packing the suckers in, so they can charge quite a bit. I dined on an expense account, but if I had to pay my own way, I'd have gone elsewhere, as I honestly felt the value for (my) money wasn't there.\n\nTHE VERDICT: Loud, boisterous, fun place with great food, but steep prices create a poor Value Factor and so I have to detract at least 1 star.\n\nIf you're dining on someone else's dime, have more money than you literally know what to do with, or if the Rio is comping you, by all means go; otherwise, as they say in the mob movies, 'fugheddabboutit'!
