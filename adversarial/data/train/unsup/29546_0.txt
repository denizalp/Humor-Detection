Bad service. I assume since we had a big group and they automatically got their tip, they didn't even try to provide good service. I ordered 5 meat combination, but they only gave me 4 kinds. We had 8 people there, the waitress only brought 5 cups, and never showed up again. We also asked for two cups of got waters, we never get those either. About the flavor, among all the pho I tried, it is just about average or little below.
