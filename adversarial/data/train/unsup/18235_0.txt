I moved into an extra tiny condo and decided to thin out my book collection. So many of the books I've been keeping for reference purposes I can now find the info online (ie Monty Python's Tao of Dating, the Canadian Book of Lists, Nit Picker's Guide to Everyone Loves Raymond, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Servant, One Thousand \"One Thousand X You  Must Do\/Read\/See\/Listen to\/Eat Before You Die\" Books You Must Read Before You Die, the Flatware of Shannara, et al.) I decided it was high time to get rid of them. Maybe pocket some cash and really splurge on Manchu Wok for lunch. \n\nThe used bookstore biz appears to be the greatest racket on the planet. They pay about $2 for a good hardcover or softcover which they then turn around and sell for 50% off the cover price (meaning $10-$12).\n\nGiven the high margins, I'm grappling for a theory of human psychology or economics that explains why the Saturday morning guy is just so, I dunno, not happy to take in new stock. Maybe there's not a great profit sharing plan at ABC Books. I dunno. \n\nThe down economy probably has a lot more sellers than buyers these days. And used bookstores are pretty choosy about what they buy. ABC won't touch books not in near mint condition. I tend to be rough on my books. A well loved book I always leave looking well loved, in a Biblical sense. You know?\n\nSo anyway, don't waste your time and spare your back trying to get cash for something even with a semi noticeable cover fold.
