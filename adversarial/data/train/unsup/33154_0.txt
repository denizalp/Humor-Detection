I went to Auto Pro after reading reviews.  I needed to have my brakes checked when my brake light went on.  Turned out I was low on fluid and they filled it for me and I picked up my car - no charge.  Yes, they filled it for free!  I decided I would use this place whenever I needed a repair.  Have been going there and every time something is wrong with my car and usually when I need an oil change (they are only open M-F 8-5).  I never feel overcharged and the work is always on time and excellent.  Estimates are spot on with what you are charged.  A good business model - reasonable and honest.  Seems like people going there have been going for years, and I can see why.
