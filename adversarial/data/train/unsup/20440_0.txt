A very well run rescue.  Due to the influx of bunnies they received from an owner surrender, there are quite a few bunnies to choose from at this point!  All the pens are well maintained, and the bunnies are brushed and pampered here like they are one of their own pets.  They also have a store which has very high quality food, treats, toys, and litter at very reasonable prices.   If you adopt a bunny from them, they will clip their nails for free for life!  A very nice perk, since I loathe clipping pet nails.
