So disappointing! I heard such great things about Johnny Mac's but after having pizza there for dinner, I am far from impressed...\n\nI went in with my husband on a Monday night. We were seated in a booth that had ice on the seat, leaving me with a lovely wet spot on my ass. The hostess asked what we would like to drink but didn't know what beers they had. Perhaps management should consider not having drink orders taken by a young girl that doesn't even appear to be old enough to serve liquor...? A second employee came by with our waters a few minutes later. \n\nWe looked over the menu, waiting for one of the multiple waitresses that walked by to stop and acknowledge us. Finally someone came over, gave us an excuse about how no one knew whose table we were, and took our order. \n\nWe went with a large mushroom pizza. I debated getting wings since I heard such good things about them but decided to pass. The pizza didn't take long to come out, it felt like we waited longer to order then we did for the food. \n\nUpon first glance, the pizza was all good. Nice thin crust that was golden brown, lots of cheese, plenty of mushrooms. The cheese was tasty, as were the mushrooms. The crust was like rubber though, when I picked up a piece to try to take a bite it flopped over. The only part of the crust with any crunch to it was the edges. Pretty disappointing. \n\nIf I had never heard of Johnny Mac's, this would be my first and only time visiting. Since I live nearby I will probably give them another shot sooner or later... Everyone has an off night at some point, right?
