I really think people come here just so they can \"say\" they are coming here...if you know what I mean.  (hence the name)  Gotta love a good name \"pho\" a restaurant!\n\nBrought some out of town friends here on Monday (Labor Day) around 1pm.  People were everywhere inside and outside waiting.  I almost gave up immediately but my inner gut & the \"best of RJ's\" on the windows made me stay.  When we finally made our way to the front to put our name in we asked the guy how long the wait was.  His reply, \"really fast\".  I couldn't help but chuckle but who are we to argue. LOL\n\nSurprisingly, our wait wasn't too long before our name was called.  With all the people everywhere I was halfway expecting to be waiting a while.  We were seated by a window.  Literally every table full.  A guy came to take our drink order.  While we checked out the menu every meal was numbered making it easy to order.  Each item had a detailed description underneath for white girls like me or at least I'd like to think. haha  BTW the menu is gigantic.  I'm often overwhelmed by such menus but I knew what I was looking for.  My BF and I decided we would share each of our orders so we could try a couple different dishes.  We had settled on two things to share until I heard my friend say...UDON Noodle!  I just discovered Udon Noodles when I was in Cali. I honestly cannot have enough of it.  To describe it to someone I would say its like a really thick soft spaghetti noodle.  Here is what we ordered:\n\n*Beef Udon Noodle - I thought it was fantastic.  The BF thought it was a little peppery (you could actually see the black pepper in it) but it was still our favorite.\n*Chicken Pho - A little bland broth flavor (I remember it being better), chunks of chicken, thin rice noodles.  We added a bunch of hot sauce to spice it up and give it a little more flavor. Pretty good even though it felt like it was the hottest\/humid day of the summer.  We did only eat half the soup.  The bowl was as big as my head.\n*Our friends also got the Beef Udon and love it.  They also got the Teriyaki Chicken with Rice and it was a huge portion.  She only had half of it.\n\nWe waited a bit for the check.  The servers were running around like crazy but she eventually came.  Our bill came to around $70 I believe-our friends had bought.  Overall it was good.  Just super crazy busy.  This is definitely a popular spot.\n\nThe reviews say that its opened 24 hours.  I cant imagine really wanting a drunken night soup bowl at 3am but it sounds like a lot of people do.  (I secretly opt for a drunken night Fat Burger at that time-but that's just me) but if its your thang have at it!  Its there for your enjoyment!  24 hours.
