+.5 for service\n\nFor a 4 star restaurant, I expected more from this place. If I had to choose between here and Kiyomizu, I would pick Kiyomizu without a heartbeat.\n\nI came here for lunch on a rainy day last week. Initially it wasn't busy, but the crowd definitely picked up by the time I left. The restaurant felt more like a bar than a sushi restaurant, which made me feel a bit out of place (everyone eating lunch here was wearing business attire; I had a backpack with me damnit!\n\nFor lunch I ordered the Sushi Lunch 11. It came with a miso soup, salad, and this noodle-like dish with soup (I originally thought that was the miso soup). All the starter dishes were great, in fact I thought they were better than the sushi dish itself. When the sushi plate came, my smile turned to a...poker face. There was pretty much no variety of sushi fish, with only salmon, tuna, red snapper, and shrimp. The other problem was the rice\/fish ratio was too much on the rice side, that is, there was too much rice and too little fish. In terms of taste though it was good, so 3 stars fits perfectly for this restaurant.\n\nService was great, which seems to fall in line with the other reviews. I was seated quickly, had my order taken promptly, and the waitresses kept coming back to make sure the food was alright.
