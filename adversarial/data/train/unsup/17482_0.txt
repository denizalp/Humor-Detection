This is a review for the gamer girls and girls who are married to gamers:   As I get more experience with this store my review could be even higher.  The owners were really friendly and helpful.  More importantly . . . and if you are reading this as a gamer's wife you know what I'm talking about . . . the store doesn't smell bad. At all.  It's clean and it's fresh!   My wife is very picky about going into game stores because, let's be honest, a lot of card gamers do not have the best personal hygiene.  It's not a factor here and the mrs. spent a lot of time in this store and was not rushing me to get what I wanted and get out.  That is the biggest compliment I can give a place.  We were looking around for a good 30 minutes, on separate sides of the store, and she didn't even get hit on.  That's another huge plus for her.    This store has good prices, helpful and friendly employees, lots of nerd stuff, and it's CLEAN.  What more can you want in a gaming store?   Well, I could want better advertisement\/notice for what nights tend to be the big nights for certain games and the player support at that store for games.  It's really all I can think of.
