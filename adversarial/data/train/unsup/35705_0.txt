I came to 7th Street Public Market just to partake in vegan pizza at Pure Pizza and boy was the drive worth it. \nThank you once again fellow Yelpers for leading me to the promised land. \n\nI took a moment to look at the menu. Still unsure of what to order, I asked the guy at the counter for a recommendation. He was super polite but no help. So I opted for wild mushroom pizza and substituted daiya for the mozzarella on the Neapolitan crust. \n\nAccompanied by my pomegranate aranciata from Zia Pia (also in the market see review), I dug in with the best intentions to eat only half of the pizza. I failed miserably and ate it all. The crust was perfectly cooked and the perfect combination of soft, chewy and crispy. The mushrooms were perfectly seasoned and the truffle oil such depth to the flavor profile. The Daiya was perfectly cooked and gave the pizza a beautiful creaminess. \n\nThe pizza was so simple in its ingredient yet so wonderfully nuanced in its execution. It was worth the $15+ spent. I will most certainly be returning to partake in their pizzas in the very near future.
