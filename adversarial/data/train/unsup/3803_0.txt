Came here on a Saturday night for a birthday gathering.\n\nI was pretty impressed with this place:\nA) Along with the bowling area, there's a bar with pool tables, and a lounge section with a window facing the lanes where you can people watch.\nB) A live DJ played songs and mixed videos on the screens throughout the establishment. I liked the songs he was playing, and also takes requests if you want to hear something specific or change the genre.\nC) The waitresses are attentive, and don't mind splitting checks. Make sure you tell them beforehand to avoid any confusion.\n\n**Bonus Points**\nRack City came on, and one of the girls bowling next to us bent over and made her booty clap. I didn't even need to give her a dollar!\n\nSo, why only three stars?! Well, there's one REALLY big caveat to this place. Everything was clean with exception to the men's bathroom. It smelled like urine. Not just ordinary urine, but the kind you piss out when you've been drinking a little too much. GROSS. Annnnd it's all over the floor. Management -- please do something about this.\n\nAs long as you avoid the bathroom (if you're a man), you'll have fun here.
