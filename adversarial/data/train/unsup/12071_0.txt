We came out to far Mesa to go to Tia Rosa's for dinner. Much to our disappointment they had a Kitchen fire there and are now shut down for quite a bit of time.  They sent us out to the one in Gilbert.\nSo this is how I happened to come across this little boutique.\nAfter dinner I wanted to go into Decadence Boutique to check it out.\nI had seen a few ladies with shopping bags from there come into the restaurant.\nShallow as it sounds I liked the look of the bags and the shop from the outside. So we went in.\nCute things I saw right away. Lots of things to choose from. All female items. from small girls ,maybe 6 and up. All the way up to the big ladies stuff.\nI found quite a few things that I liked and Purchased. Yes, I love to shop.\nSome things are a bit high for what they are. Yet other things are very reasonable. I bought a little of both.\nI got a belt there they I really liked. $60.00 seems a little high for a belt, but I just hope that I can wear it somewhere soon.\n2 young ladies working there Friday night. They were very helpful. One told me they have only been open a month on Saturday.\nIf you happen to be in Gilbert. Give this place the once over. I think you just might find at least one thing you love. I found 4 things.  Hehee\nLots of parking in the lot. It is a tiny bit dark in there,which adds to the ambiance, but also makes it hard for the older ladies like me to see. Music was a little loud at first but, they turned it down. Nice place, lots of cool things.
