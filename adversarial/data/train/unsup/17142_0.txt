We always come to bare atleast once or twice every summer. This is our second time getting a cabana and as much fun as I had I was really disappointed. They wouldn't let us take pictures because it's a top less pool party which is dumb because females choose to take there tops off, it shouldn't be that strict to take a picture. Even when we were in cabana they wouldn't let us take pictures of our group. They were really strict from any other time I've been. \n\nThe perks:\n-When you get a cabana the money spent on a cabana goes towards alcohol \n-the cabanas are very resonable just be prepared to pay for gratuity and service fee which was about $200+\n-not overcrowded\n- good music but good place to chill
