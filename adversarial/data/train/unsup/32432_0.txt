I received great service here! \n\nMy starter died one night after I got home from a long drive. The next day I had my car towed to Century 3 Kia. Within 4 days, they had replaced the starter and checked my whole vehicle for any problems. \n\nThe communication was great on their end and they kept me in the loop the whole time! The service was a little pricey even after they knocked off $30 (very nice of them.)
