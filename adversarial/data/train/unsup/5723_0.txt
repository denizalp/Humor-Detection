As if being unable to make the system work wasn't enough, it appears as if Jim Miller has been changing the programming on my system since we parted ways. Light programs that were actually working no longer work. \n\nI cannot stress how dangerous it would be to use Desert Sound and Security. They are obviously inept as well as unprofessional.   Feel free to email me and I'll give you a first-hand demonstration of my non-working system.
