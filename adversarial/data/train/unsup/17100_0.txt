I picked a dumb insurance plan through Aetna when my company changed insurance providers. The Aetna rep stated that Aspen Dental was one of the closest in proximity to my office. Today I went for a first visit. And last visit. The girl taking x-ray was sweet as can be. The hygienist checked my gums and recession depths or whatever it may be. She recommend some cockamamie suggestion about this procedure that would take 1.5 hours. I said that I didn't have enough time today as I was on lunch break. I asked if I could get a standard cleaning for the time being and she said a bunch of things that didn't make sense. I asked about cost and was referred to some lady behind a desk. She said that the procedure would be $2000.00 and insurance would cover $1000.00. I left after that. Highly suggest avoiding this place. It is like the Lube Stop of dentistry. I just wanted a God damned cleaning. Left with a headache and high blood pressure due to my anger at them wasting my time. I only have one life to live and an hour was destroyed by Aspen Dental.
