With the option of patio or indoor dining we opt of eating in side. The patio was facing York st which  is undergoing construction, can be loud and dusty. On a Friday lunch the whole restaurant is pretty quiet not busy at all. \n\nWith a party of 7 we all got appetizers, main, and dessert. Sparking water was offered and was ordered. Service was a bit slow but he got everything correctly. We were seated right in front of the kitchen, they had a open glass kitchen. We heard the staff swearing at each other in the middle of our meal but that kind added entertainment for us haha.\n\nI ordered the chicken cream of mushroom soup. Came in a nice portion, not as creamy as I had imagined but it was very flavourful.\n\nMain I got the prime beef fusille . I was expecting the portions to be small since some of the Yelp reviews said they weren't full. But my pasta was huge with chunks of beef and mushroom. Very tasty and pipping hot. I love it when my food is steaming hot.\n\nFor dessert I got the citrus panna cotta. That one was a bit too citrusy for my taste.\n\nOver all great atmosphere and food was delicious!
