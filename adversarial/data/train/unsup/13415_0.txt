This is my go-to place when I need to buy a wedding present, make a gift basket {they have the best gift basket kits that come with stuffing, basket, plastic wrap, and bow}, or really just any special occasion for that matter. They have tons of unique items and you're SURE to find something for everyone here. \n\nFor example, a friend of mine can't wear metal jewelry and WM has so much great jewelry made out of different materials! :) The prices on kitchenware are great, literally can't be beat! And they're SO cute! If you're stumped on where to do your holiday shopping or what to get your mother-in-law for her birthday, this is your one stop shop. They also have wonderful wines and lots of chocolate, i.e. for you girlfriend who just went through a breakup or lets be honest, for yourself after a rough day. ;) {We've all been there!} \n\nI'll see you again soon, World Market!
