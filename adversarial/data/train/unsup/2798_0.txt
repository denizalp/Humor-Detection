We came here for reverse happy hour a few days ago. I've only been to the Tempe one and really wanted to try their happy hour menu. I just noticed that they opened a Scottsdale location so we wanted to try this location. \n\nIt was hard for me to try the items I wanted because I couldn't eat meat this past Friday that we went and they don't have a lot of non meat items on their happy hour menu. I ended up getting their calamari and their hand cut pub fries. Both were really good. My boyfriend ordered the bacon cheddar potato cakes and he loved it!  I also got their house margarita which is not too shabby. \n\nThe only thing that did it for me was the service wasn't great. The waitress didn't write down our order so she couldn't remember it and ended up coming back and asking all of us what we ordered again. To top it off, my sister's drink was wrong. She ordered a vodka lemonade & she brought a vodka and pineapple. Their burger was also incorrect. They wanted it medium, and it came out well done. Note to staff, write down the orders so you get it correct for your customers. The food wasn't terrible, we all actually enjoyed it, however service needs a little work.
