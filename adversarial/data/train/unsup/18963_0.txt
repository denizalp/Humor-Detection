This Park 'n Swap could definitely be better.  Only about half of the spaces in the building have vendors and of those vendors I'd consider buying goods from one.  There was a stand selling nice quality pots and pans.  I've considered going back to buy some.  Aside from that stand, there was really no other reason to be there.  It was a fun way to spend a lazy Sunday because for a handful of change at the bottom of my purse, we were easily entertained.  We got to walk around with a beer in hand and listen to a live band and cracked plenty of jokes about the random crap we came across.  It costs a $1 to get in which I thought was kind of silly but when I paid it in change it made me feel better.  \n\nAs we were leaving, my man spotted a large package of batteries and he knew I needed some for my Wii remote so he went to buy them and the guy said they were a buck.  He said \"there's no way these batteries work if you're selling them for a buck\" but the guy at the stand swore they did and since they were only a dollar, we scrounged up some more change to pay him and left.  \n\n\nPostscript: On average, the batteries will last half a day.
