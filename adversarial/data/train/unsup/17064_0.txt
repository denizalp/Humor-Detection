So a friend and I was walking around MGM looking for a place to eat before our show. We werent dressed up so that eliminated all the fancy restaurants.. It was either Wolfgang Puck, The food court or Rainforest Cafe.. and I was not going to eat at the food court or rainforest an over priced sit down version of the food court.. So we had no choice but to eat at Wolfgang Puck.. honestly i am not a big fan of wolfgang puck but it beats the food court.. As i entered in the restaurant with a complete attitude of \" I hate wolfgang puck\" , my mood started to change.... \n\nThe waiters and staff greeted you welcoming you into wolfgang puck..I was slowly start to brush off the i ahte wolfgang puck attitude...\n\nAs we sat down water and beverage was taken immediately.. i said to myself hmmmm... ineteresting.. love how fast they work...\n\n\nThe server was really friendly and informative.. gave us the specials and had a positive attitude really good guest service skills pretty impressed..\n\nI was pretty impressed how often they refilled our water and bread basket without being told..\n\nSo the food finally came and i was in shock. I was supirsed how huge the portions were.. I ordered the burger and my freind had the pizza i must say DAYUM! Wolfgang! i am impressed.. loved the juicey burger and loved the fries.. PIzza was awesome also!\n\nFor dessert we had the Banana siffoule it was mmm mmmm good!\n\nOverall Wolfgang shocked the crap outta me.. Love this place! ive had the wolfgang puck cafes at the airport and was not impressed at all that's why i was a bit hesitant to eat at this wolfgang puck but im glad i gave it a second try and i would definitely dine here again!
