I will start by saying that I was beyond pleased with my experience here...\nI had bought a Groupon for Brazilian waxes here and we all know it's a bit of a gamble what you are going to come up on with a Groupon but I couldn't have asked for more considering what was about to be done to me. \nThe spot is a tad challenging to find because its a salon services building (see tip for address change) and it's in it's own individual office. The office is no frills..table, wax, a chair and some cabinets but what else do you need? You hop up and she gets right to it. \nAnd the best part?! She uses HARD WAX so while a Brazilian is never a pleasant experience it made it sooooo much less painful. She works in small sections too so you don't feel like she is ripping off your privates in one swoop. We chit chatted like old friends the whole way through, and any good waxer knows distraction is the key to getting you through one of these. The way she works is so quick and methodical that you don't even notice what she is doing and seemed to get the bad bits done early on so the last half is pretty easy. Most thorough one I've ever received without having to endure the painful post wax plucking. TOTALLY WORTH IT. About as painless as you are going to get with a Brazilian. So happy with how it turned out, I strongly recommend you give this spot a try.
