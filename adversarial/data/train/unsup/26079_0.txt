The good: My fish was excellent! The martinis were shaken perfectly.  Our server was really nice and even offered to write us a list a places to go since we are new to the area.\n\nThe bad: Who still makes a house salad with iceberg lettuce? \n\nThe ugly: The manager was super cranky when we asked him to snap a quick photos of us.
