Lotus of Siam has nothing on Komol!!!! There I said it. I love Komol. It's clean and the food here has never let me down. I have been a fan for twenty years now. It is in my top 5 of favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas without a doubt. \n\nI've tried most of their chicken and veggie dishes, but the Panang Chicken is my shining star here. The consistency of the curry sauce is excellent. Generally smooth and not watery. The heat level of the sauce is also to my liking along with the balance of the meat to veggie ratio.  My only gripe is the dark meat. Ugh. Although it's more flavorful I try to eat healthier and Komol will not let me order all white meat. What's up with that? \n\nThe food here is 5 stars without a doubt, but the service is about a 2 star for me. The young boys working seem to be more into internet porn than making sure I get my Thai Tea I ordered fifteen minutes ago. They are friendly when they do decide to shuffle on over to the table, but don't expect them to remove your dirty plates when you are done or get your check in a timely manner. Remember, internet porn comes first, customers second. As far as takeout goes they handle that shit! \n\nI highly recommend Komol if you are looking for authentic Thai on the east side of town.
