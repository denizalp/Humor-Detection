FYI - park in the same parking lot as the strip club as this restaurant is literally located right next it.  Strip clubs aren't my thing, but if it's yours and you also enjoy good Mexican food, then why not come here and kill two birds with one stone.  \n\nTheir food is of good quality, not greasy like some Mexican places.  \nWith that said, the pulled chicken tacos entree was quite tasty.  It was flavorful, but not overly salty or spicy.  The refried beans and cilantro rice complement each other and the tacos nicely.  Also, they make guacamole fresh in front of you so you can choose which ingredients to add or omit.  \n\nService was impeccable!  Would definitely come back.
