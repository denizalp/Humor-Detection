Had a very relaxing afternoon at True Rest Float Spa.  We were great with hot tea and spa slippers. \nOnce we filled out our wavers, Jill (so Sweet) took us into watch a short video about what we were about to experience and helpful tips.  Then, we waited in their beautiful relaxation room until our treatment. \nAfter we showered, you get into a room temp floating pod. You can listen to Spa music, you're own music or no music while floating.  \nThe float is so relaxing and tranquil. You really do forget about the stresses of everyday life. \nAfter the float, you shower again. They also have an area to dry your hair and get ready to go out. I loved the products they let you use.  They had everything! \nWe then met back up in the relaxation room where they have an oxygen bar and comfy couches.  It was truly an afternoon of bliss!
