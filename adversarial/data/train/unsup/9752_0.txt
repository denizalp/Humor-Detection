I recently visited Margaritaville to grab a couple of drinks with a friend, and I have upgraded the place from \"I don't want to go there\" to \"I don't mind going there.\"  I'll be honest, I'm not crazy about the place.  The house band is loud and pretty cheezy IMHO, but everyone else in the world seems to enjoy 'em.  The bar is always super packed, hence next to impossible to get a drink.  And the prices are pretty hefty for being just a shitty little bar.\n\nWhy the upgrade?  Well, on the Tuesday night I went, it was pretty empty.  My friend and I found seats at the bar and had a very friendly bartender who was able to assist us in charging our drinks to my friend's room at Harrah's.  Kind of a cool Harrah's perk, I guess.  Great place for people watching on the patio, too.\n\nIf it's my choice, though, I'll pick a different spot to go eat or drink at.
