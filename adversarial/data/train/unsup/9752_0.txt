If you're female, this place might be great for stocking up on scrubs- lots of variety, prints and solids, brands like Carhart, Dickies, and Greys Anatomy, and a bunch of clearance-priced stock \n\nBut if you're a dude (and I was here shopping for mine)... you're limited to one rack of scrubs, priced higher than anywhere else in town (approaching $40\/piece), and with limited sizes available (only small and 2XL bottoms?). \n\nLocation is conveniently right inside the 2nd floor mall entrance to the left of Sears, right by the food court.
