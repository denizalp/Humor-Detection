I came here for dinner on a weekday with my family and boyfriend. The place was packed and we probably had to wait 30-40 min to be seated. There's not really a waiting area so I guess if you wanted to you could roam around the casino for a bit. First of all, I want to say our waiter was amazing! He was serving a big party and the rest of his tables but he was able to check up on us pretty frequently. He was such a fun guy to talk to and he gave us recommendations for everything on the menu.\n\nWe ordered the sashimi won-tacos for our appetizer and they were really good! Probably my favorite part of my meal. I got the mac+cheese bacon burger for my main course that comes with a bunch of different cut fries. It was good and definitely a big portion but not the best burger I've had. My brother got the same thing and said it's now his favorite burger he's ever tasted. So to each their own. For dessert we shared the Guy's cheesecake challenge. On paper it sounds good, in front of you it looks amazing, but when I actually tasted it, it fell short. The potato chips and pretzels give it a nice contrast of textures to the large mound of cheesecake, which isn't overly sweet. I just didn't find myself wanting more of it after a few spoonfuls. \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back to try some of the other dishes on the menu, however, with the price and the wait time, it can wait haha.
