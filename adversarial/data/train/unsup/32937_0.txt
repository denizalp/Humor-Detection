I used Penguin several years ago to install a new unit in my daughter's home.  Because I had a couple issues with installation, the owner gave me 3 years free maintenance on the unit, which I've now used.  Based on my past experience, I called them to do a \"tune-up\" on another property to make sure that it was working for the season.  The tech came out, presented me with an estimate for $4000. for repairs, or of course, I could purchase new units.  Since I'm selling the home, I was't willing to follow either course. I followed the tech to the truck and asked him if he had actually performed a \"tune-up.\"  He stated that he did what he was supposed to do, which looked like taking pictures and giving me an estimate.  He didn't tune-up anything.  I called an independent company with great reviews, and he laughed at the estimate that I was given.  He said that I didn't need half of the items on the list, and the pricing for  relevant items was ridiculous.  I now have his number in my phone instead of Penguin.  It certainly pays to get more than one estimate.
