Came here with my husband and dog, sat outside very nice and of course dog friendly! Good beers! I had the superhuman salad- AMAZING dressing (coconut & Turmeric) my husband had the butternut chicken sandwich but changed it to Swiss cheese and avocado and no tomato. He said the chicken was well cooked and gave it 8\/10. Laura was our server she was friendly and gave us good service. I would come back!
