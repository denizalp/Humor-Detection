Josh and Melissa are just awesome great people and a pleasure to work with. Waited two weeks to write my review so it could be as accurate as possible. Went in looking for a new bed. Went to one store down the street and the sales person was too eager to give me $600 discount on a mattress brand I'd never even heard of. Sometimes a good deal isn't always a good deal. Played it safe and decided to stop in at Best Mattress. Immediately greeted by Melissa who showed me around to several beds that fit my budget and comfort. I ended up loving a bed out of budget but was exactly what I was looking for. This was my first time owning a memory foam mattress and I was skeptical because I generally prefer plush beds but Melissa showed me the iComfort series from Serta and it just felt right. It was the most comfortable and plush than any of the other memory foam mattresses. Melissa and Josh are great, theyre not pushy and let you take your time jumping back from bed to bed to make up your mind which I appreciate. I also purchased the mattress cover which you should never go without. They delivered the next day on Father's Day which was amazing. The guys were great in and out at 10am as promised. Melissa and Josh told me to give my body 30 days to adjust to the bed and if I wasn't satisfied I could have it returned for another mattress set. The first night and every night since has been heavenly. I love my mattress. No really it's amazing. I purchased a beautyrest 2yrs ago I hated it every day. This bed is amazing. Thank you guys for awesome service!!! Will make sure all my friends come here
