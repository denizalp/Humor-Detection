Came here on a Monday and unfortunately wasn't hungry enough for a burger but had the buffalo chicken dip and asparagus bruschetta, both super delicious!! We also had the Sangria which was just a touch sweet, perfecto! Our service was great too, always checked in on us but not too often, she also let us linger, & enjoy our time there on a busy night which i always really appreciate.
