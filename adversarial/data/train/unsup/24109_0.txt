Lizy and her team at prospect Mortgage are second to none.  I was a first time home buyer and could never have made it through the process of getting a home loan without Lizy and her team's help.  They were on top of every aspect of the loan process from beginning to end all while accommodating my difficult schedule at work.  When it came to picking the right loan she even showed me the options others could provide just to ensure I was receiving the best available loan for my situation.  I would highly recommend Lizy and her team to anyone looking for a home loan, including my friends and family.  You will receive unmatched service from a great team of professionals.
