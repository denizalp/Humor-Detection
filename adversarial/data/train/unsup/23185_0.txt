I'm now obsessed with this place, I look amazing thanks to Terry.\n\nAnyone that knows me knows how much I love my tan.  For real-I got sprayed yesterday at 4 pm, was out and about around 10 and didn't look scary at all, amazing:)  \nThis morning I rinsed lightly and still looks fab, seriously I will be in Vegas once a month now and will ALWAYS come here, Terry was super thorough and quick, but pays great attention to details, so no weird feet or wrists!!!\n\nAnd they have good prices on everything, I checked around and best in this area, $45 for a spray or $30 in spray booth?!  Unreal, and it's clean and not ghetto like some spray tan places.  \nAbsolutely love it!!
