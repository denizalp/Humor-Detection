WOW...The servings here are huge, enormous, vast, gigantic, massive, mammoth, colossal, titanic!!  A bit of advice, look to split everything on the menu.  I had the sausage gravy pot pie and it was more than enough for two people.  When our server brought it out, my first words were \"holy shit\" that's huge (please refrain from any cheap jokes)!  Rosemarie ordered some eggs and a mango coconut pancake.  The pancake was so big that it came out on a pizza platter. This place is American gluttony in a nutshell.  I almost felt guilty that there was so much food. Bottom line, even though the portions are huge...the food is good.  We will definitely be coming back and definitely be sharing....
