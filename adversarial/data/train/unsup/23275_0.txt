The Earl of Sangwich (as we like to call it, thank you Tommy Cheeseballs) might just be the most love business on Yelp. It has an insanely high number of reviews and almost all of them are 5 star reviews! \n\nI know The Earl doesn't need anymore good reviews but after my experience there on the morning of August 24th, I knew I had to write them a review. \n\nFlashback to 2am at Tryst. The goose is flowing left and right! This is on top of several shots of 1800. By 4am, I'm a wreck! I yack and stumble down the strip. My system alerts me I'm hungrier than I am tired. I know there's only one location that can satisfy this hunger at 5am: The Earl of Sangwich! \n\nI can barely stand as I enter The Earl. I blurt out some words which somehow the clerk behind the counter understood. I get my buzzer and wait for my sandwich. It starts buzzing and I retrieve it. I zombie-step back to my table and pass out. \n\nI think an hour passes and I wake up. I can't find my sandwich anywhere. I go to the counter and say something happened to my sandwich (I have regained my ability to speak... sort of). They said just a minute and brought out my sandwich. They saw me passed out and took it to keep it warm for me!! This has to be one of the most awesome things a business has ever done!! Instead of kicking my sloppy ass out, they allowed me to sleep and kept my sandwich warm! What an outstanding business! I wish I could give them more than 5 stars! \n\nBTW, the Thanksgiving sandwich was one of the best sandwiches in the world that night! \n\nBravo Earl!!
