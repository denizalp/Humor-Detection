Stopped in for a quick lunch and beer with a friend. They have specials pretty much any time you are there for food and drink. They also have  different food specials for each day of the week. They are all listed on the menu so you can plan ahead if you want to try something out. We went on a Tuesday and the specials are new Orleans themed. I expected this place to bigger but it is pretty small, though can fit a lot of people. It was pretty quaint though. I was a little disappointed at the menu options. This is mostly a salad, sandwich, and burger place. Our server was very attentive and friendly. The staff sat us right away as well and they were super nice too. Food was ok but I just got a club sandwich and fries. Friend for a burger and salad and said it was alright too. Would come here again if looking for somewhere fast and close, but I'm new to Charlotte and have so many other places to try!
