I cant' say enough about warning the public NOT to use this company. I check yelp for opinions but I've not ever given a review until now.  But this experience of hiring them to clean just one room and realistically one spot about 2 x2 area that got water damage, turned into two men pushing me worse then a used car salesman trying to convince me I needed to spend at least $200.00-$400.00 When I refused to succumb they wouldn't leave.  LITERALLY, no matter how many times I said please just leave THEY WOULDN'T.  They called their manager and he got into the whole act too trying to tell me it was going to cost that much.  I've never been treated like such an idiot.  The room itself was only a 10 x 15 area, I could've replace the entire carpet for less then what they insisted I needed to spend for the room.  After nearly 60 minutes of them harassing me, they finally agreed to just charge me their supposed $39.00 special, and then purposefully spilled out most of the dirty water in the hallway carpet and left.\nI plan on contacting many more places regarding this locally including the better business burea.  Honestly when I told my husband the story, he was mad I didn't call the police.  It was terrifying and scary to have two men come and make it clear they'd no intention of leaving until they pushed me into getting 10 times more money then what they advertise.
