My husband and I recently used Alaska Air to relocate to Hawaii with our 9 pets.  \n\nWith such an unusual case, we expected difficulties, but they were great.  The reps on the phone were extremely helpful, accommodating, and nice. \n\nWhen we arrived in Chicago the lady was very thorough checking us in, and made us feel comfortable leaving our pets in her capable hands.\n\nThe Seattle airport was the same good experience.  We really appreciated they provide cards for each of our pets to let us know they were all boarded.\n\nThe flight attendants on each flight seemed genuinely nice, and responded to all our inquiries regarding our pets.\n\nWe really appreciated their care towards our pets.  \n\nWe will definitely use them again when we visit family back on the mainland.
