Last night was my first visit EVER. I have no idea why I waited this long. Showed up for their reverse happy hour with a group last night. We sat at the Bar and Scott was behind the bar. Such an amazing experience and Scott was great. We order quite a few items from the Happy Hour list and all of it was amazing. The Shrimp Toast was my favorite, followed by the Escargot. We also ordered Oysters on the Half Shell and Oysters Rockefeller. Those were delicious as well. The Oyster Shots were interesting and fun. $3 Well drinks are great to wash all of this down. I had a blast last night here and I will be back again. Thank you Salt Cellar.
