Monkey photos adorning the walls garnered 3 stars from this Yelper regardless of service and drink quality.\n\nHowever, service and drink quality must factored into the final score.\n\nAfter a long day at the convention center, I stopped in with my work colleague (okay, my boss) and bought him a drink before he had to head for the airport.\n\nI saddled up to the bar and one of the bartenders looked at me, said nothing and went about his \"monkey business.\"\n\nI waited patiently (Jeopardy game show \"Final Jeopardy\" music played in my head - you know, the tedious melody that plays while the brainiacs scribble their answers to an obscure question?), but nothing happened.  Anyway, I waited and wondered why semi-primate dude couldn't muster a \"Hey, hold tight, I'll be right with you...\" or at least hand me a banana.\n\nAfter several minutes, another bartender took care of business - he was actually quite friendly.\n\nBottom line, I spent a half-hour in the bar, had a drink with the big guy and that was it.\n\nMonkey Bar, I loved the monkeys (and apes) dressed in suits adorning your walls.  Didn't love first bartender who ignored me.  Second bartender mostly made up for first bartender.\n\n*Bummed I couldn't quite figure out how to include, \"Well I'll be a monkey's uncle\" quip into this review. \n\n:)\n\n3 stars...and a few \"Ooh ooh ooh eee eee eee aah aah aahs\"  Yeah, that's an attempt at typed out monkey sounds.
