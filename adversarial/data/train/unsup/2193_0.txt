I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible to go along with the rest of my overtime take out meal series.  Japango, what can I say, there's a fair bit of hype associated with this place.  First off their sushi always looks fresh and I have had a few of my friends tell me this place has some of the best donkatsu in downtown TO.  I figured hell yeah, I'm going to order a donkatsu dinner to highlight my evening at work!\n\nFirst off when I received my meal, none of the items in my combo were labeled.  Simply bagging all the items in one bag together and writing the name of the person can't be that hard right?  So after 15 minutes of sorting through other people's meals, salads and soups I finally put together my donkatsu combo.  I started with the salad first, and what a mistake the lettuce was totally spoiled!  Not sure if it was due to the fact it was put beside hot food, but I had to throw it out because it was so gue-like.  Now on to the miso soup, I should call it me no soup, because it tasted like water with sand in it.  Finally the creme de la creme the donkatsu...when I opened the box it looked as if a small child had vomited all over my Styrofoam box.  Not only was the pork not crispy, it was totally wet and the sauces kind of just soaked into the box and rice making a non pleasant chunk of food.\n\nI mean it was take out and I should be a bit more forgiving, so I'm dropping a 2 star instead of a 1.  I might give them another shot, but will be definitely ordering sushi next time.  Please label my boxes next time Japango or I'll have to JapanNo on my next order!
