I recently spent 6700.00 at this Ashley furniture. Was just delivered the other day. The delivery guys were great! So I tipped them I think we'll. So in my order I had bought an set  of accessories of 2 candle sticks a vase and a ceramic dish that sits on your dresser. Well it was broken inside the box. So I called customer service and told them. Then they proceeded to put me on hold for 12 min. before the girl came back on and tell I could exchange it but I need to drive to there wear house and do it myself. But she said her managers would call me to verify this in a half hour! It's been 2 days and no call. Well I don't fill I should have to drive 1 hour round trip for a product they delivered broken. They can keep there set I will take my business else where. Once you give them the cash they don't care.! Now I'm worried that the warranty I bought is worth it.
