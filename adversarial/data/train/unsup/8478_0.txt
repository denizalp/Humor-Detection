I prefer gambling downtown to the strip usually, and I still like Main Street even though I haven't really won there in a while. I like the atmosphere so much better because it's well-lit, has vaulted ceilings in the casino, and is usually pretty lively. The dealers and pit bosses are always great too. If I'm going to lose my money, which I have a bad habit of doing, chances are it's going to be here!
