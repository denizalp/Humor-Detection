I love taking my car here, by recommendation of my co-workers it was as if the clouds parted and the suns from automotive heaven beamed down upon me.  My car is anything but new, I call it rugged, it is a jeep after all! A jeep that's about 12 years old, so TLC is required.  \n\nIf you want fancy waiting rooms, and a shop that'll rip you off go to one of the chains, cause Santa Fe is anything but that! \n\nIt's one of those little car shops that line Brookpark road.  Little signage & a desert-scape mural scrolled across the back of the building, it reminds me of a different era like the Fonz might roll up at any minute to tune up his bike & there is the chance you'll get greasy when you walk in to pay your bill-- but i like the gritty unpretentious purity of that, probably because I'm from Toledo. \n\nMake no mistake, \"Santa Fe\" Ray is the most honest mechanic i have met! He diagnosis & fixes the problem you are facing and doesn't try to 'scare' you into services you can hold off on. Being a lady i have had that happen at some of the big chain places & it sucks, at Santa Fe I feel comfortable & confident with my service !  & then there is the added bonus of Ray being hilarious! \n\nI think the only thing Santa Fe doesn't do is wheel alignments, but you can get those done almost anywhere else. Helpful tip:  Call early about 8:30\/9am or late afternoon 4p they're busy working on cars and probably wont answer midday.
