Needed oil changed on my sled and shaving dealt with the BOT in Hendo, I thought I would give this particular location a visit for an oil change and a tire rotation.  The honored my tire service from the other location and this made me happy.  The initial service was quick but when the manager approached and showed me the results of my inspection, I was destined to hang out a tad longer.  My vehicle is over 10 years old, and I have been religious in all matters relating to preventative maintenance.  When the manager showed me the results of the inspection, I was expecting the hard sell, and I would need a bunch of other S&%# I did not need.  Not the case here, he only suggested in order of importance that which I would eventually need.  I opted to bang it out then and there given the wear and tear on my vehicle.  Everyone from the manager to the gentleman doing the work was professional and friendly.  Thanks to yelp for showing my the same business which was my favorite in Henderson but in Vegas.
