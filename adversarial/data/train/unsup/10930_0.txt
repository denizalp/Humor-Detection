I've been wanting to have some tacos at Grand Electric...but I guess I am spoiled... I don't really want to line up and my friends who are nice enough to line up for me and I just show up right before the place opens... I have to say THANK YOU!!\n\nI guess after lining up for 45 min and being the first in line... they were hungry.... And as usual...someone dear wants everything interesting on the menu...\n\nMiami Ribs ($13)\n- really tender and well flavoured... remind me of Korean style ribs\n- love the fat on the ribs\n- fingers licking good... (we ate with our fingers...)\n\nBaja Fish Taco\/Spicy Arbol Chicken Taco\/Beef Cheek Taco @$3.50 each\n- I love the Baja fish that best.. the batter is light and the fish fresh\n- Chicken a little on the dry side... \n- Beef Cheek has really rich and has a complex flavour\n\nSpicy Squid ($9)\n- definitely remind me of Korean style \n- hot sauce mixed in with a sour note\n- squid are tender but I think I might pass on this next time\n\nGuacamole & Chips ($10)\n- the chips are freshly baked... eat them right away if not they lost their crunchiness\n- Not much flavour in the dish itself... I can even say a little bland... \n- Would not offer that next time!\n\nAnd I washed them down with Cerveza Monkey ($6)\n\nFor dessert:\nKey Lime Vaso ($5) and Chocolate & Pecans ($5)\n- I like Key Lime Vaso a little better since it has smooth and sour and sweet at the same time... \n- Chocolate Pudding is a little boring.... just too sweet for me\n\nChurros ($6)\n- I always love Churros... especially freshly made and filled with Dolce de Leche (life is sweet!!)\n\nMusic is a little loud... an excuse for me to scream at my friends.. ignore them...or get close to them ... whatever I like...\n\nServices is friendly, efficient and personal...........\n\nWhat a great evening!! I am ready to come back to Grand Electric again... Text me whenever?!!!
