Potato Corner is a chain that specializes in seasoned french fries. It's a popular concept in Asia. To order you first have to choose your size (go BIG or go home!). Then you can choose your type of fries-- tots, regular fries, curly fries, chips, etc.  Finally, you choose your seasonings. My favorite combination is the sour cream seasoning on the curly fries but on my last visit the guy who took my order suggested mixing BBQ and the sour cream together. Didn't even know I could mix the two, so that was a game changer! \n\nThey also sell chicken tenders and wings, but I would pass on both. The wings were super tiny and it wasn't worth the calories. I would save the stomach space for more fries!\n\nA combo with regular sized fries & a drink will cost you around $5. I would suggest you check out the Yelp deal or the Groupon before you get your potato fix on. It's the perfect savory, mall snack for when you take a break from your retail therapy.
