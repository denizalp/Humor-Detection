Move aside all you Thai restaurants that aren't actually Thai! \n\nThis place is the BOMB! There is just no other way to put it, my friend recommended we try it out one evening because she looooves it and hence we made our way there on a Friday night. We had reservations and we seated sharp at 8. So here goes;\n\nShrimp Rolls: I know.. how good could these possibly taste? Damn good is the answer. The coating was fresh and didn't taste like sawdust that you find at most other restaurants. \n\nPapaya Salad: To die for.. so fresh and refreshing! I was so upset I didnt' know of this place in the summer.\n\nChicken Satay: I'm not that big a fan of it but Mr. H is, it was soft and delicious.\n\nPanang Curry with Fish: OMG! I wanted to shove my face in it! My friend described it best, she said \"You can taste every ingredient in it! You can just tell it was made from scratch.\" Amen!\n\nMassaman Curry: Equally good, a little on the sweeter side though because of the sweet potato.\n\nPAD THAI: I hate Pad Thai! I can't stand it. It tastes weird, dry and clumpy and makes me feel bloated after. THIS PLACE HOWEVER HAS THE BEST PAD THAI EVER!!!!! Fun fact: Did you know Pad Thai is not supposed to be red in colour? It's supposed to be made in tamarind sauce! This place gets it right! They have converted me into a Pad Thai lover! \n\nI also tried their Tamarind Sour drink and loved it! \n\nI can't wait to go back there! The food takes a little while but I don't mind if it tastes that good! The service is also great.
