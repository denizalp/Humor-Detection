Today was a special occasion so we naturally wanted to come to one of the best breakfast restaurants we love. On a Friday around 10:30 am, there was no wait and we got a table right away. I was super hungry and asked for vegetarian suggestions. The waitress Laryssa was very helpful and made several great suggestions. I finally decided on the elevated egg sandwich which comes with a fresh over easy cage free egg, Gruyere cheese, avocado , mayo on a Brioche bun. Served with fresh seasoned potatoes. With a pot of coffee! So delicious and filling, I had to take half to go.
