Located inside the Galleria Mall -- lower level, next to Dillards.\n\nBig store but not enough choices.\nThe sizes on display or on the racks are the only sizes they carry, everything else must be ordered online and can be shipped to their store (min time of 2 weeks for arrival) OR to your home (which can take longer).\n\nLots of different colors, some different styles, and from the looks of it -- they do have kids clothes for most formal occasions. \n\nThey also have other locations in Chinatown (Valley View and Spring Mountain) and Maryland Pkwy and Desert Inn.
