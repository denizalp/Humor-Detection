After being a loyal customer to this location and a UPS My Choice customer, I was extremely disappointed in their policy over a mishandled package. I attempted to send a birthday present to my father in Atlanta and after it did not arrive in time, it show up back at our house in Charlotte. I was told that their policy is to resend it or to receive a credit and I could send it through another provider. It may seem extreme to complain, when I could just resend it for free, but when a company fails to perform their primary service, I feel that they should make things right with the customer. This means going beyond offering the same service you failed to perform in the first place. Having lost faith that this location can perform a core competency and their questionable customer service, for the foreseeable future, I will be taking my business elsewhere and canceling my UPS account.
