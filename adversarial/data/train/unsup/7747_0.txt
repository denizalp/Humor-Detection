When you have starving children and they refuse to eat the PB&J...you know your PB&J is messed up! When the kids refuse to eat the sugar free whipped cream it really upsets the kids because they had expectations. At least have the courtesy to warn the parents or offer the sloppy sticky drizzle on the side and to leave the nasty cream in the kitchen. \n\nP.S. Four napkins won't cut it in that situation either.
