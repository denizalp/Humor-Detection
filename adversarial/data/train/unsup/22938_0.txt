We watch a middle aged fellow wearing a tank top, sandals, and headphones dance by while we eat our early morning complimentary breakfast on the veranda. Unsure whether he's delighted or touched in the head, staring becomes potential rude, so we focus on the adorable sight of the old small dog lying on its stomach with its back legs splayed behind it a few tables over. It's the morning that we head into the red, slanted unknown of Southern Utah and Western Arizona, but not before concluding our pleasant stay at this historic hotel. Our room is plain, white with a nice old photograph of the city during the dam's construction, or maybe it's of the dam's construction itself, I can only recall that it was old and a nice change from the bad watercolor landscape prints that line the walls of even the more expensive, urbane hotels that I frequent for work. The room is hardly worth mentioning, with its sausage-shaped air-con that I've previously only seen in China (it bathes the bed in a constant blue light, so I grope blindly at 3:00 AM for the remote to turn it off), except to note that we did not stay in the Art Deco room, which the unbearably polite little boy stalling going upstairs to his room where he will be forced to take a bath tells us, whispered, makes it the \"best hotel ever.\" I did not see it myself, but I'm told that its commitment to Art Deconess goes beyond window dressing, even informing the choice of television (I imagine a black oval with a square, dim CRT imbedded inside, two large antennae protruding from the top).\n\nBreakfast was surprisingly good. I highly recommend the omelet with bacon, sausage, and green chile (those are Hatch chiles, which I didn't know made it so far West). The pancakes were also excellent. (While this goes a bit beyond the confines of the hotel's review, I would be remiss not to mention that the restaurant down the street makes a truly fantastic steak).\n\nFinally, I'll note that teens run free in the streets of historic Boulder City and they are sassy, so prepare you snappy comebacks.
