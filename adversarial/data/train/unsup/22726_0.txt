I will wear my glasses till I can no longer glue them back together. I dread picking out new glasses because of all the available choices and am never sure what looks good on me. It takes me years before I decide to get new glasses. An amazing Groupon and a high Yelp rating led me here.\n\nYou may have difficulty finding this place because of lack of signage but your efforts will surely be rewarded. As you enter the plaza (it's in the same plaza as Tim Horton's) look to your left and look for unit 222.\n\nLarge store with lots of choices, a comfy couch for those who have to wait for the shopper to make up their minds, and lovely staff who are patient and accommodating.\n\nNicole was such a great helper. She ask what I was looking for, notified me of all their sales, went over all the available options and prices, discussed the most cost efficient package for my situation, and gave me pointers on what to look out for when choosing glasses. She was patient and never pushy. I decided on a stylish pair of designer glasses that fit into my budget. The experience was quick and painless and rather pleasant due to Nicole's professionalism and warm personality. \n\nI would definitely come back and recommend this place to all my friends.\n\nTIPS:\n- Bring someone along who has good fashion sense to help you pick out your glasses.\n- Take pictures of you wearing the glasses instead of completely relying on the mirrors, believe me, it does make a difference.\n- Communicate with the salesperson on your likes, wants, limitations and needs.
