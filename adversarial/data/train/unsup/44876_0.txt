A bunch of lies. Seriously I am surprised no one has sued them yet. First when they say 50% off they are talking about full price tickets in the best row vs the tickets they sell in the worst rows. They tell you close to the stage what they fail to tell you is you are in the back of the theater. They have very high service fees and do not offer a seating chart. If you want to compare apples to apples the seats I got were actually less than 2% cheaper than the box office
