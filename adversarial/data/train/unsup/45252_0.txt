Been wanting to try this place for awhile due to their glam photos of their food online, totally IG worthy food photos. Tonight, they only had a few patrons at dinner which worked out good for the group I was with as the restaurant is small. High top tables - chairs are super uncomfortable, we all thought so, sit in booth if you go. Food was good. Wings were flavorful and hot, ranch was watered down. Shrimp burger was plentiful but the fried shrimp could have been seasoned more. Lightly fried, big shrimp. Fries were good and looked hand cut. Friend got scallops and enjoyed them - plated nicely. Other friend got burger medium well and it was too well done, not med well but thats understandable, should get it medium. Will come back, but want to try their brunch.
