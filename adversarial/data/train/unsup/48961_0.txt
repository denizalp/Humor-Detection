This place is so awesome! We had a great time here although it's a little embarrassing when you're not a golfer and are sitting next to a bay of golfers.but who cares right? Great place for all ages. You have to pay$5 for a registration card which I find odd, but it's supposed to be lifetime so I guess it's fine. Then you pay per hour. Make sure you tell them if you're not ready to start your time or else valuable $$$ will be wasted! You get your own private bay with a tv and either high chairs or couches to accommodate your group. Food and drinks is a la carte so your night of posh driving range can add up really quickly. The games they offer are fun but I still don't know how it tracks my specific ball when I hit it in the range. Technology is amazing! Everything we ordered was delicious although they ran out of a lot of food. No chicken and waffles, no crab cakes and no calamari. Bummer since I wanted to try all 3! The sign says Purell is located everywhere but I didn't see any and considering I'm a germaphobe, I would suggest having one at every bay. Lastly, they are pet friendly! You're forced to be on the first floor unless you're a service dog and then you can be anywhere. Will definitely be back!
