It's a good deal to be a kid; you get a new wardrobe at least once a year. I'd love that for myself. Unless, of course, the proviso is that you have to move up a size each year. \nNeedless to say, we buy loads of clothes for our kiddlets. I like having them dressed well but I also don't like paying too much. My solution? Outlet shopping! \nAh, Arizona Mills. . . . it really is a love\/hate relationship between us, isn't it? On the one hand, I could go there and get everything for the kids. Old Navy, Children's Place and Skechers outlets just to name a few. Yes, please! On the other hand, I hate that it is ALWAYS crowded. Coming here makes me somewhat understand those people that get in fights on Black Friday. I'm always on the verge of punching someone. Not to get to an item but out of sheer frustration. I also hate the whole walking around in a circle thing. I feel like I can't stop because I'll get poked by a cattle prod. \nIt really comes down to good prices vs. horrible crowds. Well, as a parent, one has to make many sacrifices. I suppose tolerating the masses isn't so bad after all. \n\n\nI must thank the Hermit crab guy for not giving me crabs this time. (That sounds wrong, huh?) I mean that they always used to try to  place one of those tiny crustacean monsters on my hand to make me look like a total idiot.  Not this time. Thanks. Painted shell or not, I can't stand those things.\n\nAs for you, Arizona Mills, I've had enough of you for a while. See you at around holiday time.
