Raffles Cafe\n\nRaffles Cafe serves the typical American type food here in the Mandalay Bay Hotel.  Yes, I've read the many reviews prior to eating here.  Reviews has it's up's and down's.....I was tired......I was hungry.....It was 4am...I had to be at the airport at 7am....most of the restaurants are closed here....Raffles Cafe was open 24 hours and I could have anything on the menu from Breakfast to Lunch to Dinner choices.....and I didn't want to count on eating airport food.\n\nSo as I entered the establishment and was seated with a menu.  Being so tired I just asked my waiter for some Orange Juice to start me off.  I couldn't figure out what to eat after reading various reviews.  So, I asked the waiter \"What is the Best Dish He's had here\".  And he recommended the Eyecandy Club Sandwich.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/9wxxjUKdaiWeK0fGxSYhzQ?select=5tWA-9y49U9cGTJK3uDCPw\n\nThe Eyecandy Sandwich is a Roast Beef, Turkey, Bacon and Cheese Sandwich on a toasted bread.  Comes with Fries.  \n\nWhen the sandwich had arrived.....WOW!!!  This sandwich must have been stacked a mile high (2  inches of meat)\n \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/9wxxjUKdaiWeK0fGxSYhzQ?select=RmljX-zWh_UzSnd_GVIVGQ\n\nI was glad......but now I was trying to figure out how to take the first bite.  OMG!!  Let me see if my mouth will open up this big for the first bite.  I'll smash my sandwich as much I could before taking the first bite.  Ahhh....OK....First Bite....The Roast Beef....umm......not bad....the beef is fresh ....the turkey....not bad, not too dry....ok...the sandwich was good.  Next the fries....Nah....McDonalds is better.  One or two sticks of the fries is all I could handle.....Just something about the fries that was a big turn off.  Too crunchy....too oily....felt as if it would upset my stomach....so I stayed away from the fries.  I had my freshly squeezed Orange Juice to keep me happy.\n\nOverall experience was a 3 star.\nEyecandy Sandwich was a 4 star.\nFries was a 2 star.\nOrange Juice was 4 star\nGlad this place was open 24 hours.\n\n$20.00 later....this is my last resort restaurant if all else is closed.
