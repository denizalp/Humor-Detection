Best nail salon in the Pittsburgh area! I have had the hardest time finding a good nail place since I moved to Pittsburgh and went to M Nails the past several times and I love it there! It is super clean and relaxing inside. The employees are very friendly and good at what they do. Both Lisa and Johnny have done my nails and they both were excellent. I've had a gel manicure, regular manicure and pedicures and have not had one bad experience with any of these services. Highly recommend!!
