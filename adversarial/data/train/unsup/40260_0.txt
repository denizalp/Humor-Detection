Me and my husband stopped in for lunch the other day for the first time and really enjoyed it!! Our waitress was super nice and provided great service. We got the pretzel bites as an appetizer and they were awesome. We both got burgers for lunch- my husband got the black n blue burger with tater tots, and I got the PCP burger (pimento cheese and fried pickles) with fries. The burgers were big and very tasty! We could only eat half because so much food. We will definitely go back!
