First visit to this establishment, so much for them to improve on.\n\nFor a Mexican theme, chips were horrible and guacamole was sub standard. The beer selection is a joke. We ordered the spring rolls because they were the only item on the menu that didn't have meat or cheese, and when they arrived they had chicken and cheese in them. The food selection was basic and not some place that I would ever go back for food. \n\nSomeone had the bright idea to make the female servers wear tank tops that most of them did not look attractive in and the male servers oversized tee shirts, not sure what male decided of that dress code. \n\nOur waitress was very pleasant however and all of the shortcomings of this place had nothing to do with her.\n\nWas hoping for a nice watering hole, but this place severely misses the mark. Be surprised if it lasts 6 months.\n\nAnd what is blatantly obvious is the employees or friends of the owners that are giving this place 5 stars, don't be fooled.
