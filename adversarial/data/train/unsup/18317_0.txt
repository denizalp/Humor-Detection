They had improved a bit after they had been open for a while, not great but worth the cheap cost.  We went back today about a month after our last visit, and they have gone down the tubes.  The sushi was horrid (I have never seen fish cut so thin!), the roast beef was cooked to shoe leather, the grill was gone, the soup was watery, the egg rolls were tough and leathery, and there was no dim sum or dumplings at all.  I had a hard time finding anything that was edible.  Even what passed for desserts was awful.  We will not be back again.  I was shocked how busy they were, but I guess the price will bring people in regardless of how horrible the food is.
