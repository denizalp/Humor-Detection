I'll have 10 wings and ....Bread Sticks... (What the ....)\n\nOK so my nearest Buffalo's Southwest Cafe closed down last week which offered a good selection of 49 Cent wings on Tuesdays..... so I decided to give these guys a try tonight, after-all it is new business, so why not just see what this place is about. \n\nUpon entering this very small business, we were greeted by a nice gentleman who asked if we were in for the first time, we stated yes, and he explained the menu choices......OK they serve chicken, chicken, and chicken. To be more specific they serve chicken. We chose the chicken.\n\nI noticed the seating area contained two TV's not an extensive selection of sports to choose from as they advertised, but at least two and a half men was on so I felt I was \"WINNING\".\n\nThe tea dispenser was unusual, as it contained sweet and un-sweet tea.  You push a button to select your choice, however the teas tasted of an instant type of concentrated tea, which was not  good at all.  Off to the nice Coca-Cola fountain drink machine located beside it.  The ice was cold, fresh and when added to the Coca-Cola it was very refreshing.\n\nThe meals we chose were: Chicken Tenders, and the Chicken Wings ( I have added a picture of both meals) I was unfamiliar with Garlic bread sticks with the chicken wings, but they were hot, fresh, and drenched in butter.  They were good, but again, with chicken wings? \n\nIt would be nice if they had a wider menu selection, beside chicken, however it is nothin' but FRICK\"N Chicken.\n\nI wish these folks well in the chicken business, but because of the limited menu items, and the oddity of the bread-sticks, the prices are too high to maintain a viable business........prove me wrong, but I assure you, this place will be gone by December 2011. \n\nNCFoodGuy
