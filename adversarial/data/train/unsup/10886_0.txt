I am not going to say much about this place because the only thing I really liked about it were the light fixtures.\n\nI tried the Crystal Chicken. Bland.\n\nI tried the Crispy Sring rolls. Overcooked.\n\nThe only thing that was yummy was the #51.. and I have no idea what it was called but my friend got it and I tried it and it was pretty alright.\n\nThey have a koi pond inside right when you walk in, but I was disturbed at the size of the fish in that little pool.. Definitely not enough room, and I'm thinking this might be a violation, and i'm looking into it. I may eat fish, but I don't believe the living ones should be confined like that.. I certainly don't like elevators, do you?
