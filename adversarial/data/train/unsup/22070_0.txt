Um yeah. I'd bet hands down that every other Asian would call this place out for what it is: Manchu Wok with chairs. The food is over-salted, drenched in oil, and the waving cat in the window looks like he could use a tune up. Poor waving cat. \n\nThe only reason this thing is still in business is because it's the only Chinese restaurant within a 2-foot radius of Spadina and Queen. But if we all shift our gaze 2 metres to the north of us, we'll find a magic dining palace called \"China Town\". As the name implies, you will find ample dining options that serve some of the same things on Steamy's menu... but this time, it'll be edible.
