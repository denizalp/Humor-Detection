I don't know about the rooms but the staff definitely was extremely rude. I had booked a room for 3 days for the graduation weekend and wanted to cancel it as I found another accommodation for my friends. I understand the cancellation policy states we can cancel it 14 days prior to the check-in but I had booked the room itself 4 days before the check in. Since I was charged I had called the hotel to see if they could do something about it, instead of helping me, the staff and the manager at that time was extremely rude and started yelling at me asking me why I had booked the room in the first place when I wanted to cancel it anyway. I did not expect to get the money refunded but I certainly did not expect such rude remarks. After a point, the manager started raising his voice and did not let me speak. I certainly hope the staff would show a little respect to people who are just asking them queries and want to know more about the hotel's policies.
