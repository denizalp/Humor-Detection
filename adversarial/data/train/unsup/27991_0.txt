We went twice, first time the service was crappy but the pulled pork Philly was good enough to warrant ten bucks. The second time the service was amazing but the chili mac was a travesty. Is it a thing now that all mac and cheese is now nacho cheese sauce on some noodles? Neat little place, I hope next time the food and service match up and it's good.
