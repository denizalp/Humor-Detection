Brickworks cider house is right at Queen and Broadview. It is a black building with a small sign, I missed it the first time I walked by it. The servers were friendly, the place is nice and spacious and sunny. I prefer the upstairs area it is quiter and you can have a conversation.\nThe ciders were good! I thought I didn't like cider until I tried the cherry cider and mint basil cider.\nI still prefer beer, but the cider is worth a try even if you arent a fan.\nThe food was okay. I came here with a large group on Sunday and four of us got the eggs benedict.\nOnly my one egg wasn't overdone. All the rest had hard yolks.\nThe eggs benny came with pork belly and hollandaise sauce with sriracha.\nIn theory, it sounded dope, in reality, the sriracha really took away from the hollandaise sauce and I didn't care for it very much.\nThat being said, the rest of my food was yummy. I would visit here again with friends.
