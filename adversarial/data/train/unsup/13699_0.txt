Totally cool hangout! I found this place when I was out jogging around Tempe Town Lake. It's a quaint little house with a really cool patio. They have about six beers that they brew and another six to eight beers that they bring in. There's a food truck parked on site, I ordered the street tacos. \nI love the inside as much as the outside. There are plenty of tables, high tops, low tops and  bar seating.  This place has a cool vibe. Staff is friendly. They were more than happy to give samples of their brews with no charge. That, in my opinion, is good business.\nI will definitely be back for another visit .....soon! \nLoved it!
