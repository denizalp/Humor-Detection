Oh Pita Jungle, how I love you so. I first was brought here by my mother upon my return to Phoenix for a healthy lunch. The place is very busy but adequately priced.\nI am a huge fan of the greek salad and if you just want a light lunch, get a small. The falafel platter is delicious, as well as the spinach four-cheese quesadilla. \nI've never had a problem with the service, my water is always promptly refilled and yes, they are short, but I would be too if the place was as busy as it is during lunch. \nArt adorns the walls and I'm a fan of that huge mirror [sneaky people-watching!] on the back wall. \nI would recommend this place to anyone, it really is my favourite spot for lunch.
