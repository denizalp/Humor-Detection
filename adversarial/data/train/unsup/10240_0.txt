So my friend and I were walking around Baldwin Village - and you know when you get to the point where it's like \"Man, I've been to every single restaurant here... okay, time to re-try something?\"  Yeah - so that was me yesterday.\n\nLast time I went to Matahari Grill was literally three years ago.  The first time I went, it really detered me due to the service.  So I decided to give it one more try just to see how it goes.\n\nThe ambiance in this place is nice.  Small and chic.  Giant writing with a quote that makes me smile.  My friend ordered the Mee Goreng, and I had the Nasi Lemak.  My friend couldn't finish her Mee Goreng (but then again, she's a tiny little Asian girl, so I wasn't surprised).  The Nasi Lemak was great considering that it was coconut rice, with shrimp, dried anchovies, achar-char and egg (a little bti of everything).  It wasn't too spicy, and I was able to finish a great portion of the dish.\n\nThe service though was questionable.  I know I can't say that they have poor service due tot their accents; however, I was not impressed by their quick service here and there.  While my friend was trying to decide between two items (for less than a minute), the waiter walked away. Not only this, when we were paying, we wanted to give them a $100 bill, and he asked if we had credit cards, since they didn't have cash on hand.  I found that a little bit strange, but in the end, we pushed them to give us our change in cash.\n\nOverall, food was really good - but service was very very poor.  If you want great Malaysian food with great service, head to Restoran Malay up north.  It's much better.
