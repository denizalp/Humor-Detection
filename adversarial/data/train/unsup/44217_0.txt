This PM franchise is owned by a nice couple from Oregon, and they clearly care about their customers.  When the wife is working, this place is the friendliest joint in town.  I have zero complaints about the service here when she's working.  (And the pizza is pretty darn good, too.)\n\nHer team of young ladies, however, can sometimes be a little more detached.  It's great that they're helpful, but they are inconsistent with the \"Take 'N' Bake Club\" stamps (their rewards program for repeat purchases), and I have been shorted my proper stamps several times.  Mentioning this to the owner yielded no empathy, so points off for that.  I deserve my recognition for coming back and buying more pizza, thank you.\n\nTheir freshness is the key here, and what makes this chain of pizza purveyors different seems to be the quality of the ingredients.  Love the rich, robust sauce, the cheese (which is NOT greasy - yay!), and the fresh mushrooms.  Food for thought: Canned mushrooms are a punishment for those people willing to settle for crap pizza.  And we enjoy the \"de-lite\" selections of thin-crust pizzas when we need to dial back the carb intake.\n\nAs a side note, the other poster, Katherine, obviously didn't know about the Thunderbird or Union Hills locations (run by different owners), but Papa Murphy's' has been around for awhile now.  \n\nBottom line: The pizza is very good, but come during the day when the owners are there.  It's a better experience.
