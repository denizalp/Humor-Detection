What a refreshingly clean and cool udon and takoyaki restaurant. I liked the 4 apy. special so I could try some new flavors. \n\nThe whole squid was soft with enough chew. Too spicy for Mr. Bland. The udon also had a satisfying chew and light shoyu broth. The salmon poke bowl in combo set was a nice size. They do leave the salmon skin on the poke pieces, but were not discernable in my nommings.\n\nFriendly staff, lots of young Asian clientele and lots of parking in this plaza.
