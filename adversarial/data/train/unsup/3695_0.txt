Really good foodie-food type catering :-)\n\nI was lucky enough to try Chef Michael's food for free at a festival, and even though it was prepared in the desert with a very minimalist setup...it was out of this world! \n\nWe tried a bunch of different stuff from pasta salad to various veggies, and it was all high quality and flavorful. If I ever need to cater an event, I will definitely kick these guys some business....the quality and flavors were LEGIT!
