Not a native Mississaugan (is that a word? It is now!), but I stumbled upon this place by accident while visiting shoppers drug mart close-by.\n\nGenerally, I'd rate this as a 3.5 star place, not quite enough to push it to 4 stars.\n\nI had their equivalent of a happy hour combo ($9.99), which is great value for money if you are a small eater or just grazing (see pic but disregard the popcorn). \n\nYou get a small pork on rice with a choice of snack ( I chose salt\/pepper chicken) and a small drink  (I chose honey green tea). \n\nThe rice bowl was tasty (meat was a bit fatty), albeit garlicky, so you might want to consider having mints\/gum handy. The nuggets were a tad bland for my liking, but passable. The green tea was actually done just the way I wanted it, half sweet\/less ice. Arguably the best part of the combo :)\n\nBack to the popcorn - free appy to munch on while waiting for food.  What a nice touch!\n\nI have nothing bad to say about the ambiance or service: friendly staff, industrial-ish decor (wood\/steel), free WiFi...\nHowever, something feels off to me. I cant pinpoint it, nor do I want to pick on it, but maybe it's the vibe. I think the combo of the industrial-ish decor and the jazzy elevator background music with English lyrics just doesn't resonate with me when I'm in a taiwanese bubble tea restaurant. Okok, first world problems, I know...but I'm missing the mando\/Canto\/jap\/korean-pop!\n\nOverall I enjoyed my meal, the space is pleasant , but wouldn't go out of my way to come back unless it's on the way.
