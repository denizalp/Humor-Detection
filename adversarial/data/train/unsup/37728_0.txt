This place is pretty yummy, we were pretty stuffed after eating here. I think I still like in n out a little better since I can get a double double, fries and shake for the cost of the smallest burger at five guys, but they definitely are better with all the free toppings. I had the little bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, and grill onions. Bf had the regular cheeseburger (2 meat patties) with everything and green bell peppers. I'm not really sure why they flatten the meat when they grill it, maybe to cook it faster or fit the humongous bun?  We shared cajun style fries which were tasty--i think it's just seasoned salt on top. The soda machine is pretty awesome, never had to use a touch screen to get a drink before. Fancy stuff. I liked the free peanuts while we waited :)
