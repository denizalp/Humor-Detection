I said yeah, I said yeah, I said yeah \nWooooo!\nHow come you don't taste no good?\n\nBakery? HAH!  \n\nLook - I met someone there and was compelled to consume a third of a cup of an acrid brown liquid alleged to be coffee.  Subway does a better job with SBC than this satanic majesties bequest. \n\nThey must be environmentally conscious as I am quite certain that they re-use coffee grounds from other places and the \"muffin\" contained at least 50% post-consumer content.  Not sure if that was recycled phone books, newspapers, or...\n\nThis is an excellent of why it is essential to consult Yelp BEFORE you agree to meet someone at an unknown establishment.
