We went here while we were in Vegas because we had seen it on Bar Rescue. We were literally the only people in the whole place. The atmosphere and decor was awesome - there was a lot of potential for it to be something cool. \n\nThe waitress took forever to come over to us and ask for our drink orders and then it took I'd say almost 15-20 minutes to get the drinks. The bar was behind us, we could SEE the bar, and probably could have walked over and made them faster ourselves. The drinks sat there, made, for a while before she even grabbed them and brought them over. \n\nThen we ordered our food and waited about an hour, and the food hadn't shown up yet. We had somewhere to be, so we just said nevermind and cancelled our food order. Of course she didn't come over to check on us, so we had to walk over to the kitchen \/ bar area and ask to have our food cancelled, when she told us it was \"on it's way out\". We told her to forget it, and we left. \n\nWhat a disappointing place. I've never had such terrible service ANYWHERE, let alone a place where we were the only customers. I don't recommend it to anyone and I'll never go back.
