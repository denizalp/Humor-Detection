I'm not a club kinda girl, but I find myself at Jackrabbit when I find myself in Downtown Scottsdale.  I was introduced to it by a friend who's a regular and so I have always had a good time.  \n\nPro's:  \n-Burlesque dancers who can actually dance.  No cheesy go-go dancers in big furry boots and boy-shorts, these girls have moves.  I recently saw a belly dancer perform before a fashion show and she was incredible!  I get bored easily, so just when I don't feel like dancing anymore the music switches to live musicians and some girls come out to entertain.    \n-The patio, especially in the winter.  Good place to lounge and cool off. \n-The music is pretty good too. \n\nCon's:  \n-It gets pretty sweaty in there!  \n-Not enough places to sit down unless you have a VIP booth. \n-Expensive drinks, but that is to be expected.  I don't really understand complaining about the drink prices, it's no more expensive than similar places in the area and better priced than my favorite place in LA.  It's a necessary evil.\n\nBottom line: \nI like this place far better than other clubs in Scottsdale, but give me some vodka and I can pretty much have fun anywhere!
