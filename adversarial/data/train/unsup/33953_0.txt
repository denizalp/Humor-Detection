Super in love with this place! The staff is super friendly and inviting. I will be getting all my waxing needs here from now on. \n\nI needed a last minute appointment & they were able to accommodate me 30 minutes after I gave them a call. \n\nWhen I first walked in, I was greeted by Mayeli. She seemed like a genuinely nice person & was very helpful. \n\nI got my wax from Shaina. She is pretty amazing. She had some entertaining stories to tell to distract the pain. She told me how she's a perfectionist, which I love because I am one myself. \n\nI will definitely be coming here again. Service and product is amazing.  Overall a wonderful experience!
