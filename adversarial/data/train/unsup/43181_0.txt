So you've just found yourself looking for a hardware store. Quick, Home Depot, Lowe's, or Ace Hardware. That's basically your options in Gilbert. \n\nYou can find most anything you need at Ace Hardware, and it's a locally owned business. So that alone should steer you here. I've priced checked multiple times for a number of items between Ace and the Lowe's on Gilbert\/Warner. Ace Hardware either comes out equal or just a tad bit more expensive. \n\nSo why shop here if it's a bit more expensive? The service. That's why your on Yelp right? When you ask them a question at Ace, they will know the answer, or find someone who can. This place has saved me a bunch of time and money by not buying the wrong part, or wrong tool, or having to drive back 3 more times to buy the right thing. When it's 7:30 pm at night, the sun is fading and you just want to shower up and eat dinner, that will be important. \n\nSo you can go to your big box hardware store, but who really needs extension cords in 8 colors, when you can buy the one you need and be in and out. I've always found whatever I'm looking for. \n\nProtip: Sign up for their reward program. I've gotten about $20+ in the last 2 years just from normal everyday purchases. Also, don't forget to check in!! They always have a $5 off of $25 purchase. Makes me spend more but I'll stock up on air filters.
