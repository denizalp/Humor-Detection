What a fun place! The whole new Portage Crossing is a yuppie paradise but the food is pretty tasty here I'll give it that. It's nice to be able to get a beer with your burger. They have a lot of options for meatatarians as well as veggie lovers. They also have a nice (albeit hot) patio for people watching.
