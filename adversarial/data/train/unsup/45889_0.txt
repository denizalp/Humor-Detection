Food was good. Service was awful. Environment was blah. I really hope they work out the kinks in the service. Too much running, literally, by staff and still slow service. When drinks came we immediately ordered appetizers so not to lose our waitress' attention. When she came back to take our orders 15 min. later, I asked if the appetizers were up yet and she told us she hadn't put the appetizer order in yet. So much for trying to get things moving by ordering expediently. Eventually one of the two appetizers came out another 15 min or so later. The next table seated after us received the other appetizer we ordered. When asked, another waiter brought out our order slip from the kitchen to show us we didn't order the second appetizer. I told him we did but it apparently did not get placed by our server. He offered to put it in and he said it would only take a couple of minutes. Given the delay in getting our order in and waiting time for the food so far, i just asked that they bring out our entrees without any further delay, assuming those orders were placed. Food was good but just took too much time and chaos to finally get it. \n\nMy family suggested we consider the place for take out only next time.
