No shirtzsky. No shoezskys. No Schlotzsky's. This location didn't have that sign but I remember that from other times I've been to Schlotzsky's. Always thought that was funny. I do remember when this building used to house some mom n pop breakfast kind of place. Never ate there when it was a breakfast place though. I've been to this Schlotzsky's for lunch, though, over the years whenever I was in this neighborhood for various services - there's a Discount Tire right next door for example. This is the perfect place to bide your time while waiting. This last time I opted for a medium Angus Roast Beef & Cheese sandwich. Pretty much just a regular fast food sammich, right? But the tasty Sourdough buns made me remember why I stopped here and didn't keep going further down the street. Also had the macaroni salad which was alright but otherwise not that memorable. You need the code to get into the bathrooms - I suppose to keep non-customers from loitering and just coming in to use the bathroom. That said, bathrooms were pretty clean. Lots of parking in this mall.
