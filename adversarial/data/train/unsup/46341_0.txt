This place is absolutely amazing starting with the shop itself everything is super clean and organized you feel instantly comfortable and that's before you even talk to anyone not only is the atmosphere great the people are just as fantastic I felt super relaxed everything was explained to me and all my concerns were addressed I did not feel rushed what so ever I got my nipples pierced here it was my second time and I was concerned with my scar tissue that it may cause a problem so before I even paid I was looked at before so both I and the piercer (ana) where comfortable that my piercings would heal and be okay I would definitely come back if I decided I wanted another piercing I love it here! Thank y'all so much for a great experience!
