Not was I was hoping for.  Tried the pulled pork sandwich,  rib tips,  and potato salad.  Everything was swimming  in an overly sweet sauce.  Pulled pork was soggy and I couldn't even tell if it had a smokey flavor because of the sauce. I won't comment too much on the rib tips because I'd never had rib  tips before,  so not much to compare it to. I will say that they were basically in sauce soup. Potato salad was tasty but nothing special  really  (not that it has to be). \n\nMy biggest qualm was the rudeness of the woman working the counter.  If you can manage a fake smile you shouldn't be in a customer service job. I literally sat at the counter and just started at her waiting for her to acknowledge me verbally, rather than just starting impatiently at me. The guy who ran the food was nice, but that lady is a nightmare of a person.
