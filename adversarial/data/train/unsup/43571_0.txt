my gf and i come here pretty often since we live down the street. normally love it here. the young man in the black and red pj outfit has amazing customer service each time we come. but today we got served by the older lady in pink pjs and she just wasn't as friendly, don't know if she got annoyed because we switched up our orders a few times but sheesh that's just how it is when you work in the food industry. anyways, i think you guys should fix your policy on how if we don't get meat\/protein you should substitute it for something else. Ex: we got the salmon and bacon bagel, we don't eat meat so we asked to substitute more salmon if we don't get bacon. She said we couldn't do that. I asked if we could sub for avocado instead and she said that's not an option either, we would have to get it on the side for an extra cost. Most food places offer substitutes if you don't eat meat. I work in the food industry and we don't charge extra for replacing meat with avocado? :-)
