This whole area where The Nest is located is just awesome. Its themed as a creative old cowboy ghost kinda town... ( that's Jessica lingo so if you don't get it basically im just saying its very cool). muawhahaha i HEART haunted houses and just anything scary in general. I believe it was $25 a person. you could pay VIP as well to get thru the line quicker if you wish. there was a stop on the long walk to the actual Nest. On this walk i encountered a few wonderful\/interesting things. 1) margarita shack... muy bueno! 2) this attraction called The Thing. We paid a dolla to see it...i still am pondering to this day if it was real or not, but i hope my dolla gets put to good use.3) piglets! i know totally not part of the whole being scared thing i was going for but hey, im a girl who is a sucker for anything small and cute. \n\nThe Nest is a great haunted house. VERY ORGANIZED and put together very well. You can tell this attraction is something they take seriously and i can appreciate it. Totally absolutely positively recommend!
