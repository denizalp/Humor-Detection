Waited five minutes at the doorway to be seated. Majority of staff was huddled together and it appeared the only person who could seat us was busy trying to ring a ticket. I was hoping this was not an indication of things to come. Once seated the waitress was pleasant and prompt on things under her control. Placed and order for  for lasagna and had to wait 45 minutes.  While the portion was huge, the service was incredibility slow. During our wait we watched how slow the food orders arrived at the other tables. Slow orders would be understandable if the restaurant was full, but patrons at four tables hardly constitutes a full restaurant. Would I return? Possibly if the service was faster.
