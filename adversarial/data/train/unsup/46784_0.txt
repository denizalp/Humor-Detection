This place to me is not all that great dim sum I've had better. The only thing that is good here is the walnut shrimp and the portions is great enough for a family of 5. \n\nThe time I came it didn't seem like the dim sum carts wanted to go to the other side of the restaurant. When you asked what it was in the cart the cart lady  had a hard time speaking english. Which was a boo for them.  How can you serve someone when you can't even tell them what it is.  Service is whack... can't get water or the check. FAIL.. \n\nSo thank you for the yummie walnut shrimp but no thank you for not giving me my check when I asked for it 3 times.
