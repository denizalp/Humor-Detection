It's funny, sometimes when you find yourself whining and bitching like a little baby, it seems so appropriate at the time, then some time after, you really feel like a freaking idiot.\n\nMy assistant booked a stay here for business, and did it on Hotwire.  In general, when booking a 5-star Hotel using their service I'm usually fine with her doing it and don't care.  In this case, I was livid.  A Hotel with no casino in Vegas?  Blasphemy.  A Hotel not directly on the strip?  Well my God I might as well have booked in LA and driven to the strip.  A Hotel with no club?  Impossible.\n\nIn fact I was so pissed I got on the phone with them and, \"blah blah blah, I'll never use your service again, you are the worst thing to happen to humanity, etc, etc; insert some tears and expletives; blah blah blah\".......and still stuck there.\n\nThen post stay, revert back to paragraph 1.  Not the first time nor the last I've made a horses a*s out of my self and then had to admit it later in my own mind.\n\nI absolutely loved the Hotel.  The rooms are modern and gorgeous.  The pool and spa areas are excellent.  And ultimately not having a Casino there when you are Zombie walking back to your room is not only refreshing, but probably saved me more money than I care to admit in not wasting money at tables in a state where you have no business even being awake.  No smoke, no noise, no nonsense.  No getting sucked back in for multiple more cocktails you don't need.  It's like an island respite in the middle of the madness, which was just really, really refreshing.\n\nAnd my concern of it being in \"Antarctica\"?  Its a 2 second walk from Aria.  Also getting cabs\/transpo out was a breeze, as you don't have a million wastoids in line from the casino.\n\nI would definitely stay again.
