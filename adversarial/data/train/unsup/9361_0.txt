This was the worst experience ever!!! This school is very dishonest. Charged us $299 for two 3 hours driving classes plus $10 for safety class for a total of $309. My son attended the safety class and he had one class with the instructor who only spent with him less than 90 minutes and told him he is terrible and need to work on it himself and when ready call her for the second class. The instructor insulted him instead of raising his confidence. We called many times to complain and get refund since my son refused to go with her again. They only offered $34 refund out of $309 , but sent a receipt email to us for $68. They first refunded $68 to our credit card account then charged $34 so in fact only gave $34, but refuse to send a receipt for $34.
