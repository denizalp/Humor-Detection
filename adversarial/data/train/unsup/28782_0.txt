(+)\n-option of ordering at the kiosk instead of waiting in line\n\n(-)\n-dirty\n-ghetto\n-small\n-locked bathroom that you have to ask the cashier person to open. \n\nI didnt order anything but i used the bathroom, they press something from inside that unlocks it. its not very clean....\n\nmy friends ordered from the kiosk which was handy and easy, no problems getting what they wanted.\n\nsmall, only 10ish tables for 4 and 2 tables for 2.\n\nthis place is ghetto, sooooooo ghetto. unless you reeeeally want those 2 for a dollar tacos, go to in and out across the street instead (bigger, cleaner, but longer lines)\n\nwish i wouldve read these reviews beforehand, wouldve avoided this place.
