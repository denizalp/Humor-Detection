The best food is cooked in ovens and grown on vines, so it's really not that hard to look at the name of this place and say \"holy moly, I should go\". But knowing very little about this place, I'd expected another soulless, trendy spot for the yuppies. What I got was much better--a cozy old home re-purposed for stuffing your face with carbs and feeling proud of it. The hosts are warm. You seat yourself. It's like going to a friend's house.\n\nWhat I liked: The au gratin potatoes. I am used to having them a bit more crisp--a bit more cheesy as well. But with this I feel as though it's less heavy but filled with more spice. My understanding is you can enhance it even more by adding some green chili sauce, which I'd imagine is idea for cold weather. \n\nWhat I loved: The pesto flatbread is quite frankly the best I've had in this town. The dough, with its generous coat of olive oil is crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The dough is vegan, but doesn't sacrifice an iota of flavor. Also, the prices here are amazing, with many dishes costing under $15, all while competing with the valley's premier pizzerias. \n\nI want to come here for dinner. Heck, I wanna go for lunch as well. I am never ever going to get tired of this place, and I feel comfortable saying that despite a mere two visits. I know it's a bit awkward to find, but it is well worth it.
