Changed the way I feel about Thai food! Definitely spicier than expected, but really fresh veggies and loved the tofu option for all dishes! Staff was friendly, they were just out of a couple things I wanted to order. \n\nApparently they are under new management as of about a month ago, so that may influence earlier reviews. Great food for a great cost!
