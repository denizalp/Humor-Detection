This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt!  Always fresh, always funny!  Great place for a date night or family night!  Even my teenagers love it!  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly.  \n\nTo finish off the night, head down the street to \"The Sugar Bowl\" for fresh ice cream!
