Let's start with the positives: great service like great service. The sauce is really good get the combo sauce it's like smokin sauce or something like that. The more expensive seafood is fairly fresh. \n\nNow the negatives: the food was overcooked; the lobster was chewy, the shrimp was chewy. Clams were really not fresh some of them didn't even open up which means they were dead. \n\nWe did come on a Thursday at 4:30 so maybe that's why it wasn't the 4.5 star experience that everyone else gave it. But it was good some redeeming qualities but the seafood itself wasn't great it was ok.
