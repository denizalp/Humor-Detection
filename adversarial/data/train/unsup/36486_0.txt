When I walked into this place, the atmosphere of the restaurant definitely didn't strike me as a dandelion market. The restaurant is dark and has these very old style decorations. It's a cool place nonetheless. \n\nWe were seated at table with bar stools because they had quite a few large groups taking up some of the tables and this was the only option available. You can order your own or share a few to share. The portions are small so I recommend ordering about two if you're having a meal.\n\nI ordered the baked potato croquettes and grilled steak skewers and got to try some of pan seared ahi tuna, dando brussel sprouts, meatballs marinara, and sweet potato gnocchi. I enjoyed the potato croquettes and grilled steak skewers. The croquettes were fried perfectly, crispy on the outside and the potatoes insides weren't clumpy and paired well with the dip. The skewers were a lot more tender than I thought they would come out, which was great. The ahi tuna was good, but it didn't stand out to me as anything exceptional. The brussel sprouts were fine, but I think they would be better if they were crispy. They felt a bit soggy. I also thought the meatballs and gnocchi were just A-OK.\n\nOverall, food was decent, service was good, and atmosphere was unique.
