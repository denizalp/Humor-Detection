This Mid-K location is good, they have most of the Black hair care products that you would expect from this type of store. The staff is knowledgable about the selection and they don't make you feel rushed when you are wandering the aisles. Having recently moved from Chicago, this is smaller then most of the beauty supply stores that I am used to shopping in but for Phoenix this is a good as it gets.
