This is the new hot pot place in Ville Saint-Laurent! They have great varieties of FRESH food and very tasty soup base! \nI have to say, compares to other hot pot place in MTL, this place is amazing. \nThey have beef meat, lamp meat, fresh seafood and all kind of noodles. \nPrice is bit more expensive than other places but it is totally worth it.
