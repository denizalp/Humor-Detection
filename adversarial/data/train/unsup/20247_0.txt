I came here because there was a wait at another pho place down the street. I ordered pho and the broth was good. It did not leave me quenching for water after so that's a good sign. They gave me a heaping amount of meat in my order! And I asked for 2 plates of onions and they happily obliged. \n\nLots of meat & onions = winner for me. I will be back if I want pho next time I'm in Vegas.
