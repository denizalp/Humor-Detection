I tried the 1\/3 or 1\/4 lb Fatburger and I must say that I was impressed! The burger was fresh and tasty! I've never had relish on a burger so I was ready to dig in, the relish complemented the sandwich perfectly! I would recommend for people to give this joint a try if you are in the Las Vegas area!
