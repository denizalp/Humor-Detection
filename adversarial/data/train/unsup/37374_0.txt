If I could leave -1 I would. I get my hair done there by Stacey and Kelley does my facials. I love them both. The 3 of us get along like we've known each other forever. I've been wanting to bring my Therapy dog in for a while to meet them. So I thought I would bring her in with gifts for them for the Holidays. As soon as we walked in, the store manager threw us out. She said \"you can't have a dog in here\" I had her ID on my pocket and keychain and she still said \"you need to get out\". Her name is Lori. I told her it was against the law to throw anyone out with a Therapy dog. She didn't care and told me to give her  the gifts and she would give it to them. I told her \"NO WAY\". They had 2 bottles of perfume and B&BW gift cards. I was not leaving $150 with a stranger who threw us out. I told her I was taking the gifts to my hair dressers station and dropping them off. She (Lori) was screaming at me the whole time and picked up the phone like she was calling the police. My dog weighs 12.6 lbs, does not shed and is s certified Therapy Dog that visits mostly elderly people who are I'll or terminal. I was so angry on the way out, I told her in front of all of the employees and customers she just lost a $500 a month customer. I love my hair dresser but I'm not sure I can go back. Shame on Lori for doing this. I have slot if friends who shop there and my Husband was even going to shop there this year but not anymore. I'm done. What she did was against the law and I will be filing a report. Shame on her for doing this when all I wanted to do was leave gifts for two wonderful girls there.
