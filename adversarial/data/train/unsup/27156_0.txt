It's three years since my last 5-star review of House Doctor Exterminating, and I have been so happy with the yearly inspections under my warranty, as well as the fact that that house has remained termite-free, that I called them when I found evidence of termites at another property. Once again they did a thorough, professional job, both with the inspection (done by Isaac), as well as with the treatment. The price was reasonable, far below what friends tell me the \"big name\" exterminating companies have quoted them for LESS actual treatment! (Seriously -- one person said Terminix quoted him $4000!! This guy does not live in a mansion, either!) House Doctor trenched around the entire perimeter of my house, drilled holes in the concrete along the rear patio and interior garage, but first carefully checked if all locations were OK with me for drilling. I was the first appointment of the day, and the technician arrived 15 minutes early, which impressed me very much! I would strongly recommend House Doctor Exterminating: friendly, knowledgeable, service-minded, professional, and thorough... all at far less than what the other guys charge for less treatment\/service! It's a no-brainer! Go with House Doctor Exterminating... I'm really glad I did!
