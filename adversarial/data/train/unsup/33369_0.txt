Good concept however this location cannot execute properly.  First of all I ordered the \"cracker thin crust,\" at this location there is no such option although it's listed on the menu.  The novices making the pizza are just that, novices.  It seems this is their first foray into the food industry and they seem apathetic and overwhelmed.  There is no quality control and the dough is too soggy.  With better training, better staff and a tweaking of the assembly line this place could be good.  I think the overwhelmed, poorly trained staff cannot handle the volume.  Don't be fooled by the video on the website, that is not the experience or pizza you will have.
