Great for togo!\n\nWe ordered from here for our office meeting yesterday. They were very helpful over the phone. Plus they were the first place that when I call them before they open they don't give me attitude about ordering early. \"Yes I understand that you don't open for another hour, but if you could please take my order so that I can make sure it's ready in and hour and  a half I would appreciate it.\" Do I really need to explain this to people? Annoying. \n\nAnyway, I didn't need to have that convo with them at all, took my order and let me know if would be ready exactly when I wanted it, and it was. \n\nThe quality was good, the salad dressing was great and they didn't skimp on the pizza toppings. They were a little pricey, almost $20 per 16\" pizza, but it was worth it I think. Especially since I wasn't paying for it. haha!
