Came here after hiking and was straving...  We had to put our name on the list but the wait was only 5 mins.  The server right away came and took our drink order.  Had to get the ice tea, I needed to cool off from the hike.  \n\nOrdered the Chicken Fried Steak (I know it defeats the purpose of my hike)....but it sounds so good.  And then it tasted so good...  The steak was pan fried and a light coating.  The country gravy on it was heavenly and the hash brown were da BOMB.  I also got sourdough toast to soak up the country gravy.  \n\nThe food and service was excellent....  =)  Love this little old diner.
