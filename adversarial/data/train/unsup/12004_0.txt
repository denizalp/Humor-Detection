\"Gastropub\"? Who cares. I do like Deagan's though. \n\nBeen here twice now. Had a cheese plate and tacos the first time. Both were pretty good. There could have been more cheese though. Slices were a tad thin. The shrimp tacos were pretty darn tasty. \n\nOn a more recent visit, I had the Fish and Chips. The fish was excellent (and I get F&C everywhere I go). The batter was crispy and the fish chunks were generous and thick. The spicy mayo was a perfect addition as well. The \"chips\", not so much. Soggy and cold. Bummer. But the greatness of the perfectly prepared fish made me forget about them. \n\nThe beer selection rocks. They seem to have a bunch of groovy offerings especially the Dragon's Milk Ale (my new favorite beer).\n\nService was good and we were seated immediately (although it was a weeknight). I can see this place getting really crowded on weekends. \n\nI love the space. Lots of exposed brick and rich dark wood. Worlds different from most places in Lakewood. It's a welcomed addition. \n\nI am somewhat annoyed by the whole Gastropub proclamation though. It's on the menu, it's on the wall, it's everywhere you look. I get it. Gastropub. Gastropub. Gastropub. \n\nDeagan's is what?
