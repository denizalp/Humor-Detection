This place deserves 5 stars just for the macaroons! They are amazing and I've tried almost every flavor. However the 3 stars is because their cupcakes and cake are pretty awful. Dry, bland and just not good. I expected a lot more from a bakery that specializes in cakes. I see from other reviews that this is a common theme, disappointment in the dry and flavorless cake so I would hope they would take note and make some changes. The speciality desserts are hit and miss. Some are really yummy and some are not so good. The sugar cookies are great, but the vegan cookies are extremely chewy and not the best vegan cookie I've ever had. Unlike most of the other reviews, I haven't ever really had a problem with the staff.
