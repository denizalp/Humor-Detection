I was excited to see Tempe hosting this event, Scottsdale and Phoenix have theirs but they lack the personality potential of a Tempe event.  Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed in their first time showing.\n\nTo start, parking was an absolute nightmare because of one hired guy who kept holding up all cars onto rio salado parkway at the hardy light.  Several people complained about him and he was eventually replaced, but people were sitting in their cars just to get into the lot for over 20 minutes.\n\nOnce inside, it was chaos again.  There was no clear lines for will call, purchasing, or already had tickets.  And then, they actually ran out of the wristbands for the event, which is important because you were only given 8 tastes of alcohol and the ticket was on your wristband.  By the way, I never saw on the site that your drinks would be limited.  8 tastes is enough, but transparency is always best.\n\nWater was scarce.  I was more than wiling to actually buy a bottle of water, but no one was selling, and it was hot!  Finally, they brought in free bottles and dumped them in a plastic tub with some ice.  \n\nThe food was great and there was plenty of options, but the lines were way to long, and tempers were flaring.  Did they underestimate how many would attend or just space the tents poorly?  Additionally, several food vendors ran out of food by 2:45!  I paid 60.00 and would have liked to actually get my money's worth. \n\nAnyway, I could go on, but I think I've clearly made my opinion that this event was not very good.  If they host another, I hope they plan better.  Everyone I spoke to was pretty disappointed.
