Nick and Rosie are the best! My family has used this funeral home for many many years. From my Great Grand Parents down to my parents. Many aunts, uncles, cousins and friends have used them as well. When my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, Both Rosie and Nick were there to help with planning. My parents, siblings and I went down to pre plan for my mother's passing. A few months later my dad was in a fatal accident at work. Just six weeks later my mother lost her battle with cancer. It was the most difficult and stressful time of my life. Thankfully, Nick and Rosie were there to guide and comfort my family. They were so attentive to all of our needs and wishes for my parents funerals. Anytime I had a question or concern, all I had to do was call. Several times I had to leave messages with the answering service. But I would receive a return call from Nick or Rosie soon after. My parents funerals went so smoothly and were very nice. Nick, Rosie and the entire staff went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect and that we were treated with compassionate care. They provided such personalized service and are always attentive to the needs of the family. I don't know how we would have made it through that difficult time without Nick, Rosie and the rest of the Alfieri Funeral Home Staff. \n\nThank You!!\n\nAlso, the funeral home is beautifully decorated, always clean and neat. The windows don't have the thick have drapes you usually find in funeral homes. They have curtains that allow natural light to come in. Sounds like a small detail. But it makes the rooms seem more open and relaxed. The rooms are very spacious and don't feel cramped and stuffy.
