Great bike shop for the serious enthusiast or racer.  Roadies only!  (There are no mountain bikes here.). As the name suggests, this bike shop's mandate is to get you riding faster.  How?  By offering services such as its insanely cool wind tunnel, in which you ride your bike and technicians monitor your every move in order to adjust and maximize every aspect of your cycling performance: wattage, aerodynamic efficiency, ergonomics.  (This service is not for the poor cyclist.  Appointments needed.)\n\nAs for goods, the clothing seemed limited to the Castelli brand and road bikes were represented mainly by Cervelo.  As a girl roadie, I would've liked a few more clothing brands to browse through.  I like variety!  I wanted a fall\/winter jacket but they weren't on display yet (duh! It's still summer in the desert...).  \n\nThe shop guy was personable and was patient with our enthusiastic questions.  We will definitely stop by again on our next visit to PHX.
