BEST Tacos Off the Strip!\n\nHow there are no other reviews of this place IDK!\n\nIt is always busy, It's Open late It has A drive thru it's Cheap and it is damn good.\n\nI almost forgot it's ONLY 5 minutes west of the strip near IN & Out. Check it Out!!\n\nI love the carne asada so I always get 6-8 tacos and 2 churros to go. It always hits the spot.
