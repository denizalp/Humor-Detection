This is my review of the reviews here on Yelp for Ruby Watchco. I have read through about 10 and have drawn a major conclusion. \n\nTh folks who gave the restaurant an excellent rating all seem to be really good writers. They all use the same format, first telling you about how good and amazing it is to eat this way, a la Ruby, and what famed celebrities they are. Then they tell you how amazing the restaurant is about accommodating food allergies. Then comes how abundantly friendly, attentive and funny the wait staff are, almost as if you're getting a live show as you dine. \n\nThey all remember exactly what they ate, to the detail, using all the fancy food terms. Then comes the line about how fresh, fresh and fresh everything is, followed by a diner confessing that \"if I could dine there every night, I would\".  These folks are all gushing with compliments: one woman said she wanted to hug everyone after the meal - whatever.\n\nThe folks who gave it a not so good rating seemed to be more realistic. They said the wait staff were good but definitely nothing to go viral about. What they said most is that the food is bland and lacking in flavour. It's probably beautifully presented, fresh, local, and prepared or at least overseen by Ruby but mostly bland and not flavorful. Which is okay if that's what you're after, fresh food, prepared simply by Celebrity Lynn and presented beautifully. \n\nDraw your own conclusions or dine there and write a review.
