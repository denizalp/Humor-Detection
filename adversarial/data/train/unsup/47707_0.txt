Dr. Ike Hardy is the best. I was absolutely dreading my root canal.  He was very friendly and genuine.  I have a super tiny mouth so he was extremely gentle.  He has a very calming presence which soothed my anxiety.  My root canal was done in under an hour. He truly is a wonderful Doctor, I highly recommend him!
