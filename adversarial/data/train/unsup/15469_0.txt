If you want to wait to be \"hand picked\" to get a table, come here.   My boyfriend and I have been coming here for 1.75 years and bout 1.00 years questioned it.  We've been here generally w ourselves but also w a birthday part.  Everytime w a reservation we've still waited an hour.  We've even watched people get seated before us.  Better looking people.  It's clear that the maitre de (who is the owner) Seats to his preference - he always says u can eat at the bar.   It's a shame.
