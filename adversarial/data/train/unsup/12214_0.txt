I am not sure why Concord Mills thinks they can go against one of the values that made this country what it is \" freedom of speech\" Look was this kiosk selling porn? Was it selling anything that in any way shape or form considered profanity?\n   \n      Here is my thoughts... what if he was selling Pro-Obama  items do you think anything would have been said?I doubt it. So in a since the Mall is trying to dictate the political thoughts of its mall visitors . If you voted for him or not you should have the right to sell and express your opinion \n\n       I for one will not return...
