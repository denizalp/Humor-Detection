This place looks very cool, the bathrooms were clean and tidy! The service was fast which was awesome The server was.so kind and patient. Knowing we were first timers he helped my daughters to pick a flavor! He even offered samples until we chose Princess flavor it was awesome it tasted just like cotton candy and even came with sprinkles!
