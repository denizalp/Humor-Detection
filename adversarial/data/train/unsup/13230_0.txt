Two registers open. One has 5 people in line the second one has one. We lined up on the shorter line. By the time it's our turn, the cashier rudely told us, \"excuse me, i need to take the next person in line, from the other line.  i work in retail as a Cashier myself. If we have two or three register open and we all have a line, we will ring up the people who are on our line. When our line is empty THEN We will call out the next person in line, to help our coworker. \n\nThe cashiers here need more training. You have people lined up on your register, you should ring them up first before calling other people from another line. Why can't we put zero stars??
