Read Steph V's post below for more details.\n\nThe wait was unnecessary considering how many empty tables were there. The food took so long to come out. I'd say about 30 minutes honestly, and that's not an exaggeration. I give Noodles one star for the okay food that satisfied our hunger. It's not the best asian food around Vegas, and it's also not the cheapest. \n\nThe biggest disappointment with Noodles came after the food. Our friend got a severe allergic reaction to something she ate and upon calling Noodles, we received one of the worst customer service. They said they would send someone to check up on our friend, but no one ever came. It was a huge liability issue on their part, and we could've taken more action if we really wanted to. \n\nNEVER AGAIN. Don't think we will be coming back here ever.
