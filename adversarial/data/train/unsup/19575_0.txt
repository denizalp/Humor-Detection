You need to go at least once I think. The food was executed beautifully, and the flavors were provocative. As the meal came to a close, I was nodding my head in approval, but then the bill arrived, and I realized I was still a bit hungry. I don't think the prices were insane; they just add up quickly. \n\nI love the atmosphere, as if you're walking into the LSD trip of a luchador on a dragon boat. The waitress was notable in her attention to our questions regarding dietary restrictions. If you have a dietary restriction, they take it seriously, which is always a good thing to know. However, our water glasses did remain empty for a quarter of the meal. Nothing worth complaining about too loudly, just an odd disconnect between the quality of service we initially received. \n\nAs for the food, we started with some good ol' chips and salsa. Why? I am not sure, but I would resist. The salsa was a-ok, but didn't  thrill my buds. We each had a taco. I went for the pastor with thinly sliced pineapple, and the pork belly was good, but I thought the sauce could have gone in a different direction. It overpowered the lovely pineapple.\n\nThe two standout dishes were the chilaquiles, a must if you adore cheese, and the snow pea salad dressed with citrus. I confess it was my first time eating snow peas raw, and I find this a distinct upgrade on a lettuce salad. It is quite stemmy, but I don't care.\n\nWill I return? For a sit down experience, probably not, but I may have to roll up to their to-go window just for the hey of it. I just like the idea of ordering a Jose taco to go from a window.
