What's the beef everybody? The staff was very polite and nice. Both in the plane, at the ticket counter, at the Customer Assistance Desk and on the 800 line. Trust me I used ALL of them in the last two days. Even though I did not get all the things I might have wished for, I was treated well, fairly, and even generously with vouchers to help out. \nI have flown American many times in the last few decades and things are good today and I have been treated well. Having been on full flights, empty flights, early flights, late flights, cancelled flights, and even a bomb threat flight (yes back in 1978 or so) The crew and the airline have done well by me.Thank you American Airlines.
