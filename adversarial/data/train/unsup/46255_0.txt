This rating is exclusively for the bubble tea only. Visiting Toronto and friend took me here for bubble tea and we ordered magic milk tea - regular milk tea with 1\/2 coffee jelly and 1\/2 pearl - oh my my....the best pearl I've ever had I must say. It's v soft and chewy. Milk tea also tasted v good.\n\nThis place is not like cha time or any other bubble tea chain where if you order the magic milk tea you need to make it 1\/2 sweet and so on and so forth. Regular taste just nice.\n\nLooks like a typical taiwanese bubble tea eating place type of food. We didn't eat here, so didn't have a chance to try it but check out the magic milk tea if you are ever in the area.
