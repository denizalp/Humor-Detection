So this place was amazing. We went there by accident because the place we usually go to was closing. We checked their reviews & decided to try it. \n\nIt is a cozy place but you don't feel cramped or like you are sharing a meal with the table next to you lol. The ambiance is relaxing, comfortable, & elegant. \n\nThe wine list is fantastic. That is kinda their thing haha. I didn't order alcohol but I can say great quality & selection. \n\nThe menu is full of various options and you can substitute tofu and vegetables for the meat in any entree. Not your typical thai restaurant selection. They have curries, noodles, rice, soups but they put unique twists on them. They also have entrees with seafood and all meats.  The sea bass looked great. May have to try that next time. \n\nI tried the spicy crab curry, Tom kah Kai soup & pad kee Mao (drunken noodles) with tofu and veggies. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. The soup was the best thai soup I have had. Perfect flavor, spice and freshness. You can select the level of spice you would like as well. \n\nSomething that put my wonderful experience over the top was our waiter. I wish I got his name. He made sure our needs were met while not being overbearing. He made great recommendations as well. \n\nThank you. I will definitely be coming back.
