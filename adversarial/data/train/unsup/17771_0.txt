If you're a male who loves serious go-karting, this is the place for you to go in Charlotte. If you're looking for a boredom buster, don't come here. \n\nYeah, I was with a birthday party here and it was me with about 7 guys. I get hit on a curve by someone that didn't slow down and I run right into the wall. When the guy comes over to move the kart back into the lane, he chooses to make a smartass comment about there being brakes on the kart. To which I explain I was using them and that was the issue. Most of the guys with me hit the wall just as hard or harder and were asked if they were okay. Not me. The only other female injured her neck in the kart and sat out the rest. She received no help from any employee. Just what I witnessed. It may have been an off-day.\n\nI guess I learned the hard way that amateur\/female business isn't really that encouraged here. The place is pretty expensive, but 3 stars because the karts and lanes are in decent shape. For competition and real championship racing, this place is as ideal as you can get, However, I probably won't be returning as a voluntary hobby.
