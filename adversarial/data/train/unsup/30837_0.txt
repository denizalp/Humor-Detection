Fabulous tacos but get there early.....they're so good they often sell out.  This is not your ordinary truck food; it's more like a mobile restaurant:  the highest quality ingredients, perfectly seasoned, served with enthusiasm and pride in the product.  When I arrived at Allen Centennial Garden where El Grito was serving that evening, several of the choices were no longer available -- consumed by happy diners.  I had the beef brisket - a generous portion of juicy, delicious beef in a taco shell, best taco I've had in a long time.  These guys know what they're doing.  \n  Follow them on Facebook to see where they'll be day by day.  Then head out there!  I live in California but will definitely return to El Grito on my next visit.
