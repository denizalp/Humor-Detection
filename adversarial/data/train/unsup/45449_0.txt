We ordered three different kinds of guacamole - all were delicious, but I loved the Pineapple and Tuscan the best. Chips were pretty good, warm and tasted homemade. \n\nI also tried two margaritas  - mango with Espolon tequila and the Marigold (with strawberry puree). Both were delicious, fresh and refreshing. \n\nIt was very busy last night, so service was a bit slow, but nothing major. \n\nNegative -  So sweaty. Omg, it was super hot last night, but waaaay hotter inside actual bar. Terrible. Total sweaty beast in this place wearing jeans. I was getting so uncomfortable as there was no AC (why was it not on??), or even some darn ceiling fans. Not sure if this is always the experience during warmer months or just a glitch.
