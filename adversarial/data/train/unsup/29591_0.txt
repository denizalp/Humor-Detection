STAY FAR AWAY FRIM THIS PLACE! They absolutely tried to rip us off with insurance and hidden fees and we walked away with NO CAR! Pay attention to the reviews and go somewhere else. Tried to say some scam of Nevada insurance and that they would charge us for any tiny damage even if it was there before. We have great insurance covering this already! I hope I get a reply from their CEO. I would LOVE to speak with her\/ him. 0 stars!!!
