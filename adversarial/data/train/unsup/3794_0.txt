Finally! Mexican food with SOUL.....with 2 strikes(Casa Don Juan, and Las Islitas) I guess third time's the charm...\n\nLos Antojos does Mexican food typical of Mexico City and they do it pretty good! Inside is very modest with simple tables and chairs and pictures and signs of different dishes they offer. Sorry, you won't find Quesadillas that the general American public is familiar with, nor will you find Burritos here....you have been warned.\n\nWe ordered some Tacos-Tripa, Lengua, Suadero, Cochinita Pivil, and Mole de Pollo. We also got the Consomme Loco, Quesadilla de Rajas\nand a Huarache de Asada. I also got an Horchata-Homemade, not from the machine\/instant.\n\nAll of the tacos were good, but the standout was the chicken mole, just like mole should taste. The Consomme Loco is a perfect example of simple food done right, DO get this if you ever dine here! Our first spoonful of this soup, the lady behind our counter saw our smiles and said \"Como Su Casa\"(\"Just like home\") It did feel as if we were guests in her home as she and her husband always checked on us to see that everything was okay. The Quesadilla was different in a good way...deep fried masa stuffed with cheese and strips of poblano peppers with a crisp exterior. The Huarache was good, but the carne asada was a little tough. We shared a cup of Strawberries and Cream and a Peach Gelatina for dessert. Overall, a good dinner, and definitely worthy of a return visit. You never know if you'll run into Chef Alex Stratta-Yup, this is his spot for Mexican fare....ALOHA!!!
