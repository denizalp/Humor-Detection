I don't even know where to begin. Heated floors, outstanding staff, superb (and beyond knowledgeable) concierge, prime location, cleaning services to the nine... Shit. I may move in here! \n\nComing from California and staying for 9 nights, we really debated paying this much. It was just upwards of $300 a night. But seriously, I don't give a shit. This is the BEST hotel we've ever stayed at. If you want Shangri-La service at a price that won't have you eating poutine from McDonalds, then SoHo is a SoGo. I could rant and rave for hours. So much so that we will most likely put in a bathroom option similar to theirs. \n\nAdditional perks: free wifi, gym, pool, deck, and I swear you'll love this the most.. They open the doors electronically for you. Seriously. Someone has a remote and watches the door. My own mother never watched me that close. It's awesome. I now have to never punch the handicap button out of pure laziness and shame. Fucking YES!
