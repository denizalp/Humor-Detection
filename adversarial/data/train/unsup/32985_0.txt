Rina is a master stylist at Joya Salon and Spa and she is the best I've been able to find in Phoenix. Vibrant, young, knows how to make hair look amazing. If you don't want to just look amazing but feel that way too? Book your hair appointment at Joya and ask for Rina! She is great. Plus you can spend a bit of time on the Montelucia property. This has the best views in the valley, super nice pools, and delicious food. I'm local and I love it.
