keep in mind, i'm only rating this pizza in relation to fast food style, delivery pizza - i wouldn't even put them in the same category as Slices or Tesio's.\n\nthat being said, when i want greasy food deliverd to my door, i've always been a pizza hut fan - you know, if you're going gross, do it right, don't you think? and for years i lived with girls who were die hard barro's orderers. i didnt really mind because it seemed all the same to me anyway. \n\nbut, i just had barro's for the first time in probably a year and a half and that was some good damn pizza. they're ingredients are much better quality, you don't need several napkins to sop up the grease, their crust is better and their consistency kills it (the last tiem i ordered the Hut, i got no cheese, wrong crust and piles of burnt pepporoni -like did a person really take that out of the oven, put it into a box and think someone else would want to eat it?).\n\nso, my faith in better-than-average delivery pizza has been restored, by Barro's. my hang over thanks you.
