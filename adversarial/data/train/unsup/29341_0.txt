Go early, before 6pm and get their burgers for 6.99. I tried their Beer Garden burger with sweet potato fries and I am glad I did. The Beer Garden burger is loaded with great flavor and I will definitely go back to get it again! I ate at the bar and watched and had discussions with the bartender about the Olympics. It was a very nice, relaxing, good flavored time.
