What a Bagel bakes pretty decent bagels by Toronto standard. This particular location gets a decent bit of traffic, hence providing the customers with freshly baked goods. They also serve a good variety of sweet and savory pastries in addition to their bagels, including rugelach, hamentashen, and even bourekahs. \nWhile the variety, freshness, and tasty bagels are definitely a plus, the prices aren't necessarily right across the board, and in fact very annoyingly, there are no prices listed on any of the baked goods, meaning you'll have to take a chance or inquire about any item you are interested in.\nThe service used to be better as I remember and I wouldn't bother with the challah!
