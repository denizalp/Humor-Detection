Me and my sister went hear on rain day 2014 as part of our no school\/work adventure and it was far from a pleasurable experience. First thing, as we walked in the door the sound of the door bell was ear piercing. I don't think I could accurately put into words how gruesome it actually was. \n\nNext, we ordered our donuts; I got a jelly filled powdered donuts which I was quite excited about, they are not always the easiest to find. There was much to be wanted. The donuts had this odd aftertaste I couldn't quite put my finger on. My sister got a plain old chocolate covered donut that she wasn't totally digging either. \n\nThe service was not bad, the staff was friendly, but all in all, the donuts were lacking in quality and that bell was just awful. We were reminded (and shocked a second time) as we left.
