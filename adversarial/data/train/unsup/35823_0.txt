They start you with tortilla chips that are thin and light, with 3 salsas. The food was very good. I had the Pork Tenderloin Abrigada, the pork tenderloin medallions  (3) wrapped in bacon, very flavorful, with a smokey, grilled taste. It also comes with (2) enchiladas that are covered with a type sauce that will enhance the type enchilada chosen. The service was slow and attention to detail was limited. The food took a bit long to be served, but I would come back to try other items on the menu.
