I was very disappointed. The sushi had no taste, the sushi rice on the rolls were warm, the service was slow, and really for an AYCE menu they didn't have that many choices. My all time favorite AYCE sushi joint offers far more choices, the staff is always checking to see if we need to order more rolls (so there is no wait in between our rolls) and the sushi has flavor.
