Won't be back. A gel mani\/pedi combo comes to $70 which is standard, but this place didn't deliver. I had an appointment and a walk-in customer who came in 10 minutes after me had her nails started before I did.\n\nPedi - The tech who did my toes said she needs to let them dry and then she will be back, but left shortly after I was transferred to the nail station. A step must've been skipped because I'm home now (and have done nothing since leaving the salon) but my toes are completely chipped. \n\nMani - I picked a pink color and as I was getting my toes done I saw them add liquid to the bottle and leave it up at the counter. When the time finally came to get my manicure she did two coats and then put the gel top coat on and I was a bit confused because my nail color was basically translucent white. I asked if that was the final coat and she said yes. Well, as you can see from the photos my nails are not even close to the color they should've been. Stop adding liquid to nail polishes if it's clearly diluting it down!! I even showed the lady this picture of the color it should be and she just shrugged it off..\nWaste of money and wouldn't recommend this place. Definitely don't pick gel OPI color bayou a drink or you'll end up with clear nails instead of pink!
