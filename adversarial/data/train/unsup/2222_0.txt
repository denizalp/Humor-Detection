I hate three star reviews.  It's critic purgatory as you can't be hyperbolic in an extreme.  I have one word for Drew's barbecue, average. \n\nTaste buds are a medium that can take you to dazzling places only when accompanied by a food of high caliber. Not with Andrew's.  It's tragic because although the meat was tender, the sauce was just plain Jane.   Not having a good sauce with perfectly tender meat is like having a Porsche without wheels-- sure you have a Porsche but how can you possibly enjoy it?  Andrew's simply didn't get my RPM's going.\n\nI however will give the place it's due diligence, they have great prices and a friendly staff but that's the extent of it.
