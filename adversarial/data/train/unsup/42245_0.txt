Have been doing weekly aquatots visits and have been happy until today. Did a makeup visit with Alina and did not get the same experience. My son was shaking cold and off on his own during this class. She didn't seem to be attentive at all. After awhile we decided to end the class early and pull him out. We asked her about him shivering cold and all she did was acknowledge yes he was. Well it would be good if you did something about it instead of let him shiver. The pool area seemed cold as well not sure if they were experiencing issues with the heater etc.
