Ate salad for dinner!  Mostly croutons and tomatoes.  Really just one big round crouton covered with tomato sauce.  And cheese.  Fine, it was pizza.  I ate pizza.\n\nSince we made plans to hit the gym after dinner, I figured I'd help motivate myself and give myself a goal of burning off like 1,000 calories.  Genius, right [obviously joking but no seriously, I ate that pizza and then punished myself at the gym]?  I got myself half Alfredo's Alfredo and half Mad to Meat You.  I got artichoke hearts and black olives added for some more veggies.  I also got to pick at someone else's half Smokin' Buffalo Chicken and half Rustic Veggie pizza.  Both pizzas had a super generous amount of toppings.  Like I was seriously impressed.  One of the younger ladies tonight carefully placed all my toppings with care as well.  I was surprised since the other two make-your-own pizza places normally just toss everything on haphazardly so I appreciate the attention she gave it.  It ensured for a balanced bite every time.  After everything was topped onto my pie, they asked to make sure I was happy and it was great.  Wonderful service, seriously.  As for the crust, the crust is baked to be super crispy.  There was no way that crust was going to bend.  All in all, I was extremely pleased with Pieology!\n\nThis Pieology Pizzeria location just recently opened so everything is nice and clean.  Throughout the whole time we sat there, we had multiple people check in on us to make sure everything was satisfying.  Seriously great service!
