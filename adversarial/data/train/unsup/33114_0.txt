THIS IS THE BEST TEXAS ROADHOUSE I HAVE GONE TO IN THE GREATER PHOENIX\/ PEORIA AREA! I have gone to this specific restaurant location more than 20 times and have never had an issue. In fact, I have had the complete opposite, FAST SERVICE, INEXPENSIVE FOOD, AWESOME WAITERS. The best waitress that I have had at this restaurant is Rachel- be sure to go in and say hi!The manager is also very nice and when I told her how great her new waitress was she was very appreciative that I took the time to tell her!
