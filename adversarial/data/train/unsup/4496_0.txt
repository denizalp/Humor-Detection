I ate at Guy Savoy in Oct 2006. The overall feeling is modern and spare; furniture is plain and functional. This is the kind of style I tend to like, but somehow I didn't find it attractive.    \n\nService was friendly and efficient.  The restaurant is managed by Guy Savoy's son Frank.  He seemed to be everywhere, introducing himself to guests and always making sure that things were running smoothly.  There was always someone nearby to take care of my every need.\n\nBefore the meal, there were a number of items.  First, an amuse bouche: a fingernail sized sandwich of thin slices of toast and foie gras, meltingly rich.  Excellent!\n\nSometime around this point, I ordered dinner - the 10 course Menu Prestige, with bread pairings for each course.  While I was digesting all of this information, some additional amuses bouche (if that's how you make it plural) arrived: a potato cake, a piece of quail breast, and a third item I forgot to write down.  All were very good.\n\nA little while later, yet another amuse bouche arrived:  a tiny cup of carrot and pumpkin soup, with fennel, bacon, and popped wild rice.  It was very good, and came with a surprise.  The cup was actually two cups, fused together.  One cup held the soup, the other cup was upside down.  When I was finished with the soup, I lifted the two cup combo off the plate, and under the upside down cup was a little pumpkin risotto.  It was even better than the soup.\n\nI'd been eating for at least a half hour, but now the meal officially began.  The courses were:\n\n    * Oyster in Ice Gelee.  Good briny flavor. Paired with seaweed bread.\n    * Tomato Tartar, Young Vegetables and \"Seaweed-Lemon\" Granite.  In addition to chopped tomato, there were bits of micro green beans, egg white and yolk, yellow tomato puree, gelee, and other ingredients. Surprisingly good.\n    * Colors of Caviar.  Layers of: vinaigrette of caviar; cream of caviar; string bean puree; Iranian golden Osetra caviar; warm Saboyan. Each contributed strong flavor, although they masked the caviar just a bit.  Still, very good.\n    * Slow Cooked Wild King Salmon.  A nice piece of fish, with fennel, anise, and vegetables.  I should have taken more notes, as it was my favorite of the first four courses - very simple, but very tasty.\n    * Sauteed Baby Chanterelles, Prosciutto, Crisp Potato Galette and Snow Peas.  Paired with excellent bacon bread.  This was another complex dish, with a number of items in addition to those mentioned. Excellent; my favorite course.\n    * Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup, Toasted Mushroom Brioche with Black Truffle Butter.  The soup was creamy, with a pronounced artichoke flavor.  Four slices of truffle floated on top, along with equally sized slices of parmesan cheese.  Almost as good as the previous course.\n    * Degustation of Veal.  There were four different veal preparations; overall, very good.\n    * Selection de Fromages Affines.  I don't much care for fancy cheeses, and in any case wouldn't know what to order.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The cheese steward described the general categories (strong vs mild, cow vs sheep, etc).  He asked me my preferences, and made recommendations.  The entire experience was very relaxed and a lot of fun. Some that I tried:\n          o Aged Muenster. Aged to the point where it was soft and strongly flavored.  Very good!\n          o Goat Blue Cheese.  The cheese steward recommended this variety. Made from goat's milk, it was very unusual and very special; my favorite.\n          o Salers.  A firm cheese, not so strong.  Pretty good.\n    * palate cleanser.\n    * The Peach.  A peach half, with baked or fried shredded phyllo dough, and lavender ice cream.  The peach was flavorful, soft and chewy - an odd but pleasing combination.  The entire dessert sounds a bit strange, but was very good - one of my favorite non-chocolate desserts in recent memory.\n    * Chocolate Fondant, Crunchy Praline, Chicory Cream.  Layers of gianduja-like paste and chocolate ganache; very, very thick\/dense. Cut a little piece of the dessert, and dip it in the chicory cream.  I'm having trouble giving a good description, but it was excellent!\n\n\nStill to come were mignardises - a few extra sweets to end the meal.  There was also some incredible lemon sage sorbet.  It tasted like solid lemon juice - overwhelmingly sour; I love this kind of stuff.\n\nThis was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas, second only to that at Joel Robuchon.  The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and just as importantly it was a lot of fun.  Given the prices, I'm not likely to return any time soon, but I'll remember my meal for a long time to come.\n\nThe bill: the menu prestige is $290.  A small, quicker (90 minute) tasting menu is $190.  A three course la carte meal will run between $150 and $250.  To these prices, add drinks, tax and tip.  One nice touch: bottled water is free.
