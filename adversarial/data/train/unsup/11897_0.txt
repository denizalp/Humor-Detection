Absolutely awful service and the highest prices of any dry cleaner in or around the Pittsburgh area. Hidden fees upwards of $4.50 per shirt exist for any shirt that is not made of cotton! This wasn't made clear until I picked the shirts up from the Model Cleaners on Cochran Road in Greentree\/Mt. Lebo area and received a bill upwards of $85 after expecting only a $30 charge.\n\nThe older woman that worked the front counter at this location was extremely rude and short with me... absolutely horrible experience from beginning to end. STAY AWAY
