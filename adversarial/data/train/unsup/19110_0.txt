Based completely on the comment from this business to my *honest* review, I won't be coming back. The health department is around for a reason and, if this restaurant rejects their standards as too \"institutionalized\", I can't imagine wanting to give this place another chance. As I stated, if the violations were silly ones, like not having their letter grade displayed in the exact place specified by the health department, I'd overlook the grade. Unfortunately, this restaurant appears to proudly flout safe food-handling procedures and they're extraordinarily sanctimonious about it. Listen, Yayo Taco, I'm not in cahoots with \"the Man\". I just don't like food poisoning.
