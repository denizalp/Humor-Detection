This is my favorite all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place! Even if it's a 27 minute drive from where I live, I wouldn't mind coming here on a weekly basis! I love this place mostly because of their friendly staff and their FOOD, duh! The interior design is a bonus.\n\nI really don't know where to begin with this place. But let's start with location. It's right next door (literally, a 1 minute walking distance) to the Galleria Mall. They are usually packed on weekends and during the night time. So whenever I have to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, my party and I would look around the Galleria Mall to pass time. Along with the ease of reserving a table, they have an app you download that would notify you how many people are in front of you on the list, and tell you when your table is ready. Keep in mind that you can't reserve ahead of time via phone call, you can only reserve at the front check-in desk to have them write your name on the list.\n\nNow back to getting seated. There are booths and high tables to sit at. The booths and tables are good for parties of 4-6? However, each both has only one grill, whereas the high tables have 2 grills for every 8 seats. The restaurant is still fairly new so of course everything is spankin' clean! \n\nI usually come here with parties of 4-8 so we order by the BULK, literally. Our favorite appetizers are the:\n\n1. Fried Squid Legs\n2. Japchae!\n3. Sesame Chicken\n4. Korean Fried Chicken\n5. Seaweed Salad\n6. Salad\n7. Rice (a must lol)\n\nand for meats we love getting:\n1. Marinated Prime Rib (#10)\n2. Brisket\n3. Pork Belly\n4. Bulgogi\n5. Spicy Chicken\n\nThe quality of the food tastes better\/fresher than other AYCE KBBQ places I've been to in Vegas. They have a large variety of food as well, making the price of lunch ($14.95) and dinner ($19.95) all the more WORTH IT. And I'm glad I don't leave feeling gross and smelly like how I do at Tofu Hut or Haro. They have a bar and happy hour as well, but unfortunately I have yet to partake in that experience ): The ambience is trendy and classy since the lighting is dimmed. Don't worry you can still see your food and company still!\n\nThe customer service is great overtime I come here. No matter how busy or understaffed they seem, it is always quick and personable. We get our grill changed accordingly and have no problems with the workers.\n\nI truly recommend this place if you're looking for an AYCE KBBQ place. The distance might be a deal breaker but it's no problem for me. Thank you for opening in Nevada Gen KBBQ!
