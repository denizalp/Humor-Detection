Thumbs down to Milkshake factory being closed for last day due to the  holidays but thumbs up for this great alternative! My daughter and I decided to check in here for a coffee and a latte. My daughter decided to go with what they call a sweetheart frozen latte with white chocolate and raspberry.  I opted for the brew of the day which was a Brazilian roast.\n\nThe place was packed with people and along the walls were various artwork for sale. They have an upstairs area to sit but since we were under time constraints we decided to stay downstairs and enjoy our drinks at a long bar stool. Sandwiches and a couple of sweets are also available for purchase as well as smoothies, hot chocolate, and juices.\n\nMy daughter really enjoyed her frozen latte. My coffee was a good medium blend. Was a bit piping hot that I burned my tongue a little. Still you get a lot of bang for your buck. Coffee was very good. Free WiFi is available here for the many I saw working on their laptops. They have a assortment of expressos to choose from.  Makes a great place to unwind while you're in the heart of Southside's business district.
