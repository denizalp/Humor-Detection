Great food, huge portions and a great Bloody Mary to boot! We had the Crab Benedict, Ham steak and eggs (more than enough to share), and steak and eggs all around midnight and all excellent! The service is a little spotty but with the servers short skirts and nice smiles I guess I can live. Everyone was helpful and a little surprise when you least expect it never hurts.
