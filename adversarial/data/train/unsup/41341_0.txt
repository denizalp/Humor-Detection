After trying many places in Henderson area. I finally found my favorite nail place that does good pedicure. The usual I get is the $20 Express Spa which I think is a good deal. \n\nPlace is clean and quick. Highly recommended because it is clean. That's my number 1 concern for nail places because I do not want to contract any athlete's foot or hepatitis. \n\nCheers to this nail place.
