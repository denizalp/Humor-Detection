This will be the second time posting this as I received an email from the Yelp HQ that it was \"outside of their content guidelines\". Could it have been for Inappropriate language, or the fact that the restaurant doesn't want to be viewed as the racists they are. Mind you I did add amplifying information since the original review \"did not have enough detail\".\n\nI rate this place a ZERO. Sorry excuse for service. He had an issue every time we flagged him down for service. An attitude when we placed an order, and didn't even bother to check on us. Furthermore, the white waiter had the audacity to racially profile and directly target my friend in which he called her \"homegirl\" and told her she was no longer welcome in the establishment and had to leave.  If you're not white, don't bother coming!  I will never step foot in this establishment again.
