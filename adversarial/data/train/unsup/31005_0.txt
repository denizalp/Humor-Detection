Definitely a delicious choice for pizza and wings. I haven't tried their other menu items, but they have great menu options.\n\nThe wing sauce is very tasty. I like spicy bbq. The chicken wings are good and juicy. I like the pizza dough and they make it not too thick, not too thin, just right. I hate all pizza crust, but my dog devoured it without a problem. Nice sauce, quality toppings\n\nI find this a great choice for pizza and I hope hope their dishes are as good as the pizza, but I'll have yet to try them before I can review.
