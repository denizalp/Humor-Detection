Husband had a pain in the ankles, and so we went to go check it out and ended up here.  If you text the number 23000 - you can get wait times for the local hospitals.. so that's what we did and Mountain View had a wait time of 15 minutes.  It was a Saturday, so we had to make it snappy -- :P  \n\nGetting checked in was a breeze, didn't take long at all.  It wasn't jam packed like i expected it to be on Saturday evening which is awesome.  There were multiple people checking patients in so we weren't waiting very long.   There's a type of [VIP] line--- that isn't the exact term for the line--- but it's pretty much a speedier line that Jose was able to get into.  Not sure why-------- probably cause he was cute or something.  No, JK-  I really don't remember.   Anyway-- we were in and out in 1.5 hours which is pretty fast.  I've been in the emergency for this man and have waited a total of 4-5 hours for 2 sprained ankles.   \n\nEveryone was polite-  no one was rude at all.  \n\nThere is a big waiting room in the ER check in area.  needs some big time upgrading.  It could be scary. ... really scary.  The walls seem yellow, the one toy in the room has  a scary drawing on it.  The chairs are  really old looking.   it's time for some upgrades.  \n\nOn the other hand, you walk out of that area where you check in and wait... and there's ANOTHER waiting area.  Much nicer.  The cafeteria also in this area, as well as the gift shop.  Access to the rest of the hospital is an elevator away.  \n\nAll in all-- good experience!  Husband walked out with Achilles tendinitis and meds!  :D
