Walter, his father and team are honest, service-oriented, fast and do a fantastic, high quality job at a fair price. Our home was badly in need of repainting and there were some areas where the wood on the patio needed repairing. It truly looks great now. When we first asked for a quote, Walter responded immediately and was flexible in stopping by at a time that worked for us. They use premium quality paint and Walter plays an active role in doing quality checks along the way, as the work progresses. He was his word and it was nice to find old fashioned honest, relationship oriented service. Would definitely recommend Sunguard again.
