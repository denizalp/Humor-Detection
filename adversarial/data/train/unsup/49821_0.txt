OK, 5 stars for a relatively new local bar that treats you like you have been a regular for years. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the friendly bartenders.  On Thursdays they have a 6.99 prime rib special that is so awesome! My husband gets the double cut for 6 dollars more. The portions are actually pretty decent and both visits our prime rib was perfectly cooked. It comes with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies. The mashed potatoes are good and the veggies aren't bad, but I will say the amount of garlic that chef uses on those veggies is just out of control! Yes, I love garlic, but seriously it's like a whole head of garlic in those vegetables. At any rate, it's a great deal and a good meal. \n\nIf you gamble, they have a players card log-in that's pretty cool. It's busy on Thursday due to the great deal they have going on, but the bar is pretty big. The bartenders are attentive and actually act like they enjoy their job. \n\nIt's a very spacious place. I like the layout and the atmosphere is social and chill.  There is a pool table, comfortable couches to lounge in with your significant other or whatever you are into and a dining area. Definitely making this one of our hangouts!
