Let's get one thing straight, the location and setting is wonderful. Most of the cuisine was cooked, seasoned, and presented well with satisfying portions. \n\n(restaurant week menu) - Watermelon, Tomato, & Jicama Salad, Polenta & Vegetable Napoleon, and strawberry shortcake. \n(regular menu) - Shrimp pepper pot and Beef Stroganoff \n\nThe highlights on the food include the Beef Stroganoff (the fresh pasta and the sauce was superb) and the Polenta & Vegetable Napoleon (beautiful dish and vegetables were cooked nicely). The sauce on the shrimp pepper pot was flavorful but felt there was way too much bread served and would have preferred if the shrimp tails would have been pulled off. In addition, the salad and the strawberry shortcake was nothing to rave about. \n\nNow onto the service. It was hugely underwhelming. For a fine establishment to have their patrons push aside their finished plates (pre-bus) for the staff and not have one our water glasses refilled throughout the entire dining experience was a vast disappointment and inexcusable. Our plates were not picked up until the next course arrived. We do not blame our server since she was occupied with other tables (who all were sat at about the same time) but there were multiple staff members around who completely zoned us out. Why bother when it isn't your table right? \n\nAll in all, El Chorro had tremendous potential but we left dissatisfied with the experience and will keep El Chorro off our list of restaurants in Scottsdale. Plenty of other high-quality restaurants to spend $150+ in Scottsdale\/Phoenix.
