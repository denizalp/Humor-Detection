I'm like 98% certain that this is the only froyo place where the cheesecake flavor actually tastes like cheesecake. Also, they have dark chocolate chips and yogurt chips. These are all I require for an enjoyable froyo experience, so I am happy every time I'm here. \n\nTook off one star because the last time we were in, the dude behind the counter was not friendly at all. No hello, no smile. \n\"Just that one?\" No, that one too. \"Total is $.$$\" Hand over card. Hands back card and looks to next customer. \n\nThat's not cool. Luckily, froyo is pretty effing cool.
