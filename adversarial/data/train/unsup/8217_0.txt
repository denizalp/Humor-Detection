I agree with the other yelper as the location is not in the best spot, kinda rough neighborhood.\nBesides that, lord do they have the best subs, or should I say sub, cause i always get the same type. Bacon Ranch I believe is the name of it. Good gollie MISS Mollie... I can eat this sub 7 days a week. Of course I'd be 350 in 3 months, but hey, who ain't these days. OK, just playing. but seriously this sub is the best. The only downside is the bread seems to sit in my stomach for 2 days, makes me look a little fat.\nService is always top notch and the cashier always remembers me and knows what I'm getting. I might go there too much, what you think?
