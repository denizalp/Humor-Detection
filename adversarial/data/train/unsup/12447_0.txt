Love at first bite! Papa Verde de mi corazon! \nTranslation: Green Potato (not dad, lol) of my heart! \n\nI've been stalking this food truck for a while via their location texts (you can sign up for them on their website) & had yet to be close enough to give them a try.... UNTIL I went to the Science Center and BAM!! There they were, just waiting for me :D\n\nWhen in doubt, I ask for recommendations. The guy taking my order told me his favorite quesadilla was the Papa Verde with chicken. So I said \"I'll take that!\". To tell you the truth, it looked like a common quesadilla in it's little box, but ohhhhh, sirree!!! It was anything but common! It was a burst of flavor with every bite & the potato and green chile sauce really made it awesome! \n\nThey had run out of Horchata, which I REALLY wanted to try, so I got the limeade. It was yummy! Fresh with just the right amount of sweet and tart. I also really like that it came in a mason jar :)
