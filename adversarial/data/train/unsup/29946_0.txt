Customer Service needs some work. I understand that it's your job to tell the company insurance but if I politely tell you no thank you, you don't have  but keep pushing Jonathan! Then question my insurance then say things like \"don't park next to any cars\" & \"you sure it's only 40 a day\" & \"why pay outta pocket when someone hits the door.\" Then after all that you give me a car that still has trash from the previous renter & the car smelt like something was smoking inside. Luckily, Jonathan didn't assistance us when we return the car. So I gave an extra star because the lady who help us was really nice. But never going to rent from this location. Go on to the location on Teneya!
