American Airlines truly does suck. Both of our flights were delayed and on our way back, we couldn't take off because our plane was having mechanical issues. No jokes. Three hours late home on that one. \n\nEvery experience I've had with them has truly been horrible beyond words. There is a reason why they are so cheap compared to other airlines. Avoid if you can, and be prepared for the worst if you do board one of their \"air buses\". You're in for a treat!
