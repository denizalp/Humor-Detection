I owe a debt to a friend for recommending Bootleggers to me. The first time I came here was for AZ Restaurant Week. I was absolutely bowled over. When I came in and said I wanted to see the Restaurant Week menu, the waitress took the menu out of my hands. I said \"Wait, I wanted to choose something.\" Then she said \"No, you get EVERYTHING.\" What?? Can this be?! Everything was delicious but the cuteness of the tasting proportions was deceptive. I was almost stuffed after the first course! The first plate had a mini grilled cheese and turkey sandwich, a baked potato soup and a very tender short rib with brussel sprouts and grilled pear. You could tell real thought went into the menu. The second course included a quarter section of a pumpkin waffle with chicken. I had to save that for the take-out box. But I miraculously found room for the smoked pork belly steak. So fat but so good. \n\nThe second time I went there was for the Bacon Board. What a great offer. Unfortunately it's the reason I can't go back there too often, hehe. I truly heart the Bacon Board. \n\nI also love the decor. This is another instance of a restaurant that is too good for its strip-mall location. It's a kind of rustic feel with a lot of wood and metal but they use empty bottles for the light fixture that add a cozy ambiance. This place is conveniently located right by the Shea exit on the 51. I would take visitors here for sure, that is if their cholesterol levels aren't already on the edge. ;)
