How is it possible that I've yet to review Cafe Zupas? This is one of my favorite places for lunch, and not just specifically this location - they are all excellent. So much variety of fresh salads, soups and sandwiches. It's the salad bar of your dreams. Ive even used their catering a few times for work, and their service is outstanding.
