Great place for breakfast! I ate this skillet that was pretty hearty with bacon, sausage, and ham. The potatos were really crispy and top it off with the eggs, you got yourself a great breakfast! \n\nMy girlfriend got the eggs Benedict which was really tasty! That was there special so I'd recommend that if you go there. \n\nBoth dishes were really tasty and you can tell the quality of food is great! Its not a Dennys or Carrows thats for sure, this is a nice mom and pop type of restaurant that makes really good quality of food. \n\nIf your in the area do stop by because you wont regret it. The portions were really great and thats always a plus for me! But someone ordered french toast by me which also looked great also!\n\nIt looks like they have a lot of different things to eat that I bet will taste good! Check it out you wont regret it!
