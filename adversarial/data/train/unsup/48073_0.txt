I came here with my best friend to get her nails done (Mani-pedi) before her wedding. I had an appointment for both of us but still waited almost 45 minutes before my pedicure started (they started my friend's pedicure first), which didn't bother me much because my friend and I were happy to chat. Pedicure was overall good for both of us. Classic is a pretty extended service. However, our manicures were AWFUL. We tried to give our technicians the opportunity to fix their work, but they ignored our early requests for some changes. My friend wanted to get a heart on each of her ring fingers--not a complicated request. Her technician was unable to make the heart, and when we asked her to ask another technician to help make it (multiple times), she refused.  Both of our gel polish jobs were uneven, our nail shaping was haphazard--a little fuzz got stuck in my gel and my tech did not redo it! I have never had such a bad experience. We actually went to another nail salon to get our nails fixed because it was clear that our techs at Mirage wouldn't help us. Wouldn't recommend at all!
