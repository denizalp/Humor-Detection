First time and we are obsessed!! Definetely worth the ride (we live on the West Valley). We ordered Centurion pizza, Il Purista sandwich and eggplant parmigiana sandwich to try and we looooved it all!! Foccacia bread is delicious, the pizza crust and the sauce to die for!! Definetely the best italian deli I have been to and I will recommend it to all my friends and family. It is very casual, you order by the register and they call your number and take your food to your table. We waited around 15 minutes for the pizza and sandwiches so that made us very happy (we were starving). It is very very family oriented and we loved that too!! You wont be disappointed ;) great food, friendly staff!!
