This place was absolutely amazing and professional!!! My husband and I had our wedding dinner here with about 40-50 guests this last weekend and were so pleased! First: The food is amazing! If you are looking for comfort Italian food this is the place. Living in New York for 8 years I know good Italian and this place is delicious. My guests, my husband, and myself loved it! No complaints. Second: The price is unbeatable. They include all the essentials to a wonderful meal, even table wine. We spent, including tax and tip, $1500 on dinner. With that being said, we did do a limited menu but our guests still had over 10 options with chicken and even a few seafood selections. We also brought in an outside cake in which they cut and plated for us right at the table for no additional charge. Third: The service was incredible!!! Our waitress was Kim. She was so awesome and so in control. She assured us as soon as we sat down that we would have a wonderful time and we did. Everything came out in a timely matter, the right things ordered, and her whole team was so sweet! Lastly: Making the reservation was a breeze. They sat us on time, the host crew and management crew were so kind and knowledgeable in all my questions leading up to the big day! I want to thank these guys so much!!! For anyone considering this place, do it!!!
