I would definitely recommend this nail salon to anyone. I've been living in Gilbert a little over a year and I've only been coming here. The ambience of this place to get pampered is amazing. I love all the workers they are so nice and do exactly what you want. My nail tech ViVi is the bomb I come in will different nail ideas and she figures it out and I leave very happy. If you are ever in the area stop by and give them a try. I guarantee you'll be satisfied.
