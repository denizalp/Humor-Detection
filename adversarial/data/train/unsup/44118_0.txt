By my estimation, this would be your one stop shop dealership to go if your in the market for superior service , happy people and great products. I have been buying my 4 Runners from Moussa for many years. He's extremely efficient and a joy to do business with.  His other colleagues, Ryan and Ken are also great guys and know their jobs very well. I can't be any more grateful than to have these men assist me every time I show up for my new vehicles. I can honestly call them all my good friends.  I have always had the best experience and feel like I'm being taken care of to the best of their ability. The best part is they make every effort to get you want you want and out the door in an extremely timely manner.  All of the staff are amazing. Do yourselves a favor and avoid the haggling and shop here first. It is sooo worth it!
