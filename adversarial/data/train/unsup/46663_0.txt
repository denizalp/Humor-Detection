I went with a group of 8 for brunch - we had a diverse array of dietary preferences, ranging from gluten free, to completely meatless, and some who are avid carnivores. Overall, even the vegetarians were not ultra impressed. The bundt cake array was impressive, but none were world-rocking (honestly, there's only so much bundt cake one human can eat in a sitting). There was a dizzying quantity of noodles, some of which were pretty blas√©. My favorite dish was a vegetable and sesame noodle combo, which was fairly flavorful. The salad was predominantly iceberg lettuce, which was disappointing for a vegan hipster joint like this, where I'd expect more interesting combinations of veggies. There was a farro salad with parsley that was acceptable, but I have had much, much better at pretty much every Middle eastern restaurant I've ever been too. Sadly, blandness was pretty much the status quo at the Zenith, where I'd expected a punch of flavor to round out the veggie\/vegan fare.\n\nI would have given the place 2 stars for a pretty uninspired showing of mostly noodle\/bundt related items, but their quirky decor, fun aesthetic, and really tasty bottomless coffee for those waiting for a table - those made it a little less bland. One half extra star for ambiance, and one half extra star for being so committed to the vegan\/vegetarian ideal, which is rare enough in Pittsburgh. I hope they improve their flavors.\n\nWill I return again? Probably not. There are FAR better vegetarian and vegan restaurant in the 'Burgh. However, I'd recommend checking it out if you are looking for a quirky spot. It just probably won't top your list for places to return to frequently.
