We ordered take out last night from Apalla. It was delivered via Just Eat and came exactly at the time that I selected, which was a nice surprise (Indian always seems to take a very long time for delivery). \nOrdered achari chicken, saag paneer and daal. One order of naan and raita. \nFirst off, there was no rice. I couldn't imagine ANYONE eating Indian food without rice. I am not sure if this was a mistake or rice is to be ordered separately, but if it was the latter, they should have said something when I ordered because who in their right mind would want indian food without rice? I would have happily paid extra to have it, if only I had known it wouldn't have come with our order. Amazingly, we had leftover rice in the fridge that we were able to reheat and eat with our dinner. \nIn the meantime, we set about dipping the naan in the lentils and realized that an order of naan was only two small pieces. I have come to expect when eating at an indian restaurant, a nice basket full of fluffy naan. Again, if they had indicated on the menu that it was only half of a wheel of naan, then I would have ordered more. \nBesides these surprises, the food was excellent. The achari chicken was a nice mix of sour and spice, with the dill flavor quite complementary. The lentils and spinach were probably considered \"mild\" but did have a bit of heat that might be too intense for the more sensitive of palates. The raita was a bit thinner than I am used to, but helped balance the smokiness of the main dishes nonetheless. \nOverall, it was delicious and I would definitely order from Apalla again. My only recommendation is if you're going to do something out of the ordinary (not provide rice with entrees or give smaller than usual portions of naan) please let the customer know!
