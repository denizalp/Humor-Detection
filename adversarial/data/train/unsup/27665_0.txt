Life changing experience. I suffer from depression and anxiety everyday.  I meditate but nothing compares to this place. This place has saved my life and prevented my suicidal thoughts before i could act on them I thank each and every single soul who works for this place to get those who struggle back on track. I've been a member for a long time now. They even give hugs, somthing I haven't gotten in a very long time  they touched my heart that I thought was long gone.
