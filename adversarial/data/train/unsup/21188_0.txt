Mini shop located upstairs in Langham Square and opened later at night for those who wants an affordable dessert. \n\nOutside the shop, we saw tons of signs with the different food snacks that were sold at this shop. Egg waffles are on the affordable side - $2 for plain waffles, generally $2.50 to $3 for special waffles (e.g. ginger waffles, chocolate chip waffles, green tea waffles, etc.) They also had options for waffles with ice cream.\n\nPop Up House also sells tons of random products including old toys, notebooks, utensils (there were some forks here), and other mysterious items. They also have some ketchup, mustard, and relish on the shelves for people to use. There are two seats and a small table for a small amount of people to sit on.\n\nThe packaging of these snacks reminds me of some of those in HK. The bags and cups are generic cups and bags with premade designs on it. A VERY small green sticker with pop up house is stuck onto the packaging.\n\nWe got the green tea egg waffles $3. We were asked to wait 5-10 minutes, I think this place is for small business, if more people show up, I'm not sure if they would be ready. The egg waffle itself wasn't too good (in comparison to Tung Tung ones). I thought the green tea was actually slightly bitter. The egg waffles were cooked nicely though.
