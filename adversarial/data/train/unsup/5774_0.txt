K got a co-worker to cover her call so she asked me to pick up a cupcake for her as a \"Thank You\". Originally, I went over to Mind Over Batter but they've gone out of business. Hmm, so I checked on Yelp* and Sugarlips popped up. A couple miles a way was no biggie.\n\nThe place is cute enough. There was a good selection of cupcakes in the case. I saw a lot of information of their wedding cakes, or specialty cakes, as well. K needed a cupcake but how could I just bring one home. I bought the Chocolate Cupcake for K's friend, Red Velvet for me, Vanilla for K and White w\/ Sprinkles for C. Each cupcake was $2.50 and there was a \"check in\" deal from Yelp* for one free cupcake. Booyaa, love freebies. I want to also point out that Sugarlips did not charge tax. So, the 4 cupcakes minus the free one were $7.50.\n\nAlthough the 3 of us ate our cupcakes, we all came to the same conclusion about them.\nIt's a cupcake. No, really. Just a cupcake. Seemed to be the same size as the cupcakes I can make at home. The pricing was fair for the product. The cake tasted like cake. Just like the cake I get at Fry's, Safeway, Albertson's, my cousins house or really anywhere someone pops open a box of cake mix and makes cupcakes. The frosting was fine. Again, tasted like frosting. The kind that comes in a little can and you spread it on the cupcakes that you just made from a box mix. So it tastes fine. Nothing special. But, nothing bad either. \nOK Cupcakes. Fair prices w\/o tax added on. 3 Stars.
