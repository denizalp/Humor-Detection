Excellent breakfast restaurant. They have a large menu with many breakfast options to choose from. We had the egg white omelettes with hash browns, pumpkin bread, and banana bread. The food was very good and the portions were more than enough. The only problem was there was no soy or almond milk for my coffee. I just ran next door to Smiths and bought some almond milk...problem solved.
