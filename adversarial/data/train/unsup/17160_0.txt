I'll start by saying the staff at Casanova Bros. are very pleasant, care about the customer, and have a good sense of humor, so I like the establishment and want it to do well.  However, the current Yelp rating of 5 stars is overrated.  I'm giving it a 3 and couldn't possibly see justifying anything higher than 4.  This is not even close to being the best pizza in Gilbert, let alone a larger area.  It's slightly better than average pizza.  \n\nWe tried a pepperoni pie, garlic knots, and zeppolis.  All three were fine, but there was nothing impressive or memorable about them in any way.  Again, the most memorable thing about Casanova's is the staff, and that's a reason to go back.  If I lived very close it would probably be a place I'd go to semi-regularly, but living several miles away I don't think it would be worth the drive.  I'd go to Patsy Grimaldi's, Jimmy's of Chicago, Liberty Market, Joe's Farm Grill, Oregano's and possibly even Venezia's  before I'd choose Casanova Bros.
