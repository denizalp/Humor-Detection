Decided to give Thai Express a try after walking by many times during my lunch breaks @ Suncor Centre. \n\nJason is right about the lineups - be prepare to wait for about 10 minutes or so during the 'lunch rush', but it is totally worth it. Been there two times, had the yellow curry shrimp and the cashew nut beef stirfry - in both times they were delicious and tasted really fresh. Prices are fair: portions are HUGE - reason why I always get the take away box, I'm never able to finish the whole thing. Highly recommended!
