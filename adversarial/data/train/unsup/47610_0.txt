We have been going to this location since they opened, we go just once a year, It's our oldest sons favorite place to have dinner on his birthday. It's only been ok to fair \nIn the past but has gone downhill so fast I'm surprised they are still open. Today it didn't even deserve one star. Dirty, long wait to be acknowledged, servers have no idea what they are doing, no one actually seemed to know what they were doing. A few of us ordered off the regular menu and some ordered off the stir fry make your own menu. Surprised to come back to the table after making our meals and the rest of our table had been served their meals and were done. The beef or steak (whatever you want to call it) was honestly like hard leather. The fried rice was cold with hard clumps of white rice\nMixed in, we complained and what we were given wasn't any better than what we had although they said it was a new batch. Bathrooms were in bad shape. We have tolerated this service and lack of care for many birthdays since it's our sons special day but even he said today I think we need to find a new place to celebrate.
