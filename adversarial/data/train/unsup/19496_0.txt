This book is located inside the Green Valley Ranch. Plenty of parking in private lot and right next to parking garage. Best to park in garage.\n\nThis book is tied to the other station casinos. They're all pretty similar and have the big NFL football contests and you can even get entry money back at the end. They'll do anything to keep you coming in.\n\nAlso during football season they have $1 hotdogs, soda, beer and chips. Sweet deal if you like football and love heartburn.\n\nThe lines are always up to date and give a lot of prop bets. They book almost every sport and horseracing. \n\nThey have a VIP area you can sit in except when it's busy. Otherwise there are a lot of seats and a lot of tv's. Plus a big bar attached and restaurant and deli right next to it.\n\nThe books not open 24 hrs but open late.\n\nIt's a great all around book to bet at when in the area.
