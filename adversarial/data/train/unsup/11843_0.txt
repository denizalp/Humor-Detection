Love at first bite! I have a feeling this will be our go to restaurant for tasty New Mexican style food. It was mine and my boyfriend's first time and we were definitely blown away by our first impression. Our friendly waiter Tommy was very informative about his favorites on the menu and other popular items. The owner herself actually took the time to welcome us to her restaurant. She filled us in on their HH Mon-Fri 2-6 and all their great specials. Our entrees were very much enjoyed I got their trio combo with enchiladas and a tostada and my boyfriend got their Socorros grilled chicken and avocado. Their Prices were very reasonable. If you like real New Mexican style eating with hatch green Chile then surely get a spicy KICK out of this place. We will be back for seconds
