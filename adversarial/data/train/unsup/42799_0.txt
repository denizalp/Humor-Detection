Hockey game atmosphere is great. Vegas is getting worse and with high prices. $14 dollar 8-oz lite beers are getting old. Waters are $5 and you can't being in anything.  Security is a pain but since MGM can't manage anything we get screwed with that. Fill up and drink up outside.  Don't waste your money inside.
