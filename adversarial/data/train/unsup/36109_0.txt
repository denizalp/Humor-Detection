I recently had an appointment for a cut and highlight with Emily after relocating to AZ. I was nervous to start with a new stylist after going to the same person for the last 5 years but I could not be happier with Emily and her work! The salon is very clean and has a great environment. All of the staff was very friendly and customers were happy with their results. I look forward to my next appointment and definitely recommend trying Snapdragon out!
