5 stars for hooking it up on NYE sick like. We bought tickets for Diplo New Year's Eve and got to come back for free the next day New Year's Day for round 2. Also open bar both nights for a couple hours. The club is gorgeous and so spacious, you never feel crowded or claustrophobic like at most clubs, unless you're near the DJ but that's a given. You can dance and chill outside and the musics still bumpin. I love Hakkasan but I think ima have to give it to Surrender :-) Our experience was so fun, I forgot about the rude ushers tho =O
