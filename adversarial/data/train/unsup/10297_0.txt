I've heard about this buffet for the longest time, so we recently tried it out for a late dinner driving into Sin City. The location of the M Resort just takes a bit of planning, good for stopping by on the way in or out of the Strip. Otherwise, it can be a bit of a pain to drive out, even if you do have your own car. \n\nThe M Resort has a nice contemporary decor, sort of reminded me of Pechanga (where I used to be a regular at their buffet until they eliminated king crab legs). Signing up for their rewards card is a definite bonus for taking $2 off the buffet price. As for gambling, not so much. No luck for me here.\n\nEven though the line seemed long, it wasn't too bad. You can stare off into the flat screens and view the menu. Once seated, we went to work. I headed straight for the crab legs, which were huge clusters of snow crab legs with a ton of meat. It's great that they have warm or steamed, along with the cold version. Plus, they are pre-cracked at strategically located areas of the shell. If are adept, you can slide out a long piece of crab meat without breaking it. Succulent.\n\nI even helped myself to some of the raw oysters, which I had never tried before. Slimy, but fresh, was my first though. Not bad at all. Other notable items include soup selection and the dessert area. I wasn't that big of a fan of the prime rib (bland and tough), and the \"Asian\" entrees taste like your standard Chinese buffet fare. For dessert, make some room for their gelato. \n\nThe all-u-can-drink beer and wine is great, if you have a separate compartment in your stomach. I couldn't even finish a beer, I had to make room for the food. Service can be slow, and you just have to roll with the punches. For instance, many times there was only one dude in charge of cutting the meats. So unless you flag them down, you'll just stand there holding an empty plate. The same goes with the service. If you're a crab eater, ask for extra napkins and wetnaps.
