If I was a local and powerful don and I needed somewhere from which to run my crime syndicate,  this would be my home base.  Either here or Christos in Phoenix.  It has that formal Chicago\/New York Italian feel to it...and I like it a lot.\n\nAmbiance aside, the food is the real attraction.  Everything I've eaten there is of the finest quality, resembling the perfect blend of taste and presentation.
