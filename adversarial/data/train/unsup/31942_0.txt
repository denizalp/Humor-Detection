Decided to spend my overdue date with my bestfriend at Ruelo's afternoon tea. Service was mediocre to none from the beginning to end. ie. No welcome at the door, long wait to be served, tea selection was limited, did not offer refills unless asked. \n\nI actually thought inside was a lot bigger but it's actually quite tight. So my friend and I tend to feel interrupted by other people's conversations that were sitting next to us. I kinda wished that the tables were more spaced out but the max capacity was at 10ppl. \n\nMy friend and I both agreed that the two tiers of food was dry and not very appetizing. Desserts were pretty sweet but still delicious.\n\noverall: I wouldn't suggest afternoon tea at Ruleo since we left half of it untouched. You're better off just picking out your desserts and taking it home.
