You might need to be rude to eat.\n\nEmerald is a Chinese Restaurant that mainly serves as a banquet hall. The chairs are all covered with fake silk seat covers similar to an old banquet hall trying to look newer. This place is geared for very large groups. \n\nThe food is decent but the service is geared towards survival of the fittest. For Dim Sum it seems that you need to make yourself very visible in order to get served. Occupied ladies wheel the carts around with no set predictability or pattern. \"Excuse me can we have some more mustard sauce\"? might be the way you might ask for some sauce. Here, you might have to say \"WHERE IS THE SAUCE?\" \n\nBut if you don't mind being rude (because they don't) then you might like this place. Try sitting closer to the window if you can as the Dim Sum carts seem to frequent that area more.
