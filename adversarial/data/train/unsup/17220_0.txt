When you think about Smoked Meat Sandwiches, you think Schwartz's. But then you  think long lineups, Meh ambiance & a loud dining area where everything smells like Smoked Meat. That said, Schwartz's makes the best Smoked Meat sandwiches No question about it. A pound of smoked meat stacked in between rye bread with a dash of mustard. What's not to like about it. You have an option of askin for lean meat. But leaner the meat, less juicer it is, not to mention less tasty. Also get the pickle. This is a cash only establishment so make sure you are carrying cash. They do have an ATM in the back (But you end up paying 2.50 for a transaction)\n\n\nFood -  Great\nService - Ok\nAmbiance - What you talkin bout Willis\nWorth the money - AwwwwwYeaaaaahhhh
