Stayed here on a quick drive thru Vegas. I didn't want to spend a fortune on a room since we would only be there for less than 12 hours and figured the stratosphere is a well known hotel so the ruins should be decent. \nI was wrong!\nThe rooms you see online is nothing like the room you are provided. It's like they have a floor specifically for the deal finders. Run down, smells like cat piss, no views, dust piled an inch thick, carpets full of toe nail clippings, pubic hair all over the tub, paint peeling, carpet was disgusting, I could go on and on. \n\nI wouldn't stay here again if I was paid too. \n\nThe only thing worth the stay was the free trip to the top of the Stratosphere. \n\nIf the rooms were clean, the lack of view and lack of amenities wouldn't be an issue but the rooms are disgusting.
