Very friendly service! Great food! Good variety and more than just an ice cream shop. They have pizza and deli crepes too! Our family also appreciated that there was an indoor dining area with enough places to sit. They just need one of those little mini counter trash cans for their sample spoons. And napkin dispensers on each table would be nice too.
