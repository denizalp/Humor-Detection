I gotta say, Best bloody mary ever! However, I thought it was a build your own bloody mary,  but according to the bartender,  they just build whatever and give it to you. I was,a bit disappointed because I didn't get to pick and chose.  I paid $40 for the big bowl size, which it's an okay price. I went there twice and the first bartender was ok, not really friendly type. But the 2nd time we went, the  bartender, Ashley served us and was super rude and acted like we were stupid. I would recommend the place for anyone who wants a good bloody mary, just not the people. I don't know if it's just us, but the hostess to the bartender wasn't really welcoming.
