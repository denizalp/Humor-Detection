wonderful restaurant! the atmosphere really adds the charm to a diner done Vegas style! and the wait staff is super attentive. \n\nfood was excellent and are served in incredibly large portions, walked away very full!\n\ndidn't get a chance to check out the bar area, but definitely next time. \n\nmy only qualm about this place is the crazy wait! I think because this place is so hyped up and the food is good, more people tend to gravitate at the usual meal times. I think next time we'll try going at a time that isn't so busy. and since this place is twenty four hours, I definitely seeing another trip in the near future!
