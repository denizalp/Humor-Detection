Drove hours across the hot desert with a eight-year-old boy dying to jump into the pool, only to be told that the one and only pool at Rio has been reserved for a private event - namely a convention. Sorry, but there was no mention whatsoever on the website, or when we made a reservation, that the pool would not be available. When asked for consideration, the manager brushed us off and offered us the use of a pool that closed in 20 minutes across town. Poor.\n\nIt is not, nor should it be, acceptable to lease out the one and only pool in a desert resort for a private function without at least notifying guests of the inconvenience, and\/or offering them a discount. Very unprofessional. \n\nCoffee maker in the room: great. $8 charge per coffee pod: not so great.\n\nCockroach in our 11th floor bathroom: a wonderful reminder of my college days in NYC...not.\n\nMattress was torturously saggy. Just like college, except without a door to put underneath.\n\nWon't be coming back.
