This used to be a great place. A hidden little gem. Not any more. While the food and beer have stayed the same, the atmosphere hasn't. They have recently added a bottling machine to the brewery. It is unbearable! So loud, you can't have a conversation. Do not go here anymore. Go to the one in North Olmsted.
