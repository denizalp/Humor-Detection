Visiting Patterson's in the fall is pretty much a ritual for me. \n\nThey have the best apple cider in the world! Their honeycrisp apples are to die for. I can't comment much on the other apple treats because I'm not a big apple dessert person. If it doesn't contain chocolate then why bother? \n\nI really love going to the Fall Festival. Hayrides, corn mazes, apples, pumpkins, kettle korn! This year, I think everyone in Northeast Ohio got the memo because it was extremely overcrowded. It's usually a bit more low key. Or maybe because it was such a perfect fall day? Either way -- too many screaming, wild children with no manners and parents that were nowhere to be seen. \n\nNone of the above is Patterson's fault but it made the experience less fun. Also, I don't remember paying $6 for the festival. I'm sorry Patterson's but that's a complete rip-off. I think you should scale that down a tiny bit. $3 would be more acceptable.
