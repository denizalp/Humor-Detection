Never again. On my first trip to the store, i found the fish i was looking for. I left a deposit with owner Donna and told her i would be back first thing in the morning. I was there but she sold my fish. It's not a common fish. Who does this? What kind of business ethic is this. Will not be back. And won't be recommending. So surprised a small family business would do this, something i would expect from a big box store.
