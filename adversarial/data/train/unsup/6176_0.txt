Ok so I realize I can't really complain about a room that's only $22 a night when all I'm doing is sleeping there. But....being that Hoooters has a decent size \"name\" in the US, you'd think that the quality of the rooms would be a little better than what they are. \nThe beds are slumped in as if a 500+ man slept on it and it never recovered. (1 out of 2 beds in my room). Then, bed #2 was so loud, even rolling over made it sound like a train was rolling through the room. Spring style mattresses from the 70's??\nThe quality of the room was ghetto-ish to boot. \nFront desk customs service is great I must add though.
