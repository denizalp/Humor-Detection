It's fast and not as expensive maybe I am over thinking it but what is a spa pedicure???? well I was not greeted but they did eventually offer me service. I had soak, bath beads, trim, wash, and choose a color to paint on. Maybe they did not like that I had request for a shorter trim I didn't feel as relaxed. One and done
