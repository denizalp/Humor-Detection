A-1 has been in existence for many years now, and those in the Indian community living in Richmond Hill-Markham-Scarborough area, regard it as the go to spot for inexpensive takeout. \n\nIt's a tiny family-run restaurant with a few hired cooks in the kitchen, where you can order snacks like samosas, pani puri and even a full Thali. I'm not too keen on the Thalis, since I tend to find the spices pre-made, and the overall dishes exceptionally bland and infused with sugar, but I can see how this type of fast-food Indian restaurant would stay in business. It's a one-stop restaurant for anything you could think of ordering in terms of Indian food. \n\nThe desserts are also a hit and miss since I've found their Rasgulas to be fresh, soft and lightly sweet at times, like they ought to be and at others, hard as a rock and overly sweet, when they happen to be sitting out for a while. As it happens, you'll never know by simply looking at them. \n\nI do enjoy their samosas, however, since I believe they are made on location, because they taste very fresh, and well-stuffed and seasoned albeit very greasy.  \n\nI'll go here for the snacks, but I steer completely clear from main dishes.
