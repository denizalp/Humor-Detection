When I lived in Cleveland, people referred to this bridge as the Carnegie Bridge.  Apparently, its official name used to be the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge, but it was renamed in the '80s after Bob Hope's father, who was a Cleveland stonemason.\n\nIt's not quite as famous as its nearby cousin, the Detroit-Superior Bridge (the Blue Bridge), which was featured at the beginning of the Drew Carey Show, but it's pretty important in terms of connecting the West and East Sides in Cleveland.\n\nI didn't live too far from here, and when I was driving somewhere on the east side and not using the Shoreway, I almost always took this bridge, as Carnegie was a lot easier to maneuver than using Superior and going through Downtown.  I also walked across this bridge relatively often, including once in a ridiculous snowstorm.\n\nMy favorite parts of the bridge are the statues on either end of it.  If you're at all familiar with WPA-era neoclassical peans to labor, you'll love these statues.  Named the Guardians of Traffic, they're supposed to look Assyrian (I think), but they're also completely anachronistic, as the godlike figures are holding 1930s-era trucks in their hands.  This makes sense, though, as I believe the bridge was constructed during the Depression, possibly as part of the WPA or some other New Deal program.\n\nThe bridge does go over the Cuyahoga River, although much of what it spans is also solid ground.  I like the fact that bridges in Cleveland were named after the two streets they connect.  And if you want to sound like a local, don't pronounce Carnegie as you pronounce Carnegie Hall.  Instead, it's kar-NEG-ee, with an emphasis on the second syllable.
