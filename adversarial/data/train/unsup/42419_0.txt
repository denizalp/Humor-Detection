Don't get the hype.  Solid pizza, quality ingredients but ultimately doesn't come together into anything special.  Also thought quantity of toppings was a little chintzy for prices charged - got sausage and maybe got a quarter link total on half a 16\" pizza?  Hope for better from one of the highest rated pizza spots in town.
