I enjoyed reading the other reviews on yelp, I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds the 'Caribbean queen' rude and extremely terrifying! (she ripped the bill out of my hand one time,  she grew impatient waiting for me to get change out of my bag..)\n\nOnly giving her 3 stars though because her food has been inconsistent at times. One time the beef patty was TOO spicy, it left a burning sensation on my mouth. Other time, jerk chicken was burnt to a crisp. Then, another time, she ran out of jerk chicken on a Friday evening around 5 pm. We ordered the chicken roti instead.. the curry was watery and it was missing potatoes!\n\nConversation on the evening she ran out of jerk chicken:\n\nBF: Could we get a large jerk chicken to go?\nHer: *looks away* What if I told you..... there's NO more jerk chicken?\nBF: Wha... what do you mean?\n\nI don't know why she even asked such a hypothetical question, but looking back it was really funny how it all went down lol.\n\nHowever, all that being said, when she does things right, the jerk chicken and beef patty are amazing! Maybe you gotta catch her on her good days...
