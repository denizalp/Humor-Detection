Yikes. Dinner this past Saturday was chaos. People camped out at tables early to hear the live music, making it tough for those wanting dinner to get a table. 45 minutes after ordering, was told they were out of steak. When our meals finally arrived, they came in 3 shifts. None of us ate at the same time. The servers worked their butts off to make it a good experience, but it just was not. I'll stop in again, but it's going to be awhile. Management needs to rethink what they are doing.
