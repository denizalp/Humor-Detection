For the sake of arctic creatures... Change the name. This is a disgrace to arctic dwelling finely dressed penguins everywhere. \n\nThe Penguin use to be all that and a bag of nuts. They closed up and relaunched and I have to say that I think they are trying too hard. The names on the menus are ridiculous. Just call a burger a burger. Not a \"Billy Ray Ballentine\" ?!? This being the burger I had wasn't awful... Dry. But not awful. Fried pickles were standard but good. Drink came in a styrofoam cup and cutlery came in a nice plastic carrying case (to-go). I like the penguin better when service was poor, I was treated as an inconvenience, and the place had character. Now it just seems like a bland cookie cutter restaurant. \n\nFirst step to success. Owners should pay for all staff to have complete sleeve tattoos and a minimum of 6 piercing. And turn the lights down. I feel like I'm under a spot light. \n\nAll joking aside the penguin use to be good. The penguin could be good. Just needs work.
