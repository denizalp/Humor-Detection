Man, it was a busy Saturday, lol. I had to give this place a try since I heard so many good things about it. I walked in with a few friends and you actually order first at the back and they bring you the food later. I thought it was going to be where we sat down first then someone takes our order, but that wasn't the case. There was four of us and we got an order of a sandwich, omelet, and two eggs benedict. I got the eggs benedict and it was something new for me. I got to say it was really delicious. I loved it. The problem was that I had an appetite that day so I was still hungry, lol. \n\nThe staff were professional and the food came out in a timely manner. I took a sip of someone's orange juice at our table and well, lets just say they serve alcohol and it was quite tasty. The vibe of the place was nice and relaxed. Every one there seemed they were having a good time and it also looked very clean and organized. If the weather was nice or whatever you feel is nice there is an outdoor patio if you like eating outdoors. All in all, place was nice, staff was good, and food was awesome. I will definitely be back here again and if you love breakfast\/brunch then I'd say give this place a try!
