I'm not sure why there aren't more 5 star reviews but I really had a great move by Elite.  From the very first phone call explaining to me the whole process from beginning to delivery. Not only did they take the time to answer all my questions ( and believe me I had a lot ). They even told me how to save money on my move. What company does that???  My quote wasn't the cheapest and wasn't the most expensive. I had a lot of questions and they took the time to explain to me how the whole process worked and that's why I chose them AND guess what? Exactly how my rep told me what was going to happen did. On moving day even the moving crew were professional and really took care of my items wrapping each piece carefully. I was so relieved...now to wait for the delivery....... I was told it could take longer than the estimated time or sooner. Delivery happened yesterday and expecting a few things to be not in such pristine condition I am very happy to report not one item damaged, now I only have 2 boxes left to open but they're just sheets and towels, can't break those things :-) I will highly recommend Elite Moving & Storage to all my friends and Fam. GREAT JOB ELITE
