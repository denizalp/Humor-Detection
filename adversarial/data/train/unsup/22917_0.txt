There are many better indian food restaurants and this one is a shame to the cuisine. Not only is the food not fresh but the service is disgusting. Poorly dressed and sloppy. The food has a weird smell and the ambience of the place is gross. Would never go there or recommend it to anyone. Please stay away if you can.
