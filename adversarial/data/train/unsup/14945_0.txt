I used this company for the large remodel. The company employees are great and do quality work. The problem, however, is when subcontractors get involved. The plumbers and tile company subcontractors were unreliable on their start times and the quality of their work was lacking. Parts of their work had to be redone. You can only imagine how happy they were about that!  Whew!  Glad that project is done. Too bad the subcontractors drag this company down.\n\n I do have the correct company....Check out their reviews on Angie's List. \n\nIsn't it odd that so many reviews involve an estimator by the name of Alex when the company has several estimators?
