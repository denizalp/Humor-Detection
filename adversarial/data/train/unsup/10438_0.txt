Are you yearning for something delicious but you don't know where to eat? Futo Buta will satisfy. \nGet the Fire & Ice ramen($14), and you'll thank me. I've slurped ramen bowls in many ramen shops, and this is one of the best. This tantalizing bowl is incredible and very flavorful. With few unique ingredients, the Fire & Ice ramen is a game changer. The kimchi and dashi broth is mild and the hot smoked salmon makes it more interesting.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n- Futo Buta is closed on Mondays.\n- They don't take reservations, and no seating of incomplete parties, Also, due to the limited space, during busy hours, they enforce time limits. \n\nFour and Half Yelps
