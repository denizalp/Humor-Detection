Just an okay 24hr Fitness, but I will continue to go here if I'm in the area.  \n\nI should be nostalgic about this gym since it's the very first 24hr that I ever worked out in.  Now, I'm hitting up most of the 24hr's around our beautiful city.  Like most gyms, this one is busy on Saturday morning, Monday's, and Tuesday's.  There's enough equipment here, but because of all the gym goers, the equipment can be taken at times.  Size and cleanliness is okay.  The bottom line is whether you're able to get a good workout or not. And for me, I always seem to get a great workout here.  \n\nMy one issue here is their lack of dumbbells, weights (the plates), and safety collars.  The dumbbell racks are usually missing dumbbells, the benches missing collars, and you have to walk the entire gym looking for that missing weight plate.  It's even worse when someone is loading up the leg press with over 1000 lbs.  When I see that, I know it's going to be a long night.  \n\nI'm probably biased because I love the Summerlin, Centennial, and North Las Vegas 24's.  But I will still make my way out here for a workout to change things up.
