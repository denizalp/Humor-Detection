We order from Vocelli fairly often, and I must say that for a chain, they  are quite good. \n\nAvoid the Steak Panini (what they call a hoagie, using the improper plural). It lowers the tone. Can you say Steakumms? Uh yeah.\n\nOther than that misstep, I have a healthy relationship with their Italian and Meatball Panini. Their Oven-Baked Wings are tender and flavor-packed, and their pizzas taste like they came from an indy parlor; doughy crust, gooey cheese, fresh toppings. If their pizzas are frozen, they do a good job of making them taste homemade. Maybe they're made in New York and freeze-dried or something?  A fine pizza it is. No caveats.
