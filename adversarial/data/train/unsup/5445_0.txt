Came by for dinner on a Friday night around 8 pm to see no line for a $39 dinner buffet! We had to pay immediately before a few minute wait to get seated. ...the staff at the Buffet tend to be more \"experienced\" for Las Vegas standards...Las Vegas tends to have more \"junior\" employees in the service industry...\n\nThe buffet was top tier. The BBQ beef brisket literally melted in my mouth! The veal cutlets, lamb chops, prime rib, cooked oysters, and lamb stew were all very tender and well flavored.\n\nSome of the other notable delicacies included smoked salmon, prosciutto, crab legs (already cut in half), pot stickers, and shrimp cocktail.\n\nSome of the items that I would pass on next time include the tempura, sushi, creme brulee that was too sweet, the profiteroles that had too much whipped cream, and fried chicken.\n\nService was decent for a buffet. The ambiance was on the \"casual\" side but the food and service definitely made up for it.\n\n...one buffet per Vegas trip should be more than enough! :)
