When I first heard of this show called KA, I immediately thought \"BIRDS\"! \n\nHA!\n \nI bought tickets for my family as a Christmas gift to watch Ka at MGM GRAND because I wanted to give them something they would remember long term. I had a choice of \"O\" at Bellagio,\" Mystere\" at Treasure Island and \"Ka\" at MGM GRAND so I picked Ka because it was the newest Cirque show at that time and cheaper then \"O\". \nThe lines were long to buy your tickets but luckily I just had to pick them up at will call.  =P\n\nTIP**\n\nDON'T MISS THE PRESHOW!!\n\nI won't give too much information about the show but it's an Asian theme involving a royal family and twins that try to find each other......  =I \n\nKids would love this type of showed since it's geared towards a younger crowd.\n\nThat's all I'm going to say!    LOL\n\nThe show followed the storyline perfectly compared to Mystere if it had a storyline and my parents took a while to understand what was going on after my sister's explained it after the show. What I loved about the show was the evolving stage and the use of props and lighting to change from one scene to the next, I thought that was very innovative in stage production and made you wonder what was going to happen next.
