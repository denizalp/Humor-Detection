Impressed with the fast service kiosks! This location is always busy with a line it the door, so it's nice to have another ordering option. There's an option for special instructions on the kiosk, so I took full advantage and asked if my salad could be tossed in dressing (I ordered To-go). I was a little disappointed to see a small ramekin of dressing stuffed in the dry salad... wondering if those special instructions are actually seen. \n  Overall I had a pleasant experience. The food is always fresh and I appreciate the plant-based section of the menu. The new teas are also phenomenal!
