If I were just able to give this place a zilch (0) rating, I WOULD!\n\nWhen I was about 7 years old, my Dad cooked my sister, my brother and me some sort of eggplant dinner.  I don't know what it is about eggplant (since then and up until now) but neither three of us were able to stand the horrid\/sour\/bitter taste of it (kapooey).  My brother, who was six years of age back then, was forced to finish up every bite of the eggplant that was staring him down on his plate.  He took a couple of bites and then regurgitated it all up back on his plate.  My dad had fumes and steam and redness marked all over his face\/neck and we knew he was thinking \"you have DISRESPECTED MY COOKING!\" It was instantly after throwing it up that my Father told my brother to spoon up the eggplant and eat it all within 5 minutes, or ELSE! So my brother did what he was told and re-consumed every single bite  on his plate.  We were ALL traumatized by this pitiful event.  \n\nWith that said, I would rather go through that eggplant experience again and eat my own vomit than ever go back to LAX in in the Luxor, Vegas!  That place had no dancefloor, no ventilation and you can see all the smoke from cigarettes circulate the air because the venue is so damn small! Enough said.....Major NAY for LAX!
