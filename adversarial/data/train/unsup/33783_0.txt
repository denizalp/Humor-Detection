I've been there a few times with my wife.\n\nOne good thing is that lunch menu is good until 4 p.m. The lunch combos are a good price and the food is usually good. I would advise to make sure you specify beef, chicken or cheese if you are getting something that could go many ways. The default seems to be cheese.\n\nMy wife does like the chile relleno. They do offer chips while you wait.\n\nThe service is hit or miss. I've been there during some slow times, and the service can disappear.\n\nHowever, this overall is a solid choice if you are in the area. I will be back.
