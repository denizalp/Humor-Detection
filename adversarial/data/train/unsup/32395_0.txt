The only good thing about this place is the tacos. Service is slow, but good, when you get it. The inside is hot and stuffy; I get arizona is hot but there should be ac inside. I think it was just one part of the restaurant. The queso was terrible and cold. Tacos, Sonoran dog, amazing. I think this would have been better had it not been sweltering inside.
