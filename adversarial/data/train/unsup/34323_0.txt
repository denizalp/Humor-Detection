After reading some of the reviews about this place I was hesitant to stop in, but I'm happy I did. I can understand how some of the other reviewers could see how the owner could come across as a little brash, but he is just very straightforward. \n\nThe biggest thing that surprised me about this place were the prices. I've searched everywhere and this place beats the prices of everyone hands down. He was even willing to order me a model he didn't have on hand at a discount. Eventually I settled on a much better model for only $50 more than the one I went in to buy. Overall it was the best experience I could have asked for and I really appreciated the transparent and direct manner that the owner handles business. I'll be going back for all my needs in the future for sure!
