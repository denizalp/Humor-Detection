I will admit, I left Pittsburgh before Jason Opened Black Cat Tattoos. But I can not speak highly enough of Jason and his work. He is the nicest, calmest, friendliest tattoo I have known. Along with his great attitude, his work is outstanding. He keeps it bold and beautiful just like a tattoo should be. No fancy tricks, just good solid tattoos.\nDon't walk, run to black Cat Tattoos. I would but I can't run 3000 miles... Heck I can't even run a mile.
