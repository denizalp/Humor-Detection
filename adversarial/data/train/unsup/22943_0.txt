This restaurant is connected to a Red Ribbon bakery and in a nice shopping center that I frequent weekly. This particular Jollibee has absolutely the worst customer service and quality of food in the Jollibee chain.\n \nThe food regularly comes out cold (chicken, spaghetti) and what's astonishing is that front and back of the house staff is robust. The staff aren't really socializing with each other or rude as much as they seem to be focused on everything but providing timely and at best decent customer service. \n\nDo not come here doing meal times (lunch and dinner), they will either forget ringing up your order and you'll end up waiting for 30 minutes or they'll serve it right away to you...cold. \n\nAs far as ordering the chicken here, beware of ordering the chicken \"spicy.\" They douse it in so many spices that its inedible as your throat burns on every bite. Our last and final meal here of fried chicken was so bad that my husband had an allergic reaction and we ended up going to the ER after that meal. Plus to add insult to injury, the bathrooms they share with Red Ribbon are always poorly maintained.\n\nIf you have a choice I would avoid this location and drive to the Seafood City location.
