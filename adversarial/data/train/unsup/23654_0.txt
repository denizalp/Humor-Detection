Believe the hype, my friends. This hidden treasure on the West Side is simply outstanding. Superb food, friendly and knowledgeable service, and a wine\/beer list filled with crap I've never heard of add up to one of the best dining experiences I've had...well, anywhere in the states. No kidding. I hate the word \"foodie,\" but if embracing it means I'll eat at more places like this, bring it on.\n\n(Note to bachelor dudes like myself: If you bring a date here, she will be crazy impressed and may actually pay attention to the bullshit you usually talk about.)
