Anyone who gave the Hard Rock under 3 stars is either an idiot or an old fart who just didn't get it.\n\nI recently had an epiphany: the ONLY place to stay in Vegas is the Hard Rock.  I don't care what anyone else has to say about it.  All of those other big time casinos are too huge, desensitized, impersonal and just plain suck to stay at.  I like the fact that I recognize certain employees at the Hard Rock- and they recognize and are friendly to me as well.  Those huge mega casinos are fun to visit for a club or restaurant, but staying at them is like getting lost in the mall of america.  Senior citizens and screaming children running up and down the hallways- uh, yea...NO THANK YOU.  Kids shouldn't even be allowed in Vegas in the first place.\n\nThe Hard Rock is so fun, young, edgy, hip, beautiful, has great music and the best all-around party scene in Vegas.  The only other casino that can compete is the Palms, but I still think HR is better because its just so much cooler.  It has great restaurants and great entertainment.  AND, its only going to get better with the expansion.  Body English is arguably the best club in Vegas and Rehab is definitely the best summertime party for sure.  The Hard Rock Store carries quality items that I'd actually want to buy outside of Vegas- not the cheap \"Las Vegas\" crap merchandise or Celine Dion memorabilia- I'm talking cute clothes, great designers and nice jewelry.\n\nNot to mention the rooms!  Their beds are so comfortable.  And the rooms are decorated well- not cheesy with crappy generic furniture and floral wallpaper.  They're in the process of expanding the hotel so the construction noise does suck, but you should be too drunk\/hungover to be bothered by that anyways, right?!  And, we must all pay some price for improvement....I just hope that the expansion doesn't take away the great vibe the hard rock has now. \n\nOh, cant wait to go back on opening day of Rehab...I'd move into the Hard Rock if I could.
