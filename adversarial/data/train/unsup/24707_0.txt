Wahoo! A cirque show that didn't make me wanna slit my wrist or stare at my watch!\n\nZumanity is the best Cirque show, ever. Sexy, crass, raunchy, exotic, sexy, spicy, funny, and erotic. It is the VEGAS side of Cirque... Sensual, not so much...\n\nThe cast is beautiful, talented, funny, and charming. The show is MCed by a drag queen. Then goes on to explore sex. Gay, straight, lesbian, props, it's all there! Definitely go to this show with a lover... You'll have a lot of fun and strike up some creative ideas and places to do your \"thang.\"\n\nThis show is more topless than anything. As far as the men go, it's all butts, no nuts. As in most (all in my opinion) Cirque shows, there is no real story, just an overall theme.
