This event is one of my favorite events of the holidays. It's a fun place to shop and hang out with the local community during the Christmas season. Phoestivus features several tents of over a hundred local vendors selling hand-crafted gift items and locally grown, produced and prepared foods just outside Phoenix Public Market. They meet twice a year just before Christmas. Also on hand are several food trucks and fun activities for families. Some activities include the \"Pheats of Strength\" and the \"Airing of Grievances\". If any of this sounds familiar, there was an episode of Seinfeld that featured a festivus event (a parody and secular holiday celebrated on Dec 23 to combat the commercialism of Christmas). Phoestivus is the Phoenix version of that event and was created by Ken Clark of Get your PHX in 2009. I like walking around through the crowds of people on a cold evening with a coffee in hand. I also really enjoy seeing the creativity of some of the crafts. It's amazing some of the stuff people come up with. Phoenix Ale Brewery makes a pretty good beer called Phoestivus Ale that celebrates the event and is usually on hand to purchase. The Sound Bite truck has storytelling and a choir that sings Christmas carols and the Abominable Snow Monster (from Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer) walks around and greets people. You definitely can't leave without getting your photo with Hipster Santa. Phoestivus is free to attend and draws a bigger crowd every year.
