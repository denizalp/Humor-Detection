Honestly, the only thing to get\/look at is their Chocolates at the chocolate bar. Everything else is your standard candy shop items. \n\nAt the chocolate bar, you can participate in a free chocolate tasting. They put pieces of chocolate on a laminated sheet that has their varieties of chocolate. They'll tell you about the different flavor profiles and what to expect. My parents enjoyed it when we stopped by here and they grabbed a couple of their bars.
