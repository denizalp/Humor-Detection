The shop is nice. The woman who greeted me was friendly. They did an alright job on my nails. I am very particular so the technician doing my nails was getting frustrated with my requests, which were not anything crazy. She did a good job, I have to go in and clean up the clear final coat because it's glopped on. I will definitely go back because their prices are good, their work is above average and it's a convenient location.
