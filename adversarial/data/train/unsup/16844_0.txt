First time coming to this location & it was ok. We used to live closer to the downtown one & loved going there! Food & service was consistently good! We stopped here for lunch on Saturday & they seemed a little disorganized. When we responded, \"dining in\" to the greeter's question, he then appeared confused on where to sit us. He kind of walked us around & kind of told us to pick where we'd like to sit. We had no preference so he took us to a booth but he needed to have some boxes removed first. It was odd since they weren't very busy & there was plenty of other seating. Our waitress was a delight though! Friendly & attentive! I tried one of the seasonal specials, the Roasted Veggie Penne Salad, & it was tasty! Hit the spot! The other weird thing was the tables seemed dirty. I noticed my napkin was sticking to it & when I went to lift it, some of it tore off & stuck to the table. Then I realized what I thought was the \"style\" of the table, grey with white splotches, was actually just a bunch of napkin pieces stuck all over. It was like that at our table & the ones next to us. Not sure we'd come back to this location. Maybe we'd just order pick up next time.
