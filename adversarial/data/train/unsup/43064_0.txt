My husband and I have quite a few tattoos, so we expect to be treated a little differently sometimes. But when we walked into this place, no one wanted to serve us, and when someone finally did, she acted very much like we were not welcome. After a bit, no one came to refill my coffee so my husband asked if I could get some more and the waitress scoffed at him like it would be an inconvenience for her to do so. That was the final straw. I left $20 on the table to pay for our order and we left. Ridiculous.
