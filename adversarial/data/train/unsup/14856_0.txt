I wanted to commend your staff on the outstanding job they did on my car. Especially, my change holder that they completed cleaned out. Thanks for leaving the pennies and nickels though. I really appreciate that, but the manager Manuel is going to find out who did it. Once you crack that case Columbo come see me for some additional work. Thanks, I can't wait to come back for the free car wash you offered Manuel. I'll make sure I clean out my car of all valuables before I return.
