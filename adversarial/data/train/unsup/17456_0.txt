Absolutely, LOVE LOVE LOVE Light!!!!\n\nI had so much fun at Light, and it was just one of those nights where the vibe was just right. Even though the line looked super long, we all got in fine, and the space was well put together. It's just one big stage, I didn't really explore much, but it was just one focal point when you walked in. There was a dance floor, 2nd floor and a top floor. There were also aerialist performing all over the club which was super awesome. Light is definitely one of my favorite places in Vegas now! Thank you for putting it together Mandalay!
