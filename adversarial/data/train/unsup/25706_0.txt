Seriously, awesome find. If you ride the monorail at all, you've probably passed the huge Battista's sign next to the Westin Casuarina. Follow the sign and find your way into a charming and romantic side of old Vegas. \n\nThe food is decent. I've had better. I've had worse. The wine is what you would expect unlimited house wine to taste like. Having said that, for twenty something dollars, you can have garlic bread, salad (or Minestrone if you're not into the greens), a heaping bowl of pasta, and cappuccino that sort of tastes like maple syrup infused with chocolate (in an absolutely incredible way). Did I mention the unlimited wine part? You can drink loads and loads of wine here - it's light, and refreshing, and though it's not the best tasting, you get used to it. This place is about an incredible experience. It's about taking a breath of fresh air and enjoying a slow and luxurious dinner, filled with wine and a musician who will come to your table and play you a song (he did a rendition of California - like the older song, not the one from the O.C.). It's not just a dinner - it's an experience - one you'll come away loving. And as a bonus, you may not need to pay for food for another 24 hours because you will be stuffed!\n\nBonus - two separate people told us we were a cute couple. That's right, people went out of there way to be very nice for absolutely no reason other than to be nice. People are warm, the place is warm, with a decorated ceiling that makes you feel like you're in a real Italian home.
