Heart Sushi is beyond 5 stars!  I would give it 6 stars if I could. I went at around 3pm for a late lunch and the restaurant was still super busy. However, we were seated promptly and right next to the tv...which was important because the NFC Championship game was on and I politely asked them to turn the channel from the Intense sport of Curling to a more calm and interesting sport of Football.  The host and waiter were super nice and handed me the remote controller and I was able to watch football and eat sushi at the same time!!!!  \n\nWe ordered our Sushi from the fancy iPads along with plenty of other cooked dishes such as salmon, beef, chicken balls, and tempura.  The Sushi was delicious and I ordered my usual salmon, eel, tuna, butterfish, and tilapia sushi.  All of the food came out quick and fresh!  \n\nOur server was attentive and catered to our every need! My cup of water never went empty and our dirty plates were taken off quickly and efficiently.  Heart Sushi is one of the best AYCE Sushi places I have ever been too and will definitely be going back!\n\nPrice for lunch was $16.99 per person which is reasonable and dinner price is $26.99.  Well worth the price!  Parking is easy and there are plenty of spaces!\n\nI absolutely in love and head over heels with Heart Sushi!
