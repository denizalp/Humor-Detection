I have not gone to KFC in years but decided to try again as I liked the extra crispy. Three weeks ago I went to the store on Mount Pleasant. I ordered a bucket and asked for all extra crispy. I heard the cashier tell the cook. The cook said to make sure to key it in the register. I get home and half the chicken is regular. Okay. Human error. Yesterday I went to same store and asked for 12 pieces with fries. I asked to please make sure that it is ALL extra crispy. I get home and there are  NO FRIES!!! I may go to KFC again but never the one on Mount Pleasant. They are just not worth the frustration.
