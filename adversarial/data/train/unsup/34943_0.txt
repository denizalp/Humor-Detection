My boyfriend and I wanted \"real\" italian. Not out of the box dried pasta like Ventanos. \nService was great. The owner was the first to greet us. Our server was kind and there  if we needed anything. \nThere wasn't much of a crowd considering it was a tuesday and our food came fast. Low lighting and soft music. GREAT food!\n\nI'll be back!!!
