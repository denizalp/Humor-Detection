Stepping into Frankie's for the first time is a time warp out of the desert of the millennium and into a dark Polynesian lagoon set from a 1960's tropical B-horror movie.  The lighting is almost pitch dim and a cloud of smoke floats out as you open the door.  As soon as your eyes adjust you are bombarded with totems and bamboo at every nook and corner.  There is no possible explanation for just how much detail has been paid to the decor.  \"Tiki room\" is not a gimmick for this place at all!  It puts even Disneyland's tropical attempt to shame.  \n\nThe jukebox plays surf and lounge accordingly and the crowd is lively and eclectic.  Yet nobody is apt to pull any tomsnickery here either.  The bar is much cooler than anyone in it at any time.  You get a sense of respect, almost, for the Gods of the Pacific that surround you at every angle.  Snap out of it!  It's time to order your drinks!  \n                                       \n                       *I recommend the FINK BOMB*\n\nThe drinks aren't cheap for any old bar($9 for signature drinks), but no bar serves drinks of this caliber anywhere.  Strong too!  Look towards the bar and adorn the array of signature tiki-mugs each made specifically for this oasis in the desert.  Make a choice and buy your drink in one for 25$.  You must!  They are amazingly posh and necessary for your collection.  We own 2 sets of each of them.  Yeah, the drinks are that good.  I cannot go into great detail for you here just take my words as an invitation.  If you think you are into this kind of thing than go!
