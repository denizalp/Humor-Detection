This is a nice little pub.\n\nJanuary is everything you would want out of a bartender - funny, quick to serve up your next beverage and easy on the eyes.  I had the SunUp IPA, pretty tasty.  \n\nTo eat I ordered the Sonoran Chicken Salad - or something along those lines.  Aside from the sliced chicken breast, the salad tasted exactly like the prepackaged southwestern salad you can get at the supermarket.  I'm not all together sure that they didn't just give me the salad straight from the bag.
