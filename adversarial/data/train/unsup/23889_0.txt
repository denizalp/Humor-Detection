I swear they put crack in Pan Roast! How is it so good?!? It was my bf and I first time and we ate it three times while our stay in Vegas. We got really lucky we didn't have to wait that long. My advice is go around 7-10am and 12am-2am. Their Pan Roast is like a spicy gumbo\/ chowder. I like my food to be spicy so I got level 8. Our first night there my Bf got the Gumbo and it was not good. I don't recommend that dish. But the Pan Roast and Bouill Roast are my two fav dishes. The seafood in it tastes so fresh and with the rice it's even more amazing! We also ordered half a dozen of Oysters but it was not good. I like my Oysters on the small size and these one were huge!!
