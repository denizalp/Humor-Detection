My friend and I found this place on Yelp. We were searching for an Asian place that served soupy dishes to get to go. This was the only one we found at the Venetian.\n\nWe came to the podium entrance to put in our to go orders. The waitress did give suggestions on what to order if we liked spicy dishes, wanted to know popular dishes, etc. She also let us know that it would take 30 minutes for our order, but we decided to wait for it because we wanted some soup! I ordered the won ton noodle soup and swapped the noodles for vermicelli noodles. I believe the total was about $12. When I got my dish, I didn't think it was worth $12 to be honest but then I guess it's food on the Strip so it's overpriced lol. The wontons were made of shrimp and pork I believe. The noodles were so soggy and there was barely any broth because our to go food was just sitting at the counter and not given to us when it was ready. I had to check with the waitress to see when it would be done for her to realize it had been sitting there. I'm not sure if I'd come back.
