I thoroughly enjoyed my Chicken Piccata dish. It was perfectly cooked and it came with like a sour kraut stuff instead of pasta. Sounds funky but it worked and hit the spot. I'd eat here again. \n\nThe only reason these guys aren't getting 5 stars is the Mandalay Bay got me pretty good on the slots.
