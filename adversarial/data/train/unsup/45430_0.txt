For $8, you get your selected type of soon tofu along with purple rice and very decent portioned kimchee\/side dishes.\n\nServers here were very efficient and nice. We went at a later time right before they were about to close and there were no problems.\n\nI love soon tofu and this place is deserves to have it in its name.\n\nOnly downside I can think of the lack of other dishes. Dont remember seeing gamjatang etc on the menu, but the bf tried their kalbi beef and he liked it.
