Thorough and grateful.  That's how I like my men.\n\nKidding, kidding.  However, it still does describe the service center here.  My car pooped out and had to be towed.  My warranty still in effect, they fixed not one but three problems in a matter of hours and had the car washed and ready for me when I got off work.\n\nI gave them a great review and David was so grateful he sent me a hand written thank-you card and an offer for free service.  Who does that?  It just added a nice personal touch and really made my day.  It's the most painless attention I've ever had from a dealership.  I guess it does pay to be nice!\n\nIf you ever need a Honda serviced, go find David Mach!
