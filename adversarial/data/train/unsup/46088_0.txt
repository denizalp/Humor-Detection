It is good, but I have not been back since my first visit.  There are much better sushi places in Las Vegas if you are going to spend this kind of money.  I tried a couple of the samba rolls, and for as much thought as it appears going into them, I was expecting more flavor.  They were all good, just nothing special that is going to make me go back.  Service was also good, but really, nothing from this place stands out to me as exceptional.  You will get a good meal, but nothing special.
