The Skinny: good deals aplenty but shop online instead because it's hard to find anything in store (3).\n\nI never shopped at Kohl's before until this year. But I got suckered into buying stuff by the Hubs who gets Kohl's cash alot (I don't know where...they just sort of keep popping up). I mostly shop for my daughter here and I shop online - not in store because it's a major hassle to shop with a infant in tow. \n\nThat being said, the online shopping experience leaves a lot to be desired because a lot their clearance stuff is strictly online. You have to ship to the home where they charge you for shipping (lame!). Maybe I am spoiled by REI where if you ship to store, the shipping is free.\n\nShopping online and pick up at the store in theory should be easy however it isn't unusual for the customer service desk to be overwhelmed by returns and you have to wait a while to pick up your stuff.\n\nThe really good thing is the return policy. If you don't like it, returns are really hassle free. Even better - if the item you purchase is not considered clearance, you can pick out something else for MSRP value from the same department. Nice, right? I bought a clothing item (got it really on sale) for the daughter which was too small and returned it for different item from the same brand. Sweet.\n\nAll the discounts really aren't that good unless you hit a lucky and get 40% off your purchase on top of a sale and combine it with some Kohl's cash or other promotion discounting.
