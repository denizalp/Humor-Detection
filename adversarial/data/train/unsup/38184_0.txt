One of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. Came with friends and it was disastrous. From the trashy red haired lady at the host stand, to the highly rude and unprofessional staff I can't decide what was worse. I was rushed out of their so quickly it was unbelievable. The waitress, which was an older blonde lady, what she didn't know could fill a book. To cap it all off, this older guy who I'm led to believe was the manager, an old bald guy basically told me I had to hurry up. Rudeness personified. The salads were rotten and the way it's presented is so redneck trash. Brings out a plate of rotten lettuce and vegetables, the veggies were from another table because it still had dressing on it which means they re-use them which is absolutely disgusting. What if that person was sick?  They don't care at Beef N Bottle. The quality of steak is really low BTW, barely choice. Really tough and full of gristle. Low low quality restaurant. Will never go back.
