I ordered using ubereats, and while the food was pretty good, they forgot to give me utensils and napkins. I had to walk around my hotel to find both I could use to eat. I included in my \"additional notes\" section on ubereats for napkins and utensils to be included as well, so that was a bummer when it wasn't. I got the cilantro jalape√±o hummus, Mediterranean chicken salad, and the garlic new potatoes side. Everything was great except for the potatoes--a little on the bland side.
