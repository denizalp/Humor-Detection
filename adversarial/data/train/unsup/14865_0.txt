16 oz. Prime Cut Rib Eye was the best steak I have ever eaten in my entire life!!! I was literally in heaven while devouring this precious piece of meat! I couldn't even open my eyes while I was chewing bc it was so mf ono just melting away in my mouth! \n\nThank you baby jesus to the steakhouse who closed at 930 who reccommended me to come here!!!!! \n\nBEST STEAK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI am definitely going back on my next visit to Vegas!
