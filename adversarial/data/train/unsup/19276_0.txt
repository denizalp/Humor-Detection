If you go on a good Spring day, not too hot, not too cold, this place is lovely.\n\nIt's a very nice nature walk filled with all sort of birds and animals.  The pathways are nice, as are the staff and volunteers.  I went here after hearing some good things about the place, and the positivity is justified.  It's the sort of place where you could could just sit in their little park area with a book and while away some time.  I don't know if they allow food inside, but it would make for an excellent picnic spot.\n\nIt's bigger than it looks, and with the exception of some of the more jungle-type animals, it seems more diverse than the zoo that is in town.  The place caught fire some months back, but the damage is gone, and apparently the animals are all well on the mend.\n\nYou can apparently even adopt some of the animals with a donation and the promise of a good home.  I am set on adopting a chicken so I can have it run around and eat bugs, but also because I want to be \"that guy\" in my neighborhood.  You know, the guy who randomly owns a chicken on the block.  We all have dreams, and this is mine.\n\nFinding it is a little off the beaten path, but I am somewhat entranced by the place.  Besides, it seems like everything done here is for a good cause, and I find myself in support of what they are working to do.\n\nI like it.  Quite a bit, actually.
