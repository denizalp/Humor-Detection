Solid place for Chinese food.  Prompt service, very nicely decorated and clean interior.  Would recommend coming here to sit down for a meal.  \n\nThe lunch menu was somewhat limited with about 15 different entree choices.  No formal appetizers or sides were offered for lunch.  On the menu there were no real vegetarian options; however, they are able to make dishes without meat. \n\nI ended up ordering the Moo Goo Gai Pan without chicken.  The meal tasted great and was served nice and hot.  It could have been a bit spicier for my liking, but overall was quite satisfying.  \n\nThis place is relatively inexpensive with quick service and good food.  I'm not convinced its the greatest Chinese restaurant in the area, but it is a good one.
