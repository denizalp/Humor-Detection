American Junkie is pretty much the place to be.\n\nLet me tell you a little story about this place.\n\nI decide to go out on a Wednesday for a few drinks, my friends convince me that 'Junkie' is the place to be.  Having no idea what to expect, I show up and the place is wall to wall packed. We probably wouldn't have gotten in, thankfully one of the guys I was with is buddy buddy with the VIP host Ghiz. Really cool guy, talked with him for a little about body building, babies and skinny jeans.\n\nAfter a few shots of rumplemintz I find myself covered in whipped cream taking body shots off of some chick on top of the bar with some spray tanned Jersey guy (think his name was jeff?) instructing me through a megaphone.\n\nCut to next frame, copious amounts of confetti are flying through the air, people are dancing on furniture, some cute little waitress Jordin is feeding me a boob beer bong.\n\nNext thing I know Im waking up on a couch with no clue as to where I am. All I know is that last night was crazy.  Realizing I am credit cardless, I hitch a ride back to Junkie so that my life can go back to normal. I get to junkie to pick up my card and decide to grab a bite. Food was actually pretty good! I had the maui pizza, great hangover remedy.
