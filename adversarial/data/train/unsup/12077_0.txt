Hmm, where to put K-bop... probably 3.5 stars but leaning towards the 3. Walking in the door, the surroundings are groovy! The restaurant was adequately contrived. \n\nThe Happy Hour here is for 30% off on drinks only, and runs from 3pm - 7pm. I purchased a couple of Hot Sake's. They were sharp and tasty. Soon afterwards, I ordered some food.\n\nTo begin with, I have no choice but to scrutinize the water. It had a murky, pond-river taste. I perceived that it materialized straight from the sink. Grrr....\n\nOk, so now the food. While inspecting the prices of the tapas, and then scanning the pics taken by other Yelpers, I concluded that it would be more reasonable to order an entree rather than to procure a tapas. (Even after the meal, my belief was that, all in all, every item on the menu was about 2 dollars overpriced)\n\nBanchan - Positively satisfying, but small. \n\nSoon Doobu - Basically, a spicy seafood stew with ultra-soft tofu. The broth, seafood, and vegetables tasted good. Regrettably, as many other Yelpers have said, it's way to damn spicy!!! (and I LOVE spicy, but it was too much) Furthermore, temperature wise, soon doobu should be bubbling insanely when it arrives to the customer. The one served to me was barely simmering, and when I cracked my egg in, it had completely stopped. So, by the time I mixed the egg in, the egg whites didn't even cook all the way.. Gross.\n\nService wise, we turned up as a big group, and service was OK.\nTo conclude, the food is OK but pricey, and service is OK. So maybe between 3 stars and 3 1\/2. ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯
