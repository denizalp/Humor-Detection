Purple Elephant is the best cake shop I have ever come across (and I have eaten a lot of sweets in my day...)!  My experience with Jin, the owner, was excellent on all fronts (taste, design, and service).  Jin designed a custom baby dragon cake and cupcakes for my daughter's 1st birthday, which in Korean culture is kind of a big deal...The cake and cupcakes turned out INCREDIBLY beautiful and SO DELICIOUS!!  They weren't too sweet, so you didn't get ever get sick of eating it, which means I ate waaaay too much of it!   \n\nAll the guests commented on how beautiful and delish the cake and cupcakes were!  I can't wait to have another party, so I can order another custom cake from Purple Elephant!!!  \n\nJin is just a pure pleasure to work with!!  She's super creative and really sweet!
