We ate here based on location and the cool looking fire pits outside.  I would recommend you use more logical decision making when choosing a place to eat!  The hostesses at the hostess stand inside had no clue.  The first one told us there was no open seating outside.  The second one said she didn't handle outside seating and there was a different hostess outside we needed to see.  We went outside and were seated next to one of the long fire pits, which was nice since it was a little chilly.  Service was pretty bad, we had to flag someone down after 8 minutes or so to get our food ordered.  I ordered the blackened chicken fettucine and the bf ordered the chili cheese dog.  \n\nShortly after we ordered, they had an issue with the fire pits and had to keep lighting and relighting them, leaning over various customers and their tables.  Our food took a little long to come out, but was right when it did.  It was average tasting, nothing worth coming back for.  The blackened chicken fettucine was spicy, as promised by the menu.  The chili dog was huge!  My two cents are to try someplace of which you might have higher expectations.
