I'm a big burger person and wanted to try something new so my fiancee and I came across this place. The reviews seemed good enough for us to want to try it soooo we did! There were two people working (one on cash and one prepping the food) so it took about 15-20 mins for our food to be ready. I ordered just the regular burger and honestly, the burgers are ok but I guess everyone has their preference. The patties were tasty and fresh but kinda thin and the buns were ordinary (I like mine a little warm and toasted). But the cajun fries were really good, I could tell they had just been made! I wouldn't go out of my way to come back if I were craving burgers but I would come back to try their poutine and other flavours.
