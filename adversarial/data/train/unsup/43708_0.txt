The best short ribs I've ever tried. Their sauce was amazing and the meat was so smoky. The wedge salad was so lovely and refreshing with corn kernels. The drinks menu was superb - many choices of unique cocktails. The shrimp and grits were good, but I was expecting Cajun-style shrimp and grits that are spicy with Cajun seasoning. These shrimp and grits had a mild flavour with a mild chicken broth poured on and little morsels of what appeared to be Tasso ham. I wanted more bang in the mouth from the shrimp and grits. Oh well. Will be back for the short ribs and other goodies to try though!
