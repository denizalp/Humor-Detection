I saw the other reviews and thought, hmm can't be too bad three stars... How wrong I was. Food is disgusting and they served me expired beer. This could be an amazing place, view is great, great live music, but the service, hygiene and quality of food was beyond disgusting. I am surprised the department of health does not shit them down there was so much bird shit on the seats it didn't seem safe to eat there... And one look into the kitchen\/bar is enough to turn anyone off from going to a reassurance again. Do not come here to eat or drink. The river view and music are the only good things.
