Just updating because it's been years and I still love this bar. Caveat though, I know when not to come. This bar is wildly popular and sometimes I just don't bother, there are some great other local beer options these days that are less on the beer tourism route and though they all seem to do well, this one is all-too-often way too packed for me. \n\nBut in the summer they open at 11:30am. You can get a delicious vegan board for lunch - like a cheese or charcuterie board but all delicious spreads and nuts and breads and pickles. You can snag a spot on the patio and spend the afternoon sampling incredible beers, laughing with the friendly funny staff and soaking in the beautiful bike friendly life of Laurier in the Plateau. If you can do this, you should. After all these years, still fully a 5 star experience.
