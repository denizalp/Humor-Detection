I ate at Rosewood before my \"yelping\" days. My husband recently got to eat there while attending a trade show and he ordered a 6 pound lobster!  And filet mignon!  Him and his buddy were in lobster-dipped- in- butter- heaven; the filet mignon could be cut with a fork he said.  This is a restaurant for special occasions and entertaining clients...excellent service. Next time I'm going with him & I'm going eat some lobster...and get a rose (they give all the women roses after your meal).
