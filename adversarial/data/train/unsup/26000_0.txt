After a serious fire in June 2014, my insurance company contacted ServiceMaster (I don't know which location). I was totally overwhelmed by the   experience and really regret not showing the ServiceMaster crew my sincerest appreciation. The Supervisor was wonderful and extremely patient! Due to (continuing) PTSD, I never completed the insurance company paperwork for personal reimbursement. (Please be aware there is a 2 yr insurance expiration from the date of an event.) Service Master and my insurance company did an outstanding job! Thank you everyone!   *For those without insurance coverage though, I was surprised at ServiceMaster's very high bill.
