What's not to love about waffles? While visiting the Foodie Fest, after the gluttony that was dinner, we opted for Waffle Love for some dessert. \n\nWe ordered the waffle with lemon curd and strawberries. The flavors were great. The lemon was perfectly tart and the strawberry was ripe. It was a little on the pricey side for what it was but I left that go since everything is always overpriced at these events. Everything was cooked well and it was plenty enough to share between my fella and myself, so there's that. \n\nIf I ever came across Waffle Love again, I'd show them some love and have some more waffles.
