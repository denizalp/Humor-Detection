Trying this place out for the first time. And I have to say they make a great tasting pizza. The sauce and cheese are top notch. They even offer a gluten free alternative.\nHubby had a French dip....I tried a bite and loved it. Thinly sliced lean beef and yummy au jus. The caprese salad app was huge!! The beer list is 4 pages long so if you're into trying something new they probably serve it. We definitely will be returning. After looking at the menu we have already checked out what we want to try on our next visit.
