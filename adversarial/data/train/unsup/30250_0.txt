I usually like this restaurant. Decent food. Warm friendly atmosphere. Good prices. Huge portions. But I was very disappointed in their $20.00 whole cobbler. I feel anyone can make a cobbler. I also believed if you had to order a cobbler and wait several days for it--it would be spectacular. It was gross. It had a hard 3+inch dried cracker crust with 1\/8 inch peach jam in the middle.  The dried crust on top sounded like a countertop when thumped. On top of that was slightly burned oatmeal topping. Never get this!!  Never!
