I have been a fan of Frank and Lupe's Scottsdale location for years.  There is something very comforting about their food.  Since I live in Chandler it was rare that we would make to their Scottsdale location.  When we found out they were opening a new location close buy we had to stop by.  I had the Enchiladas Poblanas and they were so tasty  A great balance of flavor.  You get a lot of flavor and food for the cost and the service was great.  Things to consider when visiting Frank and Lupe's new location, they just opened so there is no alcohol yet but I was told it was coming very soon. The food is very filling and the chips and salsa are great so you will leave full.  Ask for recommendations,  the staff knows the menu well and will guide you to something great.  I know there is a lot of Mexican restaurants around but try Frank and Lupe's, their food is based on New Mexican styles recipes which add something different. you will like it.
