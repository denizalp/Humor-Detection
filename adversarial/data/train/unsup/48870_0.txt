I had a vibration during braking diagnosed there which turned out to be warped rotors but they told me that my rear hub bearings were shot and I needed new ones. I was shown with my car lifted how the rear wheel wiggled. They assured me it was dangerous to continue driving and then gave me a crazy expensive quote to fix it. I ended up taking it elsewhere and discovering everything was fine and it was only the plastic hub alignment rings that go on your rims that were not the right size for my car $5 each as opposed to $1300 for everything.
