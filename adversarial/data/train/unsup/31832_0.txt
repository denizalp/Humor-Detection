Sadly, this location was a huge disappointment  They didn't have the usual breakfast sandwiches (even though they had pictures of all of them) and couldn't remember to put the sandwich I did order on a plate with a knife. We will avoid this place in the future ... And, when I asked \"Chanel\" for some ice, she said \"go down there\" and pointed to the guy who was very busy making drinks. How rude!!!! There wasn't anyone else behind me!!!
