I hit up this Starbucks at least once a week on my way to work. I learned quickly to NOT attempt the drive thru in the morning- you will get stuck in a line that won't move and you will be late for work. \nThe line inside can get long as well and at times you may have to fight off other customers at the pick up counter because on more than one occasion I have had my danish snatched up by another person whose name was not LOREN. \nAs far as accuracy, it is about 50\/50. I have learned to check my order before I step out the door. I bring a reusable cup and I have seen them make my drink in a disposable cup and then pour it into my reusable cup.. I wonder what is the purpose of that? They have forgotten my order at least twice. Luckily the people in line allow me to cut so that I can ask for my order. Staff is friendly, but most of the time they seem very overwhelmed and frazzled. \nI will continue to go to this location because it is on my way and its also near the freeway so that may be good for others needing a pick me up before hitting the road.
