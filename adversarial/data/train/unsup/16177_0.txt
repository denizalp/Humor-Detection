OK, so I moved to the neighborhood recently and finally found the time\/energy\/will power to go to the gym.  I used to frequent the 48th St\/Chandler Blvd location and am now wishing I still could.  A couple points:\n\n1. There is no towel service.  What gym doesn't have towel service?  I had to drive back home to get one so the person behind me didn't have to bathe in my grossness.\n\n3. They close at 10pm.  This is way too early.  11pm I could understand, but a gym should really be open until midnight.  Not only that, but when the lights suddenly went out in the middle of our basketball game, we kept playing because nobody came to tell us to leave.  I only found out the hours after I checked the website at home.  Weird!\n\nOther than that, it's a gym.  You lift heavy things and run in place.  You wait for a machine.  You feel good about yourself when you go, but you don't go that often.  Fortunately, you don't have a contract.
