Came here on a Friday and it was really packed inside but still managed to get seats pretty quickly. The food was really good. Read a lot of good reviews about their corn kaki-age and it did not disappoint. Got their curry udon and black sesame udon and both were very delicious! Portions look small but it was still very filling. It was a little loud inside which makes it hard for conversation, just have to talk a little louder! Also tried their matcha drunken tea and an aloe cocktail. Good alcohol ratio, but on the lesser end. All in all, would come here again to try out some other stuff on their menu. \nAmbience: 4\/5\nFood: 4.5\/5
