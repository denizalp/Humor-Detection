I used Guardsman to repair a dining table that has been moved quite a few times and had suffered the wrath because of it. I've made attempts to repair it a couple of times with other vendors, but their fixes were less than stellar and less than temporary. With my last move I decided I'm too old to keep moving around like this, so I thought I'd search for someone that could truly fix the problem. Guardsman was the ticket. From the phone discussions, emails, and mobile repair, I can respect these guys for what they are - professional furniture repairmen. THANK YOU for fixing my table!
