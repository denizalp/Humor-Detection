Wonderful hosts and superlative hospitality.\nOne of the few stand-alone steakhouse establishments who offer the traditional accouterments of fine dining. \nUnfortunately, those efforts seem to be wasted on most of the \"come as you are\" patrons who are most likely more comfortable with casual style dining.\n\nPerhaps if you check your potty-mouthed, entitlement attitude at the door and, leave the flat-billed cap in your totally sick, lifted monster truck, wear a buttoned-up, collared shirt over your wife beater and \"I'm dangerous\" tattoos, keep your bro-ho in check and, generally speaking, act like civilized human beings, you may find your experience here even more delightful.\n\nSeated in the DiMaggio booth, (my personal favorite), started dinner with a Cesar Salad, best I've ever had. The table side, properly trained technique, attention to detail in the presentation and preparation with fresh ingredients is superb. \nI highly recommend the Chateaubriand for two, ordered medium rare. By the time it is sliced and plated table side, it has rested to perfection. Much better than most steakhouses serving up average $45 strip steaks. Spend the extra twenty, enjoy the show, and enjoy a proper cut of beef, served in a manner befitting an adult with refined tastes.\nThe twice-baked potato is delicious! \n\nDesert?\nCherries Jubilee. Anytime you can have someone bring a pan of something sweet, covered in Kirschwasser, Cognac, or Brandy, and flamb√©ed at your table, DO IT!\nQueen Victoria would be honored.\n\nThe Golden Steer has been and IS the best of Las Vegas.
