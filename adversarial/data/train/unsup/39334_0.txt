Had lunch here this past weekend after a very long night on the road.\nStarted out with the tortilla soup. Lovely little bowl of tastiness. The only thing that would have made it better is a skirt of lime.\nThe chips and salsa are also very good and the sangria is some of the best I've ever had, and I make my own a lot of the time. The tacos where all very tasty and fresh and I even ate the black beans, which I usually stay away from, but decided to try them and was glad I did. The only bad part of the meal was the rice. Very bland and almost remained me of converted rice, oh well.\nThe service was excellent and very cute, I might add. \nI will defiantly be going back next time I am in town.
