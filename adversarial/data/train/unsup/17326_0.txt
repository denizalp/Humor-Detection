This is a good old Las Vegas standby and I've been known to dine here when in a pinch. The pinch is usually that I don't feel like eating anywhere else. If I could review the restaurant scene in Vegas in general, it would not do well, that's for sure.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the service but sometimes they just don't seem to get it right. If there is one thing I don't like in my Indian food, it's when it's over spiced. I specifically remember asking them not to do that and when I took the first bite I realized they did it anyway. Now I'm not one to shy away from spicy but if it's the only thing going on in my mouth then I'm not going to like it.\n\nI had the Aloo Ghobi Masala: Cauliflower and potatoes cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices. It's too bad they don't tell you what spices and for $12.95 it was remarkably overpriced. In fact, I think this whole place is overpriced. Otherwise, it was very flavorful and I would have given them another star just for that but the spiciness killed it for me.\n\nI'm willing to give them one more chance though. Maybe on the next visit they'll listen to me and give me what I want, not what they think I should have. There really is good Indian food out there where the spice doesn't overwhelm. I just know it.
