Dined here on my last night in Vegas, and I must say it was the low point of my trip.  The staff are incredibly inattentive and the food was just average but ridiculously expensive.  We ordered 3 apps, 3 entrees, and 3 cocktails and the entire bill (including tip) was over $300.  \n\nWe started with the hamachi sashimi with ponzu sauce (disgusting, don't even bother with it, the fish was chewy and had way too much ponzu sauce), the spring rolls (just your average egg roll), and ribs (the best of the apps, pretty good, but not spectacular).  We shared the entrees: Kungpao chicken (just ok, nothing special), mongolian beef (again, just average), and some weird cod dish that was recommended by the waiter, it was ok, but not worth the $50 price tag.\n\nWe saw our server all of twice - drinks took forever to order, and we waited around for about 20 minutes after we finished to get our check.\n\nI really don't know how this place stays open in the Wynn... probably just because it has a different type of food than most of the other restaurants on the premises.  If you're looking for Asian food, there are better options outside of the Wynn... RA is just across the street.
