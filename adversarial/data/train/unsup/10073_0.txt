This place sucks...it could be a nice laundromat as laundromats go but unfortunately, they let 20 little kids run through the store pouring cherry flavored sugar straws in with your laundry, and not cleaning up the place..there is always one Mexican lady there who never speaks...I don't think she speaks English, but is never very helpful.\n\n I hate this laundromat with a passion they need to get some better help in here and have more control over the people that wash here. Plus that it is virtually in possible to get a hold of any one if you want to complain and no one has ever answered one of the comment cards I have left, most of  the time they do not have them, I have been ripped off here had laundry ruined.\n\nNot worth it to go here.
