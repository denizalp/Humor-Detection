My hubby and I ate here on our last day in Las Vegas. I had seen the Catfish Sloppy Joe on a list of the best sandwiches and since we were staying at the Delano there was no reason to not stop in and give it a try. Being a southern girl, catfish is a staple for me. The sandwich didn't disappoint, it was filled with catfish and had great flavor and the added chips were a nice texture addition. We also tried the cioppino which was delicious. It was sop me up with a biscuit good. I'll definitely return next time I'm in Vegas.We shared the flourless chocolate cake, which tasted like a less moist brownie.
