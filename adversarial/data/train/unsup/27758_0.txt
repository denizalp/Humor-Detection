Went for a late dinner. Place was near empty. Very good service. I had the veal Marsala. It was excellent. They bring a little bread basket to munch on. Water glass was always filled. I also went for the dessert which was an apple tart type of thing. A little doubt and I wish there were more apples. I ate it all so it was good. They do bring little flat almond cookies with the bill which just pushed my blood sugar into overdrive
