Honey salt was one of my favorite restaurants and I consistently would come here until my recent experiences. The past couple of times the food has been inconsistent and sub-par. I always get the same items. The octopus and the scallops used to be to die for but not anymore. When I first had the octopus, it used to come in a very generous amount on a bed of greens. Now, I feel like they give you 4 small pieces mixed in with the salad and it's not as tender. The scallops used to be amazing but they were watery and lacked flavor the past two times we came. Also, the calamari has changed as well. It was chewy and they no longer give the same amount they used to with the fried lemons. I'm not sure if the chef or owner changed because we noticed several differences in the quality of the food. Needless to say that I think my days at honey salt have come to a halt. There are better places to eat at now. Quite disappointing.
