Yeah, we had problems with their delivery. They were swamped on a Friday night, but the wait was worth it. \n\nTheir pizza sauce is literally sweet in a sublime manner. The crust of the pizza is not too thin, not too thick. Fresh toppings...unh-huh. A fine, fine pie it is. \n\nMy dad and I split a steak hoagie, which was the best I have had in a while. The steak was real, not Steakumms, was tender, not gummy, generous, (What's with pizza places gettin' stingy with hoagie meat these days?) with nice, thick bread and loads of fixings. I like mine with mayo. \n\nThe cheese bread, however, was the highlight. The cheese was gooey, the bread itself chewy, smack me upside the head and call me Louie, damn it was good. And again, that sweet marinara sauce just put it through the rafters. \n\nThey have a fat menu with lots of coupons and specials too. We will definitely get food from here again.
