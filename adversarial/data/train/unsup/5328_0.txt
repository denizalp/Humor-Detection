Ugghh what a giant clusterf**k seriously. Just stand outside and try to get in. This was a rare occasion of me +15 so they split our group up. None of the guys had to pay to get in though and the wait was less than 30 minutes. However my friend has bad luck with bouncers and he got kicked out. Inside even more of a CF. You might as well get really intimate with the 5 people that surround you, you are gonna be touching them the whole night. Go upstairs and get fresh air. Some of my party didn't like techno so they went back down. Now I love journey but damn, why are you playing that in the main room when i'm trying to get my freak on? You want us to sway left and right or something? Can someone please tell me why a 6oz bottle of water costs 8 bucks? It wasn't even a boutique brand just some plain water probably bottled from tap.\n\nI heard on our way out one my girls was being hollered at by Mike Tyson. She told me on the elevator ride down that she was really scared because he wouldn't leave her alone. Now if I was there I'm down to save any girl but damn its Mike Tyson! I'm pretty sure he would have put me in a coma.
