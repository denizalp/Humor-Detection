I have been to Rula Bula quite a few times and cannot really remember anything memorable about it, so I was a little concerned selecting it as the starting place for my groups pub crawl. I was actually really pleasantly surprised with the outcome despite a few less-than-desirable things. \n\nThe patio area was a great choice. Plenty of room to accommodate our large crowd, both smokers and not. They also have Strongbow, which made me happy (just wish Amanda could have been there to share a glasss!!!) \n\nThere was an incredibly drunken guy sitting at the bar who was loud and obnoxious. It took a little too long for the bartender to kick him out. \n\nAs Gabi mentioned in her review, the bathrooms were pretty gross and certainly not maintained throughout the day. \n\nAs for food, I had the cheese and tomato sandwich on wheat with the potato fries. I was pleasantly surprised by my food and I really loved those little tasty fries. Yum! \n\nOur server was able to accommodate all of us Yelpers pretty easily, although I ordered at the bar. \n\nOverall Rula Bula is okay... but I certainly would never plan my evening around it.
