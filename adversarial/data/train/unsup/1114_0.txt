Golden Corral is a traditional After Church go-to place. Not sure why, though. I guess church folk love the concept of \"All You Can Eat,\" especially when it's only $10 for \"adults\" and $7 for \"seniors.\" Shrugs.\n\nIt's pretty close to \"home-cooked food,\" once you've shaken off the fact that you don't actually know who cooked it.  The mac & cheese makes me siiiiiing!! Sooo creamy and soft, pleasing babies and the elderly just as much as those of us with teeth.  The beef stew was pleasant; the beef was tender and well-marinated, but the vegetables somehow lacked flavor. The potato salad was meh (my mom's is way better), as were the green beans. The rolls, however, are the tastiest foodstuff on the planet. No lie. Seriously, if I could come here and get a whole plate of hot rolls without stares, I so would. \n\nFor the lazy amongst us (myself included), there's a takeaway buffet option. All you can eat that can fit in a takeaway box for 5 bucks a pound. Solid deal.
