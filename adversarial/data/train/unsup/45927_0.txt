I'm not grading this on authenticity... just on taste and value.  As Scottsdale das developed and evolved the hipper cooler places have moved north.  After several places closed between 2008 and 2010, good food was getting harder and harder to find in 85259.   L&Ls has great tasting food, love the Mongolian beef flat-bread and the Honey Walnut Chicken.   The service is excellent and location is great.  Adequate parking and not far from 101 but not buried around 90th and 92nd St.\n\nAnd Carol, the meatloaf is probably only on the menu for kids (or adults) who choose something safe sounding... don't think its fair to grade them on meatloaf...  I don't critic meatloaf (even when it just 3 stars) on a Asian\/fusion\/whatever-it-is menu!\n\nFor a full menu go here: http:\/\/scottsdale.lingandlouies.com\/wp-content\/themes\/WP_Theme_LandL_Scottsdale\/images\/menu-dinner.pdf
