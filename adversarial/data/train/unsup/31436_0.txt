I get my nails done about once a year, usually for a special occasion. I stumbled upon this place based on the reviews from yelp and decided to give it a try. \n\nYou will definitely not be disappointed. It was wonderful! The owner did my nails and she did a great job. She took her time to make sure my nails looked perfect. \n\nI enjoyed the pedicure lounge more than The Wigwam. I would give the pedicure lounge 6 stars if I could!
