All liquor sales being commandeered by the state, this ABC store is of the same format as all others. It has experienced the recent renovation that has been trickling through the ABC system, so it is a little more modern than some. The selection is comparable to that of the other mid-sized stores, and they will likely have whatever you need.\n\nA word of caution though: being adjacent to the UNCC campus, they are extra vigilant on IDs and seem to take pleasure in denying balding 30-somethings if given the slightest excuse. They seem to see themselves as the last line of defense staving off a world in which consenting 20 year-olds may be tainted by liquor. The puritanical attitude strikes me as strange in a liquor store. But never worry, ID-wielding adults can get their juice without much more than a gruff inquiry and a disapproving scowl.
