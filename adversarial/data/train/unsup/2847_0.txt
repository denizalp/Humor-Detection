I heart Hikari.  They let me eat however much I want of whatever I want. Other sushi buffets will make sure you fill up on rice, but not Hikari. Sashimi is included in their buffet; they even let me order items in the Nigiri section and leave out the rice. Very flexible and accommodating sushi chefs.\n\nI loved the Kama (grilled yellow tail collar).  I haven't had this anywhere else, but it's in my Fav 5 now.  The super white tuna and soft shelled crab were also delicious.\n\nI ate so much, the sushi chef told me I owe them food next time I come in. Very funny sushi chefs indeed (though I'm not entirely sure he was joking...). I waddled out a happy man.\n\nNote:  If you don't eat raw items, you're probably better off ordering off the regular menu.
