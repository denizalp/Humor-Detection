After five years of hanging  in my closet in a garment bag, I figured it was time to finally get my wedding gown cleaned and preserved.  I had been putting it off because life had gotten in the way (new job, 2 kids, etc) and wasn't  sure how clean the dress could get after all these years.  Denise was great, and walked me thru the entire service of what they provide, she showed me areas of my dress where \"sugaring\" had occurred and that they would be able to remove the spots.  We had an outdoor wedding and reception, and the bottom inside of my dress was dirty, but nothing crazy.  Denise and team did a great job with the cleaning and preservation, nice presentation at pickup with the dress in a large box(with window to display dress) linen bag, and white gloves for future handling.  Part of the service also includes future steaming when u want to wear the dress again.  4 out of 5 stars because of the price, my dress wasn't extremely expensive and this cleaning cost about 20% of the original cost of the dress.
