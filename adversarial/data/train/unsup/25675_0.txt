*first timers* my husband and I got steak kabob plates and it was delicious. The salad for starters was freshly made and perfectly dressed! The steak kabob was extremely moist and super yummy. The pita bread that came with the plate was ok, on the dry side and you could tell it wasn't fresh. The humus was creamier than normal humuses but delicious. The only downside to the visit was everything was extra. Want humus for your pita? $1 extra. Want cheese on your salad? $1 extra. Want home made pita? $1.50 extra.. overall, good good food!
