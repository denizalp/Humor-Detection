I generally enjoy Caf√© Rio. This location however, did not impress. The line wasn't long when I arrived but it took FOREVER. Employees seemed flustered and annoyed. I got a salad and it wasn't as yummy as it usually is. The lettuce weren't even chopped. I had huge pieces of lettuce that I had to rip up myself. The tortilla wasn't as good either. I probably won't return to this location. It wasn't inedible or terrible. It just wasn't as good as it typically is.
