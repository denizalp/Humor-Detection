We are really excited about our solar panels. Solar City has been amazing in making this happen. They did all the necessary paperwork, designed the system, and installed it. The only thing that has been a little frustrating is the amount of time it has taken from the initial consultation to the panels being installed to them actually producing power. To be fair, some things were out of their control, and I've had to be VERY patient. The customer service has been great, the panels are amazing looking. Solar City has been professional and responsive when I had questions. Overall, I'm very pleased  and highly recommend Solar City and solar power.
