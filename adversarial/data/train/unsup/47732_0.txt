Went to La Parilla Suiza today for lunch.  Had my Livingsocial coupon.  Read reviews before I left for the restaurant.  Was ready for the worst.  It never happened.  The waitress was very helpful, smiling and pleasant to be around.  The assistant manager came over to look at our coupon and told us we had $30.00 worth of food to order and still had another 3 dollars to spend.  He checked on us to see how we liked our food.  The restaurant had about 8 tables full which was pretty good for a Sunday at 12:00.  I will be returning as the food was delicious.  I had the chicken faitas and my husband had #32.  He said he would order it again.  The salsas and chips were excellent.
