Good god, why.\n\nSeemingly designed more around carrying the maximum amount of advertising on the outside rather than be an effective place to shop and generally contribute to the economy. From the profoundly stupid layout (A U-shaped Future Shop! Because you can!) to the drab-yet-blindingly-bright exterior, to the massive pile of FREAKING TOO MANY ESCALATORS, SERIOUSLY PEOPLE I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE OF THI-\n\n*deep breaths... lots of deep breaths*\n\nOkay, I'm good now.\n\nWhat's really sad is that it didn't have to be this bad. It was under construction and development for so long that one would assume they'd be able to get their act together. Depressingly, this isn't the case. Maybe some of the general sucktasticness of this facility is due to it being a dual-use commercial \/ academic facility for Ryerson University. I think history speaks loudly on this one: if you try to do one thing, you can do it well. If you try to do two disparate things at the same time, you, like the Internet-enabled refrigerator, have a next day appointment with fail. The chief difference here is that at least the Internet-enabled refrigerator effectively kept things cold.\n\nFor all its faults - the ugly exterior, the useless interior - at the end of the day it doesn't contain much. A handful of restaurants, a useless movie theatre, an awkward electronics store. There might be a gym in the basement but I honestly don't care. The only truly redeeming quality I can think of is that if you enter via the subway at least you don't have to look at it.\n\nUpshot: I was less annoyed by it when it was a construction site.
