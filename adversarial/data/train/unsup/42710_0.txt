Saw this show during a girls' weekend in Vegas and am so glad since it was the best time I've ever had in Vegas!  The guys really cater to everyone - tall, short, fat, skinny, young, old, female or male - in the audience and don't focus only on the pretty girls (which is what most people would expect).  However, bachelorettes and birthday girls seem to get a little more attention than everyone else so if that's what you want, plan your attendance around one of these events.  The show is a lot of fun, the guys are super hot, and you won't be disappointed.  I think the best seats are actually not the VIP section (tables 1-8), but the preferred section right behind it.  And if you can, grab seats 1 and 2 (which are at the head of the tables) as they place you right on the aisle giving you plenty of access to the guys as they walk through the crowd.  Even if you don't get to sit in either of these sections, you'll still have plenty of opportunity to interact as the guys make their way through the entire room.  I recommend spending the $20 to get a photo with the guys.  However, if that's not in your budget, stick around anyway as the guys do a meet and greet\/autograph session in the lobby after they're done with the photos.  I went on a night when they only had 1 show, so some of the guys even hung around the bar right next to the showroom and had drinks with fans.  Extra perks: You can get a wristband for LAX nightclub which gets you free drinks till midnight.
