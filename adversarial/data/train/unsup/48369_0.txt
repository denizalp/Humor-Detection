I don't enjoy writing bad reviews and somehow they are only about carwash businesses. \n\nSave your money and do whatever cleaning you want. It took forever to get my oil change and they somehow didn't have the filter needed for my car. They must have gone shopping for one because they told me I'd have to come back another day, when I told them I already paid for the change, one suddenly turned up. After waiting almost an eternity my car was ready.\n\nI paid for the most expensive cleaning package they had to have the outside washed and interior cleaned. It was the most superficial cleaning I'd ever seen. They doused the dash with amorall and didn't even wipe everywhere. They cleaned the floor mats and the tops of the doors. They did not attempt to vacuum the back seat at all. My package came with an air freshener that is nowhere to be found and my car has an odd smell now. \n\nI'd never go back here, I'll clean your car for much less and do a far better job.
