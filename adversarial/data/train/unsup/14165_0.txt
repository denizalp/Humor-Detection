My brother and sister in law were in town for some work seminars, so I met them for some drinks and dinner here at Tender. Very easy to get a table with no reservations on a Monday night. This place is surprisingly very large, with several \"rooms\" of tables.\n\nIt's a bit pricey, like any steak house on the Strip. My sister in law went with the Filet Mignon 10 oz size Oscar style, I think that was around $68. My brother and I went with the Ribeye sampler which featured Australian Waygu, Australian Angus, and Bison ribeye in 6 oz portions ($75). The Waygu was fantastic, tender and flavorful, and the Bison had a nice strong flavor as well...both easily outshined the Angus. No sauces were mentioned, and of course sides are individual. I also had the lobster bisque which was very good, but not the best I've had (The Palm still has that title). \n\nService was prompt and on point. The steaks came out pretty quickly too probably because it wasn't that busy. Steaks were cooked right and seasoned well, not overdone in either category. \n\nIts not the best steakhouse in town, but I was happy with everything.
