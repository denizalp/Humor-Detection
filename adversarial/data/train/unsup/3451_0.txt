Another great place for XLB dumplings. Also had the pork belly which was amazing followed by the spicy beef soup. Great ambience and excellent service. They were very friendly and gave recommendations when I couldn't decide by reason that it all looked tasty. \nHighly recommend stopping by. \n\nThank you
