We stayed here two nights... We checked in and there was popcorn smashed into the carpet from the previous people. The next day they left half of our old room service plates and glasses all over the room. On top of that we got room service and the man who delivered it asked us to sign for it & then proceeded with a rude racial comment... \"You don't look Japanese\"
