This has to be one of the most overpriced buffets if you are talking about quality for your $. $18 for lunch where there were no big meats (ie. steak, prime rib, roast, chicken, etc).\n\n1st - for a party of 8 or more, they want to charge 18% gratuity. I have NEVER heard this at a buffet before. Our group decided to split into two to avoid the gratuity and glad we did. Our waitress took so long - maybe she was picking the oranges and squeezing the juice herself.\n\nFOOD - nothing really jumped out at you. Cold sushi rolls. Best part might be the made-to-order pasta option. Can't comment on much else because nothing left an impression.\n\nDESSERT - probably the best part with the variety of donuts and they even have cotton candy. Their red velvet cupcake was so hard that I wonder if it was even from that day.\n\nNOTE: The hotel generally gives 2-for-1 at check-ins and sometimes free ones depending on type of reservation booked. That explains why it looks so full and busy.
