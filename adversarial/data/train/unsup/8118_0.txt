I haven't been to Floyd Lamb Park for at least ten years.  When we first moved to Las Vegas, this was a place we liked to visit to see the peacocks and the waterfowl that are abundant at the park.  When we first came to the park, it was a state park.  During the great recession when state funding was tight, the state convinced the city to take over the park.  \n\nFed by Tule Springs, the park has four ponds of different size.  Fishing is allowed (limit three per day) and you will always see someone there fishing.  \n\nSince the city took control of the park, there have been improvements and additions to it.  If you enter on Brent Lane, there is a fee booth and the entrance fee is $6.  If anyone in the car is a veteran with proof, there is no fee.  An alternative to parking in the main area is to park of Racel Street where there is off street parking along Racel.  You can enter the park from here to hike the loop that has been added to the park since I was last there.  This loop connects with the parking area near the historic area.\n\nOriginally, this was a ranch that became a \"divorce ranch\" when Nevada passed a law in 1931 making a divorce possible in 6 weeks.  People would come here for the 6 weeks to establish Nevada residency and then they'd get the divorce.  It was also the same year the gambling was made legal and prohibition was ended in 1931.  A trifecta of laws that helped Nevada grow.\n\nWalking through the buildings in the historic area is enjoyable and a good learning experience.  After going past the stables, you come to the ponds.  The largest one is right in front of you.  There are many tules--large bulrush plants that grow in the pond.  \n\nThere is a paved walking area around the four ponds and the waterfowl is enjoyable even if the geese are quite loud.\n\nFloyd Lamb Park at Tule Springs is a great place to visit to leave the city behind for a few hours.
