No haircuts for younger than 10 yr-olds. My son is 8 and  has a full head of hair and has been going to get haircuts since 5 mos-old, an infant. Not your typical kid who won't sit still. \nGuy in front didn't even acknowledged us when we walked in, until he was done with customer in front of him paying. Not even a \"hello, will be with you in just a moment\" type of greeting. On their Yelp pictures shows a little boy, maybe 6 yr-old? \n\nOur barber moved and we're in search of a new place. Too bad, they lost two potential clients: my son and my husband.
