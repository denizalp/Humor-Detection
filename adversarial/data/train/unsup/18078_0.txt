I love this gym! Since joining... I can honestly say I can do 50-60 minutes of intense cardio without thinking About it. Why? They have a movie theater... And it makes it so freaking easy to sweat. \n\nThe free weights area is full of new equipment and their machines are well kept and maintained. I do wish they had a few more smiths machines, since they seem to be the most popular. They have a turf area that has lots of really cool equipment, like kettle bells and monkey bars... It's like training outside but in air conditioning. They have basketball courts, a boxing room, and a huge pool as well. \n\nThe kids center has slides and those balls that the kids can play in. They have an Xbox and a movie room as well. Definitely make an appointment because the spaces can fill up quick. \n\nOverall, this gym is one of the most affordable for what they have to offer... beat LVAC for sure, although I have a membership to both. They have 8 locations with more to come. Definitely worth checking out.
