I came here for dinner with my parents and my boyfriend, and it was definitely one of the most memorable meals I have had in Charlotte.  I loved the atmosphere - very classy.  All of the food we got was delicious.  And most importantly,  our server was extremely patient with my dad, who can't speak english well but wanted to order two entrees instead of just one.  Much appreciated! \n\nFor meals, I got the Butcher Cut with Bleu Cheese Mornay.  It was amazing.  I think what made the meal was the bleu cheese honestly.  It won me over from the first bite, and I don't even like blue cheese!  It was a little salty, but because it was on the side (I can't remember if it came like that or if I asked for it this way), I could adjust to my own tastes.  Still, the meat was tender and juicy at medium rare, and it was pre-cut. PRE-CUT.  \n\nAnd I thought I had a two thumbs up meal until I tasted my boyfriends' dish - the NC Mountain Trout Amandine.  This was definitely what made the night memorable.  Even though I had just one bite, it was enough to make me want to go back for more.  It was so soft and didn't have a lot of the 'fishy' taste to it. It was like love on a plate.  If you have a chance to try this dish, DEFINITELY get it.  I'm not too big of a fish person, but this one totally had me hooked (Ha. Lame pun). \n\nMy dad had the Pasta Forrestierre with a NY Strip cut on top of it (his special order that took 20 minutes to explain), and my mom had the Pan Seared Scallops.  I didn't try either but they both said they were delicious!  I'll take their word for it. \n\nAlso, try the creme brulee for desert!  It's not too sweet but not lacking in that area either.
