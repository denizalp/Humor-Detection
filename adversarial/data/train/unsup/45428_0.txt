TERRIBLE......This is another typical nail salon in a strip mall that rushes customers out the door with no regard to quality. I've been there 3 times. My first visit was AWESOME. My second visit was terrible and my third visit was deplorable. They seem annoyed whenever a customer enters the salon. I treated myself to a mani and pedi on my birthday. My gel polish buckled on my fingers and toes. The polish eventually peeled off my fingers. This happened within 36 hours of leaving the shop. I returned to show them the buckled polish and no one cared or apologized. No excuse or reason was offered. My impression of them is that they are lazy and the quality of their work shows it.
