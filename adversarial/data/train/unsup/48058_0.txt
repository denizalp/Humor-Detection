Unethical practices this pertains to some of their suppliers as well. They continually sell moldy berries. Old wilted produce kept on shelve too long. Rotten smelly fish that they persuade customers to buy even when they know the item is rotten. Buyer Beware. They will even say it is the suppliers fault for such item conditions. Advice: change suppliers, get fresh (not green produce) and change out your produce & meat shelves on a continual basis. Stop selling stuff that you wouldn't take home to your Mother. Get it.
