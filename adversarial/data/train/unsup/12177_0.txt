I lived at this complex for two years and would have lived there longer if I stayed in Phoenix. \n\nThe staff has always been great. Very friendly every time I came in and were prompt with any maintenance issues. I lost my wallet around the complex at one point and they were decent enough to get it back to me.They didn't screw me over on my deposit like almost every other landlord has done to me in the past. In fact, they have kindly ordered new deposit refund checks for me (twice) after they were lost (once by me and once by my inept Chicago post office branch). \n\nAt the time I worked downtown so the proximity to the light rail was ideal. It's also in a very convenient location by a Frys and an LA Fitness. There are dozens of amazing restaurants and bars nearby which was the most pleasant surprise when I moved there. It's a good place to be.\n\nThe apartment itself was one of the nicer places I've lived at, and I'm actually paying almost twice as much now for a place in Chicago that isn't as big or nice. But that's depressing to think about....
