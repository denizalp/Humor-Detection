This subway is horrible! As you walk in there are two Hispanic ladies that just stare at you in a weird way then just ask \"what do you want,\" no customer service at all. As always, they never have buffalo sauce. Maritza can't hear so I raised my voice, she then gets defensive telling me to not yell at her. To make matters worse, while making the sandwich, she has a very dirty apron, when she bends over to get veggies, her apron touches the sandwich which grosses me out! Don't recommend coming to this location. Consistently annoying during the mornings. I have a better experience when I come at night.
