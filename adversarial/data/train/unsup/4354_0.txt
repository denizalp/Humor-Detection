Pretty cool German restaurant\/beer hall.  It's a really big place and they have a lot of outdoor seating. They've got 16 imported German beers on tap which was awesome and the prices were really cheap ($3.50 import pints) but they might have had a special going on  -- I went on a Thursday night. I didn't try any food so I can't comment on that, but it's a cool atmosphere to drink in. The only reason why they don't get 4 stars is the bathrooms -- they were horrible. It reminded me of the bathroom from the episode of \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" where the water zombie attacked the kids in the basement locker room of the old school pool...and if this scene isn't burned into your mind from countless nightmares....the link is below (around minute 19). But yeah, the bathrooms are nasty. \n\nPros: ton of imports, great beer garden, cheap prices\nCons: bathroom that could potentially house a drain monster\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hoi3GuxiA7A
