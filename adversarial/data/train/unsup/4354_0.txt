Yo,  so I ordered two taco combination plate. And the put like 0.068oz of meat. Wtf? Hell to the naw, either they have some magical shrinking beef, or they are stingy AF.  I know grilled steak is expensive. But that's why they charge more! Man, this restaurant is a disgrace to my culture...  My parents didn't hop the border illegally to just get made fun of like this...  Does Donald trump own this chain? It feels as though my wallet just got raped, and not roofie style like Bill Cosby...  Jeffrey Dahmer raw style.
