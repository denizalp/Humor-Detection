Shop local!   This darling store has the best of the best in everything you need for your dog and cat.  Dylan happily suggested food for both my beasts that were not only better, but also cheaper!!  PetSmart and Petco are doing just fine...local (and fantastic) businesses are always the way to go...and they will be my go-to from now on!
