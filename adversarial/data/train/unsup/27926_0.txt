Overall, I enjoyed my first visit to The Living Room with my sisters-in-law. \n\nAtmosphere: 4 Stars. \nI really liked this place. The place is very neat... garage doors that let the cool night air in and the little details of the place are cool. \nThe only thing that would have made it better is if they had some soft lighting after dark. It was so dark inside around 8pm that I couldn't read the drink menu. \n\nService: 1 Star. \nI think this place might hire people more for their looks than their actual skills at service. Our waitress was scarce until it came time to pay the bill. \n\nDrinks: 4 Stars. Pricey, but very good. I had the Red Sangria (blah! nothing special) and a peach martini. The martini was delicious and very strong which is a good thing when I'm paying $8 for it. I think next time I'll probably only have drinks here at Happy Hour. $8 for a small Sangria is a bit expensive for me. \n\nFood: 4 Stars. \nWe started with two Bruschetta (steak and Gorgonzola; apple and fig). Very delicious! Next time, I'll probably stick to Bruschetta because they were so good. For dinner, I got 1\/2 of a Prosciutto and Brie sandwich and a cup of Butternut Squash soup. The sandwich had one slice of fatty Prosciutto and a thin layer of Brie. Disappointing. The soup was EXCELLENT! If you like Butternut Squash soup, I'd recommend trying it here. \n\nI'll be going back again... probably during Happy Hour next time!
