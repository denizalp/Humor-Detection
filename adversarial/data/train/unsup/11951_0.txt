The only good thing about this place is the waitress\/bartender Francina and the bouncers.. so we payed for bottle service and they kept the bottle in the back the whole time. We had to pay an additional $2 to mix our drink with pineapple juice?? Where do they do that at? On top of that the bartender Crystal said \"fuck that\" when we try to order 3 additional mixed drinks on top of our bottle we paid for.. all because she was in a \"bad mood\"? Customer service is great but the MANAGEMENT is horrible. Sad because we were weekly guests at this bar and now we will never come here again.  LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER ALL BECAUSE OF THE MANAGER CRYSTAL OR KRYSTAL.
