I'm on a low rating streak and I don't care who knows!\n\nI didn't plan this party, but I did read the Yelp reviews ahead of time, so I thought I knew what I was in for.  Little did I know, they have a 'heated' patio, and my group decided it was a good idea to SIT ON SAID PATIO for dinner on Saturday night.  A fun adventure...ish...they do give you blankets but they didn't have a table big enough for our group (12) so we had to sit at two separate tables.\n\nSpeaking of which, jury is out if they take reservations.  They have Opentable and when I called to ask if they could take cilantro out of their dishes (I was told yes), she asked the name on my reservation - but when the organizer of the party called, she was told they don't.  So we went in without one.\n\nService was slow, frazzled, careless.  My drink was good and well worth $11 (I had the mango fresco frapas or something like that).  I didn't eat because - despite what I'd been told - EVERYTHING HAD CILANTRO AND THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT OFF.  Even the damn chaser for the tequila shots had cilantro in it.  My word!  I'm okay with that ... if the lady answering the phones had been more honest.\n\nI wouldn't schlep out to Distillery again for this.  Don't recommend.  Patio will be super fun in summertime with great drinks though, I'm sure.
