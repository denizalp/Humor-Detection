We had our wedding reception at Battista's and couldn't have had a better time! We had a party of 20, and the accommodations were perfect! The food selections were great, from seafood to traditional ravioli, and the flavors were right on the money. \nUnlimited wine was a hit with our crew, and our waiter Gerson kept it flowing. He was such a professional with all of our special request, hopefully he waits on you when you visit!\nCan't say enough about Gordy the accordion player! Most of the family is from Ohio, and he rocked out the Ohio State fight song for an impromptu sing along! \nThis is a must visit when in Las Vegas!\nFantastic time with friendly staff and terrific food!
