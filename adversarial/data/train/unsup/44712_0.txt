I have gone to My Pizzetta about 10 times now.  I made a habit of going directly after my golf league every week.  Pizza is a very subjective, however there are a few universal characteristics that are difficult to argue against.  My Pizzetta has them all.\n\nMy pizzas were made with extremely fresh tasting ingredients.  I am partial to the pineapple and feta cheese.  I love the fact that they put the feta on after they blaze the pizza so it doesn't destroy the composition of it.\n\nDue to the nature of their service model your pizza will always be piping hot.\n\nTheir traditional sauce is tasty and a bit sweet.  I used to denounce putting sugar in pizza sauce until I realized it was delicious.\n\nThe basil pesto sauce (known as pesto by most) is fresh and traditional.  I have yet to have a pizza better pesto pizza.\n\nRoom for improvement - One time they burnt the bottom pretty good which was unfortunate ( I do like a little bit of char but this was burnt).  Also, it is expensive.  That being said I would rather pay $10 for a high quality pizza that fills me up than pay $5 for a hot n ready that inevitably fills me with regret.\n\nI suggest giving My Pizzetta a try, it is worth the risk.
