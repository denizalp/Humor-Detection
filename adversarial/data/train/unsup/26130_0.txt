The management here is horrible! I had let a friend of mine borrow my car a few times. He planned on showing his appreciation by taking the car to get detailed at Danny's. What a mistake! As the car was being vacuumed one of the Danny's employees moved the (manual) driver's seat forward carelessly causing it to jam. He couldn't get the seat to move back at all, it was shoved all the way forward. A few of the employees were trying to un-jam the seat, each one using a little more force. The seat handle finally broke off. Now it's getting dark. The detail is not even close to being done. The seat is all the way forward. The driver is 6'7\". This is not good! Instead of completing the detail that was paid for, Danny's is still trying to fix the seat. At dusk it is determined that the car has to go to the dealer for the seat repair. The manager on duty issues a vehicle damage report stating the seat was broken and could not be repaired on premises and must be taken to the dealer. The detail is not completed. Danny's offers no partial refund due to the incomplete detail. What happens over the course of the next week is essentially why I'm giving Danny's this review. The next morning I have no other alternative than to take my car to the dealer. I am 6'2\" and the seat is shoved all the way forward. I cannot drive the car more than a mile or two, it's not safe. The dealer makes the seat movable and orders the replacement part. I show Danny's the estimate and management now claims no responsibility and suggests I call corporate to get their opinion. Epic failure. They claim innocence and suggest I (or my overly tall friend) caused the seat to break. Why would I have any reason to push the seat all the way forward?? Unless...I was...ummm vacuuming\/cleaning the vehicle (which was what I paid Danny's for!). Danny's refused to reimburse me for the past and my car never was fully detailed. Definitely not a \"win-win\" situation.
