I am a total loss for how people don't love this place?!\n\nCame on Saturday afternoon looking for some outdoor furniture.  My wife and I were immediately greeted when we walked in but not with a sales pitch.  A simple hello was all we got.  Wow, I thought, no sales pressure that's refreshing!  We walked around and eventually found the outdoor furniture section.  We casually perused the options and never got the \"hawk salesperson\" pressure we expected.  Once we decided what we wanted to purchase we found a salesperson who was more than happy to help us.  She wrote down all of our selections and helped us also find a couple of nightstands and lamps we needed too.  When she rang us up I liked how each item was shown to us in a picture before the final order was confirmed.  Most of our items were in stock at their warehouse so delivery was available within 2 days!  \n\nOur lamps were available to take with us so we got to experience their pickup process.  This is where these guys really shine.  They hand you a pager, similar to a restaurant on a wait.  You go get in your car and wait for it to go off.  When it does there is a delivery bay number that displays on the pager and all you do is pull up to that bay.  An employee very politely loaded our purchases into the trunk, collected the pager, and asked us about our experience.  He was polite, friendly, and a breath of fresh air compared to other similar furniture stores.\n\nOverall we were very impressed and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a ton of options at reasonable pricing!
