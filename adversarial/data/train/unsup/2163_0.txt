After 2.5 years of frustration, we finally have concluded that this school is lead by experimenting amateurs.  They promise one thing (open communication, parent partnership, students honored, etc.) and deliver another.  They are riding on the coat tails of many dissatisfied parents leaving CCSD schools. \n\nBuyer beware.  I would suggest that the school does a decent job in early grades (K-3) and has fails miserably at Hillpointe campus in upper grades (4-8).  For every 1 good teachers, there are 3 marginal teachers.  I find that many charter schools are weak in the recruitment of teachers because they are unable to offer competitive compensation.  \n\nI have watched a revolving door of students during our time here.  After 2.5 years, my daughter would make herself sick in order to not go to school each Monday.  When she arrived there, she was an enthusiastic and high achieving learner.  This dissatisfaction evolved over time due to an over arching lack of respect and honor for their students.   \n\nThis school is in its third year and they have much to learn. Unfortunately, the leadership of this school is not open and positioned in their own inadequacies.  \n\nBuyer beware.
