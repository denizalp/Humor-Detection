My boyfriend and I love Bitz-ee Mama's! The breakfast is pretty great! The chicken fried steak is really good. No grizzly pieces-believe me-I am always the person to find a nasty piece of meat, and I did not find one bad piece. The staff is super friendly, and the prices are good. Parking is easy to find, which is also a definite plus! I would highly recommend it!
