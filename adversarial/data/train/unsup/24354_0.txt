Update: I went to an urgent care after going to the ER here and they did a proper flush of my ear and actually helped me. When I went to the ER here, this mean lady doctor comes in and knows I'm in pain. Unsympathetically takes 10 seconds with one look in my ear, subscribes drops and amoxicillin, and goes away. Makes me feel bad for being there honestly. She should have seen that my ear was completely blocked and bleeding but she rushed through it after I waited 2 hours. F this hospital. If you don't want to help people, don't be a doctor you dumb C. I will post Her name ASAP. I guess go to UMC but I don't know. It all sucks here. Fly to DC or NY for some REAL doctors. All Desert trash with lab coats on out here. If we  want to be a respected city and not the worlds Bourbon Street, we need to improve everyday living in the Valley. Our highly ranked hospitals are considered a joke in any other major city. This one is the worst of the worst. Cedars-Sinai is only 4 hours away....\n\n\n\"Dr\" Suzanne Marie Roozendaal is who I saw. 3 days after seeing her, still in agonizing pain (which I thought is why you went to ER?). She rushed me through like it was a Jewish Deli. Arrogant and asked me why I didn't have a primary physician. Just the overprescribing of antibiotics and on her way. Found a nice place that flushed my ear and actually helped me. Had to call a Doc friend in DC to get an appt though lol. Doctor Roozendaal should be working at a Chipotle. She clearly had a bad day or has seen so much crap that she doesn't care anymore. Bitch
