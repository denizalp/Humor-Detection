The sushi was very good, and really decently priced. My lady friend and I had the one called a mexican roll and unless youre a fan of very spicy I dont recommend it. I am so I found the thin slice of raw jalapeno a treat. The only reason Im giving it 4 stars and not 5 is solely based on the fact they definitely needed another server. Her and I sat for almost 5 minutes before our drink orders were taken. Minus that Ill definitely be back again whenever I get a sushi craving.
