A different kind of pizza, which is refreshing in the Valley. I also enjoy the bar setup, it's a good place to have a drink on a nice day. UPDATE: This is one of my favorite places in the Valley, both the Desert Ridge and Hilton Village locations. All day Happy Hour, kids eat free on Sunday, very fun and friendly staff! Tell a friend.
