The only reason we ate here was because we were between two shows that were both in MGM. Well we should have eaten somewhere else. Anywhere else. This buffet is terrible. There is literally nothing positive I could say about it. When a buffet features several different kinds of cold cuts to make a sandwich that should be a sign that your not going to be happy with the quality. All the food was just blah and basic. Somethings were bland others were just not flavorful. The crab was over cooked and had an odd color to the meat. Not white like it should be. The the Asian selections were just basic. The best thing that I ate there was some sausage. The desserts were even blah. You should go to literally any other buffet.
