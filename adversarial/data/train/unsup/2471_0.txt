Michael is a great trainer who knows his stuff.  He gives a great workout that gets me sweating and leaves me sore.  I swear I want to vomit after every workout because I am so out of shape, but I keep going back for more.  The Body Shop is less than a minute from where I work and on my route home so it is difficult for me to dream up an excuse to be lazy and not workout.  Michael is available at times that are perfect for me and his rates are extremely fair, so I have no complaints other than how sore I am typing this.\n\nThe gym isn't the biggest, but it doesn't matter.  His equipment is nice, the place is clean, and you get a kick-ass workout.  I'd recommend Michael to anybody that needs a trainer.
