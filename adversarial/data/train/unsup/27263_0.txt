I have been wanting to try this place after learning about the benefits of a raw food diet and after having lunch here I must say that this will be my go to place. I love the building that Luna's is located in plenty of windows for sunshine and beautiful hard wood flooring . This place has an ultra sleek big city metropolitan feel to it. I started my lunch with the falafel sampler and it was delicious it also came with a yummy hummus and delicious pickled vegetables. As my drink I tried the chai latte which is made in house it puts Starbucks to shame. As my main entree I had the Rawco Taco salad and thought I was in heaven . To top it all off I had dessert it was a pumpkin like cheese cake and it was amazing . Even if your not vegan this is a place that is a must try for everyone. The staff is friendly and the food is good for you and the planet ! It's a win win for everybody .
