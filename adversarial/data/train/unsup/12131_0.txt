As someone who judges a book by its cover, or in this case its title, I came into this place with almost zero expectation since it has such a goofy name. The older gentleman who worked the front door greeted me warmly and offered his help right away. Already that's a great sign! My goal of coming here is to find Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling so I asked him to show me the Philosophy section. Almost instantly, fear I felt while looking at this disappointingly sparse Philosophy section. After all, philosophy is the root of mankind's motives and behaviors and all things morals, ethics, progress and innovation. After I took some time browsing this area and not seeing what I came here for, I started to roam to other sections of the shop, including the Math and Science aisles. \n\nOne thing I noticed is the fluctuation in price for various books. Fermi's Thermodynamics costs a whooping 17 dollars for a tiny little pocket booklet with no more than 30 pages. This wasn't a first edition or a limited edition; upon searching quickly on amazon I can find a new one for less than 7 dollars. Meanwhile, Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers by Stanley Farlow only costs 16 dollars when it should probably go for more. Various other Feynman's books are quite pricey for being used, which makes me wonder if they know that you can read most of these books for free online. \n\nI want to see used bookstores flourish in Las Vegas. Hence, this place has my patronage. I just wish their prices are more reasonable so I don't feel bad spending ~30 dollars or more on a used science book.
