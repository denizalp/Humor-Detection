Terrible, terrible service.  i should have known it was going to be bad when we stood at the hostess stand and watched the alleged hostess eat her lunch in a booth.  i cleared my throat and that is what it took to get her attention to look up and notice us after approximately 2 min of standing there.   She wasnt even watching the door (clearly she didn't care).  it was 3pm on a Tuesday.  The place was a ghost town and our blonde haired server was nowhere to be found BEFORE we ordered and after we ordered.  We waited 25 minutes for our food.  I watched the kitchen staff goof off from our booth seats.   When our food arrived it was BEYOND hot. I mean scorching hot.  I have never tasted food that temperature in my life.  When we left I saw the same hostess in the kitchen, goofing off with the kitchen staff.  And the table next to us was trying to find our server.  The best thing to happen to that Red Robin was the installation of kiosks at the table.  You can pay your check right at the table instead of needing to put up a flare to get your server's attention.  No excuses for any of what we experienced today.
