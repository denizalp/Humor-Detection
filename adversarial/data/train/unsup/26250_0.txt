Super stoked that there is a new spot for dinner around the corner from where my boyfriend and I live. I work in the industry as a server but I must say (whoever he was, he wasn't our server) approached our table within minutes of us sitting. He was a team player for our server. He got our drinks and helped us pick out an appetizer. Our server was a little frazzled but nothing to complain about. She was wearing glasses and had tattoos (don't know her name) but she was very prompt and had an awesome personality. But let's get to our apps. We had the spinach dip- BOMB!!! We then ordered a bacon burger (AMAZING) and  the seafood ciopinno (ehh so-so) The only complaint was that I wasn't fond of the sauce in the seafood dish but it was good overall. Another nice thing was the manager\/owner approached our table and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. We will definitely be back. And who knows itmay become a regular place for dinner with it being so close to home.
