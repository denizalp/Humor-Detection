This place is HIP and HAPPENIN!  Located where Heartland Cafe used to be, this new and exciting addition to Bridgeland is sure to please all coffee drinkers and hipsters alike!\n\nTheir nutella latte is to diiiie for but comes with a hefty $5 price tag for a large.  This is a great place as a treat once in awhile but I don't quite think they're giving Blue Star Diner a run for their money just yet.\n\nI ordered the Bacon Benny, and welll..... was underwhelmed to say the least.  Eggs were cooked soft (prefer medium) but was not asked.  The eggs, etc. were UNDERseasoned and the side of potatoes were OVERseasoned, it just wasn't a good balance and with no salt or pepper in sight.  The bacon was fatty, and when the bill came I couldn't believe it was $16.  Bitch, please.  That is way too much spenny for underwhelming Eggs Benny and 6 tater tots, I'm sorry.  Meanwhile, next to me the lady was eating the French Toast equivalent to \"50 Shades of Gray\".  I seriously almost asked her if she wanted to be alone with her brunch.  I had brunch-ordering remorse.  Next time I'll get the stuffed french toast for sure.  Hard to top the staff and those lattes though, keep up the good work !  (But please revisit the eggs benny...)
