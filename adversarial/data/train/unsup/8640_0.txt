So disappointed. My husband ate here 20yrs ago and loved it. We've been talking and talking about going back and now we are sorry we did. \n\nFood was mediocre at best. My husband couldn't wait to get the sauerkraut balls because he remembered them being so good, they weren't. His gnocchi was awful. The water tasted like it came out of a hose. The cheesecake was rubbery. On a bright note, the beer was good and so was the coffee. \n\nOur water had very little personality. He acted like we were a bother. I'm sure he would rather have been laying home on the couch. \n\nThe decor is very old and so were most of the diners. I don't think they have tried some of the new good Italian places, they are just stuck in their old rut of eating here. \n\nThis is one and done for us. (Have gone once and won't return). My favorite part of this meal was leaving \n\nVery very disappointed
