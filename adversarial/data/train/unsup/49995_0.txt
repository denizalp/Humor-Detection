I have been in the iPhone line for over an hour for them to just put my name on a list to come back tomorrow. This is so unorganized. I heard at Walmart it took people about 5 minutes to do the same thing. And now even though I am making an appointment the manager just texted of us it's possible we show up and even though we are reserving a phone they have in stock it's possible that it won't be here if someone who comes in earlier changes their mind and wants my phone they can take it. After that caused some crumbling now they will put these aside... sounds a little sketch to me!
