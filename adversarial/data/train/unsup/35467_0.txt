Amazing atmosphere, especially during the warmer months! The rooftop deck is beautiful and provides a very different view of the city skyline. Very big and seasonally-changing drink menu provides many different options. Variety of different foods to choose from, but you really can't go wrong with a classic margherita pizza. They also have a tiki lounge on the roof every Sunday, with tons of different tropical, fun drinks. Will definitely be back, again and again!
