Went there to have prescription lenses placed in my new sunglasses.  Staff were pleasant and knowledgeable about their products.  Service-wise, not bad, a bit slow as there were other customers there who were getting their glasses adjusted.  Their promotions are also very good.  Overall pleasant environment in the store.  I would (and will) return in the future.
