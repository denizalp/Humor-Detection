Best market I have been to, hands down! Ever! Even better than my Armenian markets here! Akhavan is fairly large, they carry everything you need from fresh produce, to flat breads, to fresh meats and prepared foods. \n\nI spent about the same that I would normally spend at my Armenian places here in the states which included some prepared Boregs and such. Also, I have never once in my life seen a jar of grape leaves for less than $4. Akhavan had a few brands which were $1.99 per jar. WHAT?! \n\nOh can I also express how fricken huge their nuts are? They have a whole wall of nuts. Infront of that wall is a long table of bins filled with nuts. I had no idea there were so many nuts to be had!\n\nAnyway..if I ever live here this will be one of my top places to shop! Oh and they have a parking lot!
