Walking in there and immediately i felt like i just teleported to a bar in mexico. Decor is dated, furniture are mix and match, but it all was part of the charm. Fish tacos, camarones a la diabla, calimari, and a pitcher of beer. This is gold. \n\nThis place also has live music, like all the time. We stumbled upon Madagascar music night and blues night. Oh the musicians are actually so talented and a great joy to watch. \n\nThe locals love this place, which adds a bit more of that old world neighborlycharm. Love this place!
