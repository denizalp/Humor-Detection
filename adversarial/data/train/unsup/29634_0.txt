Had the potato, sausage, rosemary and mozzarella pizza. It was absolutely delicious! I love the decor inside with the cool looking wall. We ordered a half pizza and it only took like 20 mins for a fresh one to be made. While we waited we had a fried rice ball which was really tasty as well. It gets really busy at lunch so you can tell its a hot spot! \nI'd come back again for sure.
