Loved it!!! We decided to give this restaurant a try since it is so close to where we live. We were very pleasantly surprised. The wait staff was great and the food even better.\nMy husband always asks a lot of questions before ordering at a new place and the server did not steer him wrong. She suggested the veal saltimbocca because the veal had just come in and was trimmed and pounded 45 minutes earlier. It was delicious. We joked that he definitely out-ordered me, even though my eggplant rollatini was really really good too. We will definitely go back there. The atmosphere was wonderful, nice and quiet. We could actually talk to each other and hear each other. \nGreat place!
