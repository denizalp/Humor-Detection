I think this place is getting a bad reputation for some reason... not really sure why.  They were out of something I wanted, but what I got was fine.  Foodwise I ordered a burger and fries and it was decent.  I really enjoyed sitting on their patio and seeing the view of the mountain.  I think it's one of the better patios in the Cave Creek area.  Service was good too for the most part.  No major problems.  The only problem at all was that they handed me a menu that had two pages and both the pages were the same page, but they fixed it right away.  I hope this place sticks around because I think it's kind of cool.  I don't think the food and service were over the top good, but they definitely weren't bad either.  I think this place maybe just needs some time.  That and some events going on.
