I have only been to the strip district location and i can't get enough of this place (my waist not included).... Its a few blocks from my yoga studio and even after 90 painful minutes of sweating out carbs i always find myself back here. I recently discovered their basil pesto bread and it has become a weekly staple. It is simply the bomb. com. Fresh,soft and spicy. Just dip it in some olive oil and vinaigrette and you will be on cloud 9. I have always gotten my pizza dough and bread crumbs from here and they are both well made and cheap I refuse to shop anywhere else. Their breads stay fresh for a really long time too. My only wish is that they stayed open a little bit longer on weekdays (they close at 4 pm).
