I enjoyed the atmosphere of this really cute shop with a lofty feel.  I was however quickly unimpressed with their steep pricing. They seem to cater to a younger crowd so you would expect the pricing to be a bit more reasonable.  \n\nI did order their chai latte and i really liked it, but it is not my first cup of chai so i think it's safe to say it was some kind of packaged product.   My hubby ordered the pistachio latte  which was amazing however both drinks were not as hot as we would have liked them to be.  \n\nHe also ordered a $9 waffle with pecans, maple syrup and whip cream which I thought was terrible.   It was dense and like a sourdough type of recipe.  They really pride themselves in their waffles but i have to completely disagree and at $9 it was totally not what I expected and it was also quite small (thank goodness in this case) .  Most of their desserts do however start at $9 so not sure I would want to choose different and be wrong again. \n\nI am not sure about this joint yet, as my lasting impression of this place seems to be the high pricing and awful waffle. They do offer free WiFi and the service was pleasant.
