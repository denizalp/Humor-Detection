This place had potential.  I love the name and logo.  Sadly, I was let down.  It is hard core bar food.  Wings - mediocre, but I think they were frozen.  No blue cheese?  Wtf?  Only one house sauce?  Double Wtf?   Nachos - shredded chedder spread on top and broiled in oven, really?  Salsa from a jar, yuck.  Not very good.  Poutine - come on, this is Montreal.  Fries are frozen, gravy was tasteless --- cheese curds were okay.   Cheeseburger - decent but again just mediocre.
