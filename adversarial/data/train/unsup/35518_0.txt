Not sure if any of these reviews are of recent visits, but the food and service that I experienced was amazing.  The iPad wine list is fun to scroll through, an it is extensive.  \nWith a menu that changes daily, you know things are fresh!  My party had the calamari appetizer - which wasn't over the top, typical calamari.  I had the Wolf fish special and wow was I impressed!  Served with tomato and cucumber quinoa - the flavors were fantastic!  Another person I my party also had the Wolf fish and she almost licked her plate clean!!!  I don't eat red meat, but the pork tenderloin was also enjoyed!\nDesserts were a great way to finish our girls night out and the cappuccino torte was also phenomenal!!!  Highly recommended!  \nI will be back!
