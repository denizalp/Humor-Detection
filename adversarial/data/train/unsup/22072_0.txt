Came for Ellie Goulding- the show was totally fun, but I'm totally annoyed at drink prices. I paid almost 30 $ for three shots of fireball. COME ON. ....and then for some odd reason I felt the need to tip the bartender who pretty much ignored us and acted like it was a burden to pour the shots. Also, they came in tiny thimble sized plastic containers..yah, it was the correct pour, but looked cheap. For what I paid I want that stuff in their finest crystal.
