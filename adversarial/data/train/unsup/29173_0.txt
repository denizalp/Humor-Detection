I booked the car online and the price for it should be $105 but when I arrived to the ACE rental they asked me to pay around $180 for 2 days car rental which wasn't the same price online .. so I had to argue with them a lot and they made me pay $138 which is still more than the online price that I should paid .. also the rental place is somewhere else than the airport rental car .. so you should take 2 shuttles to arrive to the car rental shop ..
