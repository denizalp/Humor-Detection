We tried some rolls, tempura, and ramen. I'm a huge ramen fan (not the cup-o-soup kind of ramen) and this was NOT real ramen, which requires a slow-cooked pork broth as the soup base. This ramen's soup base was thin, almost like they opened a can of beef broth and added some soy sauce. Also, there was no soft-boiled egg in the ramen, which is usually pretty standard. Rolls were fine, tempura was generously portioned. Service was good, but for the price I would not go back.
