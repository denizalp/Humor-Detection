Came in 3\/19\/2015 930am 14 tables empty and a 20 minute wait. People were signing themselves in since no one was attending the hostess stand. People were walking out because there was no service and so many empty tables. Plus it was raining outside so everyone was crammed into the lobby area and was highly irritated at each other and the staff.
