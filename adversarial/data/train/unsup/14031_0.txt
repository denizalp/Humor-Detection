Odd layout at this Walmart, and once again annoying employees that have to make smartass comments about your checkout.\n\n\"Hey, did ya leave any vegetables in the produce section?\"\n\"No.  None in the freezer section either.\"\n\"Are you going to eat all of that.\"\n\"Nope, just buying it to let it rot.\"
