Hachi is one of the latest izakayas to open up shop, taking up residence along the popular corners of Jones and Spring Mountain.  With ramen (Ramen Sora) and AYCE sushi (Sushi Twister) under their belts, the owners went a different route with their newest venture in yakitori. \n\nGreeted promptly and eagerly on a recent Sunday evening, the restaurant was a third full with Japanese-speaking clientele. \n\nOur waiter was thorough and energetic with explaining the menu and there was a bit to review.  We ordered a little of everything, but let's get to my favorites first. \n\n* Crispy Chips \"Deep fried chicken skin chips with house seasoning\" ($3) - Oh. My. Gawd. This had me dancing in my seat! Fresh off the fryer with a squeeze of lemon and I am having a party in my mouth. I love deep fried chicken skin and their version just makes me so happy. As a result, we added 2 more orders. Love love love! \n\n* Yamaimo Chips \"Japanese mountain yam skin fried isobe style\" ($3) - Having only experienced this dish at one other place, we were psyched to see it here. Yum. Yum. Yum. Can I get an Amen? Oh yeah! There's a limit of 3 orders a day since they don't carry a huge quantity of mountain yams. We were more than happy to claim all 3 for ourselves.\n\n* Ika Karaage \"Deep fried squid\" ($3.50) - A tasty aioli accompanied this dish.\n\n* Skipjack Tataki Hachi Style ($6.50) - This dish came from their specials board. It's loaded with raw red onions, which may not be something for everyone. I especially liked the shiso leaf, onions, and mayo(?) combination, but it was a little too heavy-handed with the Hachi sauce.\n\n* Assorted Sashimi Bowl ($9.98) - This came with about 10 pieces of fresh fish on top of rice. It didn't taste like sushi rice and I didn't expect it to be since they don't serve any nigiri here from what I gathered. This is a great opportunity to use their special soy sauce blend made with bonito flakes, so it's a bit sweeter.\n\n* Scallop Carpaccio \"Scallop sashimi topped with masago, cherry tomatoes, micro cilantro and micro greens. Splashed with olive oil, white soy sauce, lemon yuzu, and yuzu miso sauce.\" ($9.95) - The scallop was fresh and bright, and the fish eggs were flavorful (although they seemed more like tobiko than masago). I wasn't the hugest fan of the micro cilantro and micro greens and felt the yuzu miso sauce took away from the clean flavors of the seafood.\n\n* Halibut and Sea Urchin Carpaccio \"Thinly sliced halibut topped with seared sea urchin, green onion, momiji oroshi and yuzu ponzu.\" ($12.50) - Although delicately presently, it lacked something. The flavors weren't coming out as much as we would have hoped for this dish.\n\n* Tsukune with Oroshi Ponzu ($3.50) - It's made with ground pork and was surprisingly quite juicy. Their yakitori does take awhile, so I suggest putting those orders in early. They use Binchotan charcoal (versus a gas grill or regular charcoal), which means the food grills at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. Be sure to utilize their condiments, specifically the Buta miso which is made from miso and crispy pork discards.\n\n* Otsumami 3 Kinds ($5) - We received bean sprouts, squid and seaweed, and bonito flakes and veggies. It was a little uninspiring. It does change regularly though. \n\nWe tried ordering their Match soft serve, but it was unavailable. \n\nOverall, food was good. I would come back just for the Crispy Chips and Yamaimo Chips for sure. I would request light sauce or sauce on the side for the sashimi dishes, but that's my preference. I would definitely be interested to see what other specials they offer and any additions to their current menu. Service was attentive and polite. Water glasses were constantly filled and they worked as a team checking up on us. Love that.\n\nNote: They do use peanuts as their chopstick holders, so those with severe peanut allergies should be aware!
