Hello fellow Yelpers! Tired of going to your chains such as Denny's, IHOP and Waffle House? Then I'd suggest you run your azz over to Original Breakfast. \n\nNOTE: Be prepared to wait for a table. Yes, they're pretty slammed on the weekends. \n\nI ordered the Big Gooey Scramble Mess and when I tasted it, thought I was in some divine universe because I heard harps and saw angels circling. True story.\n\nEven their black coffee was great, ppl! And, it was presented in our very own carafe for self-service warmups?! Whaa?? \n\nService was so accommodating (by bestie and I prefer to sit in booths on the perimeter, not at table in middle of room), by moving us to a better table. Our server did frequent check-ins and answered our questions without any 'tude. I did tip her very well. \n\nSo, it's settled - I think I'm in lust\/love with this restaurant. I'm in deep, folks.
