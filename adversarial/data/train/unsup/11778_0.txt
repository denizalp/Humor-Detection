Pacific Mall has been on my Toronto To-Do list since I got here two years ago and I finally made it out there. Needless to say, it was completely packed; I'm not sure if that's because it was Lunar New Year's Eve or if it's normally that packed, but I had to practically Mario Andretti myself into a parking space.\n\nThere are some amazing things to see in Pacific Mall and the photographer really wanted to come out in me; I restrained myself, however, what with being one of the few blonde people in the joint, I thought it best to refrain. There were all kinds of roots, herbs and pickled things, but which were written in Mandarin\/Cantonese, so I'd have zero clue what they were for.\n\nI ended up buying some DVD's (10 for $30), which rocked; of course, they are dubbed in Chinese characters which I can't seem to turn off. Meh -- win some, lose some. :-)
