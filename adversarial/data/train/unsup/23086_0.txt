Located in the food court area at the Flamingo hotel. \nThey were open pretty late when I went there. It was after midnight. \nYou place your order at the counter and you get a beeper to let you know wen your food is ready. \nSeating is just some cafeteria style tables and seats. \nGood for a late night snack or meal.
