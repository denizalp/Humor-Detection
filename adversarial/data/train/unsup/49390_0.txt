Fast casual style restaurant. \n\nService 5 star: fast and friendly. Ordering online was nice. \n\nAmbience 5 star: nice and new\n\nFood: 3.5-4 star\nKabab was quite good. Vegetarian plate was also very good.  The one letdown was the babaganouch, it was down right gross.  It had the consistency of snot. Nasty. \n\nI'd go back...just won't get the babaganouch.
