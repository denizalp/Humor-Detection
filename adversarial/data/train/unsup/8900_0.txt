This is my new favourite Farmers' Market! The family-friendly vibes at this park are always welcoming, but yesterday was my first time experience the market. My hungry hippo and I got the delicious organic popsicles, and then I couldn't resist the 3\/$5 pierogi deal at the table right next door.\n\nI will certainly be returning for produce, lamb and just about everything else you need to start your week off right. What a perfect little Monday pocket of Parkdale!
