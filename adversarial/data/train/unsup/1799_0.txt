I'm giving this show two stars only because a friend called me a one-star hater. But really, this is a one star show compared to everything else in Vegas.\n\nPrior to the show, I thought Criss Angel was bad ass. Kind of like Satan. Walking on spikes, eating snakes, getting run over by bulldozers, he seemed like an entertaining guy, albeit a little cheesy. I thought he could do magic. Since it is his job.\n\nThis show proved to be the exact opposite of magical. I don't know if it was the possessed dancing Cirque rabbits or the fact that he used blatantly fake legs when he cut himself in half, but the whole production was incredibly anticlimactic. The plot went something like:\n\nCriss Angel has weird S&M relationship with his psycho, head thrashing, camera woman who also turns out to be his arch nemesis dressed in black. Criss Angel then has a healthy relationship with a nice blond girl dressed in white. Angry thrashing camera woman sends evil rabbits to kill Criss Angel. Criss Angel dies.\n\nAnd that was it. I have to commend Cirque du Soleil, though - they definitely saved the show and made my 2 hours quasi entertaining.
