This Starbucks is in a convenient location within a shopping center along with a drive-thru for those on the go. The baristas\/cashier here are friendly and gave good service. I came in the afternoon with no wait which was a plus and therefore the drinks were made efficiently. My ICED AMERICANO was perfect along with my other purchase of two teas: one iced and the other one hot. Overall, your typical Starbucks... but a good one when needing your caffeine fix in the area.
