DO NOT GO! The service is HORRIBLE!\n\nSimilar to other reviews, the OWNER needs a reality check and she needs to take a class on how to treat customers properly. I have never felt so humiliated,  angered and disappointed than I did when I dined there. I was a frequent visitor to this sushi place because I stayed right down the street. They have my favorite roll, the \"Mt. Charleston\" and they offered salmon belly, which sadly enough, I can't seem to get anywhere else. However, my friend and I ordered AYCE  and I ate my meal and he didn't. It was his first time and he should've just ordered one roll  (our fault) but he had a half roll left over. When it was time to pay, they were slow getting us the check because the OWNER decided to tell us to finish his roll before she could give us a check. Needless to say, things escalated and she was very disrespectful and went as far as to put her hands on me!  She was SO rude and I vowed to NEVER go there again. It's unfortunate for the staff at that place and I just hope she values her employees.  I tipped the staff and I left so upset. I will make it my duty to never direct people to this place again. \n\nAlso, the kitchen smells  really bad.
