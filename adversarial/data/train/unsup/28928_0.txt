They have lots of candies, but are pretty pricey.\nWhat I like best from sugar is their gelato.\nFor $5 you can get a tiny cup of gelato, I chose the strawberry one which is really good. Its light & refreshing, you can taste the quality of it, and all the strawberries as well, it's also sweet but not too\nsweet & has a sorbet texture. Perfect for a hot day in vegas!
