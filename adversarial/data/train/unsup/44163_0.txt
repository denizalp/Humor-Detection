I went with my husband. I was really looking forward to taking him there since I really enjoyed the Lazy Dog in Downtown Summerlin. Unfortunately, the location in Town Square was quite disapointing. I ordered the Thai Noodles which just ended up being a soup-ey mess. Between our appetizer and our meal, a server (seemed like the manager) placed a plate of what looked like potato chips on our table. She explained that they were complimentary-as a \"thank you\" for coming in. Although my husband and I appreciated the gesture, we're not potato chip fans. We politely asked our regular server to take them back. She seemed very irritated and frustrated at this request stating; \"well now we'll just have to throw them out\". Finally, our food arrived but was less than impressive (as previously stated). Our server kept our drinks refilled, but somehow refilled my husband's plane iced tea with some kind of sweet tea. Again, we politely asked for a fresh glass of tea, only to have the server roll her eyes at us and quickly take the glass away. The food was pretty unimpressive and the wait staff seemed frustrated with us. I won't be back to this location.
