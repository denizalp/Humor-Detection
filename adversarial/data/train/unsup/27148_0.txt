Went to Blue velvet lounge recently on a Thursday night, which is latin themed on Thursdays. This is a martini bar, and they offer a very large variety of martini's and they are all delicious. They also have other specials as well for other mixed drinks. The first floor is a chill social area that is lit up in a blue tinted lights. The upstairs has another bar and the dance floor. When we went, the dance floor was packed and everyone was having a great time. There was a huge wait to get up to the second floor after a short while. Unfortunately, the second floor does not have bathrooms so you need to go downstairs and then wait in line to get back up, which took my friend about a half hour. In addition, this bar does not give free water. My friend who was driving us home and was not drinking alcohol asked for water and they would only offer bottled water for a dollar. This was reasonable, but most bars in the area offer water for free so this was slightly irritating. Overall, I will come back and love the feel of this place. Drinks are reasonably priced and taste good.
