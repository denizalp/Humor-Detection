I had pretty low expectations for this pan-Asian resto. Despite the slow service, they let a group of 4 of us hang out for hours and slowly order our meals dish by dish. The food tasted better than I thought for something that really is fasian (my term for fake Asian) food but the prices aren't horrible given how new the decor is and there's plenty of space. it depends on the dish because I thought the mango salad was a sad array fruit with of lots of salt (yes salt!) in it! The best part was the free bubble tea when you check in on the Yelp mobile app.
