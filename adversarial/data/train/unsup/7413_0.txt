I bought a 2007 Passat Wagon from CarMax in Henderson 2 years ago. The car had issues from DAY 1. I tried to take it back the first day after my mechanic looked at it. CarMax said they would fix any issues and if I wasn't satisfied they would allow me the 5 day refund and return. THIS IS A LIE. The car had an oil leak, vacuum and turbo issues and countless other issues. RECALLS from VW that were not small. When I tried to return it they said they would not allow a refund (ON THE 5th day when they had it in their service dept for 4 days) and they said I had to pick out a car on the lot in Henderson and they would not refund or get a car from another location (they do this for new customers, but not for me when I put 5K down on the LEMON. \n\nBUYER BEWARE. LEMONS FOR SALE AND A RETURN POLICY THAT IS A LIE. Also, I am not in deep with a complete front engine repair.
