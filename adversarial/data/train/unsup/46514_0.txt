This review is based on a two members of her staff, so by proxy, this reflects upon her office. \n\nWhen I first called, I explained to the older man who answer the phone what I was looking for. Mid-conversation, he cut me off by saying, \"ya, ya\" and ushering me to the end of the conversation. He then said he would have Shelley give me a call. Shelley was pleasant and got back to me quickly, however she was going to have to call me back again later with the information.\nThe next correspondence was from James, who called me and gathered a general overview of what I was looking for, and that he would send it by email. Two more calls later and multiple attempts to have him resend it (I was not getting it), I finally received the information. But to my dismay, it wasn't the correct information and we had a couple of email exchanges before he got it right. Three people in and still they couldn't get it right. \nI finally had some information on what I needed, but I had questions, as my need of a specific kind of supplemental insurance was not something they handle often and was apparent from the information and the delays. I had another question for James and replied to his email, but a week+ later and I still do not have a response. \nI get it, I had questions and it wasn't a piece of cake, but wow, passing me around, forgetting vital information that wastes both of our time and completely ignoring my emails, that is highly unprofessional. None of these actions are conducive to long-term customers.\n\nSave yourself time and energy, find another agent\/office!
