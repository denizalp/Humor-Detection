A new diner in the up and coming beltline? Wellll..... I don't know. Oh, they make their own butter? Their own bacon? Grind their own chuck?\n\nWow!\n\nWhat?? They have a bunch of kinds of pie? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!\n\nI stopped in here tonight with a mission and that mission was pie and coffee. I wanted diner pie in a new diner.\n\nFirst of all, this place is beautiful. We came in the evening so we got to see the low lights, interesting fixtures, and tea lights on the tables. Comfy Boothe's, wooden tables, and a bar to belly up to. \n\nMy favorite thing right off the bat was how friendly the staff were despite being really busy and selling 30 pies today! And I must mention the 16 oz coffee cups. Now THAT'S a cup of coffee. Doesn't hurt its Fratello coffee, one of my faves.\n\nI ordered lemon meringue pie, another of my favorite things in the world, and I was not disappointed. Real lemon, tangy and sweet and topped with brown sugar meringue. I chose to top it with a scoop of Fiasco vanilla bean gelato. I am so smart, s-m-r-t.\n\nBreakfast is available all day, everything looks delicious! There's a kids menu and a full bar. Pretty much the best combination ever. Also, high chairs for the minis. \n\nWill be back ASAP.
