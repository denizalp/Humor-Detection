Do Not lease a property managed by this company. Yet another negative review about this company. \nTheir management fee which is several hundred dollars per month  is in addition to the advertised rent amount. Their failure to communicate and  response to issues is unacceptable. I have not not reached the end of my lease yet but based on a prior review should not even expect my money returned. This is a scam
