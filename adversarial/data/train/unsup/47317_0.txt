I've been a customer here for over a year and have always been happy, except for the one time they lost a shirt!  Good news though, they found it after a couple of days and didn't charge me.\n\nThe ladies at the front counter are always very nice.  This place isn't cheap but they do good work.\n\nUse the online coupon for a 20% discount on orders over $20.
