Willie our waiter was THE BEST! He made it so much fun. \nWe had such a great time. We laughed so hard until we cried. Food was good but the atmosphere is what you pay for. The pitch blackness was weird and hard to adjust to at first. But it is an experience I will never forget. Thanks Willie for making us laugh and let us be loud and silly. We had a blast!!
