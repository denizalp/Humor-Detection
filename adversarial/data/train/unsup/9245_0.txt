While coaching on deck at the Y, I managed to drop my iPhone flat, face down. It didn't fall hard, I've actually dropped it much harder in the past. Still, when I flipped it over the whole face was brutally shattered. Fortunately it continued to respond to my touch, with the added sensation of cutting me albeit on a microscopic level.\n   As more and more slivers of glass fell from its face I concluded that a repair could not wait, so I located Mac Masters with the Yelp App.\n   It did cross my mind to go to the Apple store, but I find they grossly overvalue their services. Hell, all they really need is a security guard, because now you can check out using the Apple Store App.\n   The Mac Masters' services were more expensive than I was hoping for, but I was very satisfied with my beautiful new pimped-out iPhone. Metallic blue face, new metallic silver case and battery upgrade left me with a smile that continues to this day :)
