So, my membership is through the location in Surprise. I am having billing issues with them and want to contact corporate since things aren't getting handled properly here. I called Surprise, Arrowhead and the Goodyear locations. Surprise rep and Arrowhead rep told me they'd have to call me back because they have to \"find\" it and she's helping a customer. Goodyear rep DEVIN answers and says he doesn't have it but \"is there something I can help with\"I tell him it's something id like to speak with corporate about and I've called around and a little annoyed no one has this on hand or makes any effort to get it. He goes \"i'm sorry\" and something in the tone of have a good day. I stop him and say \" I find it crazy how 3 locations cant just give me the number and now you wont even \"TRY\", there's NO ONE there that can get me this number?\" he goes to put me on hold and comes back saying \"this is the number I found\" with much hesitation and almost making it seem like \"if its not right then I have no clue\" .... FOUND? did you google this? Because I used google for the past 10 minutes and couldn't find it until I found the address to headquarters and then googled THAT and it brought up the number. I mean if you have someone on the phone asking for corporate why wouldn't you already from the beginning try to help them as best as you can? YES, he asked if there was something he could help me with but I have a feeling they just don't want you speaking with corporate AT ALL! But as a customer I shouldn't have to go through so much for this!
