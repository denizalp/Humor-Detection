God this place is amazing!  This is on my route to take the lil one when we come Downtown to see the lights and pig out at Christmas time each year.  Only thing is that only places to go are super high-end places that I wouldn't be caught dead in or random delis on the bottom floor more catering to the 9-5 lunch crowd.  Put in something maybe family friendly or more intresting to the average Clevelander on a Downtown excursion and I would spend way more time and money here, fo sho....  Hell, a bong shop and a shady rub-n-tug would probably do well here!
