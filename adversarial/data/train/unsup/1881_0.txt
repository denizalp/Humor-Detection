A group of coworkers and I went there several times during a conference for lunch.\n\nWe were seated quickly each time, but food always took a very long time to be served. Service was friendly, however.\n\nFood was decent, but I did love my Ahi Burger.\n\nThis restaurant is a higher end version of the Cheesecake Factory, but if I had to choose, I prefer the Cheesecake Factory.
