Lets just start by saying I hate Victoria's! Their employees are very sales oriented and it can be a tad annoying, then when you actually want to purchase something good luck trying to find someone to help you check out. They are always so helpful when you walk in but if you are an independent shopper like me and dont take that help right off the bat they will leave you hanging like a fly on the fly tape. This place is overrated but its too bad I wish it was a little more laxed on the sales and I could find a happy medium when I buy stuff here whether I buy all new intimates or when I just come in quick for their sucralose filled lip gloss and some chemical perfume. Curse you Victoria!!
