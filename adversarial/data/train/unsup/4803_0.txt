I think I just had the best steak dinner of my life.  Everything about our dinner was just impeccable!\n\nFirst of all our server, Anthony, was AWESOME.  He was friendly and energetic but definitely not aggressive or over the top.  He was fantastic about explaining everything on the menu and answering our questions, and he was excellent about making suggestions, especially when we were on the fence about some things.\n\nWe started out with Ty Nant sparkling spring water which was very good!  JAS likes beer with his steak, so he ordered the Moose Drool Brown Ale and thought it was great.  I asked if they had pineapple juice, which they did, but even better was that it was freshly squeezed!  Delicious.\n\nJAS and I had reviewed the menu online earlier in the day and decided that we were going to get the Roasted Beef Wellington for two.  We had watched enough Hell's Kitchen to make us want to try this famous dish.  We had mentioned this to Anthony prior to him bringing over the steak display which, by the way, was pretty impressive:\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=BVZECZd6-u3Zw45DfVKEtw#BVZECZd6-u3Zw45DfVKEtw\n\nAnthony said he would still go over the steaks with us, and we were glad he did.  JAS loves ribeyes, and when Anthony described the rib cap to us, he threw a wrench in our plans.  Ohhhh, what should we do?  He then said that he could have the kitchen split the orders into two plates if we wanted so we could try both.  What a fantastic idea!  So out went the Beef Wellington for two, in came the Beef Wellington for one AND the Kobe American Rib Cap.\n\nI wish I had a better memory because they served different kinds of bread with butter (did I hear Devonshire?) and volcanic sea salt.  Yummy.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=_UfQDFOJOaDyfUWiMOq08g#_UfQDFOJOaDyfUWiMOq08g\n\nWe started with the Heirloom Tomato Salad with red bell pepper vinaigrette, cucumber cauliflower puree, spiced marcona almonds.  They split it into two plates for us.  So fresh, so delicious.  I wanted to lick everything off that plate.  (I didn't!)  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=DhEwPJGDDfUy6huMrmYOLA#DhEwPJGDDfUy6huMrmYOLA\n\nThe Roasted Beef Wellington was served with glazed root vegetables, potato puree, and red wine demi glace.  This was no ordinary Beef Wellington.  Anthony had described what the steak was wrapped in but there were so many components that I can't remember it all!   It was split into two plates and it tasted wonderful!  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=3IqEuRS3GnDTuzecN8a0Ig#3IqEuRS3GnDTuzecN8a0Ig\n\nThe Kobe American Rib Cap was the most delicious steak I've ever eaten.  It is very flavorful and very tender.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=I97LcskpiJdDNT099LXU6A#I97LcskpiJdDNT099LXU6A\n\nWe ordered the Haricot Vert  (tempura fried, confit, with garlic citrus aioli) for our side.  A Yelper recommended this, so I wanted it.  It was good!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=EVS8qtI30r33YQANLarHTA#EVS8qtI30r33YQANLarHTA\n\nFor dessert, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding (sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream).  It is rich, it is sweet, it is remarkable.  I loved how the brown butter ice cream looked just like a stick of butter.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=uAXd7oN-Si5Ee_2P_YjgAA#uAXd7oN-Si5Ee_2P_YjgAA\n\nOur dinner was relaxing and more than pleasant.  Not once did we feel pressured to order one way or another.  Each member of the staff we interacted with was professional and genuinely friendly.  They made us feel welcome when we arrived and thanked us for visiting when we left.  Everything about our dinner experience was perfect.  \n\nWe have already decided that this will be a definite stop during our next visit to Vegas!
