I decided to come here since there were many reviews here on yelp. The restaurant setting was dim and there were booths, tables and bar area. We ordered a lot of different Korean and Japanese dishes, and sides. My parents favourite was the sashimi salad, which had a mixture of veggies, sashimi and really good salad dressing. My sister really enjoyed the udon which was shared amongst us four. We also ordered this large seafood soup which was spicy and had variety of seafood inside. The sashimi and sushi combo was fresh and they didn't use the typical white rice but this red bean rice(?) The servers at the restaurant were very kind, and nice. Our server remembered all of our orders without writing anything down, which is pretty impressive! Definitely would come again! A very nice selection of food :)
