Tried Kainan today with their famous bistek (beef steak), also tried other stuff the dinuguan, and shanghai rolls (0.50 each). \n\nThe bistek held its reputation. \n\ni gave it a four because the foods were very oily. probably why they were so good. i dont mind sifting the oils off. The dinuguan were ok. I like my dinuguan a little more sour depending on who's cooking and who's eating i guess. The rolls, i can taste a little oil while biting on the rolls. But other than that, the bistek supercedes everything I dont mind going back to try out their desserts and bakery.\n\nThe sweet and sour dip for the roll also looked and taste homemade, not too bad. Nice owners. Got there too early coz i only saw cassava's for dessert.\n\nKeep in mind, always bring cash. They dont have swipes and chips. Otherwise you'd have to risk your life crossing the street just to go to the atm machine.
