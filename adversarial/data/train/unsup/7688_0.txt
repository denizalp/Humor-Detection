This is my new favorite place to eat. If you like pastrami then get your butt over here now and get some. The Pastrami Boyger is great but the pastrami sandwich on its own is just brilliant. It isn't \"The Hat\" but it will damn do! The owners are super cool and make everything when you order it. The guy is pretty nice about customizing orders too. You can call your order in for pick up or eat inside. They have a pizza special that costs just over $5 and it tastes great. My wife ordered some of their Chencho Fries and we ended up sharing it because I liked it. It is simple but the green sauce and cheese taste great on them. You can't beat the cheap prices for the quality you get here. What are you waiting for? Get over here and try something... just save some pastrami for me!
