I have a MSG allergy and can usually tolerate it at restaurants. But wow, I can't have the food here, on both sides of the restaurant. I'll get a severe headache and have to crash for a few hours. It's that hard on my system. This being said it's my personal physical reaction.\n\nThe food taste alright but the service is horrible.... The servers just don't care. The washrooms are dirty and as for utensils and bowls I soak it in the cup of tea they give you. Of course I don't drink that cup of tea.
