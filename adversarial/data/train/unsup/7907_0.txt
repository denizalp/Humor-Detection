BEWARE of FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI fully understand that realtors take favorable pictures to entice foot traffic, but this agency takes the cake!!\n\nThey posted pictures of a BEATIFUL house, I was told that I was one of 7 that would be viewing it and that offers were already made.  When we came to the house we found it in complete disrepair.  Mold on the outside, water damage on the roof, water damage in every bathroom, yet the pictures showed the property as it was being renovated, which we found out was 7 years ago!!\n\nTo make maters worst, the current squatters, I mean renters were in the property and followed us room to room and would not let us view one room because someone was \"sleeping\" in there, yet there was an unmistakable smell of marijuana coming from the room.\n\nYou've been warned; do not do business with these slime balls!
