Went here for lunch and OMG! was it ever delicious!  The octopus appetizer is very good. I also had SEPPIE NERE 22.59\nRisotto with shrimp, scallops and fresh Mediterranean cuttlefish with natural black ink\nIt doesn't look very pretty, but this dish is wonderful and one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Highly recommend both of these items.  The wait staff was very kind and helpful.  We sat in the fake \"outside\" area which was quite lovely.  The only annoying part was there were opera type singers close by in the open Venetian mall area that were extremely loud... so loud that we needed earplugs I kid you not!  We were so happy when they stopped.\nAlso wanted to point out there is a happy hour that looked really good.  There is no mention of it on their website or anywhere... I would have gone to it if I had known since they have some food items half price I believe and drinks at a discount.  Will definitely go back to this restaurant every time I return to Vegas... just hope they fire the opera singers!   :)
