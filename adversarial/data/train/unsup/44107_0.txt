As soon as you walk in you are immediately greeted with the scent of Panda Express and Starbucks Coffee. That should be reason enough shop here. The store is kept very clean, and is organized well. \n\nThe flower section is always setup with lots of really nice arrangements. Plus its setup near the registers so if your in a hurry and need to grab a few things you can snag some flowers. They have cards for every occasion, they even have gift cards and holders which I thought was pretty cool. \n\nSales here are better then most other places. Most importantly the food is fresh and its rare that you find damaged produce here.
