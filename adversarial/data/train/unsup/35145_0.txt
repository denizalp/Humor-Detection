We had to have crepes while we were in Montreal, so on the last day we decided to stop off here. This place is goooood. I got the chicken salad, spinach, and cheese crepe. It was frikkin AMAZE! Like so good! my mouth was jumping with joy hahaha. It was filling and delicious and all the right things. I would for sure come back here again and again! WOuld like to try a dessert crepe one time. The odd thing though was that mine was folded up into a sqaure shape....never seen a crepe served that was before lol\n\nMy one complaint: There are 2 levels, but only the downstairs where you order has AC. When we got there the seat downstairs were full so we had to sit upstairs and it was HOT. Not cool- no pun
