This place is rundown. The smell when you walk in is overwhelming. Smells like really strong perfume I think to mask all the cigarette smoke. Not sure if it's really any better than the smoke itself. Serious gives me an instant headache. The carpet is squishy, stained and uneven. Not much good to say.
