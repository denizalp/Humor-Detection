What they said ... they sold out I'd most things and what was available was Amazing! We will come earlier next time!! I liked that they offered a few things complimentary. With the meats, and the service was nothing short of perfect. Friendly, genuine connections, happy people. Extremely attentive, sampling to the line, clearing the tables, following up with customers at their seat, explaining you could come back to get a pie directly to the register. I mean dream state service if you run a restaurant.
