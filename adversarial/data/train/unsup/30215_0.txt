Used to really enjoy the meat pies at the old Bramble house, the Beef and Kidney being my favorite,i'd usually blow $50 on related cans of this and jars of that,lately however theres been a location change and i suspect a managment change as i;m just not getting the same vibe in the new place,3 times i've been out to the new place and they never seem to have the steak and kidney pie, this time was the same so i bought a bunch of stuff including sausage rolls,pork pies and some other meat filled pastries, got home and cooked a few up only to discover they were not the same as the old product in the old location as these pastries were inedible resulting in me and my 2 daughters tossing our pastries in the garbage. At this point i'm not likely to return to this new incarnation of the Bramble house and will instead frequent the British store in Hudson.\n\nJim
