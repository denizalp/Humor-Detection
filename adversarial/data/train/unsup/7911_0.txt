We took in our 2006 BMW 325i to the dealership for an unrelated airbag sensor recall issue. As part of the service BMW generously provided us with a complimentary vehicle inspection. The only thing that they found wrong was that the rear brakes would soon require replacement. BMW gave us a rough estimate of somewhere in the $600 range (which as I recall included new rotors). Since we normally have the car serviced at EMC (European Motor Works), we gave them a call. EMC told us that if the problem was just the pads (and not the rotors too) the cost would be somewhere in the $300 range. Since the car has 67K miles on the original rotors I had to assume that the rotors (and sensors) most likely required replacement. I discovered PBS here on Yelp and decided to also give them a call. I spoke with Craig who was very friendly and professional. Craig didn't give me a \"range\", instead he provided me with an exact quote based on the specific repairs that I stated were likely necessary. \n\nWhen we arrived at the shop we met with \"Craig\" whom appeared to be both honest and sincere. They inspected the brakes and found that there was 75% of life left on the front brakes and 15% of life left on the rear brakes. they measured the thickness of the rear rotors and found that they were in need of replacement. When returned to pick up the car 2 hours later the job had been completed and the final price was exactly as quoted. We estimate that we saved in the $200 \"range\" from the dealership quote.  \n\nNo surprises, no excuses, no aggressive up-sales, no brake squealing, and best of all; no phone calls beginning with \"We have some bad news for you sir, it looks as though we also need to replace your....\", . Just good work for a reasonable price (albeit not an amazing price).  \n\nWe have 3 other cars and as far as we are concerned, this is the shop that we shall take our future brake business to.
