Fan-clucking-tastic!\nMy Husband and I in town for the \"TOUGHEST MUDDER\" and made reservations for an early dinner.\nWe wanted to go there b\/c of watching Hells Kitchen.\nThis was one of the best meals we have had all year!\nWe started off w\/ the roasted bone marrow and bacon jam and also split the chicken biscuits -omg! \nThen my husband had the fried chicken and cheddar cheese waffles w\/ bourbon maple syrup and spiced watermelon.\nI had the short rib on top of roasted corn.\nW\/green beans and mashed potatoes AMAZING!!\nWe ordered the peach cobbler in advance b\/c it's made to order and takes about 20 minutes. What a beautifully and thoughtfully prepared dish!\nWe left feeling almost uncomfortably full but it was totally worth every bite!\nThis is the kind of place that I would totally crave and frequent.\nCould care less about coming back to Vegas but when I get my Lear jet, I'll fly in just to eat at Yardbird!\nGood Job, Gordon Ramsey!!
