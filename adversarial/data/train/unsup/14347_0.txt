Like good spicy wings so decided to try this place. Ordered to go. They were over zealous in their attempt to educate me about their wings & really didn't give me a chance to talk. Anyway, got home with our order only to find they forgot our Fries that we paid for. I called to let them know they offered me some donuts next time I come in. No thanks, won't be back. \nGot the dry rub TWC wings & the Thai.\nThe TWC lacked flavor, where was the dry rub? The Thai were supposed to be spicy but they tasted like honey with no flavor in the chicken. \nPaid $20 plus a $4.tip for take out! They have you choose a tip % when you pay. I don't like that but I was the sucker who gave 20% and they still forgot my fries. Apologies are great but we were disappointed when we got home. \nSo $24.00 for some wings & I'm still starving! Lol! Gotta go eat!
