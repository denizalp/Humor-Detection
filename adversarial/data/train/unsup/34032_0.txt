You want what I consider the authentic experience, this is it. It's a limited menu and everyone sits along the bar looking at the open kitchen. Although they have Tonkotsu, here it's all about chicken based broths, including shouyu. There is one beer. It's on draft, and you are not expected to hang around and discuss world affairs with a friend when you are done. Come in, eat, enjoy it while you eat it, and leave. Someone else is likely behind you waiting for a seat. They make the noodles, and they are good. You can watch them take a blowtorch to the chashu to add additional flavor. And, it is great chachu.\nFinally, there's the onsen tomago. They may not have a hot springs in back to make it traditionally, but it's a very cool addition that nobody else in town has, that I know. Make sure you get one. It's a perfect poached egg of mostly magic liquid yolk with a little soft white around it. Oh yea.\nFor straight up Ramen, this is the top game in town, however, it's not a place I'd always want to go. Sometimes you want to relax, and visit with friends. Ramen Tatsu, or similar, fill that bill better, but nobody does straight up ramen better.
