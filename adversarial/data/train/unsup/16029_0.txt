I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for this kind of shit. Overpriced and way too cute for it's own good. \nI was in the area and decided to hop in around lunchtime to check this place out. I ended up perusing around for over an hour! Cute kitchen magnets, cute accessories, cute cards...it's all. too. cute. \nAND the sales girl was incredibly nice and helpful too...arghhh. I was beside myself.\nI ended up buying a bag that probably makes me look like I'm trying to be 17 again..but I couldn't resist. \nDamn you Frances, you vile temptress. Thank God I live on the other side of town.\n\nUpdate: Having moved, I now live about 5 minutes away from the place. And my paycheck is truly suffering. (shaking fists) Damn you Francis!!!
