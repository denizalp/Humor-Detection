The new and improved Aladdin hotel from back in the day. Yes this hotel use to be called the Aladdin! Of course it's upgraded from many moons ago. I'm trying to figure out why and where all these bad reviews are coming from. I have experienced this hotel on both the Hotel and Casino side and have always had great experiences. The rooms are pretty nice and yes even though I am a dedicated MLife member I do remember the days I stayed here. The staff at the front desk are professional and courteous, I do remember being upgraded to some of their best suites upon check in. On the casino side I really like to play here because the vibe is pretty cool and hip. I feel that they do actually cater a lot more to the younger generation and that's fine. I mean we do want a place to feel at home as well. Not to say of course if you don't fit into  this category you won't have a good time it's just you better be ready to hang out with the youngins I also love the casino floor's vibe during the weekend nights. It feels like you are gambling in the middle of a nightclub or something. Great Music in rotation and drinks just flowing. This is my type of place for SURE! Make sure you checkout the pussycat lounge where the dealers are dressed in the rather risqu√© kind of outfits and you have go go dancers performing up top!
