The service is friendly and attentive. The food not bad. I grew up in a family that is a mix of Vietnamese and Chinese. I know that my palate could be a little skewed because my parents tend to mix some of the flavors of both. \n\nI like their Gi Cun Nem Nng. The crispy tofu skins in it gives it another texture that puts just lettuce to shame. I am a huge fan of Bún bò Hu. I can't say that I will order it just anywhere. I like it because it has so many different components that makes for a rich and complex soup. Pho Lan's chili oil on the side really made the dish for me. I like a little more kick to my broth. The adding of all the fresh herbs and lime helped as well. I did like that they have the pig knuckles and blood cake in it. \n\nThe menu is simple and I would want to try other items.
