My little guy and I really enjoy coming to this Indigo.  There is a fun space downstairs for kids to get together and play.  Although the play area is typical to all Indigos, the staff at this location are incredibly friendly.  One time, I even ran into the owner of that particular Indigo.  It was one of my first times in the store and she took the time to help me and talk to my little guy.  I had no idea who she was until one of the staff told me!  \n\nAll the staff at this location are incredibly friendly and will smile at my little guy even if he is running around shrieking ... from happiness and excitement.  \n\nI often walk out of the store with a book or two for my guy since there is a great table of discounted baby books - books that are often 5.99 but regularly 12.99 or more.\n\nThe place is often bustling with a positive vibe.\n\nI love this place :)
