First time here and although the ambiance was very good the service and food was mediocre. We waited at least 15 minutes before a bartender would take our order.  It seems that the people who were seated had priority. Each bartender was working the whole bar instead of an area of the very long bar. \nThe food was ok but the vegetarian meatballs were not fully cooked and the mushroom gravy was pasty and thick. Not what was expected. Pork meatballs were good. Service was better downstairs.
