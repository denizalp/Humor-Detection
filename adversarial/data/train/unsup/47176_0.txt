Sienna Mercato is a great addition to the Downtown restaurant scene.  Although the menu is somewhat limited, the food is reasonably priced and the service is quick and friendly.  I chose the Spicy Pork Meataballs and the Escarole & Beans, and both were delicious.  The location is perfect for before or after a show downtown, which is a real plus.  The front opens up when the weather is nice, which is a wonderful feature.  The food is not at the same level as their sister restaurant, Sienna Sulla Piazza, but the prices are more reasonably priced and there's a lot less waiting time.  They don't take reservations, however they have lots of tables, so I can't imagine a long wait.
