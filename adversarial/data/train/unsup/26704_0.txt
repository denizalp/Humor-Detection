A rustic pizza shop owned by two people who are passionate about their pies. The owners are not only super friendly but like to discuss the recipes and ingredients used in their pies.\n\nWe are addicted to the pulled pork pizza which  is topped with amazing coleslaw when it comes out of the oven.\n\nOur more simple go-to pizza is the margherita. If you want a small dinner for two one pizza will suffice. But if you want to walk away nice and full, two pizzas will do the trick.\n\nIf you go once, you will return many times for what can only be described as a zen pizza experience.
