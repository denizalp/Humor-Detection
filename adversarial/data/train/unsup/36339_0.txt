Unique Landscape and Design just finished our backyard landscaping project and we couldn't be happier. From the initial consultation with Melissa to the final walk through the whole project went smoothly and totally exceeded our expectations. She gave us a detailed estimate that was both easy to  read and understand, with no surprises. \nAlong the way we changed our design and Melissa was always accommodating giving us helpful ideas and tips. \nThe crew (despite the heat) did an excellent job, their attention to detail was admirable, and they always took the time to answer any questions I would have throughout the project.   \nKevin and Jeremy oversee the whole operation coordinating materials, crews and kept us informed at all times. \nWe are thrilled with the results, and look forward to working with Unique landscape on our future yard enhancements. \nIt's tough to select a company to work with, but I can assure you that Unique Landscape and design will take care of all your landscaping needs big or small. They were a complete pleasure to work with and are highly recommended by us. Thank you Kevin, Melissa, and your whole crew. \nYou rock!
