First off, the salon is beautiful inside! I had an appointment with Christina to get balayage done to my hair. She is so friendly! She was very thorough but also moved quickly. I just wanted to add a little blonde to brighten my hair. The finished product looks so natural. My hair turned out amazing and she will be my go-to from now on! Thanks Christina!!!
