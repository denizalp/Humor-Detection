Our family LOVES Egg Works.  This is the only place to get the best eggs benedict breakfast.  Their portion sizes are HUGE and the food tastes amazing.  We just went on Christmas Day (Observed) and Raul was our server.  He was tentative, friendly, and made my girls laugh (which is super tough to do in the mornings :) ).  Thanks Raul and Egg Works.
