I had gone years without trusting anyone ot cut my hair, and then I went to see Holly at Grooming Humans and had the best experience all the way around!!! Holly has the natural ability to cut hair, hands down the best haircut that I have gotten in my life. Holly has a great personality and was not overly aggresive as far as taking too much hair off. She created a dialogue with me as far as what I was looking for and what would work for me. I really like her process.This girl has ALOT of nautral talent. I can't recommend Holly enough, she's the best hairstylist I have had in years. Can't wait to go back.
