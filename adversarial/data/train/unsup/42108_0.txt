I love the owner(s)! First time coming here. Service was great, fast, reasonably priced, and extremely friendly! Really, these were the kindest people. The man who attended me was very kind and remembered me immediately when I walked in a few days later. He said it was because I smiled :).They did a great job, I had gave them 12 pieces of clothing. Will come back again whenever I need something dry cleaned!
