I have had two amazing experiences with Mark, Nicole and Blake. The first job was a bamboo hedge at the back of my property with a paver stone border. The hedge looks super and most importantly, is thriving a year in. The second job was completed only a week ago and involved major landscaping to my backyard. Mark came several times to the property and never once grimaced when I wanted changes to the design. And he had his crew come early to demo several previously existing sago palms that I learned were poisonous to my new pup. That's just the kinda family that the Emersons are. They care about their customers and work hard to make sure that you'll be happy after the job is done. I recommend Pacific Landscape for your job with no reservations whatsoever.
