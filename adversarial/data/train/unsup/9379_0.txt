If you're thinking about coming here because you like the show, just don't. It's really not worth it. Nor does it look anything like the show. \n\nI've been here twice. Most recently I was there because I had friends in town that were interested in going there. They were in the market for some art work. To be honest, I thought the service was pretty horrible. My friends wanted more info regarding a piece of art and it was like pulling teeth to get someone who worked there to assist us. Finally a girl came over. Her overall vibe was meh. She wasn't enthused about assisting us nor did she seem happy. Kind of a bummer. Half the fun of purchasing an expensive piece of art is the actual experience of picking it out. The staff added nothing to this at all. She actually made us feel like we are an inconvenience to her. I just think that kind of sucks. \n\nDon't wast your time on this place.
