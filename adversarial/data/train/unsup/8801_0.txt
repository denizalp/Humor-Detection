About a 2-2.5: Le Falco is a cafe that's in a large warehouse, offering fair-trade coffee, sandwiches, salads, onigiris, and Japanese rice bowls.  There's communal tables and even a hammock swing!  The hubs and I came here to check them out for a mid-day snack, and I tried the 3-onigiri combo special: you get to choose 3 onigiris of your choosing and a cup of soup (miso or their soup of the day) - I tried the pork, the salmon, and the breakfast 'egg' version.  The pork was okay, as it was sweeter bits of pork inside a rice ball; the salmon was a bit forgettable, as it was dried out and there wasn't much seasoning or flavoring to it; the breakfast 'egg' version was my favorite, as it was more heavy on the sesame oil and filled with some scrambled egg.  The miso soup was not appetizing at all, as it was a watered down weird concoction - there was hardly any miso taste to it, and it had some off chemical taste to it.  Complimentary water is up by the serving area, and once you're done, there's a section where you drop off your dirty wares.  Just a note, there's a minimum to use the CC.\n\n+breakfast 'egg' onigiri\n+avoid the miso! T___T\n+hammock swing on-site!
