Nice decor, good food.  \n\nKobe beef tacos $15 - they were good in flavour but a little dry \nPerogies - amazing! So much depth of flavour... If you love mushrooms and onion this is the dish for you! Pricey for $18 \nDuck fat fries - probably our favourite dish! Huge portion for $6 served in their signature cone napkin... Really flavourful, perfectly salted and crisp (I'm sure they're at least double fried). \n\nIt's not a raving review but it's certainly worth a visit. Best part is their beer selection... Organized in a way that's easy to read and navigate through the types of beer you like.
