As my dining companion said, \"never trust a place that charges for chips and salsa!\" Like most other folks who've reviewed this joint, we wound up here because of a Coyotes game. It should have been warning enough that there wasn't a wait to eat here but there was at every other establishment at Westgate. They were serving their much-maligned Event Menu which is truly food court food at resort prices. $5 for chips and salsa? Ridiculous! Between the three of us, there was a taco salad (which I was informed is less tasty than a taco salad served at particular hospital cafeteria in town), a sad veggie burrito and my sad steak burrito, replete with dry steak and missing guac and sour cream until I pointed out to the server.  It took a very long time to get our food, even though the restaurant appeared pretty dead. The server was friendly enough but not very skilled. For three entrees and NO beverages, our tab was nearly $50 before tip. Outrageous prices for subpar food. I agree with other reviewers: Taco Bell food at triple or quadruple the price. No thank you.
