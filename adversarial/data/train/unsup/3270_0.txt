I don't know why I keep trying to shop here. I guess it is because of the awesome flyers that come in the mail showing all of the wonderful goodies that they offer. If only their staff was just as awesome as their marketing team. \n\nOf course they have nearly everything you would need as far as makeup, perfume and hair. That is not the problem. I love that part. I was completely ignored the last time that I tried shopping here. I was busy browsing, and would hear someone ask another customer if they needed help, but when I looked up they were nowhere near to me. This happened few more times, and I gave up. This is the second time that this has happened, so maybe I am invisible here. I shopped somewhere else instead. \n\nI will not come back to the store, but I may shop online at Ulta. I still like their products.
