I know the rating is low and part of it is undeserved. The people at Salon Sandoval are warm and welcoming and I have been happy with their services. They are an Aveda salon which is how I got their name. My stylist, Ruby, left there and then there seemed to be a ton of turnover. So, the reason for the rating? It's filthy. They honestly need to close for a week and have a deep cleaning, scrubbing, work it over. They also did a good job with my kids.
