I've had the cupcakes here, and I could take them or leave them.  On a tip from a friend, I got the salty caramel ice cream. Heaven.  I will never go back to ordering cupcakes here.  \n\nThe atmosphere is the definition of twee, which I actually don't mind, but some people are put off by it.  I've also never been served promptly here, which seems a bit crazy since they aren't making anything that complicated.  Put the cupcake on a plate, scoop the ice cream into a bowl.\n\n5 stars for the salty caramel ice cream, 2-3 stars for everything else.
