I had a cleaning service that did an ok job but then never showed up one day.  I spoke to a friend of mine who recommended Kimberly's Kleaning Services.  I spoke with Kimberly herself and she came out the next day to clean my home.  Not only did she come to clean my home but her company always does one special project to make your home sparkle.  When I walked into my home I have never seen it so clean...then I looked at my couch and they actually vacummed the couch where it then looked brand new.  It was an unbelievable experience to come home from a long day and have my house feel like a model home....and best of all they come back every 3 weeks with a new project to make our home sparkle!  kirsten
