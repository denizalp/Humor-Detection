I miss working downtown and being able to get their fresh coffee and muffins each morning. Then indulging myself in their pastas. It's like fast food but with natural ingredients. \n\nI've never been sure why Marche rebranded itself to Richtree, and I'll never understand it - I will always still refer to it as Marche, especially if it maintains the green and white stripped colour scheme, and decor as if you were in a market. \n\nHere's a condensed version of what you would find at their flagship on Front street. All these 'Richtree' (i.e. Marche Express) establishments still contain the same variety (which is not a lot) that the larger Marche also has (which is why I don't really understand the flag ship store). \n\nYou have Pastas (2 types daily + 1 oven baked), Salads, Rotessirie Chicken (4 different flavours!), Bakery+Coffee, among others. One thing is for sure, they make all the food from scratch each morning - there's no processed food here. \n\nPrices are cheap enough to justify not bringing your lunch every day. \n\nToday I got a Half Chicken (two 1\/4s) with rice and veggies (ask them to pour gravy on from the other chicken flavours) $9.50 (a quarter chicken meal like this is $7). \nI've always been a big fan of Marche Chicken - the skin is crispy and salty the way it should be. \n\nPayment after you gathered your food is easy, except seems crowded and hard to maneuver. \n\nSnag a seat, and there's also free water for you as well.
