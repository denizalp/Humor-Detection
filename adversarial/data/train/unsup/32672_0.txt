This place is fantastic!  Went here for lunch with the fam on a friend's recommendation and did not leave disappointed!  The beef ia everything you want in a Chicago style beef!  Super fresh and moist, not dry at all! The fries were amazing as well! You can really taste the freshness of them and my 4 year old just gobbled them up! We will definitely be back!
