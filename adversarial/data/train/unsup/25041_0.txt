I went here over the weekend after hearing great reviews. I had previously tried going about a month ago on an Indians playoff game night and it was over an hour wait for a table so I'm glad I could try it on a less crowded night. I am glad to say this is one of my new favorite restaurants in Strongsville.\n\n I have been to the restaurant that was in this space previously and this one is much better. They gutted the place and completely redid it. I love the decor- very hip and trendy. There are a ton of tables (all different style of tables too) and a huge bar. They also have these really cute lights made out of Jameson bottles (trendy). \n\nThe menu was impressive as well. The biggest selections were appetizers and sandwiches. They also had some flatbreads, salads and main dishes. Drink and beer selections were very impressive. HUGE draft list (probably 20 or so on tap) and an even bigger bottle list. \n\nI ordered the tomato soup and the grilled chicken salad. The soup was just alright, didn't come out hot just kinda warm and it tasted very tomato saucy. The salad was great, just the right size. The other people in my group ordered the O'Malley flatbread and a cheeseburger with tater tots. Everyone loved their meals. \n\nI have heard that Wednesday nights are ladies nights with $3 beer, wine and martinis. I need to check that out soon. This is a great spot and I will definently be back!
