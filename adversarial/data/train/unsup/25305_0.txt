I love this place!!! From the appetizers to the main dishes everything is amazing. I can add this to my list of favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas as they are good on price and quality. Not to mention, the service is incredible. So friendly, kind and the restaurant gives you an at home feeling. Did I mention it is extremely clean!!! Thanks guys, I'll see you next week.
