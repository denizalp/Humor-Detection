I had my 3 three wisdom teeth removed yesterday. Before the procedure, I felt that the doctors could've done a better job at explaining how the surgery would work and especially post-surgery instructions. I had to ask most of the questions knowing that I would be incapable after the procedure. On my way home, I had many questions on how to take care of my wounds. I had no clue how to put the gauze in, if I could eat with them in or if I had to take them out, if I have to wait for the bleeding to stop before I ate, when could I eat, etc. But luckily my family had the procedure done before so they were the primary ones that helped me out. The doctors prescribed me 4 medications, not even explaining to me what they were for or if I had to take all of them. I ended up figuring that out and only took 1 medication which was the antibiotics. I also wasn't told if I would have stiches or some other form of closure for my incision, so it worried me when I switched out my gauzes that I had a gaping hole in my gum that wasn't closed. The procedure itself was effortless and done very well, coming from a post-procedure point of view. I had no pain in the three areas whatsoever, even one area where my wisdom tooth was very close to my maxillary nerve and pretty snug in my bone. I didn't even touch my pain killers. The office space and lobby are very nice, a plus is the view from the room I had, perks of having an office space on the 5th floor. Dr. Daccache's work is excellent, I WOULD definitely recommend him. But my overall feeling I experienced at the office was only average, not great. I do wish himself and his assistants would be more detailed on their explanations for pre\/post operation. Only gave 4 stars due to the excellent ops work.
