Straight Outta France\nLa Maison de Maggie is owned and operated by Chef Maggie Reb, who's cooking up authentic French cuisine at her restaurant on Durango.  Offering up crepes and galettes, I've visited twice in an attempt to widen my French food horizons.  Upon entering the caf√© on my most recent visit, the sweet smell of strawberry basil jam being cooked on the stove greeted my gal pal and I.  Chef Maggie was making a new batch to sell and I'm sure it went quickly.  I had my first galette, the July special, with mozzarella, tomato, goat cheese, and honey.  You can sit at the counter and watch your food being made in front of you.  Using authentic buckwheat and wheat flour imported from France for her crepes and galettes, Chef whipped up our orders in no time.   My galette was delicious, especially with the pairing of the cheese with the honey.  Chef Maggie also let us sample the freshly made strawberry basil jam: ooh la la!  This is food made with love from a real French chef.  Stop by to try something new for your palate:  bon appetit!
