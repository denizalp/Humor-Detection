I've been here when it was just a quarter of the size it is now. Russell was always so great with his customers! They even incorporated a Chinese addition to their menu. The menu is Korean Hawaiian fusion.The restaurant is much larger now but the food seems the same which is the most important. I love their meat jun, it's a meat cake fried in egg batter and it's paired with macaroni salad, rice, and of course your traditional korean appetizers. It's a joint perfect for asian cravings.
