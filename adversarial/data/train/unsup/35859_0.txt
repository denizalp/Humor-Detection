Been here a few times and wasn't so pleased with the service. The Five stars are not for the store but for the cashier that was at register 8 today around 3:15 pm. His name was Nicholas. What a great asset to this store. He should train a lot of the other employees on how to treat customers. He went beyond his job and carried a conversation that he started just by paying attention the the items I was purchasing. Definitely Manager material. Thank you Nicholas!
