I have been going to Kennel Care for over 20+ years and its been amazing. Dr. Hudman and the whole staff always goes above and beyond from the time you walk in to the time you leave. Everyone is friendly and professional also they are always willing to help in anyway.  The boarding area and kennels are always clean. The staff in grooming are friendly and professional and do a fantastic job in grooming my dogs. I totally trust the staff at Kennel Care in taking care of my dogs.  Thanks Kennel Care.
