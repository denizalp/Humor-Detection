Douce France....a lovely atmosphere.  I really enjoyed the leek\/eggplant tart although I found the almond croissant a little flat.   Was charged 11.91 for sitting at a 'reserved' table in a cafe.  I've never heard of this before.  Maybe they do this in Paris?..not sure.  The all butter madelaines were yummy.
