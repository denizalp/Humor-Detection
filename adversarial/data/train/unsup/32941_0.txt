this place was great right after it opened, but lately its been really disappointing. The last 3 times that I've ordered food from this location its been under season to the point that there's no flavor. I go to the location on 44th st and Thomas every so often on my lunch break and they're amazing. I  love their Pumpkin curry and figured that it would be the same at the on the fly location. Boy was I wrong. not only did it not have any flavor, but it was extremely water downed. \n\ntoday I just went and picked up some spicy noodles - medium spicy - and there is no sauce or spice on it at all. I've had this dish before from this location so I know what to expect when its made right. \n\nunfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming back to this location anymore.
