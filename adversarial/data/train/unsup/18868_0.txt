I love blaze pizza and all the unlimited choices of toppings that you can put on your pizza. If you can't choose what base sauce you want, you can ask to do half and half. Their kale, quinoa & cranberry salad is delicious as well. But if I'm coming to Blaze Pizza, I'm getting a damn pizza. Make sure to try out their lemonades\/frescas! They're all delicious. The lemonades can be too sweet for me, so I normally just water it down.\n\nTip: Since it is thin-crusted... your crust can only hold so much, so make sure you don't load your pizza with wayyyy too many toppings! Unless you like having your toppings fall off every time you take a bite, hah.
