The ambiance is nice, spacious and comfortable. We have a 1 year old and they're very accommodating for kids. I see a lot of other parents bringing kids. The music is a good volume.\n\nThe food I find is a bit hit or miss. Some of the dishes are really good and some...well not that good at all. We particularly enjoy the seafood pasta, spinach dip is good and the fist tacos. Had the squash ravioli once and it was nice but the portion quite small and it was a lot spicer than expected. Their burgers and fries are really nice. Do not get the ginger beef, the entire dish has a weird taste and way too much sweet brown sauce.\n\nService is fine, the servers are pretty attentive to your needs. Price is on par with other similar chains. I do like Milestones more than Moxie's, Jack Astor's, and Joey's.
