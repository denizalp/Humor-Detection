Terrible!  I took my car into their repair department. They gave me a $4K estimate.\nI  DID NOT have them do the work. They were quite rude about that... Then, I took my car to my son's very trusted mechanic, and together, we put the car on the rack. Only one out of the three things was actually wrong with the car. My price went all the way down to $1100.\nThey are a RIP OFF!!!!!! Don't get your car fixed there!
