Booked rooms at Flamingo because it was only $39\/night for 2 nights during the week. That price can't be beat, especially with its centralized location on the strip. That's probably the one best thing about this hotel. We were upgraded, upon arrival and had a decent view of Bally's and the Bellagio Hotel\/watershow. The rooms are fairly new and recently remodeled, so the carpet looked clean, the bathroom was modern and the beds were OK comfy. The air conditioning in our first room was broken, so we had to switch rooms. Our new room had a nice view of the pool area and The Linq carousel, not too shabby and the aircon actually worked. One thing that was annoying was the super weak shower. The water pressure was low in both rooms and this was a huge thumbs down for me. I also noticed that the air ducts were super dirty and very dusty. Yuck! To bad I just noticed this on our last day, but it was nasty. \n\nThe hotel didn't have many ammentities like restaurants and bars. The self parking fee is $10\/day and the valet parking fee is $18\/day. Besides the room fees there is a resort fee of $34.95 per day. I don't understand what this covers because we don't get WiFi and we paid for the parking. Still confused about what it covers. \n\nCheck out was quick and easy. Since our flight didn't leave until early afternoon, we kept our baggage in the holding area for free. \n\nI wouldn't stay here in the future, even if the room fee is cheap. You get what you pay for.
