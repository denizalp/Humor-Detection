Yep, only two stars from me for this place. My friends and I were so excited to try this place after talking about it for weeks. \n\nBeing on Open Table-5 stars\nBuilding\/restaurant itself-5 stars\nHostess-5 stars\nService-5 stars\nFood-1 star\n\nSure, that should probably bring it up to a better star average, but it's really about the food every time right?  Party of 4, we liked 1 out of the 5 dishes we ordered and shared. \n\nStarted off with the potted crab and the roasted cauliflower. The potted crab is basically a crab dip served with grilled bread. The bread is from an outside source which is a thick sliced white\/sourdough type. The potted crab was a pot of crap! Hardly any crab flavor let alone any flavor at all. Not even any spices. \n\nThe roasted cauliflower was even worse. What really disappointed me in the cauliflower was that our server recommended it over another side that I wanted to try. She even said \"oh the cauliflower is the way to go because of how flavorful it is\". Did she mean it was the least flavorful? I hate to say that too because our server was really good. \n\nMoving on to the main events. Two of us had the NY steak, another had the chicken sandwich and I had the Cuban sandwich. \n\nThe steaks were served sliced. I actually love this concept and it reminds me of a famous place in New York (I have a personal rule against naming another restaurant when writing reviews no matter how poor). I was so excited for the first bite and again was let down. Zero flavor, not even any salt and what was worse was all the fat and gristle, like hard gristle. Gross! It was like this on both steaks! \n\nAs for my Cuban sandwich, it was decent. I think the bread they used is the wrong choice as it's just over powering and takes away from the important stuff between those two slices! \n\nThe winner was the chicken sandwich. Fried chicken breast with sweet and spicy toppings. The bread for this one is a bun which nicely complimented the important stuff! \n\nAs I said, we liked 1 out of 5 dishes. That's pretty disappointing. I think simply adding some salt to a few of those dishes would have helped. Speaking of which, what is with these trendy places not having salt and pepper on the tables? Your food is not that good, get over yourself! \n\nSorry Stock & Stable!  Look at your reviews, people like your place but hate your flavorless food!
