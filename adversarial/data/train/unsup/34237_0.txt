Came on a Thursday night and beat a small rush.\nI ordered the spaghetti baked pie and a peporoni pizza.\nThe spaghetti pie was pretty good but lacking sauce, it barly came with any and the sauce was good.\nMy son got the pizza and im glad i gave it a try, it was the best peperoni pizza ive ever had.
