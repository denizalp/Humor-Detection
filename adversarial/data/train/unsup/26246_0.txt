You know you are getting old when you see the type of clothes you used to wear in High School and College are now featured in the vintage section.  Need neon windbreakers, buffalo plaid shirts, and mom jeans-you're in luck as they have them.  Ragstock is a great place to get inspired for a halloween outfit or to waste an hour perusing through their eclectic collection.
