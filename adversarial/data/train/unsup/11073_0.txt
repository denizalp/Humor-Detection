This place is like a hipster mousetrap.  Quirky decor. Check.  Waitstaff in flannel. Check. Complicated cocktails with ginger beer. Check.\n\nThey cannot resist!\n\nBut, I digress, this is a great al fresco spot.  I don't care if the eccentricity is contrived, it's cool!  I like eating outdoors next to a painting of two horses humping!  I like see-saws and mismatched chairs!  I agree that all employees should chant \"Bloody Mary\" three times before returning to work! So, sue me!\n\nExclamation points aside, I also enjoy the food although it's more of the \"bar bites\" variety.  I'd also recommend the \"Pillowtalk\" cocktail.  I don't remember what's in it, however, because I always drink too many.  Apple vodka, cucumbers and Sprite, or something. Yeah...
