excellent atmosphere.\n\nlove the comfy couches and chairs.\nduring the summer, outdoor seating is available.\nmany outlets for laptop charging.\nfree wi-fi.\n\naverage coffee.  not the best coffee connoisseur actually, but the mochas are good -- and the mocha shake when they have it.  \n\nthe cheddar grilled cheese is to die for.  and the potato salad that comes on the side is delicious too; there are pieces of bacon in it!\n\nextensive collection of wines.\nlove coming here and sharing a bottle of wine with a friend for conversation and catching up.\n\nsometimes it can get crowded and it's hard to find a seat.. but overall, a 5 star experience.
