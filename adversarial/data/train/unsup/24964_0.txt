I ordered takeout from this restaurant today: Orange Chicken and Crab puffs..The food was good....Portions huge.....The pieces of chicken were cooked nicely. They could have been a little crispier. The orange sauce was good and plentiful.\n\nThe crab puffs were cooked perfect, and the filling was great..\n\nMy only not so great comment is that the inside of the restaurant smelled like old moldy feet...I don't think I would like to dine in.
