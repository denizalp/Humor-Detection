We went in looking for a Table ..woman walks by us and I ask do you work here? Oh yes Starts to tell us about the table Then another woman walks up (Gloria) and then she starts to help us.. I didnt know if she was having a Bad day Or just didnt want to help,, I said, do you have any Round Dining tables and She said I don't know we have to look around .. I said You don't know your Stock?? So looked around and then went and bought it down the Street and it was 400.00 Cheaper !!
