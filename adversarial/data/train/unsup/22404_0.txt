I'm unsure why it is called Camping World when all they really have is mobile homes, camper trailers and equipment designed for such. Their website advertised that they had pop-up tent trailers and camping equipment. They did not really have either. But if you need a satellite receiver and a memory foam king size bed topper for your 'camping' experience, they have that sort of thing. \n\nThe sales associates ignored me completely, and chose instead to speak exclusively to the man I had with me, even when I tried to talk to their floor staff about their selection while they took him out to see their 1 pop up tent trailer. (Which was so far away from their store that they had to drive him to it.)  I stayed behind to look for camping gear, and came up disappointed and un-helped there, so we went to nearby Gander Mt. for that afterwards.\n\nEventually when the men folk returned from a disappointing viewing of their 1 relevant item, he decided to leave his information with the sales rep in case they had something suiting our needs come along. They asked him for a copy of his drivers license, which he said he would do but on the condition that he be allowed to see them make 1 copy only and block out his license number.  So, they took him to an office room to do this.  Once they brought him in, a different sales guy was sitting at the desk and turned to him and said \"Sir, can I ask you to please leave.\"  Of course the answer was no, not until I have my license back. He was quite rude about wanting him to leave him alone in the office with his sensitive documents. Eventually he backed down until the license was copied and returned. \n\nOverall unpleasant experience, yielding no results, and making us feel uncomfortable with the idea of making a large purchase with them.  Maybe they would have treated us with more respect if we had been looking to buy a $40,000 mobile home instead of a basic, more rustic pop up trailer in the range of 'only a few thousand dollars.'
