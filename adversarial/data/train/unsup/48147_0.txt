I really, really, really wanted to like this place and hope they can work the kinks out and stay in business. However, it's a long shot if they keep their current manager. \n\nI've been here twice, once with my hubby on date night; looking for a romantic place to enjoy a glass of wine and some much needed convo. Manager sauntered over, had a seat in our cosy corner and proceeded to complain to us about his employees and how much more work that put on him! Well, you're the manger yo!\n\nNext visit, I brought my family. We did not know ahead of time, but they were having a free wine tasting hosted by this same manager.  He wrongly assumed that we were wine newbies and arrogantly shared his vision to bring wine education to our community through his hand selected wine list... Which of course, wasn't the same wine list he would choose for himself. When not serving wine behind his wine barrel tasting station, he sat playing on his phone. Yikes!\n\nI wish I could say the food made up for the poor experience, however the bruschetta (low cost, high profit item) we all shared, was flavorless. Hummus was the highlight. \n\nOverall look and feel of the place is clubby and warm. Unfortunately, cheap table chairs, while nice looking, are uncomfortable. \n\nEven though this place is needed and welcome in my neighborhood... They need to bump it up!
