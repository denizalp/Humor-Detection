I admit it - I had to \"fake bake\" in hopes of getting rid of some major strap marks... and now I'm red as a lobster!\n\nWell - the above is true except for the part about being red as a lobster... thank goodness, right?  It just sounded more interesting to lead into my review that way!\n\nI don't believe in tanning salons - especially because living in Arizona, we have all of the natural UV rays one could ask for... but believe it or not, it's rare that I take the time to lay out.  Nonetheless, I'm in a wedding this weekend and I'm wearing a strapless dress, so something had to be done.\n\nI remembered seeing Camelback Tanning over at 38th Street and Indian School by Thai Lahna, so I popped in there.  Sandy was working the front desk and was sweet as can be... not the typical person I imagined would work at a tanning salon - she was more a motherly type and made me feel comfortable right away.  She took the time to assess what bed would be best for my visit, whipped me up a special bronzer, and walked me into the room to show me exactly what to do.\n\nFifteen minutes was all it took... and for $7, I think it did the trick!  I can't say that I'll be back soon but it's good to know that if I need a little (un)natural color, Camelback Tanning delivers!
