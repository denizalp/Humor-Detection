New upcoming name in casual southern cuisine. Currently only;y in Miami and Las Vegas, new locations for Beverly Hills and Singapore are in the works. \"Talk\" of NYC and Chicago as well.\nLocated in the Fabulous Venetian Hotel & Casino (one of my favs!).\nA huge, HUGE selection of beers (100?) and whiskeys.\nGreat, friendly, educated staff will cover all your questions with recommendations. Nice open casual floor plan.\nTHE FOOD,\nSo many items we wanted to try, but portions are big so we had to tread lightly to avoid dozing off in a Foodie coma for the show we were catching afterwards.\nAPPS--We split..we LOVED :\n-Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad\nchar-grilled mango, smoked pecans, tomatoes, red onion, benne seed vinaigrette.\n-Classic Buttermilk Biscuits (4 of them)---best I ever had..even better than in SC and GA!...............served with honey butter, house-made jam\nENTREE-\nWe both had one of their signature dishes......\n-- Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles-\nwith honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup.....at $36\\plate..it's not cheap for fried chicken..but is was some of the best I've ever had and a whole 1\\2 chicken to boot..the contrast in flavors made them all a perfect match...gotta get all 3 in one BIG BITE!\nwaiter also suggested:\n-Short Rib-with\ncabernet braised, charred corn, green beans, sweet garlic bordelaise, cauliflower mashed potatoes\n--Skillet Cornbread-with\nVermont sharp cheddar cheese, bacon,jalape√±o, honey maple butter.\n\nskipped dessert although they sounded amazing.\n\nAnxiously hoping they come up to NYC Metro soon!!
