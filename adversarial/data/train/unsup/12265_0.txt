Once in a while, I like to venture off and try a different cuisine. This mom and pop place is tucked in a small plaza on Jones and Dessert Inn, in the same plaza as Escape and Jojo's jerky. My visit left me stuffed, yet unsatisfied.\n\nSetup is similar to Panda Express, but with array of traditional Filipino dish from lumpia to chicken adobo. I am not too familiar with Filipino cuisine so I just pointed at whatever looked good. Everything looked good on the display that I was probably drooling as I was browsing through the display...mmh, yes I will take that one. And that one. Oh, and that one too. \n\nDined in and they put all the food on a plastic plate. I'm assuming it's for their convenience so they don't have to deal with dirty plates but would be nice to have a more decent plate. Of course they only have plastic utensils. Felt like I was at some sort of family gathering. Ha. \n\nSome dishes we got were luke warm, and some were cold. I guess this is what happens when you have a display without a heat lamp. Everything was way too salty for me. Perhaps I'm not used to Filipino cuisine? Though the noodles they had were pretty tasty, everything else we got were just ok. \n\nLeft here stuffed but visit was easily forgettable.
