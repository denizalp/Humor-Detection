This is a really nice place. The interior looks great and  the Portofino is on the edge to be a top restaurant. Nevertheless, it's not there (yet). First of all, the ladies allocating your table at the entrance who are supposed to give you the first impression of the restaurant failed at their job. They where not only unfriendly and snotty but also seemed to be bored or not happy with what they are doing. The waiter seemed very willing, was friendly and helped with our choice. However, after the food was served, no more wine was poured in our glasses and we had to help ourselves. At a restaurant at this price category, you should be able to expect a seamless service, this was not the case. Also, we were placed at a lonely corner of the restaurant where the a\/c was way too cold so we had to freeze during the dinner. Besides these critics, the food was really great. Especially the signature dishes of the restaurant are recommendable.
