Earlier in the week one of my customers from Wickenburg mentioned he had just come from lunch here and when he lived in town it was a regular stop for him.  So I Yelped it while he was here and found not a single bad review.\n\nAfter a disappointing time at the MVD I needed to treat myself to something good.\n\nAmbiance - OK so this is not a place to impress a date.  It's a bit, OK a big bit, dated.  But it is really clean.  A total of 11 tables and 3 of those could be moved and joined for a party of 10-12.  Most of the customers were regulars for a Friday lunch and 5 tables were in use.  The waitress (owner?) doesn't smile much but she is pleasant.\n\nService - After being asked my party size I was told to pick a table.  As soon as she had finished serving another table she brought over my service and a menu.  She gave me a couple of minutes and then came and took my order.  When my iced tea was running low she appeared at my table with a pitcher.  There is a quiet relaxed feeling to the whole place and if you go with that vibe you will find the service to be quite good and actually faster than it feels when checked with a watch afterward.\n\nFood - This is the fourth star!  I had Chicken Apollo, chicken breast with sauteed spinach, feta cheese on fresh baked bread.  The bread as listed is pita but it is something different and better.  It came with a \"small\" Greek salad that took up a good portion of the dinner plate with basic iceberg, large chunks of tomato and cucumber and a couple of Greek olives topped with feta cheese and an oil\/vinegar dressing. With iced tea and tax the bill was $8.93.\n\nDefinitely a place to put on the list for more visits to try other menu items.
