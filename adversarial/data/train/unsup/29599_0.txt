This is a great restaurant! The service is fantastic, the drinks are really well done, the atmosphere is really fun, and overall it's a good experience! I would definitely go back!\n\nI will say, the menu is confusing. It's given to you on a clipboard, and if you don't notice that there are several pages, you may only see the specials. Several people in my party did this. Also, there are so many options that it's overwhelming.  \n\nWith that being said, the sushi was really fresh and well executed. I also had a great fish dish. Seafood seems to be their specialty, so I wouldn't veer to far from it, but everyone enjoyed their meals!
