Food was great, service was subpar.  I had heard several times before actually heading to Streat Burger that the service was pretty horrible, but we figured after the USA World Cup game we would check it out.\n\nLittle did i realize, it would take up the rest of our evening.  We basically had to beg to have them open the patio for us on an almost perfect Cleveland evening (which are hard to come by) after that it was an adventure to try to get chairs unlocked for more of our friends to join.  We were bringing business, yet were left feeling like a burden.\n\nOne table of our friends filled up before the other so that table got menus first...and got to order drinks first...and got to order food...at least fifteen minutes before the other table got to set eyes on a menu.  Our friend actually went inside and came out with 6 cans of beer to distribute as the server was finally passing out menus and asked \"how did you get those?\" Well.  We came from a bar, and were thirsty, so we made it happen.\n\nThe food was great, no major complaints there aside from the fries tasting like my high school cafeteria, BUT, the burgers were delicious.  Service continued to be bad throughout our time there as she asked if things were together, then came out with new checks all printed incorrectly.  My friend would like me to say it's okay because she was 20 (not even legally allowed to open our beers) but to me it was inexcusable...you work for your tips, and she treated us like overflow that she was annoyed with. \n\nI won't venture back...good burger or not, when I'm spending that much money I expect more.
