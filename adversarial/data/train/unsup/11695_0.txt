Nice atmosphere, great service & good food. Ordered the chicken curry fettuccine and shrimp panang curry. I felt our meal was just average, didn't really stand out to me. I was pretty disappointed because the curry was like soup! I like mine a little bit thicker consistency so i thought maybe this is just how they make theirs? But the flavor was definitely there. I like that their menu is very presentable and has many of the common Thai dishes i enjoy, that i would like to try next time. Probably pass on the curry. As for the thai tea, i saw on a \"tip\" for Panna Thai that it is unlimited thai tea and thai coffee..which sold me because no place ever does refill on thai tea. It has been a few yrs since that was posted but they may want to change that. Instead it is limited to 2 refills, still better than none!
