Great place for drinks!  Outside, you'll have gorgeous mountain views.  Inside, a beautiful space with large windows and nightly entertainment.\n\nWe stopped in twice during our brief stay.  The signature cocktails are a little expensive at roughly $15, but my Polo Club with Hendricks gin, raspberry syrup, fresh lemon juice, and egg white was a treat.  Later in the evening, we had dessert...apple tartan.  The presentation was a work of art.  So was the speed at which we devoured this slice of heaven.  \n\nNice spot for travelers and locals alike!
