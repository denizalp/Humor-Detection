I was told that this state of the art Arena was the best in the league. So I expected to be blown out of my seat with all of the extras. That wasn't the case but it was new, huge & not a bad sold out seat in the house. This is speaking from experience. We had the standing room only seats at the last minute (2 weeks before the game) & those were my only option then. They were on the top but you felt like you were still part of the action. The stadium seating is pretty steep but that's how you achieve that feeling which was nice. If you ever have the chance to get standing room only seats you should definitely go for it to save a few bucks but show up early. What they don't tell you is that there a very few limited seating at the end of the area & you can grab them if you arrive early enough. We weren't aware so we hoofed it. We had a really great time. The crowd was really committed & out in force for this new team. Good times for sure.
