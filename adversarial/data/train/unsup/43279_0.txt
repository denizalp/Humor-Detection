Service is fine but quality of food is disappointing.  Call me spoiled, but being from Denver, which is home to Chipotle, I have grown up on the stuff.  The guacamole was bland, the chips were waaaay under-salted, and the chicken in our tacos were barely warm.  I have been here a few times, don't think I will return.
