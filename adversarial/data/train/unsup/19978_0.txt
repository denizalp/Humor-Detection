Will the real Malaysian please stand up!\n\nMy party of five (NOTE: 2 Singaporeans and 3 Malaysians) walked into the restaurant  with high spirits and excitement. Afterall, we did drive 12 hours from Chicago to Richmond Hill for a couple of nights and decided to allocate one precious meal to enjoy an authentic Malaysian luncheon. \n\nMy one star rating summarizes our experience. utter disappointment.\n\nFood: we ordered Indian Mee Goreng, Roti Canai with Curry Chicken, Char Kuay Teow and Mee Siam.  Not one dish was impressive.  Roti Canai was not crispy, chicken curry was watery, the kuay teow was the thick kind, not the thin ones we have in Penang, Mee Siam was blend and the Mee Goreng just over cooked.\n\nTo my 3 Malaysian friends, national pride was at stake here. Afterall, Malaysian food is supposed to be better than Singaporean food! We had to give the owners some feedback, afterall, they were Malaysian too.\n\nService: If I could give negative stars, I would.  The service was non existant.  Our server looked like she was being forced to serve us. The owner came over after 10 minutes of our request and did nothing but offer one word of apology.  \n\nThe experience at Restoran Malaysia was totally unpleasant and we will never return.  And neither should any of you yelpers. We know authentic Malaysian food, and this is definately NOT it.   \n\nThis is what you call a \"waste of stomach space\".
