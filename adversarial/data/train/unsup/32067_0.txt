I ordered a bunch of food from Joyous Thai from uber eats and honestly, it was pretty good; it's good that home made from mom feeling when you eat it. \nMy friend and I got the deep fried calamari which had some spicy\/salty toppings on it which is typical for asians, red curry with chicken + vegetables which was creamy and delish. We also got shrimp rolls which he liked, but as a south East Asian gal, i know these aren't the real deal; these were slightly burnt and just too thick for my liking. The mango chicken was deep fried pieces of chicken with mangoes, veggies and a sauce. We also got coconut rice to go along with our food and I was pretty excited about this ahaha- so simple but so good!  All the portions were large- had them for leftovers the next day and still good!! Good food and worth it's price.
