This service wasnt rude but it was cold. \nThe rice was the same as uncle Ben's converted rice,  that is if it wasn't uncle Ben's. \nThe spicy white beans literally tasted like seasoned canned pork and beans including the sweetness. \nThe hummus was okay but really loose like flavored tahani. \nThe kofta was very very salty, could not make it any other spices
