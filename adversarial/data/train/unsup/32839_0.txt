The closest pho spot to my place. If I'm craving a quick fix this would be it. Pho is decent. It's only available in one size. Slim pickin's. Not as many options to choose from like most Pho spots around the nation. Broth is decent along with portion but definitely not worth the price. We ordered the egg rolls\/spring rolls. HORRIBLE. When the server placed it on the table my husband and I looked at it and didn't know what to do with it. Over cooked, yellow and the size of 2 jumbo sized chapsticks cut up in 4s.
