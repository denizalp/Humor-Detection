I was craving a poutine today. I'm so glad I found this place.  Mo prepared a fesh poutine for me consisting of fresh cut Yukon gold potatoes,  mushroom gravy and layered stringy mozzarella cheese.  Gravy was perfect (not salty like most others) and cheese not squeaky but good spin on the traditional curds.  Very satisfying and reminiscent of my youth in Quebec city.
