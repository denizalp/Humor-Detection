Finally someone is giving Lux a run for their money. Their espresso is smooth--not bitter--perfectly pulled. The two eggs any style plate was absolutely delicious, with scrambled eggs garnished with green onion,  two strips of crisp bacon, and a fresh fruit cup of strawberries, grapes, and pears. Toast on house made bread. I have been here a few times so far and it is my new favorite spot. The ambiance is calm and inviting. Everything is spotlessly clean and the service is fast and friendly. You should go!
