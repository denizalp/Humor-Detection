Let's start by saying that thanks to growing up in San Diego in the 1970's, 30+ years in the medical field, and countless TDYs to Thailand and the PI, I have come up against (pardon the pun) more than my share of exquisite women with impressive... ahem... let us say attributes.\n\nSo on the whole, you're probably thinking that I would usually find a show with exquisite women with impressive attributes boring, and you're right.  And I would have been out the door after the first 15 minutes if this show was only about the aforementioned.  After all, this is Vegas: a city with more beautiful women with exceptional... attributes (natural and enhanced) per capita than any city in the world.\n\nThis show isn't about the women and attributes, it's about talent.  These girls can dance and perform and sing and keep an audience of both men and women in their seats for an hour.  The performers could have been wearing bikini tops during the entire show and it would have been just as worth seeing.  Of course, they ARE spectacularly beautiful as well as incredibly talented, so it's a win-win situation.\n\nIf you're on the north strip around 10:30 PM and want to see a great show, stop by the Westgate and see this one.  You won't be disappointed.
