Yay!!  I FINALLYYYYYY got to see this show this past Memorial Day weekend.\n\nCall casino marketing if you ever are to book at a Vegas hotel b\/c they can throw in some extra perks for you.  Not only did I get a good deal on my Aria hotel room, since I booked at an MGM grand hotel, I was able to get a 2 for 1 deal on the O tickets, which is AWESOME b\/c O tickets are so damn expensive!!  Total came out to be $165 for me and my bf AND we got to sit in the middle towards the front of the stage.  Great seats!\n\nWHY ONLY 4 STARS:\n-  O had some slow parts...bf didn't want to say it, but I know that he got sleepy during the show.\n-  The storyline was a bit confusing, but that may be because there were so many different skits one after the other.\n-  Personally, I like Le Reve at the Wynn better, but that may be b\/c I had strawberries and champagne during the show.  \n\n\nOVERALL:\nI loved the energy of the entire cast...you can really tell that they put their everything into the show.  The whole audience stood up with a standing ovation at the end.  I can't believe they have to perform twice in one night!  They have bodies built like a machine!  The comedic skits with the clowns were funny and the acrobatics, water routines and the gymnastics of the entire cast was just amazing.  I couldn't help but be wowed throughout the show.  If you can get a deal on this show, I recommend watching it at least once when you come to Vegas.
