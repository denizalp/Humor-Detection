I had pretty much given up on ever getting to eat Eastern European food when I went vegan. If I hadn't had authentic fare in my pregan days, there was slim chance I'd get it as a vegan.\n\nLeave it to Apteka to change that.\n\nThe food was amazing. Simply delicious.\n\nI made the mistake of closing out my tab just after ordering so I had to open it back up to order more!\n\nIf you're visiting Pitt like I am, do yourself a favor and visit Apteka.
