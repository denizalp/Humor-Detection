I haven't been in nearly a year, so I am due.\nThis little S\/M gem is hidden on Oakey and if you aren't familiar with the area, can be a bitch to find, get in and get out.\n\nHaving said that...\nWe were immediately impressed by the front office\/screening area. They want to make sure you are of proper age and know what this place is.\nIn the office you'll find seating and advertisements for kinky places, shops, and vacations. Pretty awesome, I took a handful.\n\nOnce inside, you'll see a kink store that specializes in their own brand of \"electro-stimulus play\". Basically you buy the box and wiring. Then buy the accessories. There are more accessories than you can shake a stick at. I mean a whole catalog, and illustrations of how they can each be used. \nMy hubby and I have known of this place, and its wares for years, but are still unable to afford them. To my knowledge they will let you go to the backroom and try somethings out in \"the chair\".\nSounds ominous.\nI have seem the exhibit at a few fetishballs, and at the time,was too reserved to exhibit in public...even though it was behind closed doors. It was still in front of people.\n\nAnywayyyyy,must return again with lots of $$$.\nWould appreciate a groupon\/ some other form of discount greatly. The economy sucks!
