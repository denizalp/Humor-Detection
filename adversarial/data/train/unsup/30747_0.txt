The 2 stars are for the 2 great dogs that I have SAVED from this shithole. TODAY, I stopped in because we are in the market for possibly another pup for our dog. I could not believe what I walked into. Stray and rabies quarantined signs on 3\/4 of the kennels. Multiple dogs in each kennel. Covered in urine and feces, kennels full of piles of shit. These poor animals deserve better than this. I have never seen it this bad. Flies are everywhere. These animals are miserable. The shelter is currently having a sale on their adoptions until the end of April, yet none of them seem to be available for adoption. I'm not even sure if it's a staffing\/volunteer issue, because I saw them walking the aisles, passing the kennels full of shit and other things etc. God, I'm so disgusted over this. These pups need to be saved. ASAP.
