Yay! Another authentic Chinese cuisine in the southwest! The food items are definitely authentic for the taste. But a little bit on the pricey end though. Portion size is smaller than rainbow kitchen as well. They have karaoke rooms for big parties so it's great for your super basic Asian uncles and aunts when they are in town.
