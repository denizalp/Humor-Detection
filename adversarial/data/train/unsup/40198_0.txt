I LOVE this place. The selection isn't as large as some other sushi restaurants (that's why I didn't put five stars), but you can't beat the price. My husband (a big eater) and I leave *stuffed* for around $25. That's by far the least expensive price we've found for a sushi dinner.\n\nI agree with some of the reviews that said you don't know how long the sushi has been sitting on the conveyor belt. However, I'm guessing those people aren't aware that you can order the sushi you want - and it's made fresh for you. We either keep an eye out for the sushi that has been put out the most recently or ask the chef\/waitress for the rolls we want. Just ask for a menu; it shows the different types of rolls you can order. \n\nTip: go with the \"Haru Sushi;\" it's my favorite!
