Heeee-yah!\n\nFirst thing that stood out about Kung Fu Tea was the cute and cozy decor with AMPLE outlets for plugging in all your electronic gadgets. If you need to get some work done and want to hang out in an adorable caffeinated spot this is your place. They have lots of teas on their menu too. Menu items are on the sweeter, milkier side of the spectrum with boba, grass jelly and red beans as options for additions. Customization is an option for those that prefer their tea to stay more true to it's original state.
