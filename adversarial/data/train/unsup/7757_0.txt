FINALLY got to check this place out!\n\nWent with a group of 9 and so we got to try everything and everything was DELICIOUS!!!\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nCatfish w Thai Basil, Pad Thai w chicken, Padseew w Beef, Garlic Prawns, Crispy Mussel Omelet, Green Curry, Crispy Duck with Panang, Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab. \n\nEverything was very good!!! But if  you must choose a few from the list above I would go with Garlic Prawns, Crispy Duck with Panang & Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab. \n\nI would probably pass on the Pad Thai, Padseew & Green Curry next time. Pad Thai & Padseew was good but you could get just as good noodles elsewhere. Green Curry was kind of plain compared to the other dishes. If you want curry I would get the Crispy Duck w Panang over the green curry. \n\nTIPS: \n1) Make RSVP online on their website! So much better than trying to call to make RSVP! Lifesaver!!! :)\n2) Plenty of parking so no worries if you decide to drive there! Probably better since it will be faster than trying to grab a taxi or uber\/lyft etc.
