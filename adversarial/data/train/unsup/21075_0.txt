I LOVE MY STYLIST. \n\nSeriously. I do. She's fantastic, talented, and wonderful. I love her so much that I don't want to share her name! Oh alright. FINE. \n\nAshleigh. \n\nThere are you happy? \n\nAshleigh's been doing my hair for 4 years. She gets me. She knows how un-skilled I am with styling so she cuts my hair in styles that even a hair-moron like me can handle. We've gone long to short to pixie. She's done my wedding. She's been there for pre and post pregnancy hair. She's just so good.\n\nThe people at Lavish are so warm and welcoming. I go there at least every 2 weeks to refresh my pixie cut and they do it for free (it's like a reverse bang trim). They always fit me and they never make me feel like I'm a bother.\n\nThey know that people are there to relax, be pampered, and feel pretty. So they do their best to cater to those needs - hand massages, scalp massages, slippers when you walk in, beverages, etc. \n\nI always feel so good after being here. And I will even share Ashleigh with you. Okay, maybe not.
