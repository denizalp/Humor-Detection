Rating: 2.25 stars. Uhhhhh...huh? What is this place anyway?\n\nWhat I Liked: The girls that worked there were fun...?\n\nRoom For Improvement: I like strong coffee. Coffee that puts a pep in your step and your ass in the john! Even when I order mochas, I want to taste the smoky bitterness in the roast to offset the sweetness of the chocolate. But this place...? This place serves coffee-lite. Too sweet. Good for coffee newbies who like their mochas to taste like chocolate milk. With the loud music, the \"cute\" staff, and the overly sweet drinks...it just seemed like this place was trying too hard. All image; no substance.\n\nOverall: Good for coffee newbies but not for connoisseurs. I won't be back.
