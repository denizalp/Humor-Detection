All I can say is THANK YOU to whoever is behind this amazing place.  It is a gift to all.  It is an opportunity to enjoy incredibly high quality and delicious products in a wonderful place.  When you think about it, this is kind of lost on most people these days.  The atmosphere is right out of the 1920's - really - all the equipment, menu etc. seems truly from those times.  Really special.
