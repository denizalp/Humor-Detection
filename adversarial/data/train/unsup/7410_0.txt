Some friends were in town and they wanted to try a new restaurant. We stumbled upon this place and noticed it was voted \"Best of Las Vegas\" in 2004 and 2007. How can you go wrong with that? We walk in and promptly get seated. I dont recall anything out of the ordinary in regards to the Middle Eastern ambience. On to the menu... We give it a look over and before we can even order, they give us some complimentary Ftayir, which is Lebanese bread. It was warm and tasty.\n\nOur party ordered the following:\n\nMost Popular Dish - Frarej - Half of a chicken baked with potatoes and ripe tomatoes, baked together so that the juices and flavors from the chicken and vegetables permeate each other, basted until golden with olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice.\n\nShawarma Plate - Beef grilled with tomatoes and seasoned onions, and served with Lebanese tarator sauce and a generous bowl of Lebanese rice.\n\nShish Kabob Combo - Lamb, Shrimp, Beef Kabob, tender and succulent cubed and charbroiled with fresh seasonal vegetables laid on a bed of Lebanese rice topped with seasoned onions.\n\nThe best out of the three was definitely the Beef Shawarma Plate. The chicken seemed a little dry and the shish kabob combo was good... but not excellent.\n\nI'll answer my two favorite food questions, which I always ask:\n\nWould you order that dish again? Yes. Shawarma. Excellent.\nWould you eat here again? Maybe\/Yes. It's not on my top 20 places to eat when were throwing restaurant names around, but if someone else wanted to eat here, I would probably go with them.\n\nAnd of course, I added some pictures to stimulate your taste sense.
