Wife used the words fabulous and phenomenal.... I cannot think of a word to describe our meal. 14 year old son didn't say much....just ate and ate.\n\n1. Small, mini spring rolls are given complimentary. Delicious!\n\n2. Ordered chicken satay and more spring rolls for appetizers. Extremely good!!!!\n\n3. All 3 of us got a soup...Tom Yum chicken, Tom Yum seafood, and wonton chicken. Again....delicious.\n\n4. We then ordered sushi....we are all full at this time. Son got spicy crunchy shrimp roll, wife had volcano roll, and I had the spicy Rock Hill roll. Freaking delicious!!!!\n\nService was awesome!!!! Sushi chef is as cool as they come and owner is the bomb. If you are in the area, please give this place a try.
