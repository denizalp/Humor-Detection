Hands down the best barber shop in Vegas! \nFirst class, professional barbers. Their attention to detail is unmatched. Incredibly unique atmosphere, with a touch of the traditional barber shop! A special thanks to Martin for an amazing hot shave! I'll be telling every man in America about Hi Rollers barber shop.
