I am giving this 3 starts,  because the Lady at the Front desk, really needs to drop her Attitude. You don't go to an expensive place like Fleming's, to get Attitude from their staff. If our Money is not good enough to her, we would gladly spend it elsewhere. I told my Husband I wish she doesn't get a share of the tips, because she didn't deserve it.\nIt was Our Wedding Anniversary & we chose this restaurant as we had heard good things about the food. However, the Lady at the front desk was so Rude. She is the face of Fleming's. The first you see even before you have a chance to experience the rest of their staff or their food. Her attitude & rude replies, just put me off.\nWe had a reservation for 7.30 p.m. & thought we would get there around 6.30, so that we can have a drink & hang around for awhile. However when we got their it was packed & the small entrance was full, with no place to stand or sit. I manged to get up to the desk & informed her that we had a reservation. Either she was angry with the crowd their or she didn't like her job. She was just rude & said you have got here an hour ahead. I informed her, that we got there early so that we could get drinks before dinner. To that she just said \"Oh! the Bar area is full\". We got to the end of the Bar Are, near the back door & with a few minutes wait managed to get the attention of the Barman & get ourselves drinks. I had the 'Club Clover' which was so very sour & didn't taste good at all. I had to ask for some Tonic water in it. My Mum was with us too & she couldn't keep standing there much longer. She is 83 years of age. I saw an empty table Outside & I asked her to sit there & I was seated on the ledge outside. The Tables outside were not being used Last night for Dinner, as the weather was bad. The winds were way too strong, with a slight rain & the leaves were in peoples food. A few minutes later, I went up to the girl in the front again & I asked how long it would be before we get a table. I was then Informed by a Gentleman that they were trying to get the guests who were seated outside, in to the Dining area due to the bad weather & it would be a little after our time of reservation. That's fair enough & I was fine with that, as that's the right thing to do. The people seated out there couldn't have their meal in that windy weather & they were there before us & it was fair that they should have a nice meal in peace. I informed the lady then, that I was seated outside & the door was closed due to the wind & if she could inform me when our table was ready. To this she tells me, \"No, You can't sit outside, unless we seat you\". I informed her that the weather was bad, (If she didn't know it already) & that there was no one who wanted to sit outside, except poor us, as we didn't want to stand by the door & get in the way of the servers & my Mum couldn't stand there & keep shuffling around to make space for the servers to walk. I told her I am seated on the Ledge outside. To that she says, \"Ah! Ok\".\nWhat is this place? A school? She tells us where we can sit & stand? So we can't sit on the chairs outside, even if there's no one &  they can't use those tables due to bad weather, but it's ok to sit on the Ledge.\nI was very upset with her & I told my Husband I really don't want to eat here. He was interested in eating there, because he had heard good things about the Steak. Anyway, I told him, I don't want to come here again. They are Rude.\nThe Server RICKY at the Bar was very kind to us & kept looking for space so that my Mum could sit. That's how staff should be.Thank You very much Ricky. \nWe got our table by 7.30 as promised & I was ok by then as the lady who seated us wished us for our Anniversary & she was nice. Our server MARIE was so very nice. She was friendly & chatty. It was like she knew us all along. It made us feel so very special. All the Servers Attention to detail was amazing. They never left an empty glass on the table, always cleared & cleaned. I informed Marie about the Girl up front. She said she will let someone know about it. But I said it was ok & I was Happy now.\nWhoever the lady was, up front on Sunday 31st January, Please let her know that she really needs to leave her issues at home & not bring it to work. You can't spoil another persons day because you are not in the mood to be nice. People who come to dinner, come to relax, be happy & Celebrate. Just because it is her place of work, there's nothing we can do about it. I feel bad for her, if she has had a long day. But it was my day to celebrate & be happy & not be served with her Attitude.
