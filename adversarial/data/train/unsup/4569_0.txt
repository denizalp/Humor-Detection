Been driving by this place for the better part of a year. I see the sign and think \"beef on weck.\" Mmmm Buffalo. So on a chilly November evening I figure it's worth a go so I go.\nEnter to the left of the beer garden and you are at the window, giant menu to the right, little ones on the counter. After the sticker shock you remember Buffalo is in the same New York as New York and get on with your order: wings, beast on weck, and a beverage.\nThe wings are so Buffalo! Large and meaty and saucey with celeries and blue cheesing. First time in so I erred on the side of caution, medium has good flavor but little heat, go with hotter. The thick-ish sliced beef is delicious and tender and subtle and stacked on a heavily carawayed roll with fries and horseradish and extra gravy on the side.\nChunking a star for the horseradish: it should be stiff enough to open your sinuses and fortify a body for -20Â°. This stuff is sweet like candy, probably why the locals think 35 is cold.
