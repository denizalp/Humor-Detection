Ty is fantastic - I was waiting for my appointment to begin, not acknowledged by anyone for the 15 minutes I waited, until Ty walked in to the salon and greeted me with a warm hello and guided me to a seat. He did a wonderful job shaping my nails, and he took plenty of time to ensure they were just as I wanted them to be, even doing an extra coat because he thought it would look more well done. I'm a little disappointed because three of my nails have already come off entirely (I had gel polish on) and it's barely been 2 weeks since I had them done, however I've been looking for a nail salon in Pittsburgh for ages, and I think this will be the one I come back to!
