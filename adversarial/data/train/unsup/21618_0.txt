I do try to support small family owned businesses but I do not support small minded, stubborn and ignorant businesses who refuse to listen to customers and respond appropriately. There's a reason that Avery's is still a cluttered mess of a store with no true purpose other than the owners hobby of roasting beans.\n\nToday I visited after dining nearby and I was caught off-guard by the rude employee who was upset that I asked for stevia. She went into a rant about not having stevia or coconut milk even though she's asked several times a day.\n\nHaving seen the owner in the back I asked him why he didn't have stevia or coconut milk if it was common in coffee shops and if his employees are asked for it daily.\n\nHe said that he doesn't carry either because they are expensive and customers just steal it. I expressed my concern with his ignorance and jaded view of customers \"stealing\" condiments after paying $5 for coffee. His view of telling customers to use what he has because he will never coalesce and get what they are asking for is the very reason why small minded small business owners will fail.\n\nAvery's is in business to provide a product and service to customers, if the owner can't figure this out then I can't blame his employees for being equally small minded and ignorant.\n\nPeople using stevia are thieves according to the owner. They pay a super premium price for the business owners arrogance that his coffee is more valued than Starbucks. The prices at Averys are a good 15% higher than Starbucks and definitely not worth it. \n\nTake my advice and avoid this business.
