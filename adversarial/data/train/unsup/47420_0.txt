While it bears the same Chinese name 許留山 as the well known Hong Kong dessert chain, and sells some of the same items, it's clearly not part of the chain.  \n\nThey do have a nice selection of traditional Cantonese style dessert, steaming hot sweet soup made with ground sesame, almond, taro, red bean, tapioca, etc. My favorite is the steamed milk custard, it's so smooth and tender, the chef totally mastered the art of making it (and which I cannot aspire to achieve at home).  More exotic choices include papaya, pear, snow fungus, hasma and other things double steamed with sugar and herbs for their health benefits.  \n\nFor summer days they have cold dessert, mostly heavy with fruits, like mango pudding, mixed fruit with pudding, tapioca, jellies or shaved snow.  They don't necessarily have the best shaved snow in Toronto, but it's ok. \n\nIf you prefer something savory, they do offer a few snacks, such as fried chicken and fried calamari.  In the winter time, an order of clay pot rice really hit the spot. It is rice cooked in clay pot with various toppings on it, such as chicken, Chinese sausage and ribs.\n\nOverall, not the best place to eat but the food is more than decent, and it has an extensive menu.
