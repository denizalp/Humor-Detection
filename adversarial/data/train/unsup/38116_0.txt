This is perhaps my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Last night I had the acorn squash soup. It held wonderful nuances of flavor. I also tried the late night pizza. The crust was thin and had a nice chew   The tomato sauce was excellent and the roasted peppers were a nice touch. The service was excellent! And the wine was wonderful. I would suggest an Oregon Pinot on the wine list.
