I went to reset tattoo on Monday, and I must say I am so happy I did! The office is set up by appointment, and so when I walked in it was just him there. Seems like it would be typically unsettling, but it was very opposite. I liked the fact that I was able to just talk exclusively and have undivided attention. He was professional and made me feel comfortable. He uses a top tier machine made only for tattoo removal, which is important. A lot of other places specialize in removing hair, and use the machine to remove tattoos as an extra money avenue. This is not the route you should go, as getting the tattoo off scar free and effectively is the goal. The price is great, and the procedure is quick and accurate. The feeling is that of a heated rubber band snapping the area of tattoo, but he does it fast. Honestly, if you can sit through a tattoo, this is a cake walk. I am so happy to be getting rid of my old tattoo and look forward to the next session. I highly recommend this office! Thank you!
