I like sunwing, Always do.\nI went to Bahamas, Caya coco, Jamaica \nI book all these vacation in sunwing, there was once I write the wrong name, and they changed for me the second day I book the vacation.\nI always chose all inclusive for my hotel. \nThe airline is always at 4am, that is too early for me, I can not even sleep that night. and I can play during the first day in the vacation.\nthe airline seat is very small, I upgrade it all the times.
