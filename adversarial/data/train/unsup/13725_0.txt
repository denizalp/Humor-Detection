This is by the far the best bakery in Phoenix! I've been going to Baker Wee for years and my crazy cake ideas have been over-the-top year after year. They always have so much patience with my tedious details, and everything comes out perfect in the end. I've put in orders for baby shower cakes, birthday cakes, and wedding cakes... and not just your normal cakes, either! I wish I could post pictures of how the cakes turn out in the end... absolutely fabulous. Well, for example, it was my best friend's birthday and I wanted a Christian Louboutin shoebox cake, with a doll-like figure on top that looks exactly like my best friend, with shoe boxes and tiny vodka bottles (lol) and my God, it was incredible when they brought it out. I absolutely love this place - 10 stars if I could!
