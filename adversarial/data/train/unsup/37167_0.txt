TLDR; get the beef noodle soup, not the pork sauce noodle. The pork sauce is just too salty. The noodles here are very chewy and fresh and portion sizes are worth the price you pay. I always get a small bowl of noodles and it is more than enough to fill me up. there is also a decent amount of beef and the soup is flavourful regardless if you get it spicy or not. It's not a mind-blowing dish, but it is a well done bowl of fresh soup noodles. I've also tried the jellyfish appetizer, which tastes a bit too much like vinegar for my liking. Overall, I think the beef noodle soup is their best dish. The service here is quite fast as well, but the space is small and seating is limited.
