Best Manakeesh In the city! \nI love this place. My dad introduced me to this place a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since! The ingredients are so fresh and baked to perfection you can just taste it! \nThey have a wide variety of dishes! The prices are great as well! Good place to come here for students!
