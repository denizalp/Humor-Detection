This place is amazing!! Our servers name was Jessica, a long brown haired girl. She suggested the filet, mentioning it was her favorite choice of meat here. We tried it upon her request and it was absolutely to die for; cooked to absolute perfection and even charred to give that true flame grilled taste. We will be returning here to try other dishes next time. I am now in love with this place.
