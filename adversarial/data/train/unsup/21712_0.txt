We arrived as soon as they opened at 11am. Was told we needed to wait a few more minutes as the restaurant was not quite \"ready\". Being a very punctual person, I don't understand how could a well established restaurant not be ready until it was seven minutes past opening time. Anyways, while waiting we got bored so we started taking photos of the decorations (some cute figurines of Lincoln, Franklin etc for the kids), and the hostess announced our table was ready and rushed us to finish while insincerely saying \"I can waiiiiit.\" , tapping her foot at the same time. I thought she was about to yawn :(\n\nOur server was ok, not friendly, didn't care to ask if we have any questions about the menu, just very simple service. Hubby ordered the Lamb Meatball sandwich. I had the Prime Rib French Dip. Lamb was delicious, a bit too much tomato sugo. Prime rib was tender, thinly sliced, barely any onion.  The herbed fries that came with the sandwiches were soggy and extremely salty. Not acceptable at all especially when I am paying almost $20 for a sandwich, there's no excuse for the fries to be not crispy.\n\nWe also ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow. The sea salt was not evenly sprinkled on so upon first bite, there was no taste at all, and then there were parts that were super salty. Half of the toasts were burnt black. :( And to make things worse, the busboy spilled ketchup on me while cleaning up. There were absolutely no apologies or offering to clean my skirt. He did bring a wet towel if that means anything. \n\nI guess we should have left when we first entered, when the restaurant was not \"ready\" yet.
