our hotel (ballys)  recommended it..\n\n the restaurant is 'fancy,' has a romantic mood: dim lighting & candles, and also a nice little view.  the waiters were more than willing to serve us, they were so friendly (maybe TOO friendly, they were like flirting with us, it was sometimes uncomfortable).  they all seemed to be \"italian.\"  but my friends and i are pretty sure that some of them were faking the italian accent. (haha)\n\n we all ordered different pasta dishes.  i ordered from their \"specials for the night\" : mushroom and black truffle ravioli..which i couldn't finish, not because there was too much on my plate but because the black truffle was \"how do you say,\" too rich.\nalso my dish cost $50.00.\n\noverall, the food was OKAY, the service was more than great, because they gave us free shots of GRAPPA and LEMON CELLO!!\n\natmosphere is for couples.  we all had a good time at Il Mulino because the waiters were entertaining us, but other than that.. i don't think I would go back there or recommend it.
