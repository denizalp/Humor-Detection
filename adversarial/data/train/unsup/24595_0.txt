** Super addicting and tasty waffles, a definite must try. Tastes great with ice cream and well worth the price.\n\nWaffalonia has changed my life for the better, and how many places can you say that about? No matter how full I am after dinner, sometimes one friend in my group decides he wants to stop by, and once I step in and smell the fresh dough, there's no turning back. You have a separate stomach for dessert and waffalonia proves that's a fact.\n\nThe waffles are always nice and warm off the oven, super soft, and nice and sugary. They're so good that they'd taste amazing on their own, but I usually order it with their speculous ice cream. I love how the coldness of the ice cream contrasts the warmness of the waffle, and each bite is just heavenly. The speculous ice cream is my favorite.. it just complements the taste of the waffle beautifully and though it's really sweet every bite just packs a punch.\n\nAnother option is to add fruits, but from my personal experience speculous ice cream is the definite way to go. My friend described this place as \"dank af\" and I believe that's the best two word summary you could give it. I'm craving it now just writing about it...
