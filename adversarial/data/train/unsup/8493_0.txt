I ordered my third grilled buffalo chicken salad from here today. The first two visits I had no issues other than the food not being prepared in the time frame they gave me. Everything was tasty and well prepared. Being a new lunch spot downtown I can deal with that. \n\nToday however they gave me the fried chicken instead I'd the grilled chicken I had ordered.  Their fried chicken was not good at all. It tasted like it sat out to long after cooked. Their was also a hair in my salad that I subsequently had to fish out of my mouth. \n\nI asked for them to add jalapeños to my salad at my request. I was a little surprised that they charged $1 for them. I have no problem paying for my jalapeños but I can buy an entire jar of them for $1.27 at Aldi. Just noticed that was a little much for the 7 jalapeños they put in my salad.
