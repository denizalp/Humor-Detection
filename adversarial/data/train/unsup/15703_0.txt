UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UTNZ... I swear that's what I heard from outside 'cause inside it sure as hell looks like a well-refurbished club, but instead there were catchy korean pop songs playing. Yay... I hate catchy korean pop songs 'cause they're insanely catchy. *Frustrated* \n\nSo yeah, this place is monstrously big in a good way. There is also free wi-fi so a lot of people had their laptops. There is also another floor, but that for people with a party of 6 or more (I'm pretty sure). Although, I'd love to grab a few of my friends JUST to sit up there, haha.\n\nI never tried their bubble tea before... but I did have their BEEF BRISKET noodle and I tried my friend's spicy noodle? The beef brisket noodle was not pleasing to the eyes 'cause the soup base was evily dark, which didn't even taste good. Also, the beef was chewy and just dissapointing.\n\nHad a try of my friends noodle, which smelled great and tasted better than mine with the spices.\n\nMy friend ordered a Rose Tea which comes in a pot and you get unlimited water refulls. It was only okay. I would have much preferred Jasmine tea or Green tea 'cause the rose tea tasted too perfume-like. \n\nOverall: I'd only come back for free wi-fi or just because it's so comfortable here. Other than that....y'no.
