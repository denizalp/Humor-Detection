I've been coming to AZ Matsuri almost every year for over 10 years now. \n\nIt is held at the Heritage & Science Park, free admission but parking garage nearby is $12.\nRestroom facilities available but porter potty only...so you know.\n\nThey have several stage areas where I enjoyed watching performance (dance, drums). Numbers of food vendors increased over the year, so many people are here now, expect a long line (also sold out if you come late).\n\nMerchandises vendors are here to sell all kinds of Japanese stuff. I shouldn't have done it but I ended up buying a bonsai plant. I don't keep anything live in my house but they looked very nice, I purchased one without thinking through the consequences.  \n\nIf you have kinomo at home, wear one to this event. Some wear them casual but I saw several of them wearing kimono properly. Since it took me 45 mins to get dressed, I thought about walking up to them ask, how they did that so nicely.  Also you will see lots of people dressed in cosplay. Some are done really well.  Fun place to come out for people watching.\n\nThey do have a small area serving Japanese beer. Mostly family friendly events with some free kids activities area.
