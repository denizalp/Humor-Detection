I love coming here. This is the biggest mall in the Phoenix metro area. It is three stories and extremely huge! It boasts your typical mall stores, but also has many high-end stores, as well (well, we ARE talking Scottsdale). The food court is huge and their are plenty of places to eat (Kona Grill, Yard House...) among so many other stores! Furniture (Crate & Barrel).. They also have many of the only stores available in AZ (Zara, for example, is only located here in this state). Valet is offered. \n\nYou WILL get lost here if it's your first time. You will also probably get lost for the next 10 times you shop here. Enjoy.
