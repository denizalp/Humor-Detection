It's more than a bar.  This place boasts a hell of a sound system and a small but very nice dancing area.  My wife and I came here to attend the Pax Romana event by City of Madness (goth, industrial, etc.)  City of Madness used to hold events over at Sanctum, but after Sanctum's closing, they set up shop here and run a great show.\n\nIt ain't the largest place to dance in, but you'll have enough room to really shake it and get some great and friendly service while you're there.  Goth dance spots are a pretty limited field in the Valley, but if you're looking for one, be sure to check Club 24's calendar.  $5 to get in.
