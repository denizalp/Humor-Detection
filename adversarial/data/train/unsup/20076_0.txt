Our favorite place to come on Friday nights! We are from Philadelphia part of the year and have high expectations for cuisine when at our Scottsdale home. Grape's food is fabulous. From the baked Brie, mussels, savory salmon on a crisp potato pancake, to the fabulous wine selection... we love everything. The wines are fresh and delightful. A special shout out to Chris (Dan) our waiter.... \n\nBack for about our 12th time on 11\/11\/17. Had eggs Benedict... flawless and perfect. Shout out to Lynn (even if he is a Utes fan) and to Kayla. Fabulous and friendly service.
