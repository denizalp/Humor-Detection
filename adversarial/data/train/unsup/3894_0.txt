It's pretty simple. You just can't go wrong here at Zinburger. The burgers, sides, and even the chicken sandwich I have had here have all been top notch. I have to say my favorite so far has been the BRUCE LEE* Burger: Asian BBQ Sauce, Avocado, Jalape√±o, Napa Cabbage Slaw, Cucumber,\nRice Wine Vinaigrette & Sriracha Mayo. Its just a little something different but everything works so well together. And the last time we were there they had a BBQ Chicken sandwich and even that was great. Chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I would say these burgers are big enough to share. Especially if you plan on getting a side or two (as the sides are a la carte.) and a dessert. I recommend a Malt Shake. Mmmmm...  They also have a decent beer and wine list here, along with a few signature cocktails. Like I said... you just can not go wrong!
