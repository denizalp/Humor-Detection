Wow! This was definitely the highlight of our trip!  The atmosphere is amazing, very cool and hip.  Our waitress was probably the best we've ever had; she was friendly, fast, and so helpful with recommending items from the menu.  \n\nWe had the Edamame to start, and they were perfectly done with a delicious sprinkle of sea salt & lime. Miso soup was yummy.   We then tried the Beef Tenderloin and Aji Panca, and the Peruvian corn was scrumptious!  We had a Samba Strip Roll & a Green Envy roll... OMG, so good!  \n\nFor dessert we had the Chocolate Fondue.  Such a cute presentation, and simply a delicious finish to our meal.\n\nWhen we got our bill, we were surprised at how much we had spent, but we both agreed it was completely worth every penny! Best meal we've had in Vegas, by far!
