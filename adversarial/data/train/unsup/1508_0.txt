Don't ever, ever. ever get the food. I called for 2 pepperoni pizza and guy was so rude. He told me it would be a half hour before it would be ready. I told him no problem. He hung up on me and didn't ask for my name or a phone #. I showed up 30 minutes later and he scream that he hadn't even stated them yet. Go back to New York! We don't need you in Las Vegas
