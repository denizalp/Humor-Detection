Eyebrow? Want 2 Eyebrows? Go to Lee.  She is by far THE BEST EYEBROW WAX I have ever encountered.  I've gone to her for 5 years now and I have never been disappointed.  Don't believe me?  Look at my pictures... those brows would connect if Lee did not take good care of me (thanks, Italian genes!!) \n\nI also get my manis and pedis here-- WONDERFUL!  Clean, friendly and affordable.    The pedicure chairs are to die for and it is very relaxing.  I would never go any other place than My Nail Salon.\n\n*** Note:  Lee does not baby or pamper you in waxing, it is strictly, wax, rip --ouch-- move on..... she does do this forehead beating\/massage quickly after wards-- it can be startling at first-- just a warning.  The outcome is flawless though.
