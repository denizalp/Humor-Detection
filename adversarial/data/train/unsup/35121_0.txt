SEATED & NEVER SERVED.\n\nSeeing that the location on Sunset is amazing, and I've only had wonderful experiences there. I decided to give this location a shot since it's closer to the friend I was meeting up with. Upon arrival the hostess was very nice and seated us right away in a closed off room to the restaurant where there was one server serving just about every table in there (even ones outside) with the exception of a few tables across the room that were empty. 10 minutes roll by and we still haven't been greeted, so I ask the hostess if she could grab our sever. Another 10 minutes rolls by and we still haven't been greeted. I grab a random sever and ask if we could get the manager sent to our table. He apologized and served us the rest of our stay there. Meanwhile we are wondering what is wrong with the server in the room that has no problem taking 7 tables at a time that have now cleared out, but can't take our table. (She even served some that she were seated after us) she begins to loudly explain to the table across from us that we are mad because that's the new girls \"section\" and nobody picked us up. So she can talk about us, and she knows of the situation but can't even say hello to us? Regardless if it was her section (I can't imagine only one table is the new girls because she was taking tables all around us, even next to us both ways) she could have at least greeted us and said I will grab you server, or I see you guys haven't had service yet let me grab you some drinks and your server. Instead she chose to ignore us and to me that looks like she is not capable of giving good service. The 2 stars are for the food, and for the manager who was very apologetic and nice.
