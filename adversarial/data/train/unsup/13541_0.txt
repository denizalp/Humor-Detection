Waited in line for an hour for their self car wash.  RIDICULOUS! The money I saved on gas for buying the car wash package was wasted as I sat idle in the line.  \n\nThen to add insult to injury my car got locked in the car wash.  After the wash the garage door came down and would not open.  I was stuck there for a good 5 minutes until the doors finally opened.  My attempts at honking and banging into the garage door with my car went unnoticed.  No one came out to assist.  AVOID THIS CAR WASH AT ALL COSTS!
