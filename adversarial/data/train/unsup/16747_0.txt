It is difficult to write a review anymore. If someone doesn't like your review, they contact Yelp and Yelp removes it. That being said, allow me to declare these chocolates average. I am not sure what all these people are talking about, saying the store is filled with \"bob-bons.\" The number of different chocolates available I could have counted on my hand. Yes, they are real chocolates, as opposed to say, a Godiva, where it's mass produced candy by Campbell's Soup, but there is so much better chocolate out there. My immediate thought is Jacques Torres Chocolate in New York. That is chocolate. There is Vosges. I realize you can buy their candy bars in World market, but if you get a chance to visit a retail shop, the chocolate and the uniqueness of the combination certainly surpasses anything sold here. La Maison du Chocolat makes incredible truffles.
