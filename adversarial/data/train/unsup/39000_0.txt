They should lower the prices! Me and my boyfriend went inside to play pool and maybe bowl on a Saturday night and not only were the prices high, the place was dead. It's a nice set up, good decor, decent service but the prices are not worth it. Also, our bartender kept roaming off which slightly annoyed me because if I thought of something else I wanted I had to wait for his -every ten minute check in- with us. 12\/h to play pool, so after or first and only round of drinks we left and went to a bar that had more people, cheap pool tables (1$ a game), and good drinks.
