I wish I was still a kid so I could sit on a pony while having my hair cut. \n\nWhen I was a kid my hair was cut two ways:\n\n1) By my mom, who almost always cut my hair crooked (especially my extremely cowlicky bangs.)\n\n2) By a cheap inexperienced woman with bleach blond hair who once cut my brother's ear with her scissors (true story). \n\nMelonhead's on the other hand is a super cool place I'd actually LIKE to go to to get my hair cut....and I don't just mean as a kid. I STILL find getting my hair cut off-putting. Oh, and they play MOVIES! Isn't that, like, the coolest? \n\n....um....say....couldn't I just try and squeeze into that rocket ship chair? I just need a quick trim....
