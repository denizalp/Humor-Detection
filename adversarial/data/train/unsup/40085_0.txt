Great menu, prepared in a high quality manner with wonderful folks (Stacy [Manager] & Marco [Chef]) provide a really excellent meal and atmosphere in an unexpected location.  A really modern, clean decor with a great wine and beer selection makes this an unexpected delight, in an out of the way place, in north Phoenix on E. Bell Road.  Highly recommend.
