Good was OK, could have used a bar rescue on some.  The onion rings were tough so you couldn't bit through the onion, the salsa was pretty much onions with a few tomatoes and the little toast with the dip were so salty that I cannot image the chef could serve it?  We still stayed and did not complain.  Service was not too bad though!
