I waited 20 min for someone to even come to my table or acknowledge that I was there. After I ordered my drinks and a menu she took forever to bring them back. I have now been sitting for 20-30 more minutes for her to even come back and take my food order. This is the second time I have been here and both times have been horrible service. I won't ever be back. Worst place EVER!  We are headed to Sawtooth Bar and Grill... go there they have amazing service and food!
