This was once my favorite Indian place until it the change in owners. My wife ordered veggie pakoras for an app and couldn't stand the way they tasted. It was all breading and had a texture as if they were stale. She waited 15 minutes to get her appetizer. We then waited another 45 minutes to get our main dishes. I ordered aloo gobi and she ordered a fish curry. 3\/4 of my bowl was oil! I took one bite of my dish and couldn't stomach to eat more. It had absolutely NO flavor and just tasted like grease and oil!!!! \n\nMy wife said her curry lacked flavor as well. The waitresses were extremely nice and attentive. Unfortunately, we will never go back, as the food was that terrible. I am so sad the the change in owners changed the quality and taste of the food. Now, I'm back searching for some good Indian food in Vegas.
