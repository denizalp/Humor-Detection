I was reluctant on trying this place, I didn't know if the Tommy Bahama brand could deliver good food.  Pleasantly surprised. I came here for a lunch meeting, I got a chicken and mango salad and it was insanely good.    The great thing is I saw a number of things on the menu that looks really tasty, so I am looking forward to trying more. My only qualm, is that the service was terrible. I know they were trying but my waiter who was training somebody, both seem to be too distracted to do their job well.  For example, I ordered a drink and didn't get it.  I noticed right when my meal came out so I asked them again for it, and then it didn't get delivered to my table until after I was completely done my lunch. It wasn't anything special, just an ice tea, but I didn't have my ice tea for my meal at all, and I got it too late to actually drink it, and enjoy it, and yet they still charged me for it.  Especially considering that the person was training somebody, this is poorly handled.  I will try this place again because the food options looked good, but if service is not good the second time I probably won't come back\n\nNote for manager Patrick:  I don't know how to respond directly to your comment, yelp doesn't seem to offer that.
