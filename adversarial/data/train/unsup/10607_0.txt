First let me say im former US Army Infantry.\n\nThe guys here are just super over the top. All acting like they are about to head into combat and couldn't be more uptight. Bullet Proof vests and everyone has a sidearm. WHY?\n\nWe went all the way down there to shoot at 5pm on a Thursday night only to be told we should have called first because the whole place was rented by some corporation.\n\nOk so we decided to do some shopping. The selection of accessories is pretty bad here. They literally had 2 scopes.\n\nTrying to get the guys to be cool was a bit of a task, they all act like on duty police officers or bouncers. Not a fan of this at a gun range!!! Get over yourselves.\n\nThe only upside I saw was the pricing on their box ammunition. Decent prices.\n\nTried to look at a couple guns, 10 mins after standing there i managed to get a guy to help me. Asked to see an M&P Shield \"sorry dont have it\". Asked to see a Sig P938 \"sorry don't have it\". \n\nLeft. \n\nAnother couple asked if we wanted to go shooting a week later and said they want to check it out. I said fine, go ahead and see when their ladies night is. NO LADIES NIGHT.\n\n\nPASS!!!\n\nWe will keep going to Caswells, Teds or Shooters World. The staff is down to earth.
