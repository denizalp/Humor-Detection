When we walked in, three employees were filling an online order. We, and several others, stood in line for quite some time while they completed it, as one employee stood at the register watching them and several others stood by not noticing the building line. Guac was fresh, so fresh in fact that it tasted like straight avocado. No flavor at all. Chicken was burnt. Overall, just didn't taste like my usual Chipotle order tastes. Next time I think I'll try the Burgerfi a few doors down.
