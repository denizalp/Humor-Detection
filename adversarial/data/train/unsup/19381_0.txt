Not once would I ever have thought: McDonald's... A-OK. But... Consider the lobster. The McLobster. It's like America lost a bet and had to serve the McRib while Canada won and serves whole, fresh, chunks of lobster in lobster salad on a bun roll. Yes, here, while it may not be anything to write home about because it's old hat in Canada, it's a fresh catch for me to see it at McDonald's. This McDonald's... No drive thru. It's incredible to see people's reaction to no drive thru. The most easy going, active people might get enraged that we'd dare have to get out of the car. The nerve. But, during the McLobster season, it's no doubt worth it.
