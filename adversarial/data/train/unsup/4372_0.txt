No doubt about it. This is truly a treasure trove for vintage fans! I found some retro t-shirts here, and a few vintage luggage that I was almost tempted to buy to up-cycle. \nUp-cycling is a little bit of artistry, and a little bit of recycling. I like to find and transform boring things that I find in thrift shops and turn them into uniquely elegant or quirky objects. \nThis quirky shop has several rooms full of photographs, books and picture frames. There are rooms full of furniture and 60s kitchen stuff, vintage clothes, some of which was utterly delightful, some of which was ridiculously inexpensive! \n  There are areas with with tchotchkes, treasure boxes and more than I could delve into.\nI will absolutely go back here and take advantage of their yelp discount. A fun place to look around that's for sure!
