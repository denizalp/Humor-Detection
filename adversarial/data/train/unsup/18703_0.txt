Craptastic Cupcakes. \n\nMan, do I love a good cupcake--I could get high just thinking about it. I stopped in GiGi's Cupcakes today hoping to find some cakey goodness. These cupcakes are decorated and displayed beautifully, with tempting names, cute decorations, and piles of icing pillowed on top. The problem? They are God Awful. I exaggerate not. To prove a point; the little cupcakes that Walmart sells--chocolate with buttercream on top?? They are from Walmart, mind you, nothing special, nothing for which I had great expectations, BUT as it turns out, comparing a GiGi's cupcake to those dorky mini Walmart proved to be disastrous for GiGi's: the Walmart cupcakes kicked GiGi's pretentious cupcake arse to the curb!! I bought 4 different cupcakes to try from GiGi's (which was 4 too many), I ate but merely a couple of bites of two of them (to be fair, before reviewing) and got so irritated by their dry, tasteless, dirty, cake-cardboard bluck and the waxy, thick frosting grossness, that I immediately googled this ridiculous chain and ended up here. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY & calories! Trust me, just say NO to Gigi's upChuck cakes. How in the world does someone screw up a cupcake?! Especially if a cupcake is your specialty and the ONLY THING you make? GiGi's is ALL smoke & mirrors. I might as well as eaten dirt. Remember-- you will be be so much better off making your own with a good Duncan Hines mix or going to Walmart and getting those mighty tasty, moist little minis. Yeah, those little guys are pretty good! GiGi's is a joke. Don't say I didn't warn you.
