Not really much of a grocery store but a great little deli and restaurant.  I had a wonderful calzone that was enough for two meals.  My friend had a sandwhich with a side of antipasti salad that looked really good as well.  A small selection of wine and beer but the reason to go here is all about the food.  Didnt try the desserts but might next time if I have room.
