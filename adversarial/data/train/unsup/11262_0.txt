A little disappointed\n\nI was very excited to try a \"Slice of Sicily\" based on all the positive reviews that I have read. The restaurant is clean and the staff is warm and welcoming. However, when I first walked in and sat at a table there was this overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke and the pizza was a little disappointing.\n\nOn this visit we ordered the 2 slice one topping pizza with drink lunch deal. The slices of pizza at Slice of Sicily are large and the toppings are plentiful however the pizza itself just wasn't very good.  I don't know, maybe I was expecting too much but in my opinion,  the pizza was just average at best. There are other pizza restaurants in the area that I would prefer to go to.\n\nTo end on a positive note, the service at Slice of Sicily was excellent however,  I could not get over the strong smell of cigarette smoke that lingers throughout the whole restaurant.
