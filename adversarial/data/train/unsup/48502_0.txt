Came here on a Monday and it was surprisingly busy. We had about a 20 minute wait, not bad. Nice variety of sushi ranging from crunch roll, crab roll, las vegas, etc. Best feature is of course the revolving sushi. I remember the first time I came here I thought it was the coolest thing. The prices for the sushi is pretty reasonable. I got a crunch roll, shrimp tempura roll, bake scallop roll, and baked mussels. The baked scallop and baked mussels were special orders you have to tell the waiter and it was well worth it for me because I ordered a few of them and they were delicious!!\n\nThe customer service was pretty good and they were nice and polite. A downside I can think of is that their revolving sushi is usually bigger. So, I don't know if it's because it was a weekday and maybe there are bigger parties on the weekend. Overall, I liked it, not a bad place to bring a date. Good service, good sushi\/food, price ain't that bad, and I can see myself coming back here.
