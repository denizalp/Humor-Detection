Great staff and amazing food! \n\nWe stopped here on a whim (mainly because there's a shamrock on the sign and we have Irish ancestry). Service is super friendly and attentive. Our server even mentioned specials off the bat!  \n\nI got onion soup and the grilled cheese with bacon and the power slaw. My husband got the cheese balls and the French dip with fries.  Overall comment on the food?  Layers of flavor!  Super rare at restaurants. Power slaw is coleslaw with kale and other healthy veggies thrown in.  Fries are fresh cut and delicious.  Cheese balls are fresh made.  Our only complaint would be the cheese ball serving size for the price - a bit lacking in quantity.  \n\nWe will be back here regularly!
