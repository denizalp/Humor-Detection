I came here on an event with a bunch of AMAZING bloggers and I have to say, the chocolate fondue and delicious dessert drinks were amazing.\n\nWe sipped samples of the Red Velvet (which was complete with a cream cheese frosted rim) and chocolate martinis - which were both incredible. We also sampled the white chocolate, milk chocolate and dark chocolate fondues. All were incredible.\n\nThe service was awesome. We were absolutely taken care of. \n\nWe ventured into the bar to watch them make some of their crazy drinks - you know, like the ones that come with lollipops?\n\nWill definitely be back.
