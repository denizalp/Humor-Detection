Would give this place 0 stars if I could. Have been 2 or 3 times, each time I tell myself I am not going back but gave it one more chance today...first of all, today was President's Day, and I went out shopping expecting those sweet deals you always see on TV. I walked into the store and there was a big sign as I walked in saying \"All clearance 90% off\" with \"ALL\" in gigantic whiteboard letters. In the mindset of deals, and seeing absolutely no signage for any clearance section, I think to myself \"sweet, 90% off sale\". I spent about 2 hrs. gathering and trying on clothes while being subjected to the most horrible scummy music from the pits of hell ( I really do not care to listen to songs about obscene sex or people abusing each other while I am trying on clothes...I am unfortunate enough to be a 27-yr.-old woman who is too small to find clothes outside of the junior section) that made me want to blow my brains out or murder someone, but I hung in there for the sake of a good deal. \n\nThere are no carts or shopping bags to hold all the merch you want to try on, only teenaged clerks that occasionally come take the clothes for you if you are lucky enough to catch their attention away from their phones (or if you hunt one down). When you are in the fitting room, you have to re-put on your street clothes again each time you want to come out to get more, instead of them placing all your things by the fitting rooms for convenience.\n\nFinally after 2 hrs, I bring my selections to the counter expecting the sweet deal, when they ring me up at $127. \"That's before the 90% off right?\" No,\" the girl behind the counter says, \"that's only for clearance.\" \"Your sign is awfully dishonest and there is no signage for the clearance. Where is it?\" \"Oh, it's the stuff with the pink tags over in the corner.\" I go over to investigate, and find nothing marked with so-called pink tags, only pink dividers for a small section of casual shorts, again, with no signage. I come back and begrudgingly leave out a large portion of my selections ($10 for used athletic shorts? No.), at this point feeling an obligated rage to purchase something since I paid with my time and a large portion of my sanity for the music, I come back to the cashier and ask to speak with the manager. \"She isn't here...we're never sure when she is going to be here. Usually she comes after 3 pm but not every day.\" What time is it now? \"4 pm but she isn't here.\" \"Can I please get her phone number?\" \"No, we aren't allowed to give it out, you will have to try calling to see if she is here\"\"...OK, what about the owner?\" \"The owner is never here\"\"...well can you please fix the sign right now? It is very misleadingly worded.\" \"The manager is in charge of marketing and signage, we can't fix anything without her approval. We will mention something to her when she comes.\" \n\nI have never experience a catch-22 retail situation where the clerks made it impossible to get a hold of the manager! I was ready to tack on a note to the sign stating the truth, but alas, I could not find any receipt paper or tape laying around. Perhaps I would have been banned from the store...I would be ok with that XD. All I can think to do is leave bad reviews all over the internet and contact PC corporate, but I doubt that will change anything. I will stick with Goodwill and may check out Buffalo Exchange instead.
