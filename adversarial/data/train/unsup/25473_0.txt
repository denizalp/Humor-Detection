I've been around the world, and I can honestly say that this is the BEST bakery I've EVER been to.  Their signature cake, the \"kouign amann\" is so delicious!  It's cheap too!  \n\nThe service was fantastic, and they are happy to speak English for us non-Quebec'ians.  \n\nOnly negative thing:  not enough seating
