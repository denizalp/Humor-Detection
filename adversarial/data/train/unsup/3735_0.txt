Very small and bare store. Haven't been into a Gap in several years, but was happy to figure out which size I wear in their jeans- for $70 a pop, I'll use them as a reward when I go down one more. Appreciated that they had petite\/short sizes in stock!\n\nStore doesn't seem to have much merchandize- it's set up boutique style with registers in the middle and a baby section in the back? Women's section had several striped and plain tees and maxi dresses, and jeans. Men's department seemed to have the same, then the clearance, which was a mess of reject pants that mostly looked visibly unflattering even on the hanger. \n\nTook three pairs of pants to the fitting room, where I was shown a room by a disheveled employee who looked super-casual in ripped shorts and old flip flops. After being shown the room, I never saw her again- wasn't asked how I was doing or instructed where to put items that I did not decide to purchase. Folded them per company standards and put them back on the racks and shelves myself. \n\nNo one told me about their sale\/promotion- I had to get that info from a sticker on the mirror in the fitting room. That's a little bizarre, and you'd think there'd be a push to make more sales before it ends... tomorrow.\n\nThis store was basically a more expensive, smaller, and less-friendly Old Navy. Luckily, I made off with a pair of $10 khaki corduroys from the rest of the mess on the clearance rack. The only communication the cashier made with me was that all sales were final and she needed to see my ID to use my credit card.\nFor this company and brand, I expected better service with the higher price tag. Or, you know, ANY service.
