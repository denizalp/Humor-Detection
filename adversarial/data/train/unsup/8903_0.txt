I don't know if I can add very much to what so many others have said, but here goes! The staff are all absolutely wonderful. Very friendly and welcoming. The interior is just fine! I'm not sure why some others have complained but I found the furniture and decor to be very pleasant.\n\nThe food was great! The pasta seemed fresh and the sauces were not overly sweet or too heavy. The food really seemed authentic.\n\nThe bakery counter was amazing! A huge collection of treats! I tried 3 types of cookies and they were really good.\n\nWe are coming back for sure as there are several more items we want to try.\n\nI do need to also say that the price is a little high. Everything about the experience makes the restaurant want to be an \"everyday\" restaurant but the prices push it more towards \"special occasion.\"  We're still coming back soon, though!
