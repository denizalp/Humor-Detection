DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GOING HERE!!!\n\nI have never had such a horrible experience in a restaurant in my life. I worked at restaurants for many years. I get it, you get busy once in a while. This place is one of the restaurants that won't make it a year. It's a shame, with the awesome location and plethora of TVs I really was excited to try it out. \n\nWe went to Pittsburgh Grill and Sports Bar against my friends suggestion to stay away as the food wasn't great. I like to try out new places, especially on the North Side, so I was happy to stumble in here before a concert on a Tuesday night, despite what he may have said. Bettis Grill had a wait, this place did not. Score!\n\nWe walk in and an employee asks us if we are going to the bar. \"Sure, we'll grab a bite at the bar.\" We followed her back where she didn't really seat us, just kind of left. We sat down at one of the tables around the bar area. I noticed the bar was starting to fill up rather quickly and I could only see one employee in site. So, to make it in time for the concert we quickly relocated to the bar. \n\nUpon sitting down we decided to order everything at once. We sat at the bar for literally 30 minutes while the bartender served some people around us and walked by others. He didn't even offer us a drink or just simply say \"I am sorry I am so busy I'll get to you when I can.\" I worked in a restaurant for many years. I understand these situations come up in restaurant but at least addressing the customers would help your cause. \n\nI really think there were 2 people working at this entire restaurant that night. No use in trying it out, go to the other restaurants nearby.\n\nI can't stop wondering what they are going to do with all of those TV's when they go out of business?
