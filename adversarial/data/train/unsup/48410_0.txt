First time to Chili's and I will be back for their afternoon lunches. Great to relax and take a break from an all morning conference with a margarita for $5 dollars and one of their sandwiches. The menu is pretty extensive when it comes to lunch.\n\nStaff is friendly and quick when it comes to bringing your drinks and meals. They probably get patrons from all the surrounding hotels for lunch and dinner too.\n\nThe food is good, reasonable prices and the drinks are awesome.\n\nReally like their gadget-tablet at every table where you just swipe your credit card, sign and go. No need to get the check from the waitstaff. Eat and run out with the check all processed. Now, how cool is that. Have not tried the games on the tablet yet.
