I've been coming to Sam Ash for 7 years now and purchased many instruments including tenor sax, alto sax, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, semi hollow electric guitar, electric guitar, and various accessories for those instruments. \n\n3 reasons why I like Sam Ash and always purchase here rather than the competition:\n\n1) they have very big selection and they let you try out anything they have. They are very accommodating and explains each instrument in detail and gives you plenty of time to explore each of them. \n\n2) most of the time, you can ask for a discount and get it especially if you are a regular like me. My very first purchase was an alto sax and I was able to get $200 off the price of $1500.\n\n3) staff are super nice and friendly. They take the time to educate you so you can make an informed decision. Lauren at wind instruments is extremely helpful. \n\nThey have in-house guitar repair guy (Phil) too which makes things very convenient. Office manager, Mark is super cool and was helpful in getting my son's Gibson guitar replaced. \n\nI'm certain I'll be returning to this store just as long as my son's love of music continues.
