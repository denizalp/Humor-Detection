I am a fan of Chipotle.   This is a standard Chipotle.  I went during lunch so it was crowded and a little dirty (expected since not everybody cleans up their mess and the staff are focused on preparing food).\n\nWhat I like is that I can get it my way.   I ordered  a bowl - Double Chicken, Pinto Beans, Lettuce, Grilled Vegetables, and Medium hot sauce.\n\nThe meal met my expectations and kept me full for the rest of the day.   \n\nPrice - less than $10\nAtmosphere - Standard Chipotle (crushed and a little dirty but not to the fault of the establishment)\nParking - the parking is a little crowded because of competing businesses.\nXtra - It is next door to my favorite candy store - Rocket Fizz - another reason to go to Chipotle for lunch and drop in to get some retro candy :)
