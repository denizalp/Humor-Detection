We used South Hills Movers for our move from Mt Lebanon, PA to Milton, MA and they were excellent.  Tammy gave to gave us an estimate and was very thorough and her estimate was right on the mark.  She was very profeesional and friendly.  Everyone I spoke to at South Hills movers and was friendly and helpful.  They even offered to give us some used wardrobe boxes for free and the gentleman who loaded them into our car was a great guy.  Our truck driver, Tony, was really helpful and great with our little girl who had a bit of a crush on him.  They had to move us into our home in the rain and made sure to tape boxes down on the floor to avoid getting them dirty or scratching them.  I can't say enough nice things about our experience with them.  I feel very lucky to have found them, absolutely wonderful!
