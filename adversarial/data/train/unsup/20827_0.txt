Granted, I have only visited this locale once, but it was enough that I felt compelled to offer my opinion. \n\nI went with my new boss as a lunch outing to talk and get to know each other. The ambience was super cool. Wonderfully comfortable seating and they had a whole area dedicated to games like ping pong and bean bag toss. I want to go back just to enjoy some of that! They get kudos for the whole setup.\n\nI decided to get the (what I considered expensive) roast beef au jus. Let me say, I do not know WTF they were thinking. First off, not enough meat, then they decided to butter the bread inside (wait for it...) and then put mayo along with onions and the beef. YACK, it was so greasy. I compare eating that to eating the nasty mayo-ey ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the box. You end up not wanting to eat everything because the greasy mayo-ey mess is nauseating. To top it off, not enough fries either and to be honest I wish they offered a healthier side option because that was too much fattiness. \n\nI will go back and give them another try, but that sandwich alone put me off. I think I want to just go drink and play ping pong...sorry CD.
