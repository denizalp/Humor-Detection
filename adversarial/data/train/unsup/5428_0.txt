After reading a story about Maru's, I decided to give it a try.  I drove there and ordered a Sicilian style half pizza with four cheeses.  The gentleman wanted to make sure that I knew that each of the cheeses was an extra topping.  I also ordered mushrooms but there were none.\n\nI waited for the pizza to be baked and then I brought it home.  The pizza was good and large enough that it provided 1 1\/2 meals.  They gave me a small bag with lots of napkins and extra cheese and three packets of crushed red pepper.  That's a nice touch.\n\nI was pleased with the pizza but I'm not sure the value is there.  $20 for a half Sicilian?  And, it's an extra drive for me to go here.  I can get the same or better only 2 miles from home instead of going to Maru's.  I;m glad I tried it but I'll stay with my tried and true pizza vendors.
