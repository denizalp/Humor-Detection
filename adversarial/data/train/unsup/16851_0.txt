Went there to get my hair cut.  They were running a special where you get a free conditioning treatment, which was great.  However, I expected a normal salon conditioning treatment where it is set on your hair for 30 minutes under a dryer, and this one was just a leave on treatment for 7 minutes in the shampoo chair.  However, the shampoo chair happened to be a massage chair which was cool as hell.\n\nThe haircut itself wasn't amazing, as I just wanted a light trim and not much else, so I didn't expect anything fancy or wonderful.  I should probably be more adventurous with my hair but a bad hair cut scares me terribly.  \n\nI would go here again for the value, but I am unsure if I would go on a regular basis, as I preferred the salon in the Rio and Paris better.  Maybe I might try a regular local salon next time.\n\nI was also annoyed as hell they would not accept checks.
