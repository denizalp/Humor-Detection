I came in here to find some baby gifts for some friends who had a baby girl a few months ago. I literally had no idea what to get so this place really saved me. My budget was about $75 and this place had so many baby gift options it was unbelievable.\n\nI ended up getting a thing that let's you take the hand print of the baby and hang it up, as well as some cute owl stuffed toy because owls are a hoot, a congratulatory baby card, and cute little baby socks.\n\nThe only person working was a nice lady who was a bit busy but helped us out and offered some suggestions. She was really into her job but almost TOO into it if that's possible. For example she was talking to us like you'd talk to a baby while showing us her recommendations. I was really confused, because you know, I'm not a baby and all that. NBD, she was friendly enough and gift wrapped our items. What a lifesaver!
