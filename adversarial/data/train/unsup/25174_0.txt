Sometimes you feel like your review is just affirming those who came before you, but this spot deserves another 4* rating.\n\nIn my opinion, you come here for the beer selection, hoping the great ones haven't run out that night. There are great craft beers to choose from, which is rare in the city, and you can use that tasty foaming top to wash down their well cut fries.\n\nI didn't try their food, so can't comment there, but I'll definitely be back.
