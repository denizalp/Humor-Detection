Do not go if you like your eggs over easy. Have been going to this place for years and they've recently undergone a change. Its decor and menu have changed and they not only are unaccommodating for requests  but they police your food order and change it to what they want to do. I tried to order one of their skillets and requested my eggs be over easy and was told they don't do the skillets with over easy eggs. Scrambled is the only option. So I decided to order their grill sandwich: egg, cheese, and peameal bacon on a biscuit. Again, ordered the egg over easy. I specifically said I wanted the sandwich messy. Was given a sandwich with the egg over medium and was told the cooks won't cook over easy because they don't want people making a mess.  \n\nTo have a go to breakfast place not accommodate a simple request for over easy eggs is unacceptable. They have lost two long standing customers. \n\nSo if you are the type of person who likes your yolks runny, go somewhere else. They're afraid you'll make a mess.
