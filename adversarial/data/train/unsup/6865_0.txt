ABSOLUTELY THE VERY WORST CAR SERVICE.  What is more awful than buying a car at this dealership - having it serviced.  Charged $ 1,500.00 with the car returned in much worse shape than the condition prior to service. Just wanted a tune up.   Now the Check engine light is on, the car electric system is not working properly, we must manually open and lock the car as the remote key no longer works, leaking oil from a damaged oil pan done at their facility, and brakes are misaligned.  UGH- If they were trying to damage my car you were successful.  Would I buy a new one if that was the goal.  NEVER FROM THIS MONEY SUCKING SCAM OF A DEALERSHIP.  RUN AND DONT EVER EVER EVER HAVE YOUR CAR WORKED ON HERE.  I now go to a local garage.
