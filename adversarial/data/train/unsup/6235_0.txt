I had a dog with me and there was no parking in the front, so instead of blocking in other patrons, my friend and I drove around to the back and parked in a spot. My friend who waited in the vehicle was yelled at and then a come-to-find-out manager (never even introduced himself as an employee...) came and pulled me out of line (mind you, we are two girls driving cross country and it was 345AM) and told me I had to pay a $100 dog deposit and that I couldn't wait in line (after 10 minutes and there's only one person in front of me now) because I must move my car to the front and BLOCK other patrons cars in. After he yelled at me for where I parked, I left, and they charged my credit card even though I didn't even check-in. Now I am being accused of having two dogs and trying to hide them by parking in the back where there was open spots?? Disputing charges with Wells Fargo. Do yourself a favor and go to America's Best Value Inn. The staff over there are awesome and will not try to bully or physically intimidate you!
