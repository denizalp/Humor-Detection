This is my go-to restaurant when I'm craving some quality sashimi. Service is always friendly and prompt here. I've tried the lunch bento boxes and some of the Korean soups which are pretty decent. For this particular visit, we came here on a Friday night and we were seated right away as it wasn't very busy around 8 pm. We ordered the assorted sushi and sashimi (30 pieces for $29.99). It came with miso soup, salad, and Korean banchan which were japchae and sweet potatoes. I enjoyed eating the sashimi more than the sushi, as it tasted very fresh and light. Portions were big and filling. Overall, I'd highly recommend Gal's for people looking to grab a quick and satisfying meal!
