This is a great hotel, but as far as aesthetics goes, I wasn't sold, ....HOWEVER, the service here is impeccable!!! They wait on you like you're some kind of sultan or something. They even give you free bottled water as you wait for your valet, lobby, or anywhere for that matter! OH, and it's super close to Wet Republic---a PLUS!
