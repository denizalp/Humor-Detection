Called to schedule everything but still had to wait 2 hours to shoot one mag which was especially frustrating because obviously, like most people were visiting and have other things to do which is why we called in advance. Everything is over priced but the service made up for it. The girls in the front were very nice, our instructor was also great, but our favorite was our driver, Guy. We got on the shuttle upset about time wasted waiting 2 hours but he made us forget all about it with a warm welcome, great suggestions, and great conversation. He should be considered an asset to the company. I would go back just to visit with him again! Thanks Guy!
