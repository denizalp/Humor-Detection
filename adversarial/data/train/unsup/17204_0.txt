***ROOMS AWFULLY OUTDATED & POORLY MAINTAINED***\n\nI recently came here with wife for a 2 night stay on a Thursday and Friday.  When we arrived to check-in at 1:30 a.m., there was a 15-20 minute wait.  The hotel was out of the standard rooms, so we were upgraded to a suite.  However, when we went to the suite, we were terribly disappointed.\n\nThe room smelled musty, like it had poor ventilation.  It was creepy because it looked like no one had been in the room for a long time.  The suite was poorly lit and ill-configured.  This may be because it was at the corner of the pyramid.  In the toilet was the feces of the previous guest.  There were two HVAC units in the suite: one did not work and the other we could not turn off. \n\nThe bedding was not soft to the point of being scratchy and rough on the skin.  We checked out after 1 night.  We did receive a full refund, including of the resort fee.  I would avoid this hotel. If you want to spend the same amount of money on the strip nearby, consider Excalibur.
