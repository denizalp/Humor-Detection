This was my second visit to Thai Street Cafe. I chose this place because it was a short drive from the strip. I had family from out of town and wanted Thai for dinner. \nWe ordered the typical spread of food such as egg rolls, soup, shrimp pad thai, orange chicken and 2 different fried rice. I must say, with the abundance of Thai restaurants around town, this place did not meet my expectation for taste. I prefer my usual Thai places I frequently dine at, which are located away from the strip.\nThe Tom Kha soup is my favorite Thai soup. I like my broth w\/ a more coconut milk taste. This soup did not deliver. On the other hand, the wonton soup was pretty good. Both soups were served in smaller pots compared to other places.\nI preferred the taste of the chicken fried rice over the pineapple fried rice. We ordered 2 orange chicken. This was unanimously the least liked dish. The orange chicken sauce was too strong. Shrimp Pad Thai was ordered mild (not spicy) but it still came out too spicy. The same happened with the Tom Yum noodle soup. \nThis place is conveniently located near the strip and prices are decent. While this is not my first choice when I think of Thai food, the atmosphere and service makes up for it. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but we all know it's not possible on Yelp.
