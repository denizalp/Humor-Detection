Wow! This place is thee \"Las Vegas\" for little kids,  located in Henderson.  They love it here & didn't want to leave this place.  So many things for them to do & there was so much screaming,  bouncing & running around here. I left with a migraine, wishing I had brought my flask & my son & his cousins didn't want to stop jumping & running around.  They all knocked out in the car which was WONDERFUL!
