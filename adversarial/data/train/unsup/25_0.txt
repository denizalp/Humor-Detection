I didn't want to give this place a one star review but I ordered online for them to deliver to my hotel....they knew it was a hotel and they did not bring any utensils. Not even chopsticks. I had to eat rice with my hands. \nThen they did not bring me a receipt which I specifically asked for because I was on a business trip. \nThe food was extremely bland. Seriously I have nothing good to say about this place.
