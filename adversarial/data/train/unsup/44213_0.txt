Ohhhh Wok Wei how I constantly crave your orange chicken!\n\nHave eaten here probably 6 times now and never disappointed.  Usually get the orange chicken that is not only filled with orange flavor but an amazing garlic flavor as well that is simply just delicious and perfect every time.  The menu says it is spicy but I have never tasted the heat with this dish so don't worry about that.  If you order the dinner combo it is like $1.50 more for lo mein noodles, a cheese ragoon, and egg roll which are all worth it.\n\nThe pineapple fried rice is also a favorite!  I always want to try something new here but cant bring myself to missing out on the delicious orange chicken!\n\nVery reasonably priced as well and if you dine in during lunch time they have great prices on lunch specials for a large portion of food!
