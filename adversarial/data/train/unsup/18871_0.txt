It's a 3.5 for me....\nHere's the short end of it:\n1.  The menu is pricey--even the kid's menu.  \n2.  The food is delicious (have the burger or pulled pork sandwich) and is prepared perfect.  Out of 13 entrees, every person in our party loved their meals.  \n3.  The service is dependent on who you get. Over the course of a 7 day convention, we ate there 3 times. All the male servers were completely nice and friendly. All the female servers couldn't be bothered and kinda had chips on their shoulders.  We ignored it, but it was really noticeable all 3 times.  \n\nI would definitely go back the next time we are at the MGM. It's great for happy hour and\/or any sporting event!
