It's fine as a car wash - hasn't got tire clean or air dry options like the best in class shops, but gets the job done - but what kills it for me is their terrible weak vacuums. They swallows up your money but an 80 year old emphysema suffering hooker could suck better than their vacuums do. Terrible. Oh and super loud while not doing the job. That's a bonus,  Not. \nSo you get half the job done fine, the other half done poorly, but you pay full price for both. They'll need to fix their vacuums before they'll get me back.
