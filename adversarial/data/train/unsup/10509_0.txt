Two words: SMART METERS! SRP is on a huge drive to install smart meters, even though several public health departments have requested a moratorium until the health effects of electomagnetic and RF radiation can be studied (see link below). Utilities are claiming this is the same radiation produced by microwave ovens and cell phones and therefore it is safe. It is NOT the same thing, this is PULSED radiation which may be more dangerous (my husband worked in electronics for 40 years and has researched this topic extensively). \nWhen we got the notice that they planned to install the meters, we called SRP and requested to opt out. The SRP customer service rep argued with my husband on the phone and finally stated that they could do that for a charge of $20\/month to send someone out to read the meter each month (some utilities offer this option at no charge). We agreed to that charge, but the charge labeled \"Field Visit Fee\" is actually $21.86. The first month they actually charged the fee even though they never even read the meter--the bill stated that it was estimated because the meter was not read! We are still be charged the \"Monthly Service Charge\" of $15 as well (which covered reading our meter for the last 40 years). \nhttp:\/\/www.sej.org\/publications\/tipsheet\/many-are-claiming-health-problems-caused-smart-meters\n\n10\/30\/2012 We found it odd that our SRP bills had $21.86 charge for reading our meter every month, yet it seemed like every other month there was a note on our bill that the meter was NOT read, just estimated. When we called the SRP supervisor states that they have NO intention of reading our meter every month and that the ACTUAL CHARGE for reading our meter is $40!!! They just break it into monthly installments of $21.86 to make it easier for us to pay the bill!!! You have got to be kidding! We are highly disappointed that SRP chose to roll out a smart meter program before the scientific evidence was in and instead chose to use their customers as guinea pigs in a large uncontrolled experiment.
