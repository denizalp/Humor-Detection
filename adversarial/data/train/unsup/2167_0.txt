As a woman, I often feel like gun store employees treat me like I'm either of no consequence or a 'noob'. The guys at 2nd Amendment didn't dismiss me out of hand just because I'm female. The first time when my husband & I walked in I was greeted warmly and asked specifically if there was anything I was interested in or wanted to see. I just pointed at my husband & said, \"I'm with him today\" but it didn't stop anyone from including me in the conversations (and it's not because I'm a hot mama in sexy clothes - I'm dumpy & middle-aged, lol).   \n\nThis morning, my husband & I went back to buy the gun we were looking at. We got there first thing when they opened, and the gentleman behind the counter (he's older, w\/a beard - I suck at getting names) was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. \n\nMy only complaint is the same as everyone else - they need more stuff! For a shop their size (it's tiny), they've got a decent assortment of rifles and some handguns, but woefully little ammo - and a very limited collection of holsters, cases, and straps. \n\nI'd personally love to see this shop really take off - as long as everyone can keep the fantastic attitudes and customer rapport going!
