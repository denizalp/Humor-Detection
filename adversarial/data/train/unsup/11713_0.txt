My friend called me last Saturday asking if I wanted to get some brunch at Le Petite Triangle. We went and there was a wait as usual. I flipped through some bookmarks on Yelp and we decided on Miega. There is a weird false door with a crazy face on it. Don't try to go through that one or else you will look dumb as we did. There was a martial arts class going on across from the restaurant which was cool to walk past and see. The interior of the restaurant is contemporary and very clean. The music that was playing was awesome. They had some Korean sounding hip-hop which reminded me of an album my brother gave to me for Christmas in '97 or '98 called Bomb Worldwide: International Rap Compilation. I love to hear rap music from other countries. The service bell on the table was very cool. I am definitely not the prude I once was and now really enjoy Korean food. My favorite dish was S15 Gal Bi Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob. My friend and I both agreed that this was one of the best brunches ever. My little hangover was gone immediately.
