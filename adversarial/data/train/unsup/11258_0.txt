Holy shit this place is gross!\n\nMy parents saw the waiter drop my fork and spoon while I was away getting my second plate. All the waiter did was put it back up on the table. Right in fucking front of them!\n\nThe meat of the crab legs appears to be made from cheap, unhealthy crabs with very poor meat inside. Also DO NOT EAT THE CLAMS! There are alot of clams that remained closed after being cooked, that means the clam actually died BEFORE it went into the pot, which can be a dangerous vector for food borne illnesses.\n\nAnd for $12 a person for this kind of crap? Stuff that is unsanitary and can potentially kill us? \n\nMom and dad told me later that they were really sick, but me and my brother were fine due to our precautions.
