First time was GREAT thought i had found my new spot nope 2nd visit no call ot text saying who i requested wasnt there. Then they stuck me with some maria girl who asks how i want my brows done and proceeds to hand me a stick. First off ur the professiona i came to you to do theml. My brows are pretty easy theres a shape n all she had to do was clean them up n trim them. Not happy very very disappointed
