\"i'm ready for my close up... wait the wind blew off my face while i was dancing on the rooftop!\"\n\nGREAT PLACE to dance, well, maybe not in march when the wind was tearing up the joint - literally, the heat lamps were tore up!\n\ninside is a bit cramped, but hey, how else do you get to know strangers, spank their asses, dance on someone's toes, snap photos of unexpected victims while blinding your friends, and think \"i'm sure glad i'm not that go-go girl dancing up there in 6\" heals... you know her feet are barkin.'\"\n\nsorry no photos, i sighed an oath!
