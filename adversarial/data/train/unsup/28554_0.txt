Salty salty salty! Holy cow!! This was just okay. Had the Low Country Pouttine.  Sirloin, fries \"cheese curds\" gravy and an over easy egg. They obviously do not know what cheese curds are. This was like melted mozzarella. I asked for the steak to be rare and it was as tough as well done. Aweful meal. But, we're talking airport food here so I guess we should set the bar low. Really low. Definitely wouldn't order again. $19.99. I should've stuck with a cheeseburger I guess. Next time. Also, glass of wine = $12.75 for a normal size (9oz) and this is the cheapest on the menu. They offer a 6oz for less but, really? I've never even heard of a \"six ounce pour\". WTH??
