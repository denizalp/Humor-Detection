Great food nice people! We just kept ordering stuff that I am sure the owner was overwhelmed by the five us entering his establishment. If your in the area you should definitely come in. Tips no restroom so don't get too comfortable. It's great to get to go orders but we stayed there too smell the goodness. The prosciutto and Italian cheese is by far my favorite where the wife and kids love the chicken pot pie and Cesar Salad. The spinach and feta is also the bomb!! Go and ordering something you will love it!!!!
