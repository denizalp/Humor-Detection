Food was amazing. Had a larger group and everyone loved their meals! Biggest downside was the service. Slow waits for our server to come back to our table for refills, take the order, clear and bring boxes.  We had to order for one of our people when they ran to the bathroom. As she was coming back the server was about to walk away and we wanted to confirm the side for her sandwich. The server turned around and rolled her eyes and asked if she had to repeat the side options. We couldn't believe it! Two of us had to ask for refills. When we asked for boxes for our food, she never cleared away empty plates or asked if we were ready for the check. I really want to go back because the food was so good. But man, our server really is making us second guess going back!
