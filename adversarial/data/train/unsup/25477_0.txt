Stayed here for my friends 21st. *drool* we stayed on the top floor in the huge suites. we had a huge master bedroom, two bathrooms, a Jacuzzi tub, two shower head shower and three TVs. VERY nice :]\n\nI felt bad for the maids because we kind of trashed the place but at least we didn't break the door like someone down the hall did. \n\nThe beds were really comfy and the room was always cleaned whenever we left.\n\nBut they treated us like Kings & Queens except when we lost our key card. But i saw Questlove and posse it was really nice. Id definitely stay here again!!
