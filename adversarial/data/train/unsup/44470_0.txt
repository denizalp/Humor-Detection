Second visit to Sweet Moses this past weekend.  The first time I had the sundae that comes with a brownie and banana foster ice cream.  It was enormous and sooo good.  This time I had a cone with peppermint and coffee ice creams.  The peppermint was good, but the coffee was amazing!  My husband can't get enough of their homemade caramel sauce.\n\nThe sundaes aren't cheap, but they're pretty big.  And the atmosphere is worth the extra expense, in my opinion.
