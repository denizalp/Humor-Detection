I know my burritos and there's nothing \"burrito\" about what this place serves up. There's also nothing \"subway\" about what you want to get here, for what they *do* serve are some awesome warm wraps with freshly prepared,  flat-grilled skewered meats which were tender as heck, and if I had to guess, marinated. Yes, they have veggie stuff too, but I was in meatatarian mode.\nThe place isn't meant to be pleasing to the eye...the walls are painted yellow, the ceiling is sky blue and there are faded black & white posters of the new york skyline on one wall while the wall in the back actually has a faded photo of a sub.\nDino, the bearded Greek guy who prepares your hot skewered chicken burritos, has been working at New York Subway for fourteen of its fifteen year existence. The only other patron I talked to has been coming here for ten.\nWhat else is there to say?
