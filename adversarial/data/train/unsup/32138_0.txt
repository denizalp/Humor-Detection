THE GOOD:\n\nThe staff has been courteous the few times I was able to speak with them. \n\nThe screens look nice, and make the home cooler. (However, there was no decrease in the power bill.)\n\nAfter installation, Eunice contacted me to check on my satisfaction with the work. (However, further developments revealed that this is merely a meaningless formality.)\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nIt is very difficult to contact the office. The staff contacted me after a few weeks of signing the contract regarding the homeowners association application. They did not contact me when the screens were ready to install; I had to call them, and for once, someone answered the phone. \nAfter Eunice's followup call and two emails, I was not contacted until a man was at the gate making a requested follow-up visit. I was not home, so the visit was unsuccessful. I never heard from anyone again.\n\nThe finished product is very, very crude in that the holes drilled into the wall for the break-away lock are unfinished, and drywall chipped off the inner wall were left that way. This compromises the insulation, allows possible water seepage in extreme rainfall, and makes a nice entry for insects.\n\nThough the office claimed the sliding door screen would have a threshold, it was not true. Therefore, security is seriously compromised.\n\nInstallers are not careful with laminate flooring.\n\nThey are eager to get you to sign off on everything because it relieves them of accountability.\n\nTHE CONCLUSION:\n\nI would not do business with Olson Iron again. They lost further jobs from me. I do not recommend Olson Iron.
