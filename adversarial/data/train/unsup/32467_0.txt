From the mocha to the special to the vanilla bean dessert.....GIDDY UP!  So very delicious and all served with a smile plus a little bonus....a sampling of their amazing cereal.  This was my first time at the Crepe Bar.  Shouldn't have waited so long.  The only reason why I can't rate this higher is because of the cramped quarters.  Hope you'll expand soon, Crepe Bar!
