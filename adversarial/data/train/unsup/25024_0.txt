Bit Disappointed; a lot of their food was either a bit too salty or bland or oily. The buffet is overrated... did not even bother trying the desserts. Not a huge fan of buffets to start out with because their quality always disappoints but I would rather much pay $10 extra for the Bacchanal buffet at Caesar's for much much better quality, presentation, ambiance and variety.
