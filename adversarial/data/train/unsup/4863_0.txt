This was my first half marathon, so I do not have anything to compare it to. I did watch my husband run the full marathon last year but obviously, there is a huge difference between spectating and participating. \n\nEven though I have no other races to compare this to, there are definitely some things that I could tell needed to be improved on. \n\nI had only been training for about a month when I decided to sign up. When you register, you have to include what you expect to complete the run in. I went with a rather long time to be safe, in hindsight that was a mistake because I got stuck with a bunch of people that were walking. \n\nI get it, all sorts of people want to participate in a fun event and some can only do so if they walk the entire 13.1 mile course. But walkers need to move to the side of the street. Trying to maintain a certain pace while having to dodge ladies in tutus and angel wings walking 4 abreast SUCKS. \n\nPerhaps having fewer people per corral would help with this? And actually ensuring that people were in the correct corral? Or perhaps next time I just need to estimate that I will finish faster, even if I won't. \n\nRunning along the Strip was cool... Running along the residential streets between the Strip and Fremont Street, not so great. The streets in this area were not lit up enough. \n\nMy biggest issue with the race is that I never got any Gu!! Apparently the sole aid station with Gu ran out before we got to it. For a race that states that one of the participant perks was going to be 'plentiful course support'  this was ridiculous. Frankly, only one Gu station for 13.1 miles isn't what I would call 'plentiful course support' but zero Gu stations for many runners is just unacceptable. \n\nFor the cost of entering, I was left a little disappointed with the race overall. I love the medal, and am happy that I got to experience the race but I am not sure I wold pay the money to do it again.
