Came here for dinner, waited 30 mins for food. Worst service ever, nobody has ever refill the water. The udon was good; however had to ask the server to check our order after waiting for 35 minutes. But after we finish with our food. They brought the check very fast. \n\nHorrible experience on Christmas !!!
