So, a friend and I were going to try Varrati's pizza. She had come all the way from New Kensington to visit me...\n\n...only to find that Varrati's didn't open until 4pm. It was a little after 2. \n\nThank heavens for swerves in itineraries. We were meant to come here. Fate would allow nothing else this afternoon. \n\nI saw Franco's Trattoria, just a few blocks up. \n\n\"Let's go there,\" I said. \n\nWe walked into the posh establishment, and a distinguished older gentleman, perhaps the owner himself, greeted us as he dined with a companion. \n\n\"Seat yourselves,\" he told us. \"Anywhere's fine.\"\n\n I felt a little slovenly in these surroundings with my jeans and AC\/DC t-shirt on, yet our wonderful server (a beautiful Italian-fashion-magazine-cover-bound girl named Jennifer) told us when I asked about our casual attire, \"Oh no, you're fine!\"\n\nOnce again, when you eat anywhere Italian in Pittsburgh, even if you're an Eastern European\/Irish mutt like me, you feel at home. \n\nBesides, a little kid ran past me in gym shorts and an oversized tee. \n\nEVERYTHING we had was divine and brilliantly plated. I wish I had brought a camera with me so as to snap some pics of this gorgeous, gorgeous food with flavor and personality for days\n\n\"Angry. Look angry. Give me pouty. Pouty, that's it!\" \n\nYeah. Drop dead knockout food that should be against the law. It would make a grown bon viviant cry. Cue any other cliched hair metal lyric about hot chicks you can think of.\n\nI really wasn't sure what to order, but oddball me likes to make meals out of appetizers and salads.  So it was...\n\n...the masterful calamari. It's hard for me to pass up that deep fried squid. Even seeing tentacles doesn't deter me. Hell, I wanna see them! They were breaded expertly, were perfectly al dente, popping in my mouth as I chewed on them, that marinara sauce dressing the squid up in culinary love like it was Madonna in 1985.  \n\nYou remember that song. Don't lie. \n\nAt the same time, I was served something called Crab Joseph. I love crab, but I had no idea what Crab Joseph was supposed to be. Here it was a sweet, light, cold, lemony salad of sorts with greens, tomatos, scallions, shrimp and plump, juicy chunks of jumbo lump crab meat.  A jones for crab and a sense of adventure can take you to Paradise. \n\nMy ladyfriend dined on her Ravioli and let me try one. I got jealous. Until they brought out the Victoria Salad anyway. According to their menu, it has \"baby field greens, candied pecans, apples, gorgonzola cheese and raspberry walnut vinaigrette.\" Oooh yeah. That viniagrette and the candied pecans made the salad as far as I am concerned, but the apple more than held its own. It was exotic, a sheer and sweet delight. \n\nWe had plans to go to an ice cream parlor about 20 minutes away until our sneaky waitress showed us the dessert menu. \n\nYou should have seen my tiramisu. It was ART, for the eyes as well as the tongue and stomach. It was light and rich at the same time with just the perfect blend of rum, coffee, and whatever cheese they use (marscapone?).  It was a clinic in confectionery. Eccellente! \n\nMy friend could not finish her Three Layer Chocolate Cake, so I came in to save the day. Normally I like my chocolate cake rich and gooey, but this dessert made the case for a chocolate cake that doesn't need to be overly sweet and dense to be delectable, and it was more than delectable. In fact, it was as angelic as a chocolate cake could be. It should be served with a halo above it. \n\nPlease take a date here, or if you're of the fairer species, beg to be taken here or drop some weighty hints. \n\nHow many times did I ride past this classy, awesome, yet moderately priced place o'er the years without seeing it?  Ãˆ scosso il mio mondo!\n\nAnd to think all we came out for was some pizza.
