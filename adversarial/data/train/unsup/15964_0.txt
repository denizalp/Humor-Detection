This company sold my younger sister her car. She was silly, and did not call family for help to understand the loan. This company was working with Chase Auto Loans and offered her a horrible loan that was essentially a trap. \n\nWhen she finally \"fessed up\" to the bad decision she made, I called the dealership to ask how they could ethically offer this kind of deal to young buyers. When I asked to speak to a manager she was \"to busy\" to talk to me, and I got som sassy remarks from the finance person during our conversation about the issue.\n\nI decided to yelp about my experience in the hopes that some other young buyer might see this and avoid the same mistake.\n\nSummary:  Beware what you sign up for at this dealership. Bring someone with you when you buy because they are definitely looking out for their own interests with little regard for their customer!  You should be responsible, and informed as a buyer but that does not excuse loan sharky bad behavior by dealers and banks!\n\n\n...shame on you Avondale Nissan!
