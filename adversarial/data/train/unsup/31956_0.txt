Walked in and walked out at 9:15. There were a bunch of people just standing around, presumably waiting for a spot at the rotating bar, because there were plenty of empty dining tables.\n\nI did not like: \n\nNot being greeted for over 5 minutes while I was there - it appears that is the way they operate there by choice, if it just seemed like poor customer service the rating would have been one-star\n\nPersonally handwriting my name on the waiting list, I noticed that on the whole list I would have been the only party of one out of like 20 names.... I honestly didn't feel comfortable with that!\n\nNo bar to sit at, just a rotating sushi bar
