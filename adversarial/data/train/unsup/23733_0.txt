I can only comment on the 'barber' side of things as I went in twice to look at razor blades and shavers. According to searches on Google, this was the only place in the GTA that sells Merkur safety razors. The issue I had was that both times the salesperson behind the counter seemed to have no expertise (I don't think he actually uses brushes or double edged razors) so I was left making a decision purely based on price point. I also asked to see if they sold Feather razor blades (sharp, high quality blades from Japan) and he nodded and promptly handed me Personna (dull, cheap, meant for first time shavers). He was friendly, however if I was to do it all over again, I'd just stick to eBay as I get my blades for even cheaper now from a supplier in Quebec with far more expertise.
