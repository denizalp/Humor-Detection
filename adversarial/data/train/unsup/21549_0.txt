This place brings some new excitement to the PV Mall area. Menu includes Grilled Burgers, Sandwiches and delicious sides such as Fries or Onion Rings. They even have several Fresh Salads as well Shakes, Malts, and Sundaes.\n\nInside is very clean and the service is quick and friendly. Seating is somewhat limited and it can get pretty busy. Just bring a friend to eyeball a table while ordering. Tables turn rather fast.\n\nCheese Burger, Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger, No Pepsi and a side of Onion Rings. Triple CB with everything actually for me. Wife did the single Charburger and some Fries. Super COOL condiment bar with a great selection of chili peppers and hot sauces to jazz things up a bit. Helped bring it up a notch or two.\n\nBurger were pretty tasty but lacked something. Seemed as if the burger patties were made ahead of time and possibly frozen before cooking them. Tasted a little too lean or dry and did not melt in my mouth like I was expecting. Maybe I just like my burger a little more greasy and smashed. Ha!\n\nWould be nice if you had Hot Dogs added to the menu. You got the grill going already and who doesn't like the DOG. Maybe should also consider getting rid of those outdated flashing beeper thingys that tell you when you order is ready. The number system works fine and you do not have to rewash your hands after returning it to get your meal. Hmmm?\n\nGive them a visit and check it out. ORDER UP!\n\n3.5 STARS
