5 Stars on a Monday BECAUSEEEEE ---- HALF PRICE SUSHI! The entire sushi menu is half priced which includes apps, sashimi, nigiri, and all sushi rolls! Started with the White Tuna appetizer with a cilantro jalape√±o sauce, which was THE BOMB! It was so good that my coworker & I both ordered an additional one (why not - it was half price). I got the Rainbow Roll, but I'm not a fan of California rolls, so they allowed me to substitute the California roll portion for spicy Tuna - which earned an A+++ for both the roll & the substitution allowance. I also got the spicy salmon roll which was also good. The service could be a bit better, but everything else outweighed that. Definitely come here on a Monday night!
