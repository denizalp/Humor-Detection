I've ordered the carnita tacos, the carne dilla, and the bean burrito and this place never disappoints. The tacos are moist and flavorfull, the dillas are filled to the brim, and the bean burrito was bigger than a chipotle burrito! The chips are amazing and the salsa and guacamole have the perfect amount of spice.
