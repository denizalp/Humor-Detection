Dropped in on a sunny saturday for an early diner.  We were warmly greeted and seated on the patio.  Service was prompt and polite.  We were pleasantly surprised by the food; good salad, solid pasta, nice veal.  A worthwhile stop if you are exploring little Italy in Toronto and looking for a quick meal on a sunny saturday afternoon.
