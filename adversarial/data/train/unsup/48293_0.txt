This salon came recommended by a few people so I gave them a try today for a gel manicure and I'm pretty happy with the results. The salon is clean, staff is friendly and chats with you a bit, and they take their time instead of rushing your appt. to get to the next person. They also have great, competitive prices and tons of color options. Happy to have found a good nail place!
