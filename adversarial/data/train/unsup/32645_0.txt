I really like this place and have been there to many times to count but quite frankly last night me and a person I've been telling about this placed stepped in to have a drink and a bite to eat but left after the first drink. The customer service\/unfriendlyness was very off putting being that I always get nothing but positive vibes from this place not sure if Ill be back but hey we just headed over to joes midnight run and the experience was more enjoyable!
