My first cirque du soleil show in Vegas! It exceeded my expectations and I was in awe and engrossed by all the moving stages, props and tricks for 90 minutes... Well 70 minutes to be honest because the beginning was kind of slow...\n\nAlthough it does start off slow the rest of the show is captivating and beautiful. The stages are very dynamic and constantly moving and transforming. The girl twirling the baton (?) was incredibly skilled and fun to watch and the wheel with the two guys balancing and running was terrifying yet captivating and exciting to watch. Another one of my favorite moments was when a bunch of different acrobats were flying across the top of the stage while giant caterpillars etc were climbing up. We had prime seats and could easily see everything; there were also people flying above us. The costumes and makeup were beautiful and really contributed to the aesthetics of the show.
