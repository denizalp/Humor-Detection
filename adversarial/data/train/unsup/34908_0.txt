I've just returned from the intro \"try scuba\" class ($50). If you are on the fence or don't know what to expect about a certification this is perfect. \n\nWe spent about half the time learning our gear and getting fitting outside the pool and half the time swimming around. \n\nThe class was just myself and my husband, not sure if others were larger. The personal attention was impeccable. I was set at ease as we progressed from 4ft to 6ft to eventually 15ft. \n\nThis was a gentle intro to what can feel very overwhelming. Our instructor was patient, knowledgeable and kind. \n\nThe hot showers in the locker room made the visit in winter a lot more comfortable
