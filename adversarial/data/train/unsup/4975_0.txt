I finally have had a few selections at FEZ now and feel I can throw in my two cents. I like this place. It is sort of in an unassuming place along Central Ave, next to a FedEx store. The interior is pretty damn cool though! They have a bar up front with some high top tables. What I like is, the bar is sort of separated from the rest of the place by some smoked glass partitions. There is ample seating inside and on the patio, with also a small loungy area. \n\nThe dishes I have tried are as follows: the douxelle burger, the arugula and shrimp pizza, some sort of fried chicken sandwich, and of course, the sweet potato fries. The burger is really tasty, but I will say it can be a bit salty. Not sure what did it. The pizza was really good. It had a cream sauce on it, so if you are not hip to the bovine milk steer clear. The chicken sandwich was good, but not amazing. The sweet potato fries with apricot aioli? Holy Shnikes!!! The cinnamon and salt on the fries are like a celebration in your mouth! They are worth the price of admission. \n\nThe service has always been spot on and have never had any problems. I have been with a big group and small and they had no problem accommodating the big one in the lounge area. Candy, I believe, has been my server two times and has been fun and bubbly both times. Thomas S even comes over to say hi. Nice touch! I had my first amaretto on the rocks here. Fell in love!!!
