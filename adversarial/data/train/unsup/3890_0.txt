Really nice sports bar. Went there when I was in Scottsdale to watch my Texans play. The food overall was outstanding! The wings were delicious, the pizza was wonderful, and the brownie skillet was rich and flavoring! And the overall atmosphere of the place was so great, it makes me want to make a sports bar like that! Love it!!!
