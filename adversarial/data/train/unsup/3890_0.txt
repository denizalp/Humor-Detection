Alright, so... I've got mixed feelings about this venue. \nThe first night that I got to experience the place was at a work get-together. had 2 lanes reserved, and our director ordered a spread of food for everyone. We just had to pick up our own beer tabs, which was cool. We liked our wait staff that night 'cause they were all nice and checked on our group throughout the night, despite minor hiccups and confusion as to whether or not we'd be able to split our bills. \nSecond experience was for the Grouplove concert with the fiance. Got to eat at their restaurant area with cool and attentive wait staff again. Food was good, not great that makes me wanna go back, plus I was kinda disappointed with their beer menu (not that big of a variety). Bartenders around the concert floor were nice and on top of it - no long wait to get a drink nor was there trouble getting anyone's attention. \nMy only hesitation was the set-up of the bowling lanes. LOL. The walkway honestly kinda sucks going between the sofas and tables, trying to take your turn at bowling. Also didn't really appreciate how the concert started about an hour after the advertised time with the opening bands, but that could be my lack of experience going to concerts. Even then... Do I get irritated with the band(s) or the venue for punctuality?\nOverall, 4-5 stars 'cause of the awesome staff.
