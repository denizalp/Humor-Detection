\"That secret that we know that we don't know how to tell\"\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nIn A Sentence™\nIt's where one finds the most inexpensive petrol in the valley.\n\nQuick Review™\n+   Gas, cheap (relatively).\n\n+\/- Cash. You pay more with a card therefore those points for the trip to Hawai'i (aloha, motherfucker!) aren't worth it.\n\n-    It's practically in Henderson: so there's that.\n\nKEY: \n+    Positive observation\n+\/-  Neutral note\n-     Negative observation\n\nEmployee of Excellence™ \nName unknown: whoever put up the sorry, no smoking inside sign. WTF.\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nIt is just petrol. Unfortunately, we all need it and as a whole are addicted to it. It's cheaper here. \n\nPro Tip: No service or transaction fees if purchasing from cashier inside with cold, hard -- or inversely soft -- cash. \n\nPro Tip: It is adjacent to Star Nursery. Make a turn into the side street instead of directly into Circle K off of Eastern and you'd mitigate your collision rate significantly.\n\nPro Tip: Don't drink and drive. Don't smoke and pump. Don't play on your fucking fancy phone and pump (electrical micro-spark could blow this whole shit up). Don't even stay outside when pumping; get inside your goddamn motor vehicle and hold your partner's hand. \n\nNo tourists come here -- naturally -- especially since it's practically across the street from being zoned for shitty Henderson. \n\nNot good for kids*. (*Kids can't pay for fucking gas.)\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nRating: Five-stars, \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"\n\nEpilogue\n\"We'd all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum, though.\"
