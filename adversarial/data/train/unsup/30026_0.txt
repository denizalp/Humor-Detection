Very organized, and well-run business.  The offices are clean, and the staff is very helpful in providing information.  This is one of these new businesses where a client naturally has questions about the state of the art science behind it.  They do a great job of explaining the science behind it, and what you can expect results-wise.  I highly recommend Blake and his team.
