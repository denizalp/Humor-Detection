An old stand-by, obvs. As far as \"cheap\" sushi goes (meaning about on par price-wise with any other non-fancy sushi joint downtown - about $35 all-in for dinner for two), the quality at New Gen is better than many, plus it's nice and clean. I have no complaints. Super polite, efficient, pleasant to be around at mealtime, music playing softly - basically, the opposite of the actual new generation. *shakes cane*\n\nI'm sure previous reviews have covered everything you need to know, so I'll give you something new: the doubt-inspiring Cheese Unagi Roll (with eel, avocado, cucumber, tempura bits, and some sort of fluorescent yellow Kraft-esque fromage, $7.95) is GREAT. Try it if you're adventurous. If you're not, a) let's not hang out, and b) everything else is fresh and tasty too. Lucky you!
