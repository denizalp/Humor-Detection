A very different take on Chinese food in China Town. I was very keen to try lt.  I read about this joint on blogTO last week and a friend suggested we try it last night.\n\nApparently when the British colonized Hong Kong a whole bunch of cafeterias serving polyglot Cantonese British food sprung up and are still very popular to this day.  Hence the unusual dishes on the menu like Duck with Red Wine Sauce , Pork with Tomato Sauce and Borscht!\n\nThe interior is great, ripped benches and we'll just well loved shall we say.... Service was very friendly. My friend described the dish he had wanted and the waiter knew what it was. \n\nDecent place if you are in Chinatown and want to try something very different from the norm.
