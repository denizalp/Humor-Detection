In the world of pizza aficionados, there are two things that can get the saliva glands going: the words Napoletana and San Marzano tomatoes!\n\nTo be labeled a Napolatana pizza, one needs to be certified either by APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napole- tani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana).  Trust me, this is a good thing.\n\nIt means a wood burning dome oven heated to at least 850ºF.   Second,  #00 flour, San Marzano tomatoes, all natural Fior di Latte or Bufala mozzarella, fresh basil, salt and yeast -- only fresh, all-natural, non-processed ingredients.  \n\nWe came on a late Saturday afternoon two weeks ago and sat outside on the terrace.  We order the Beef Carpaccio di Bressaola ($13.95) and Bruschetta ($5.95) for appetizers (see photos), along with their Regina Margherita pizza.  \n\nThe day was dying and we enjoyed the lazy pace of our meal.  Nothing was rushed, though the wait staff kept a watchful eye on our progress.  At 850ºF a Napoletana pizza cooks in a couple of minutes!\n\nThe Bruschetta was yummy and sweet, with a hint of garlic.  While the Carpaccio was as we like it, with a fair amount of greenery, some shaved Parmigiano Reggiano and EVOO.  Both, were very good.  As we were finishing, our table was bused, and our pizza arrived .  Perfect timing.\n\nThe Regina Margherita pizza ($12.95) came with a perfect mixture of tri-color from the sauce, cheese and basil.  It glistened with a sheen from the tomatoes and you could smell it as it was placed on the table (photos).  What was also nice is that it wasn't burnt.  The pizza maker timed it perfectly.  WOW.  And, it tasted as good as it looked and smelled (photo).\n\nFor dessert we tried the Bigne al Cioccolato ($7.95), one was vanilla, the other chocolate (photos).  They were like large cream puff profiterole, but with a  custard filling. Delicious. \n\nThe bill for two came to $45.80, plus taxes and tip -- which was more than fair given the wonderful meal we enjoyed!
