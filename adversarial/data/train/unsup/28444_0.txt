I love this place and stop in whenever I'm flying out of Charlotte.  Excellent choices from a great wine list.  And the cheese plate is awesome.  The environment is pleasant and upscale, and the service is excellent.  Such a nice change of pace while on frequent travel.  I do wish they would provide a taste of wine without a charge, however.
