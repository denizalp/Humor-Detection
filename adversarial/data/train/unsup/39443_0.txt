This club is small and intimate. Came here on a Friday night to watch ARTY and boy did I have a blast!!! There wasn't a lot of people so there was room to dance. Dancing space could be an issue if its packed. Tons of space to sit down outside. They closed the outside area around 2AM so it got really hot inside. OH! There are only 2 bathroom stalls in the girls bathroom!! Such a long bathroom line. Bartenders had some attitude but overall, I had a good experience. Will only come back if its a DJ I want to see.
