Before I came to this place I stop by two other shop, \"the source and Blumm\" both of this shop were busy people in line with bad vibe, I'm in a point of my life that now I try to avoid places with bad vibes..just and I don't like that atmosphere in my life...\n\nNow  the apothecary is a different place, you can feel the love here it felt like home. This very nice girl took care of me she was amazing she was a nice human being.  \n\nThere's so many people walking around with hate in their heart and I'm here to tell you everything is goin to be ok man just take 3 gummies and you goin to be ok. I love you all
