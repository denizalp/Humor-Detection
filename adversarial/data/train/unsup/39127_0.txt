The last time we went to this Claim Jumper, we were interrupted during an intimate conversation by the server, who went into an annoying and lengthy sales pitch about CJ gift cards. Who wants to have to sit through that while trying to have a nice quiet meal?\n\nWe overlooked that today and went back, and guess what? The server balked when I ordered fish tacos and asked for the seasoned fries as one of the choices for side. She told us that even though the tacos are listed on the menu under the Sandwiches category, which lists several choices of side dishes that automatically come with the order, the fish tacos aren't included in that option. What? There is NO disclaimer on the menu that says \"...except for the fish tacos.\" Then when I insisted (because the menu specifically SAYS side dishes come with the items on the list, DUH!) she pointed out that rice pilaf comes with the tacos, so would I like to omit the pilaf in favor of the fries? What is she, the Carbohydrate Police? No, I would not like to substitute fries for the pilaf. I want both of them just like the menu indicates. I like both rice and fries, thankyouverymuch. Then she said she'd send the manager over to talk to me. Fine, send him. He arrived, squatted down next to our booth, and proceeded to examine the menu for errors. Nope. The menu is clearly misleading, and I was clearly entitled to the fries with my tacos if I so desired. He left and twenty minutes later our meal was served. Strike number three, the corn tortillas on the fish tacos were so tough that my husband could only eat one of his tacos and I had to discard the tortillas and eat the fish filling with a fork. We brought home leftovers for the dog and cats, meanwhile vowing to NEVER EVER go back to Claim Jumper again. \n\nWhy go to Claim Jumper anyway, when you can just go to the freezer section of your local supermarket and buy CJ products, and save both money and aggravation?
