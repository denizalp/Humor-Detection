Went for Pumpkin Blizzards, every other Dairy Queen in the world holds them upside down, this location couldn't as they are usually a little meaty before they hand them to you.\n Parking is small but I've never seen it full. Getting out of the lot us problematic, if you have good karma someone will let's you in.\n They keep it clean but it's one of the oldest in Vegas and never been remodeled, an Old Vegas feel with antique car pics.\n They have cakes you can just grab and go, I've never tried one, we usually go to Baskin Robbins.\n The staff is always very young. Most of the time they are VERY friendly, but check your order, in case a newbie forgot spoons or fries.
