I've tried to like this place.  I like the look of it and the location.  But the food is mediocre and the service my last time... awful.  Food brought out was not what I ordered.  Bartender got in an argument with my girlfriend on her drink preference.  A lot of details I'm leaving out, but we are not hard to get along with.  We just happened to have a bartender with attitude.  When we sat down, the guy already at the bar was leaving and we noticed he left the bartender a $1 tip on a large order.  I should've known then.  I'd be happy to talk to management rather than leave a review, but I have not heard back.
