What a great place to eat after spending a few hours rock climbing for the first time. I was starving! I ate outside which has a really great area to relax. It's right on the LYNX blue line so there's a lot going on in the area. It's tough to find parking so it's best to scout the area before heading out. The front of the restaurant is facing the tracks so you won't be able to see it if you're trying to find it. You have to walk before you see it.\n\nI suggest you go with multiple people and have everyone get something different so you can try everything. There are so many different things on the menu it was hard not ordering it all. I'm looking forward to visiting again.
