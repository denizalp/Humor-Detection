All the prices you will find for pizzeria Bianco menu items online are conveniently listed less expensively than they are in the restaurant. \n\nIf you question the staff about the price discrepancies ($4+ difference for The margarita pizza for example) they will swarm you like African killer bees! \n\nI was continually told that my search on Google and Yelp and other easily accessible search engines were out of their control and there was nothing they could do about it. \n\nWhen I mentioned how easy it was to suggest edits to these inaccuracies, they proceeded to degrade me by calling me \"buddy\" \"dude\" \"man\" \"bro\" and using quite a aggressive tone when I did not reciprocate such a manner.\n\nNow, about the pizza... It's good. If you've traveled much, and tried pizzas around the country and even around the world, as I have, you will find this pizza to be unworthy of the price, the wait, or the interaction with the rude staff. \n\nI'd absolutely never eat here again. I tried it 10 years ago and had the same experience. I decided to try to get out of convenience, but lesson learned! The shame is on me.\n\nAlso, do not try to place an to-go order over the phone. Even when you tell them you are walking to the restaurant, and you are in a rush, I need to save five or 10 minutes, they will take no mercy. They will just tell you \" we don't do that. You will have to come in.\"\n\nWell, at least I can appreciate the consistency of this restaurant. It's not about you, it's about them.
