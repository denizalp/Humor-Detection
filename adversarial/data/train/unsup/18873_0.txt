Okay okay, I can feel the backlash already. \n\nBut after all the hype about this place, I'm far from being impressed. But yet again, I'm not one to drive into hype. \n\nFirst off, why drive away customers with a sign that exposes a 60 minute wait time when you have a bunch of empty tables waiting to seat hungry patrons? and when we only ended up waiting about 25 minutes (as was everyone else in front of us and behind us), I automatically felt pretty bad at their potential loss of business for those that left because they didn't want to wait \"60 minutes\". I mean cmon now, this isn't Disneyland. Or maybe it is because one of the waiter's were obviously friends with a party that came in and went straight in to be seated. Fast Pass. Nice. But hey, it was only a 25 minute wait, so I can't complain. \n\nNow on to food. \n\nCuz this is what so many of my friends hyped about. \n\nI ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Okay. Folks- save yourselves and just head on over to Aloha Kitchen or Island Flavor. Now they know how to do it right. If you can't make your adobo correctly and expect to throw it into some fried rice and covered with a thin layer of egg- then don't even bother. Learn how to make adobo first- then try and throw it into an \"omelette\". \n\nBoyfriend had the Loco Moco. Please, don't even get me started. Even him- not being from Hawaii- was highly disappointed. Gravy was bland and so was the hamburger patty. Which meant-- no flavor whatsoever. Cmon folks. Get it together. \n\nAnd now...drum roll please...\n\nThe pancakes. \n\nMacadamia Pancakes. \n\nTasted like generic, boxed pancake batter. Not mixed correctly with proper measurement of liquids because it was dense beyond belief. Really? Pancake sticking to the roof of your mouth? What the? And I wouldn't even have known it was macadamia nut pancakes if I hadn't read it myself. The white chocolate chips on it was the only other flavor aside from \"batter\" that you can taste. \n\nRED VELVET PANCAKES:\n\nStrike me now babycake fans. \n\nLast time I knew-- red velvet pancakes is a touch of cocoa and chocolate. It shouldn't taste like CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES. Granted, chocolate chip pancakes are delicious (elsewhere-idk about here), but to have chewy and dense red velvet pancakes that don't taste like it? Not acceptable. \n\nSo now, I'm going to leave my little experience to an anomalous fluke because people seem to love it here and their red velvet pancakes. So maybe I just came in when they just weren't up to par. But I gotta review as I see and experience it. \n\nWill I go back? Maybe.
