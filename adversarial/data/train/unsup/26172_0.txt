I am a huge fan of this place. 7th district has always made me feel welcomed and I will continue to go.    \n\nOnly reason not five stars for me is I have not tried too much of the food and prices are high\n\nAll I know is tue-thur night is its drink special nights and I believe Mon. is its Crab leg night.
