Very good value for take out!! \n\nWe tried this place on a whim and with a craving for some Haka.  We ordered some classic dishes - cantonese chow mein, crispy beef, pakoras and spicey veggie fried rice.  All for $34... amazing price, and amazing food, too!   Portions were very generous, enough to feed 4-6 people easily.  \n\nWe ordered over the phone and picked up at a busy dinner time.  The restaurant itself was filled (which is a good sign!) and the food was ready in 15 minutes.  The restaurant really would needs a website and online menu. \n\nOtherwise, we'll be back and this may just be our new go-to Haka takeout in the Scarborough.  Cheers!
