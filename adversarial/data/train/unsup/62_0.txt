Visited the Luxor because of a good friend's wedding. Ok, get here and first thing the line to check in on a Sunday morning is ridiculous. There are like 4 desk clerks and 20 stations. So wait wait wait, I have to get off my feet so my husband says \"go on over to the bar and play a game and I'll check in, honey\". Well, then he comes rushing back in 45 minutes saying after all that time, they wouldn't let us check in because I did the reservation online and not him.. ARG. So over I go to complete the reservation and we had lost our place in the line from hell. So we wait. and wait. Finally we are allowed to check in. I tell the clerk our friends are staying in #53** east, could we stay on that floor too? \"Oh yes, no prob\". He assigns us our room and says\" OH you must go over to the M-CARD desk to get your MCard because you'll get so many discounts and a gambling credit for every time you gamble on our properties\". Great idea, I think.\n\nI get to the M Desk and the line is literally 40 people long with 2 clerks.... What tha?? If this is supposed to be so great, I better wait, right? I wait..... I wait..... I wait.... And I'm not moving. You know why? Because the desk also serves the VIP people who ALREADY HAVE THEIR M-CARDS\" and whatever they need they just butt up to the front, coz that's how it works. WHAT THA??\n\nMy husband is about to divorce me and I'm not backing down - I will have this coveted M Card if it's the last thing I ever do! So FINALLY, I get up there and they take literally 20 minutes getting every detail and aspect of my existence they can gather, give me the card and tell me \"see you when you win and cash in on your points!\"\n\nTravel up to what we thought was our room ~ well, because our check in card said it was ~ and cannot find the room number on the floor we were assigned. WHAT THA?\n\nA super nice \"floor person\" from the hotel scurried around and determined we were assigned a room corresponding to the WEST tower but the clerk (mind you I asked for the East tower coz our friends were there) wrote down EAST. Flip! My hub is tired (not thrilled with my 1 1\/2 hour detour to the M Desk) and now we have to travel BACK to the front desk to get the right room assigned? The nice \"floor person\" (these people need to make a living wage, just saying ~ they were the ONLY personal who gave a crap about our visit) let me contact the \"manager\" via a hallway phone and that \"manager\" assured me if I went to the LL level North check in desk, I would not have to stand in line again. GREAT!\n\nK - we get to the LL North desk and I'm promptly (and rudely) told to get to the back of the line (which was long and clerks were scarce) because \"you don't have any right to be in front of these people\". Well, ok ~ maybe she's right in a way, but those people haven't been wandering around the planet looking for a room that doesn't exist (or so I think) and afterall the \"manager\" I had on the phone said no problem, just go up there and tell them I put you in room \"53**) and you will be expiated.\n\nSo, Hubbie is fuming (as hubbies will, I'm sure you get it) and (I'm sure because the steam-from-ears and a red neck is a sure sign) so we drag our (thankfully on wheels) luggage all the way thru the casino back to the front desk and confront Jason, the wonderful guy who checked us in. \"Jason!! Dude, that room does not exist!\". \"Wha??\" So he attempts to obtain the focus of a \"manager\" (term used loose -ly) and that manager says \"Wha??\" and it takes her literally 30 minutes to come back from the cubby-hole in which they escape into to tell us what we already knew. \"Jason made a mistake and wrote down EAST when he meant WEST\".  \"Yes, brain-flippin-child, you are so right. Thank  you for researching that..\" I hope her parents did not invest in a college degree, this one...\n\nFINALLY up to our room after a triple-lap jaunt around this grand palace, liking the room, it's \"fine\", not bad, pretty good, I'm thinking. Plop down, bed's not horrible, it's pretty giving. ERG. There are a total of 3 flimbsy pillows for 2 \"major pillow hog\" people. (We're not hogs, just like 3 pillows each ~ is that wrong or unusual? I don't think so\". So I'm starting to forgive this bunch for the check-in line, the M-Card ridiculousness, the \"running all around the resort\" trying to get our correct room endeavor, so Hubbie says \"can you call to get another 3 pillows, my lower back hurts too.)\n\nWell, when Hubbie starts complaining about this so early into what should be a action-packed weekend, I'm on it!\n\n\"Hello, housekeeping, I'd like 3 pillows, please, I prefer no down pillows, as hubbie is allergic.\"\n\n\"Mamm, no ~ you can have 2 pillows only. That's the rule from the hotel.\"\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n\n\"WHAT THA?\" Just 2 pillows? Question; how many pool towels do we get?\n\n\"Oh, Maam (again with that label) You'll get at least one pool towel if you wait in line and show your card!\" Thanks alot, that's really sweet..\n\nSO..... letting it all go by the wayside, we decide
