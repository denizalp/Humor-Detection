Received a resume full of grammatical errors that I needed to comb through in order to correct. There were sentences that made no sense which gave me the impression that she perhaps doesn't have a lot of experience working with folks in Silicon Valley with really crazy jobs where one wear multiple hats. \n\nI think one thing that ended up not being helpful is that I ended up speaking to her assistant and after receiving the first draft, it was obvious he didn't quite understand all that I had stated during our phone call. So it ended up being a waste of time and got a subpar resume as a result. \n\nLong story short, I kept the basic structure of the resume but fixed and reworded most of it. She also did my LinkedIn update and it was a similar experience. \n\nCan't say Ill use a service like this again :\/
