By far one of the best restaurants in Toronto. Staff is fast & friendly, chefs are great, and the food is amazing. I have not been disappointed with any of the menu items.\n\nThe flank steak wrap is like a gourmet steak dinner wrapped up all in one.\n\nMenu is very healthy, fresh, and unique. You will not be disappointed!
