Place was clean and good the food was pretty good. Orange juice was really good fresh squeezed. Cucumber flavored water. I got bacon eggs and hash browns with. Pancakes the pancakes weren't my favorite they tasted like from the box but okay. The orange juice was my fav. Waitress was nice . They took long to notice me at the bar cause I was alone. It took around 4 for them to even say hello. Which is why I gave a 4 hospitality is very important for this type of restaurant. . I would come back they have interesting items on their menu.
