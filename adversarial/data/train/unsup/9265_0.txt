I'm rating this place with one star because I haven't even been there and already will never go there. This morning I called to ask about how much their oil changes are and this was my conversation with the worker:\n*Ring*\nWorker: e motors...\nMe: hi I just wanted to ask how much an oil change was,\nWorker: 19.99. After tax 22 (or 24, can't remember) .99\nMe: okay. Thank u\nWorker: yup *CLICK*\n\n\nSo rude. Not ever going there
