Fantastic wine list, even by the glass! And a classy menu, too.\nI was travelling alone, and was able to score a small table next to a wall outlet so I could charge my laptop while I enjoyed a couple of glasses during my long layover.\nMy filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and I was able to order a $37 GLASS of amazing pinot.\nThe service was attentive and prompt - which is always appreciated in an airport, when people are running tight schedules.\nI'll definitely return during every layover I have in CLT!
