Javier at Redstone Roofing did a great job repairing the roof. This home was in the process of being sold and some shingles were missing. Not a BIG job, during the monsoon season. So most roofing compaines were very busy and did not have time. Javier responded to my inquiry immediately and communicated with me to schedule a time to assess & complete the repair in a very timely fashion. I highly recommend Redstone Roofing for their professionalism, timliness and willingness to help when we needed a quick fix. Also, the price was reasonable.
