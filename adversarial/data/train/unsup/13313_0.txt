\"I can't be on the cheeseburger diet all the time.\" - Bobby Flay\n\nThe wife told me she had been having dreams of being in a relationship with Bobby Flay so naturally I reacted by taking her to his burger place in Las Vegas. That's reverse-psychology or something, right? It must have worked because she wasn't interested in his burgers (but she still loves watching Bobby Flay on The Food Network). For me, I had a decent lunch. \n\nI got the Bobby Blue + Bacon Burger and shared The Undecided (half order of onion rings and hadlf order of sweet potato fries). My burger was cooked perfectly. I admit that it was under-seasoned but the blue cheese, bacon, the chips (I got it Crunchified), lettuce, and tomato worked well together. If you love blue cheese, this burger is for you. The onion rings and sweet potato fries weren't anything special but it allowed me to try the carousel of sauces.\n\nOverall, it was a nice lunch before checking in to our hotel room. It sits right on The Strip so you can't miss this prime location.
