While Lotus of Siam remains as part of our Thai restaurant rotation,  Komol has been added to the mix.\n\nThere are three dishes we always have to get-\n\nThe Herbal Salad is HELLA GRUB!!!-if you haven't tried this one yet, get it the next time you dine here, you won't be disappointed!\n\nI love me some green curry, but Komol's Panang Curry has got me HOOKED!\n\nThe Pad Thai is perfection as well, and twice the size of Lotus' version.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we also tried the Orange Shrimp which was pretty solid! Looking forward to our next visit...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(69\/365) \"All Thai'd Up\"
