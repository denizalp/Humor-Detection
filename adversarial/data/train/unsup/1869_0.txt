I've had three experiences with M&M.  Unfortunately two of three were not smooth and easy and I've since taken my business elsewhere.\n\nIssues I had with them:\n1)  Underestimating the cost of the repair  - nothing like being quoted for an $800 repair and then being told after they have it torn apart that they didn't realize my car was the \"Sport version\" and the real quote is $1600.\n\n2)  Delays in getting the repair done.  Promised on Tuesday, tried to pick up at lunch on Thursday.... (See #3)\n\n3)  When I went to pick up my car, the repair was faulty - it looked like the paint wasn't dry when they put the bumper back on so it was rubbed off.  REALLY?  Come on guys.  Pay attention.  Don't waste my time to pick up my car during work hours if it's not really ready.\n\n4)  Finally picked up the car Friday, forgot to put gas in the rental, in the rush to juggle my schedule to meet theirs.  M&M promised to gas up the car for me.  Was I surprised when I saw a $40 surcharge from the rental company?  (I called - it was for gas!)  \n\nNo integrity, no customer service = loss of my patronage.  I've moved on to another company for my body work needs.  THEY have been incredible.
