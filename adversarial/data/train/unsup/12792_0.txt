The Encore comes in as Wynn's younger, hipper little sister.  \n\nIts definitely more modern than the Wynn, but with all the upscale amenities that you would expect from a Wynn property.  \n\nGreat water pressure in the showers, comfy beds (from what little I slept) and nice views of the strip or golf course.  I recommend getting higher floors to escape the pulsating beats of the clubs below.  \n\nThe reason for only 4 stars is the lacking customer service.  I don't know about you, but when I go places I expect killer customer service, maybe because I'm in the service industry myself, but NO should never be in your vocabulary when dealing with clientile. \n\nWe unfortunately lost some stuff and getting it back was a nightmare and hoop jumping, run arounds and the like were enough to get my blood boiling.
