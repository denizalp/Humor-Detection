Disclaimer: I am not accustom to dropping $85 for a meal unless it is a special occasion.   This is a very high priced joint.   Notice I did not say overpriced, you are paying for a premium.   This is all local food, wine and craft beer.   In fact, if you look at the supplier list, they are all at the Davidson Farmers Market.  \n\nOkay, here we go.   Nothing about Fork is average.   Ultra classy and upscale.   The setting in the old house, front room bar and outside wrap around porch dining are perfect.  The staff rates top notch.  Awesome setting for a romantic date.\n\nFood.  My fellow Yelpers, I read most of the reviews and ordered exactly what everyone recommended.   Spicy chicken eggroll, pork chop and lobster mac n cheese.   I even got a side of ghost chili.\n\nI can honestly say 100% without a doubt, it was the most tender, juicy and flavorful thick cut pork chop that I have ever had the privilege of devouring.  The ghost chili rocked my world, on a scale of hotness 1 to 10, it was a 15.  Eggroll just spoiled me, the local Chinese aint got nothing on it.   The lobster mac n cheeses had cheesy flavor explosions on my taste buds.\n\nSadly I will not go back, but I will miss it!!!!!!
