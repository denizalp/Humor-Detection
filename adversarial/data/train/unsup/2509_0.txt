Worthy of the hype. Wait for Saturday lunch wasn't too bad just after noon, line itself isn't that long but goes a bit slow. Employees are working hard with smiles on their faces, though.\n\nBut you come here for the food! \nThe three meat plate is the best value, and the portions are huge- this is easily split between a couple, add on a dessert if you dare. The HOTLINK is \"easily one of the best I've had,\" says the BF. We both thought the RIB TIPS were amazing, and were both a little pickier than necessary about the BRISKET- blame our time in Texas for that, but it's still lightyears better than most other versions here in Vegas.\nThe sides are pretty solid, too: the COLLARD GREENS are seasoned well with meat and onions mixed in, but the MAC AND CHEESE wins all the awards here- it's one of the best versions I've had outside of someone's home. The CORNBREAD and PEACH COBBLER also were really good, and clearly homemade.\n\nMenu is small, but everything we tried was really well executed. Location has some limitations, but I like the down home style. I'll definitely be keeping it in mind the next time a barbecue craving hits.
