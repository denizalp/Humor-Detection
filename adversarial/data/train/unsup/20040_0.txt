A colossal disappoint for the beginning of our epic bachelor weekend in Montreal. My group was so excited to get a reservation at this restaurant and didn't know the sadness that would follow. The menu, first of all, is hidden under a dim light with ineligible cursive writing. Their trick is to let the waitress come over and suggest the plates for you to order. She of course suggests the meals that are either expensive or the food that is probably overdue and they need to get rid of. In our case, we were all poisoned and it ruined our night and the next day as well. Disappointment all around for us. \nI hope \"Joe\" is proud.
