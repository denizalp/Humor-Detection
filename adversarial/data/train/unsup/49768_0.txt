I purchased a DealSharing voucher with a valid voucher # & deal ID #. I called the listed telephone number well in advance of using the promotional offer to learn about the different locations. I acquired the contact information for my nearest location, called for the staff, validated the voucher, noted the exact location, operating hours, and inquired about a treatment I was interested to have, etc.. \n\nMonths later, when I had an opportunity to use the voucher (which, by the way, had NO expiry date listed), I called the head office to RE-validate the voucher and I was repeatedly ASSURED and GUARANTEED that, in fact, there was NO expiry date. I called my nearby location, and they invited me to fax in the voucher so they could open a file. I did so. \n\n2 or 3 days later, I visited to inspect that same clinic & follow-up about an appointment in the near future. Immediately, I was told that the clinic staff would not honour the voucher. The extremely rude lady at the front desk argued with me for over 25 minutes before demanding that I call the head office again. I did, and the male customer service representative asked me to pass the phone to her. I did, and she spoke to the man in a manner to mislead him about the validity of my (already validated) voucher. \n\nShe succeeded, and I was left completely and utterly ripped off, with absolutely no recourse. I called back the head office \/ customer service line to inquire (from the same gentleman) about why my PRE-PAID promotional offer had been suddenly withdrawn, and after about 10 minutes of sheer nonsense (while I pressed him to support his position with facts or legitimate reasons) he SWORE at me & HUNG UP the telephone!\n\nJust an entirely TERRIBLE experience that I wish to NEVER endure again!\n\nF-
