Food is really really good and fresh! The gyros are always so tasty and really stuffed! When we order the platter, which comes with 2 gyros of your choice, I'm usually stuffed and will eat the second gyro the next day. Great food!\n\nDelivery people from Uber Eats are just awesome! Food arrives quickly and our order is always complete. \n\nWhy 3 Stars? Let's just say the last time I ordered directly from the restaurant, the little girl taking my order was super rude and arrogant. I guess we will have to find another good gyro place near my home.
