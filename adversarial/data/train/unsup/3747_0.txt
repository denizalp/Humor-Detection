Being half Asian myself (Filipino), I of course love Asian cuisine. In my almost 50 years of life, I have had mixed experiences when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine. However, and thankfully, Vietnam Grill was definitely a PLUS! From the outside, it looks kind of ordinary. But don't judge this book by its cover! The inside is much nicer than the exterior suggests, and the food is the star here.\n\nTo start, we had the Cha Gio (Crispy Spring Rolls). Now one thing to keep in mind about Vietnamese is that they are meat eaters.....more so than other Asian cultures (with the exception of Koreans who love meat as much). These spring rolls reminded me of my Mom's rolls, who stuffed them with plenty of meat. This one was loaded with pork, onions and mushrooms. And were they ever yummy, especially with the Asian fish sauce (which we called Patis). \n\nFor dinner, my wife had the crispy pan fried noodles with beef, and GOD were those ever delicious! They loaded it up with beef and a wonderful brown sauce which were soaked up the crunchy noodles. They they topped it with lots of fresh Cilantro, and what a flavor rush!\n\nI had the Traditional Vietnamese Hot and Spicy Curry with Chicken. This too was good, but not nearly as good as what my wife had. Not sure about the \"hot\" part of this dish as I didn't think it was hot at all. In fact, I wouldn't even qualify it as \"spicy\" let alone hot. Still it was tasty.\n\nIt seemed like everyone around us was enjoying Pho. So next time, it's the flank steak and briskett Pho!\n\nOverall an excellent meal and I can't wait to try their Pho!
