How does this spot only have 3 stars? Yelptern Megan H and I visited tonight for some late night eats, and it was everything I wanted it to be. The restaurant had easy enough parking, the food came out super fast (it felt like five minutes), and the inside was clean and comfortable.\n\nI was also glad to see that they had a full page vegetarian menu. I'm not a vegetarian, but I often feel bad when Megan and I eat out- by default I tend to pick carnivorous places, and I always feel like she ends up eating a piece of lettuce. The menu had a great selection all around. It felt like a good choice! Bring on the meat for me and fried tofu for her.\n\nOh, and hi, bubble tea! I was so happy they had so many flavors. I had the watermelon bubble tea and I would definitely get it again. Along with the beef pho, I was totally full. The portion of pho was huge and came with a giant plate of bean sprouts and limes (probably one of the biggest at all the pho places I've been). Overall, our visit felt quick because the service was great. I'd absolutely come back soon!
