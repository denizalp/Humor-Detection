Armando's you are now a big suckfest. I used to love you...no more. About a year and a half ago I used to come here frequently with a coworker. The food was always unhealthy as hell, but delicious. \n\nI moved jobs, so I hadn't been here in a while. I decided to go back for lunch today, and relive some of that old deliciousness. Didn't happen.\n\nI know this place is a dive, so I didn't expect the moon, but my service and food sucked!\n\nI walked up to the counter to order, no one else was waiting which was great. I stood there for over 5 minutes, and neither of the two women working even spoke to me. One looked at me and went back to the drive through window. She gave one car their food, then another one pulled up and she gave them their food. Then brand new car pulled up, and she gets on the intercom to take their order. I was there before that 3rd motherf*!@ing car! The other girl only comes up to the counter, after a guy eating at his table comes up to a counter for a refill, which she gets him, and still doesn't help me. By the way, his friend came up later to get a refill, and they tried to charge him for it. When he told them his friend did have to pay for his refill, they just told him he did have to pay. They were both drinking soda...how shitty and lame.\n\nI honestly could have overlooked all this bullshit if the food was like it used to be. It wasn't. I ordered a chicken, bean, and cheese burrito and an iced tea. The burrito had no cheese, almost no beans, and huge chunks of super dry, flavorless chicken. The only good thing about it was the tortilla. I threw out most of the chicken, and mainly ate the tortilla. I basically paid $5 for a tortilla. \n\nIf I wanted gross food, I would have done the cooking! The reason I eat out is because I want food that is better than what I could make. I will never be back to Armando's, not even if they beg me, which I'm pretty sure they won't. Besa mi culo Armando's!
