When I called this morning and spoke with Rosie my intention was to get right in because my body was so drained. Rosie asked me what my body was in need of. I appreciated that. Rosie suggested Mia, but I wouldn't be able to get on Mia's table til 6:45 pm verses 10 am. I was cool with the late appointment because Rosie assured me her style is what my body needed. \nI got there just in time. Sue, the owner greeted me with a warm smile and gorgeous blonde dimensions in her hair. The energy in Elements waiting area can not be bought. The energy there is so real and forceful that you want to sit and breathe positive vibrations as you wait for your therapist. \nAaahh, Mia...she welcomed me with this blessed energy that she applied to my body along with lemongrass lotion. I told her the energy I needed to remove and her unique blend of Reiki and Massage did just that.\nHer touch had me release energy that was taking up space and being selfish to the shift of my life which needed space to receive new energy.\n Thank you Universe for allowing me and Elements to now be therapeutic friends.
