This is, hands down, my favorite breakfast place in metropolitan Phoenix! The service is always great and the food is just amazing. \n\nI made my boyfriend take me here today for my birthday and he was very skeptical. He ordered the New Mexico skillet and just about cried it was so good (he really likes food). We live about half an hour away and he agreed that we could come back every week. :) I always get the two egg breakfast and it never disappoints. Eggs like a cloud, life changing hash browns, and the best pancakes in town. \n\nAsk to be in Willy's section, he's awesome.
