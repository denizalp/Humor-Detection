I come here all the time with my family. The food is cheaper than regular Hong Kong style restaurants and the portions are also bigger. I think the food is not bad. There are a couple dishes that are pretty stand out like the hainamese chicken with rice, fried chicken leg with rice, and their cheese and cream sauce garoupa baked rice. They also have a note worth wontons in their wonton noodle soup. Its the sort of place where you get the most bang for your buck.
