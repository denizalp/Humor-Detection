I grew up in Lakewood so I always thought Rocky River was dumb. I love this section of Rocky River by the bridge and the pink condos where Bernie Kosar used to live. A friend of mine jumped off the Detroit bridge to his death about a decade back so sometimes the bridge bums me out but like Led Zeppelin says \"I look to the west\" and avoid the memory trigger. Tartine Bistro is one of the best places to bring a date in my estimation. The interior colors are warm reds. The draft selection is mostly Belgian beers for around $6.50. The food ranges in price from around $10-$25. On Wednesdays they have live music.
