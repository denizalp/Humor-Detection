After a huge breakfast jus wanted something lighter for a late lunch, remembered the reviews of 9091 so decided to try it . I had the Korean beef torta(beef , lettuce,avocado, tomato, cilantro sour cream)  Came with a shoyu based sauce, hot sauce and salsa, on the side with some sweet pot fries. The sandwich reminded me of teriyaki beef sandwich's I  grew up eating in Hawaii. The sweet pot fries are really thin , wish they were a little thicker. I think next time will try the burrito or taco , like I said the torta reminded me of something I ate growing up in Hawaii so there's not the wow factor. Maybe I should get the burrito or taco for the wow factor cause never ate too many tacos or burritos in Hawaii .
