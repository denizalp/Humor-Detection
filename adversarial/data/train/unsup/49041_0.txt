The flavor was amazing! I was mad, they didn't fill my large bowl up and sad when it was all gone. I can't wait to go back. I had the black beans, jerk chicken rice, diablo chicken and red chicken. The only thing I didn't really care for but can live with was the texture of the chicken, it was kinda tough but I didn't care.
