The $3 greasy slices are delightful, and people go nuts for their panzos,which are essentially grown up, giant, extra-cheesy pizza pockets. \n\nHowever, their entire pie experience didn't quite live up to my pizza dreamz. The crust was dry and they were stingy with the meat. The sausage went under the cheese and was basically just pepperoni, and there was hardly any pep above the cheese. I did appreciate their cheese ratio, but it just didn't live up to the hype and my previous slice experiences.\n\nWill I give them another try? Of course. It's the cutest pizza place on the planet, and I'd like to try their veal sandwiches.
