Dead empty on a Thursday during happy hour before the Steelers game.  Just a couple guys playing video games.  Sign outside mentions $1 miller lites on Thursdays.  Except we found out that wasn't until 9pm.  And happy hour didn't start until 5:30 so until then Miller Lites were $6.  The bar looked nice inside but the bartender couldn't be bothered.  No thanks, 1 miller lite and left.
