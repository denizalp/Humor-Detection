One of the most sugary drinks I have had, with very little or no alcohol.\n\nI know this is a little DIY, but you could buy all the ingredients for a nice frozen margarita at the nearby Walgreens. You can even buy the half-yard plastic margarita glass, and make the best margarita to go, with the same experience.
