From just a combination of underwhelming service and mediocre sushi, I feel like this place deserves 3 stars. \nThe moment my sister and I entered the restaurant, it was quite busy so none of the servers greeted us. We only got a half hearted greeting from one sushi chef. Then we waited around 5 minutes for a server to get us seated, but we stood at the front counter awkwardly because one server was busy dealing with checks and talking on the walkie.\nFor the ayce, we didn't even get to look at the menu for 1 minute before the same server came back. He honestly seemed bothered with our presence and all the other servers kept eyeballing our table at first. (??) Throughout our dinner, they didn't come to check up on us to really see how we were doing but it was more like to pick up our empty plates. We were rushed to order more and rushed to finish fast. Not too enjoyable. \n\nWhen we got to ordering, the rolls came out very quick and there was one nice server who was good with refilling our water. \nOn to the food... the only ones that stuck out to me were the Who's Your Daddy appetizer and the First Kiss roll. The other rolls tasted similar and was quite lacking on the eel sauce for those that we ordered with eel sauce. But then halfway through our dinner, my sister noticed a hair in our soft shell crab roll.... uhh I know damn well that it is not mine nor hers because our hair is pretty long while that one was significantly short. \nSuch an inane experience, I won't give this place another chance.
