Features:\n-We came here on a Friday night for dinner with reservations and we quickly got seated near the back where the chefs were cooking.  The menu was easy to read and gave a lot of options (drink menu was aplenty).  We ordered the Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles dish with honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon (a little spicy), cheddar cheese waffle, and bourbon maple syrup (you can really taste the alcohol!).  This is what they recommended and what we wanted to try.  We had two big pieces and two small pieces of chicken with maybe six cubes of watermelon and two waffles.  The taste was good, juicy, soft, and flavorful.  I would definitely come back here again for the chicken but not order this dish (watermelon and waffles). Our friend just ordered Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken (1\/2 a bird with honey hot sauce) and it was only $26. The waffles were only okay but the bourbon maple syrup was really good, and very different.  \n-Aside, we had the skillet corn bread with cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, and maple butter.  This was also just okay.  It didn't taste fresh, and I did not taste much bacon in it.  I also tasted the mac and cheese which a lot of people talk about on yelp and my opinion is that it is delicious! I would order this again.\n\nImprovements:\n-Waffles had a very bland taste to it.  This was not my favorite. \n-Don't order the corn bread.\n\nTips:\n-CC and Cash accepted, they can split bills for you.\n-Make a RSVP as it can get really busy after 6pm.
