Not sure what took us so long to try this place. We just got take out but will definitely be back for dinner. It's small inside but very islandy with relaxing music. We had the jerk chicken, marinated pork burritos, avacado fries, and black beans. Everything was excellent. My favorite was the pork though. It just had so much flavor..  Can't wait to go back!!
