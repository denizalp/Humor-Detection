I only decided to try this place because of the $20 off coupon with no minimum purchase necessary. I think this steakhouse primarily gets their few customers from that offer for hotel guests \n\nGoing to a lot of steakhouses, I consider myself pretty knowledgeable with steaks. While their service is minimally decent, it could be better. \n\nTheir bread is served cold with hard, cold butter cubes. How can you serve cold bread with cold butter? Especially at a steakhouse! I do like their wheat bread with the cranberry and dried fruits inside, but hot and crispy would be more appetizing \n\nTheir steaks are cooked with the iron grill press and was served cold\/warmish. That's a huge no-no for me! Props for them not over cooking my steak, which is a common mistake that many steakhouses accidentally do, but serving a steak almost cold is unacceptable. Also, barely any flavor to the steak at all. I felt like an extreme raw animal carnivore tearing at a flavorless raw piece of red meat =x\n\nPros: \n-very fast service (both waiters and cooks work fast, hence, probably why the cold food) \n-$20 off (just get the flat iron steak 10oz for $25 and you have yourself a $5 steak hahahaha) \n-cooked medium rare and rare the way it should be (didn't over cook)\n\nCons: \n-cold bread\n-cold steak\n-poor seasoning\n\n2 stars for just the $20 off :(
