Items Selected:\nPumpkin Nut Bread\nSweet Cream Pancakes\nFrench Toast\nChocolate Marquise Cake\n\nLong on my breakfast to-do list, though not particularly close to home, Saturday breakfast at a space known by some as Omelet House and More, but by others as simply \"50's Diner\" saw the sort of food and scene that speaks of an era long past, and with the sounds of Chuck Berry and The King playing overhead it seems like no matter the name there are a whole lot of locals well aware that this place exists.\n\nOwned and operated by the same family for many years, and located just down the way from Boulder City Station, 50's diner is decidedly a lowkey operation that thrusts patrons back in time with d√©cor as well as smiley service as 'Please seat yourself' signage belies a sort of effortlessness that never seems put on, the dog-eared laminated menus speaking to oft ordered classics while specials rotate daily depending on ingredients and chef's whim.\n\nOpen 7a-3p Seven-Days a week, it was with a few questions answered that an order was formed, and omitting biscuits and compotes that were admittedly frozen or canned in order to focus on scratch made selections the first bites of the morning paired to repeat pours of coffee were of the restaurant's \"signature\" pumpkin bread, the flavor extremely natural and none-too-sweet with the sort of flavor that spoke to lots of butter, nuts, and fruit plus just a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\nUnable to resist pancakes that some have said to be some of the better ones in the city, but happy to set aside the pseudo-syrup in favor of 100% pure stuff from Indiana brought from home, the decision between sweet cream and buttermilk led to an order of the former and with a thinness that makes three a not-unreasonable portion for just $5.99 the light flavors and soft tooth are undeniably pleasant, the French Toast of white bread with just a bit of cinnamon egg wash and confectioner's sugar far less interesting and, as such, best passed.\n\nOffering any number of shakes, floats, malts, and sodas the dessert menu at 50's Diner is unfortunately limited to only two options and informed that the apple pie is bought from \"a local bakery,\" but assured the Marquise is made each night in house, a small rectangle of the graham cracker and chocolate compilation was ordered and with dots of whipped cream serving as garnish the flavor proved to be quite rich with a texture not unlike tiramisu, a nice way to end for just $2.99.\n\nFriendly without seeming fake and offering good food at an extremely fair price 50's Diner is certainly not a destination, but worth checking out if one is in the area looking for good pancakes and a whole bunch of omelets, the later seemingly quite popular with those at surrounding tables.
