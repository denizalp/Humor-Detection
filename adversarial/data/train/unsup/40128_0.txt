I cannot speak for all the Nothing Bundt Cakes locations, but the 17025 North Scottsdale Road location really takes the cake! (pardon the pun)! We live in Florida and ordered a cake for our sons 30th B\/D a week in advance so it was ready for pickup. We told our son on the phone to pick up his cake on the way home from work for one of his B\/D gifts. When he got there, they had no idea of a cake and balloons ordered for pick up! He called us from the N. Scottsdale Road location and asked us if we sent him to the right store and if there was any kind of order number, which we gave him while he waited for his cake. We should had known there might had been a problem because my wife called on the phone a week before and the person on the other end had the personality and customer service knowledge of a cinder block, But order and payment were taken. About 30 minutes went by and they come out with this cake that had a giant purple flower on it instead of the birthday items we ordered and no balloons that they knew of! They had no cake order ready for him at all! They not only screwed up the order, but the customer service was non existing as they did nothing for him as he waited there! After looking at other reviews from this location, most of the negative reviews were more about terrible customer service. They also answer Yelp Reviews with the same generic repetitive response, and not from any actual real concern. How do they screw up bundt cakes, when their only business is BUNDT CAKES?? And then just throw any flowered cake in a box and call that a completed order? Unbelievable is all I can say for our sons 30th B\/D! By looking at many reviews on this location, it's pretty obvious why and who's working there and \"not\" doing their job! Never again will this 17025 N. Scottsdale Rd. location ever get our business again! Terrible experience!
