I am new to the area and went to Kennel Care with my dog for the first time in November. They were highly recommended. The well visit went fine no complaints. Yesterday morning my dog was very sick. He had been up all night retching and had blood in his stool. I called Kennel Care to get him in to be seen at 9:30 in the morning. They said that although he definitely needed to be seen they were too busy to squeeze him in. They suggested I go to emergency which I did. \nI will never go back to them. If a vet can't see your pet in an emergency during normal business  hours I have no use for them. That is completely unprofessional. Perhaps those that gave the excellent reviews were never in  my situation.
