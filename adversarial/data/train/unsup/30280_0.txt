Long wait after check in, busy Resturant however food was great and service was very good and friendly. Our server Hernan made a great margarita and provided excellent service at our table. He made great recommendations and helped keep our 4 year old happy with lots of orange slices. \n\nI had the carnitas plate which was good. Others at our table tried fajitas, tacos, and enchiladas everyone stated they were happy with their food.
