Talk about a wonderful combination of different ingredients brought together for the most delicious Vietnamese food in Charlotte.\n\nWe visit Lang Van 3-4 times a year and yet the owner personally greats us and if she sees us coming in she orders our appetizer before we're even seated and it's always incredible.   \n\nThe food is inviting and artfully served.  The service is outstanding and never disappoints.  \n\nThe only negative is the location which is the ONLY reason we don't get there more often.  Had dinner there last night and still thinking how wonderful it was.
