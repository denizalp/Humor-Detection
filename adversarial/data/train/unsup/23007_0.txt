I came here for a friend's birthday last week and experienced the worst service I have ever received. I don't know why, but the waitress avoided our table like the plague. It took forever just to get drinks. We arrived late, after everyone else was done eating, so my friend and I just ordered a quesadilla appetizer to split. We had to ask for plates and silverware... which she forgot and then just gave us some paper cocktail napkins instead. We had also asked for a side of beans to go with the quesadilla. She basically snorted and laughed in our faces and then never brought them out. I understand if perhaps they don't serve beans a la carte (I don't know since we were never offered menus) but there was no explanation given. I have never encountered someone with such a bad attitude at a restaurant before. The other girls said she was like that the whole night. They all left her a bad tip but I think people like that don't understand that's a signal they need to do better next time; instead it just makes the chip on their shoulder get bigger.\n\nI am giving them an extra star since the food was decent and I liked they decor inside. We were out on the patio which was lovely. They had comfy lounge chairs and a fire pit. Its the type of place I would want to hang out and drink Sangria all night. I would definitely return if it weren't for our experience with this waitress. A friend who has been there before said she has had similar issues with another staff member on a separate occasion so its just not worth a return visit.
