I like this airport; I thought it was laid out well and wasn't confusing at all. The security people were actually pretty nice but the lines were crazy. I actually went to the secondary line, as the other one was long (according to airport personnel positioned by the door), but the secondary line was pretty freaking long too. Plus you go out the door, and across the drive, and then in an old seemingly unused part of the airport...I kinda wondered if I was in the wrong place...but I wasn't and eventually got through.\n\nIt really is easy to get around and it doesn't seem as huge as a few of the other airports I have been in. They have a few cool shops and of course everything is Steelers! They even have Pittsburgh chocolate at the bookstore. Oh! And they have a real bookstore in there...that's where I wasted my time waiting on my flight...it was awesome!\n\nOne thing they had which I thought was cool was the water fountains that had a tall spigot for water bottles. \n\nI liked this airport, but I also don't hate airports and don't travel much so maybe I don't know what I am talking about...lol But it's not a bad place, and any place that has a bookstore makes me happy!
