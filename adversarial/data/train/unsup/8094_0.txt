I have to say I'm not real happy with the way I have been treated the last few times here. I was having an asthma attack and the doctor had no clue what to do. The doctor released me when I should of been put in the hospital. I was at home after being released no longer then 30 min when I was rushed back not breathing and was put in the hospital. The first doctor should of taking better care of me and I should of never been released.
