\"The sensual side of Cirque du Soleil\" said in my Barry White voice...\n\nWhy oh why am I giving Zumanity only 3 stars???\n\n+1 star for spectacular visuals\n+1 star for some acrobatic feats\n+1 star for the \"Human Pretzel\" guy...ouch!\n+1 star for crowd participation\n+1 star for titties!\n\n-1 star for a number of corny midwest \"moms & pops\" type humor\n-1 star because the creepy french guy nonchalantly grabbed my wife's thigh as he walked by (I'd be willing to deduct 1\/2 point for the humor of it all)\n\nIt was a decent show but nothing compared to the other Cirque du Soleil performances. Lots of eye candy for both men and women...if that's important to you. \n\nMy wife and I also had the misfortune of sitting in front of a NASCAR bachelorette party from hell. They were hee-hawing and yoo-hooing throughout the whole performance...and everytime the Fabio-looking dude with the washboard abs came on, they were whispering out loud \"oh he's so hot!!!\" like little high school girls...dude, you had to see this cheeseball to know what I mean... \n\n...Picture the hair of Sandra Bernhard with the face of a young Elias Koteas from the movie \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" with washboard abs and huge pectorials wearing spray painted breakaway acid washed jeans...yup, ACID WASH JEANS...with some white pleather Chess King slash International Male tassel jacket...and to top it all off...drumroll please...WHITE COWBOY BOOTS!!! That's who they were swooning over.\n\nTalk about trying to hit the lowest common denominator.\n\n...and I tried to leave this mental picture in Vega$ but it just came back to haunt me...damn!
