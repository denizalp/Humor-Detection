Place is great, come here for the tortillas mainly but there plenty of other things on the menu that are good. Can be pretty busy at time, particularly around lunch time but the line is worth it. Staff is always friendly and fast at getting the food out to you. If you are craving some Mexican food then I'd go here. Grab a dozen of tortillas for home too. Won't regret it.
