I was in town with a bunch of friends and we really wanted to try joe beef! We had no chances of getting a reservation, esp it being july 4th weekend - there was quite a good amount of tourists in town! So based on yelp reviews we headed here!!! And i must say, it was sensational!!! \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant and was seated about 20 minutes later. They were packed as well, but we were real lucky! The 6 of us were seated in a far corner and couldnt see much of the menu ( oh, so the menu is all written on the walls with chalk!! No handouts period...) We were all a bit skeptical at first not knowing how to proceed. The person waiting on us was quite smug and almost condescending in the beginning... Let's jus say he was snobbish about his restaurant.  But as mentioned in another review, he went on to narrate our meal for the evening. Once he got talking, he mellowed down and got more friendly. The recommendations were epic. \n\nThe food is essentially tapas style... So u order a large variety of small quantities.. We had their take on chicken wings, mushroom and potatoes from the grill, a radish with special butter combo, some pic cauliflower from the grill, amazing red wines and some epic deserts... The amount of though put into the selection of flavors is mind boggling. Everything tasted amazing, and was their take on some traditional dish at times. \n\nIts a great place for date night.
