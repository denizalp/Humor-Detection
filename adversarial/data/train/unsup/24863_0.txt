I recently had the chance to try out this resto for breakfast located in the heart of our beautiful city! My expectations were exceeded! Loved, loved everything about this well reknowned resto and it deserves 5 star rating! Let's begin with the resto ambiance..as soon as you walk into this resto you are greeted by a super friendly hostess with a great big smile! The decor is absolutely stunning and glamourous creating a warm welcoming feeling. The moment you walk in , you get a sense of being transported away! At the end of the resto is the stupendous beautifully glass covered veranda overlooking the beautiful garden and pond. Nothing like having breakfast in a beautiful glass veranda creating a zen-like feeling. Onto the food, wow ...we tried the pain perdu and egg's benedict dishes as well as a side order of smoked home and basket of four warmly baked goodies croissant, chocolatine, raspberry tartelette ....every bite just melted in your mouth. Yes the prices for some of these breakfast dishes are quite expensive but they really worth it!!  This is a great place to celebrate an anniversary, wedding proposal, birthday milestone or a girls weekend outing! I recommend trying this out at least once in a lifetime! The resto is adjacent to the luxiourious Ritz Carlton hotel! You can walk into the lobby for a sneak peek! The egg's benedict were not like any egg's benedict...the hollandaise sauce was light and delicious! Yummy!  Reservations are a must!  Simply amazing foodie experience! Check out my pictures.
