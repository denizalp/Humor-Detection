I was offered one service  but when tech arrived  was told it was not possible  so more expensive service  was installed.  Service worked for 24 hours and went out. Another teck came out to fix it. They tried to charge me for their mistake. I am paying double. This was not offered. My phone and tablets often lose internet  I'm looking for another proveder.
