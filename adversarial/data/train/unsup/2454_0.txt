(note: I posted this review prior to realizing that as of earlier this week, they've moved down the street with their sister restaurant, Le Canard Mort. Hopefully the intimate atmosphere of the old place remains!)\n\nI almost hate to write a review of this place, because I don't want anyone to know about it and thus be able to keep this wonderfully intimate French restaurant all to myself and my husband. Every time we come here, it's not very crowded and we're free to make goo-goo eyes at each other over dinner without making anyone want to toss their moules frites. But, this place is too sweet not to share, so consider yourselves warned if you spot us in a corner, canoodling over crevettes. ;) \n\nStandouts here include the escargot poutine (yes, you read that right!) and the coq au vin. Both items are rich, hearty, and perfect stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. I also really like the duck breast with cassoulet, which is another hearty choice. The filet and frites are also good, but nothing special. \n\nThe wine list is decent; on the small side, but well-curated. The server, a lovely Montreal woman, sets the atmosphere with her lovely French accent and welcoming (if slightly frazzled) attitude. Food comes out reasonably quickly, and I've already blathered on about the romantic, intimate atmosphere. Highly recommended.
