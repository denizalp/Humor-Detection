Usually dont review places where I pay to sleep since most Vegas hotels do a decent job of accomdiating. My stay at the Cosmo was for business and was great for the most part. My biggest complaint was the handling of a major issue in my room...the shower. Wake up to get ready for work at 6 oclock and turn on the shower. Everything is working and then as I am about to get in, shower makes a hissing noise and shuts off completley. Afer fumbling with the shower knobs trying to get it to work i relaize the shower is not happengin today. I try the bath since at this time I need to get ready to start my day. After several minutes of messing with the water contrsols I realise the tub has no hot water, an improvement over no water in the shower yes but not what i look forward to in the morning.\n\nI call downstairs and speak to someone at the counter and let them know the water is not working. She asked to re-verify that zero water was coming out of the shower in the first place since it seems :hard to believe that absolutely zero water is coming out of the shower\". I explained that there is indeed no water and at thist ime I have established that taking a shower or bath isand making it to work on time and is not goign to happen. I go downstairs to complain and was told they would call me once they have a supervisor in to go over my stay. Its been 5 days and no call. Great customer service...guess they think im crazy, I dont expect a free room or to be made better than whole...jsut a call back apologizing would have sufficed. My boss who also satyed at the Cosmo encountereed a very similar experieince in his room...he happened to make it in the shower while it turned off though! HE will be posting a video so the Cosmo can re-verify the shower was not working during our stay.
