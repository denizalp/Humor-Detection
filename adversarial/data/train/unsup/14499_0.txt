I love coming here for soup and salad! The variety is good and the flavors are tasty. They always have two or three vegetarian soups for me to try. I also love their Mac and cheese so so much!! \n\nMy only gripe is the long wait times when it's busy. People take FOREVER figuring out what to get in their salad. Come on people, you should know by now! Same thing with the hot food buffet, they stare at it like there were millions of choices. Just get a small amount, take it back to your table, try it out, if you like it get more if not you didn't cause a thirty minute back up.  I'm only saying this because I got stuck behind an indecisive Sally and I was STARVING. I was ready to push her old ass out of the way. \n\nSorry for what I said when I was hangry.
