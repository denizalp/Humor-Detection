While I don't shop in Talbots, I do get to spend a significant amount of time walking around the store, or hanging out while my wife tries everything on.  This is not a bad thing at all.  In fact, she loves the clothes she buys at Talbots.  Sure, she looks great in anything, she tells me it can be hard to find clothing her size - and Talbots has lots.\n\nWe were in Toronto traveling, so her wish list had zero items on it.  With that in mind, we only bought three pairs of pants.  Since that day, I have declared two of the three her all time favorites as she wears them often.
