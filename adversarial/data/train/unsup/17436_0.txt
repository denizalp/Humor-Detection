I must say I will never enjoy Russell Stover or See's or Cerreta's again. W Xocolatl has introduced to me the BEST chocolate I have savored this side of the Mississippi. Only they use stunning presentation that makes these morsels ALMOST too neat to eat. Only they employ superb quality and unique flavors that keep me up at night pondering my favorite. Perhaps it was the white chocolate with a banana-almond praline? Nonono, it's the Cinnamon Spice with Thai chili flakes. Okay, definitely that, but the new summer collection has Earl Grey, rum, lavender, or scotch infused confections too good to pass up. You won't even need to try more than a couple varieties to realize why I've given it five stars. \n\nIf you can't make it to their location, they're distributing to some coffee shops in the north valley, but hopefully they can expand in every direction once they get settled in. I need my fix.
