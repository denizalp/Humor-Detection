What's in a name right? I heard Pita Jungle and thought of some 2nd rate mall food court dive in the back corner.. you know the one with the guy who has the really long armpit hair. A  trusted food blogger wrote a review about this place so I HAD to give it a try.\n\nWell to my surprise and honest delight this place didn't have one gnarly armpit to be found!! In fact this place is VERY sleek and sexy in its space.. the food super YUM-E! ((I do feel a little uncomfortable writing about food and armpits.. Im becoming far to self aware!)) The servers were all very attractive and their service very much fit the surroundings, clean, not rushed, comfortable and friendly.\n\nWhen I ordered the Medchilada the server warned me.. he said he had finished one barely and that I may not be able to.. I just looked at him and said \"hello!\" with 2 hand motioning up and down the sides of my belly! With that he smiled and placed my order though I appreciated the warning. When it came it I was stunned.. he wasn't kidding.. this is THE BIGGEST thing on the menu.. HUGE! It came with the most tasty side of brown rice Ive had! There was so much chicken inside it was falling out the edges.. I sight to behold though not quite a sight when you saw me trying to eat the thing. Id like to say that I have an unhinging jaw but even this was far to thick to grab and take in. All for 10 bucks, oh yeah! \n\nOh yeah!!
