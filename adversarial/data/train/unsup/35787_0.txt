This was a great dinner. Freshness was paramount. Each dish had unique flavors, creative combinations and exquisite presentation. The wait staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. A truly special place that believes in a fantastic dining experience while having social responsibility to maintaining and promoting sustainable food sources. Things to try are: Octopus, Big Eye Tuna, Green Papaya Salad, and the Dessert Sampler (Key Lime Pie to die for).
