I would give the place negative stars if I could. The owner, Kawika is a real piece of work. I was sitting in my car waiting for my friend to drop off his car for work. I dropped a cigarette butt on the ground, which i know was wrong, but this guy comes out of his shop, walks across the parking lot, holds the butt up to my face and starts shouting racial epitaphs in my face, asking who is going to clean up the butt i just dropped. I admit, i did not respond well, but he was just an all around jerk. I would not take a bicycle there for repair.
