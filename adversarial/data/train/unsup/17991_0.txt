Ramen flows in my bloodstream. I'm selective with ramen and I know when it's good. This un-nutritious sodium filled bowl of broth and noodles can make or break my day.\n\nNothing will beat great ramen houses in LA or NY, but being in Vegas, finding a good ramen joint is satisfaction. Monta ramen is located in Chinatown off Spring Mountain.\n\nI opted for the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen  6.95\nTonkotsu-Shoyu (\"pork bone and special shoyu base\") Ramen has a cloudy white colored broth. The broth is like a mix of the Tokyo and Kyushu style blend.\n\nI added green onions and hard boiled eggs.\n\nI prefer the thicker broth and it delivered. It was creamy but not overly fatty. The eggs were cooked to perfection with a moist yolk. The noodles weren't undercooked. I had extra noodles afterwards for $1.50. \n\nIn the end, I was filled with pleasure and satisfaction. It wasn't the perfect bowl of ramen but I left satisfied.
