If you know, then you know. \nThis is Korean SEOUL (soul) food and it's probably an acquired taste if you've never had it. \nIt's not the most instagramable food but it sure hits the spot. \nGrowing up in Vegas, we have always been very limited to Korean dining options, other than KBBQ, so I'm very glad to see we have so many now (and not just in Chinatown at that). TTT's food is tasty and on par with the best korean spots in KtownLA. \n\nI love the boneless porkbone potato soup, the spicy beef soup, the milky oxbone broth soup and the pork wraps! \n\nThis location is bigger and service is fast. Love how the tables all feel like private booths haha \n\nTIP: if you are eating the oxbone broth soup make sure you season it with salt, pepper, and a crap ton of green onion... Enjoy it with rice and kimchi. I like to put the juice of the kimchi into my soup to spice it up a little.
