Absolutely amazing and delicious... The best French fine dining I've ever had. The foie gras and the Chilean sea bass were absolutely delicious! If you're willing to spend $100 per person, I would highly recommend coming here. It's probably not a good idea if you're going on a budget. The service was spectacular and we had about 6 people waiting on us at all times. I can't say enough about how amazing this restaurant was
