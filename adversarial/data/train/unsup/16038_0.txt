Yeah, just don't.  We had the kids with us this time, and thought it'd be fun and would be such a novelty for us to stay at a 'castle'...yeah, but no.  Move on to the next hotel you're considering...but if you must know, let me tell you:\n\n- Room smelled as old as it looked\n- Sheets and towels were stained http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=sPpq5PaPK3tHR354o4mXcg\n- There's no tub\n- You'll hear the wind howl like a banshee through your window \n- Registration line was looooong\n- Decor looked like it was purchased from a garage sale http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=_zPXBcStYGFQ_ZYdITQaRA\n- The folks in the lobby who try to sell you show tickets are pushy and rude\n- Parking is outdoors and no direct access to the hotel\n\nAnd if this is not enough to convince you, here's the kicker:  Our window had a broken lock and I called THREE times to get it fixed and they never did.  It would have been a long fall from the 26th floor.  A blatant disregard for safety, especially when I mentioned our two small children (7 & 5) were with us.\n\nYeah, just DON'T.  Never again for us!
