BLD has early morning Happy Hour from 7am-9am.... am I still dreaming??? \nIt's an excuse to enjoy a cocktail before Target even opens! So. Much. Yes.\nWe ordered, and kept ordering. The drinks were strong and our server was ambitious. No photos because... well, we were enjoying ourselves too much. Order the captain crunch waffles, green Chile Benedict, biscuits&gravy, croissant sandwich we walked out $70 poorer but we had tons of leftovers and a great breakfast!
