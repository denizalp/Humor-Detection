Really love this pace great staff always happy at the bar Mike one of the best I've came across. Food is very good had brunch todayvso yummy.\nLive music on Wednesday and some weekends.\nThe staff is great but the one manager maybe the most rude manager I've ever met he never says hello or welcomes they need to make a change he thinks he's awesome complete asshole !!!! \n\nManager David Think I'm so coolich
