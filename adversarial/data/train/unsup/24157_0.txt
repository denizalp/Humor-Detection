Beware of Sam the order taker! She will laugh at you for ordering too much food! \n\nToday, we are moving lots of furniture. There is a big group of us, we are hungry & Mcdonalds seems easy,  fast and efficient.. Right?? No no no!\n\nIt's was my job to grab lunch for the group. I came up  to the drive thru, and Ordered 6 mcdoubles.. The order taker Sam's reply is \"wow 6 mcdoubles, that's a lot of mcdoubles\" ( laughing ) \nMe : \"yes 6\"\nSam: \"you must be so hungry for 6 mcdoubles, wow!! ) still laughing) \nMe: \"well yah I'm 400 pounds, of course I want all this food\"\nThen I ordered more to the order, because that's what my group requested.\n\nMy friend & I were in shock! We could not believe a fast food order taker could be so condescending and rude!! \n\nI requested to talk to a manager and I had told her what happened. She was very apologetic, which I understand it's not her fault her staff are rude kids. I told her she needed to get my order and I was not going to go up to the next window because I would go off on Sam. \n\nAs I was waiting, the window staff member asked me to move to the next window. I told him no, I was waiting for the manager and I would not move till I got my order. He rolled his eyes. He was a stocky rude boy. \nThe manager  came back out with our \"HUGE\" order and apologized again and gave me a punch card for a free value meal.\nI told her it wasn't her fault but she does need to get a grip on her rude staff.\n\nMcDonald's , this is not how we know you. I'm still utterly disgusted with the service I received today. I will NEVER be back at this location again and I will be writing corporate. \n\nAdvice : Go to Indian school & Hayden location, they are friendly fast and not rude.  They don't care how much or how little you order!
