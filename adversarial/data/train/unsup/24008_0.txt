I guess they can't all be winners. I ordered a cheesesteak and onion rings for delivery. The order came in about a half hour, which is great, but the food looked like it had time traveled back from a dark future in which it had been sitting out for days.\n\nLet me be more specific. The onion rings were soft and flaccid. When I picked one up, the breading sloughed off like skin from a water-logged zombie. The taste was also suspect, as if sugar was added to the breading. The cheesesteak was soggy. I'm not sure if they popped it out of the oven and dunked it in a bucket of dishwater or what. \n\nHere's what I know: I couldn't finish the onion rings, so I put them in my dog's bowl. She wouldn't eat them. I should mention that she will eat her own feces, if given the chance.
