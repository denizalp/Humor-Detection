My favorite buffets in Vegas are Wynn & Bellagio.\nWhile the Wynn is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous inside...I feel like the Bellagio has an edge food wise.\n\nThis past visit I wasn't exactly 100% satisfied.\nWe waited 1.5 hours in line (Yes..I was dying of starvation halfway through).\n\nHelpful Hints:\n - Dinner is pricey at $36.99 for weekends. Do what I do and come right before 4pm (which is when lunch ends) and pay lunch prices. \nCheap I know..but I'm Asian.\n- Crab legs here are CRAZY salty.\n- One of my fav. was was the salmon & ahi poke. SUPERRR spicy but I kept going back for more.\n\nThis place is consistently solid and you won't be disappointed (unless you waited over 1 hr in line...then you'll just be mad).\nNot exactly worth the $40 dinner price..but if you can get in for cheaper than go for it!
