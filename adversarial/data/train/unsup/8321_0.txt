Ni hao.  Can't get to Hong Kong today on the next flight out on the orient express.  Baked pork hong kong style is my favorite here. Chinese satellite tv is on to catch up on what's happening in the old country or to see the latest game show that will be in the states in a matter of weeks. If you don't know what to get or speak mandarin, just point to the pics that illustrate the dishes on the wall. Go ahead try that dish that looks like chicken. It may just be eel or squid and I'm sure it's good. Bring your laptop with rosetta stone to learn mandarin so you can understand what the locals are saying about you. For you non adventurous types there still is an americanized menu for your faint heart.
