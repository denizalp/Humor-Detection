Went back to Jt boba house. Thought I would give them another chance. Omgad! I seriously wanna slam my drink on the counter & say, I WANT MY REFUND. But me, I know better not to do that. Anyways, went there last night and got myself a strawberry & kiwi flavor tea with boba & jam. I thought I would try jam because when I had it in Cali. Omg, I was amazing. Had it here, it was a failure. Everything about my drink was just a no no!!!! Plus I even asked my boyfriend how was his Thai tea. He said \" it taste water down\" then I asked my little sister in law how was her lychee drink. She said \" I hardly can taste anything but water\". Fix your drinks because its definitely not good at all. Never coming here unless someone pays for my drink but I probably just get myself a cup of water :)\n\nSincerely, a customer that knows what's good & whats not good
