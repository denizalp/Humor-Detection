Old busted wooden door feel and the aged black mailbox gives you an idea not only what this place is about but the overall neighbourhood.  At least this time around I can open this busted door knob.  For some reason this place reminds me of Mercury Espresso on the East-end with the corner location and the large windows and the setup as well.\n\nI'm not a fan of the lay-out as the Tables in the Cafe are quite compacted which leaves very little space for Travellers to pass through therefore one must go through the treacherous pathway know as the Original Q.  Do you know about this factor?  It's quite common especially Downtown area.\n\nThe hungry and cold customers wait forever in single-line get to see the full and satisfied customers squeeze by them on their way out because the Entrance\/Exit is super narrow so you can smell what they ate while they pass you and give you the \"L\"oser sign.\n\nIn a Cafe environment, I'm sure eventually I'll be like my sugar-loaded Friend and pour the whole cup of hot Coffee onto someone while I tightrope my way through these places.  \n\nAs for the Cappuccino, the first one was a piece of Art that didn't take so long that the original creator passed-away.  I did notice that while the Barista poured, the second guy was overlooking his work and guiding him through.  \n\n2 Baristas serving me that is what I call service which is too bad because the next person in line would have to wait until they finish admiring my Cup before continuing to theirs.  It's a nice Beverage indeed but just not my scene.
