It's been awhile since I last posted, but I felt that this one would be warranted...\n\nCurrently sitting in Edulis, waiting for our last course.\n\nOur reservation began at 7pm and it is currently past 11:30pm. We ordered the 7 course tasting menu along with 2 bottles of wine (special occasion, it's our anniversary!). \n\nThe food is amazing. Very seafood forward with the last course being duck. The home made bread is fantastic. They even own a duck press - they take out the breast and legs and press the rest - sounds amazing, and it really is. You have a choice of a cheese platter at the end and it's totally divine.\n\nHowever, it's been almost 5 hours and I'm still sitting here. As entertaining as my boyfriend is, I have to work tomorrow. And to make things worse, they removed my wine glass, when we still had wine left in the bottle. I miss my puppy at home and I just want the damn bill. It should not take 45 minutes per course.
