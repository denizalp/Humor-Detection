Teo Taxi makes me feel so exclusive\/important. Every time I've taken one the service has been perfect, the wait time minimal, and the cleanliness of the cab excellent.\n\nI love that once the driver gets close, your phone tells you to raise it and tilt it to the side so the driver can recognize you. I love the little screen inside the car that displays your name, your journey, the news, and charges your phone!\nAlso the fact that now they say \"Bonjour\" on the side is so cute!\n\nYou decide on the app which vehicle you would like, how much you would like to tip, and where you are located\/going. Very user friendly and to the point.\n\nIt is on the pricier side though (compared to Uber) which is why I can't take it as much as I would like to. But it always feels special when I order one :)
