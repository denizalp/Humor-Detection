I lived here three years. Then moved. Now I have lived here another year and a half. The office staff are so kind. They really work with you when you need it. I was only unhappy when they kept raising my rent every time my lease was up. Although I'm sure this is normal these are large studios and I just couldn't keep justifying paying more and more for something that is the same. I would definitely recommend these apartments for anyone who is living alone or with a child. Two adults might be too crowded here I would think. The grounds are well kept and the grass is almost always perfect. I did have some bug issues for awhile as most apartments do. But the office was fast to help remedy that. Seriously this is a great place if you need a small amount of space for a low price and low move in costs. Great transitional apartment. It's actually a very quiet complex!
