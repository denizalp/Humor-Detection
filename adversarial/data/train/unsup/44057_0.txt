Why no love for this place?!? My review is based solely on the steaks and they knocked it out of the park. My wife needed her steak well done because she's pregnant and it came out well done without being dry. My New York was a perfect medium.\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy atmosphere, but who cares about that. For steaks, a solid A!
