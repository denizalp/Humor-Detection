Terrible service. 1\/17\/15 my friends and I walked in around lunch time to have a quick beer. Upon seating, we waited 10 minutes before we had to flag down a waiter to put in an order for drinks. After ordering, 10 more minutes elapsed before our waiter returned to see if we needed anything else ... which we stated we were still waiting for our drinks. 10 minutes later he returned to let us know that a beer we ordered was out. (Which was listed on a giant chalkboard at the bar as a daily special) ... at which point we walked out. They showed total disregard for efficient service ... avoid if possible.
