The only reason that I would give this company 1 star is because I have to at least give 1 star.  This is the worst service that I have ever received period, and I am an extremely easy going person.  This is also my first yelp review I have ever done, because most of the time I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  \n\nI was first contacted by this company through American Home Shield which is an insurance company that I have since I recently purchased my home and had to use them due to their contract with them.  \n\nJ&A initially came out to look at a leaking faucet in my bath tub back in January and it is now March 24th and he just left my house without me being there because I was at work and told my parents who had come over and wasted their time letting him in that he could not do the job.  \n\ni would never, ever refer this company to my worst enemy.  I called to see what the issue was and they said the contractor would be in touch with me, it's been 2 hours and I still have not heard back from him.
