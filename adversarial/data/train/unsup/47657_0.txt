I'm spoiled coming from a foodie city like Louisville. We've honestly been a bit disappointed with the range of food quality and the ubiquitous amount of overpriced chain restaurants in Las Vegas, but we know that's how it goes. After all, we didn't come here for the culinary experience.\n\nHowever, Border Grill was by far superior, and was a great experience. \n\nI didn't anticipate authentic cuisine as it was marketed, but it was actually very close. I was prepared for mediocre Tex-Mex and that does NOT describe this wonderful place. The meats were just right, the salsas were incredibly fresh, and the drinks were high quality. Atmosphere was classy and pleasant as well.\n\nThe cherry on top? We had absolutely phenomenal service here today. Our server was so down to earth, helpful, and attentive that he alone could have made the entire experience. I'd gladly come back here again next time we're in Las Vegas!
