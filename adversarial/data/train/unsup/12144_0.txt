Stopped by for a Saturday lunch and the place was not very busy. My father and I both ordered the Longboarder burger and we both enjoyed it. The burger was well seasoned, cooked perfectly, and the bun was just right. The fries that came with the burger were very good. They were slightly crisp and went well with a side of ranch. Our waitress was okay and could have had a little more personality but did everything a waitress should do. Overall, we left satisfied and I would go again for the quality burger. If I had decide between Islands or Red Robin, Islands is the choice.
