After 3 trips to Bubble Pi, I don't have any plans to return. Although I love the owner's nian gao (here it is crusty with a softer interior), the bakery is uncomfortable (little seating), messy (there are old magazines and random decor everywhere), and the owner is too nosy. She asked me how much money I make and whether I was planning to marry soon--I just came in for dessert!!!!\n\nI have had dim sum here and cannot recommend it. The dim sum is too difficult to eat with a flimsy plastic fork and in a shop where you feel like you're intruding on someone's personal space.
