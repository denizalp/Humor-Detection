A reliable business associate referred me to Chris at Stellar.  So, I gave him a call.  He suggested that I buy my own opener if I wanted to save some cash.  He even recommended a brand.\n\nHe came out to my house the next day (on time) and completed the installation of a new Chamberlain opener that I bought from the Depot.  After he finished, he cleaned up, and walked me through all of the features, taking the time to program my external access box.  Since his price was very reasonable, I had him replace the steel rollers with teflon ones, which really cut down on the noise.  He even lubricated the spring action.\n\nPromises made, promises kept.  I highly recommend.\nhttp:\/\/www.stellargaragedoor.com\/
