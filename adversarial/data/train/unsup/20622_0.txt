They have wifi - it's their phone number. \n\nI really like this place. Particularly the \"House Special\" baked pork chop in tomato sauce with cheese. I like the sauce, which is plentiful and mixes well with the rice. The portion size is large. It also comes with soup and drink as one would usually expect from these places. I think I'll be coming here often because of it's convenient location and because I crave milk tea sometimes. :)
