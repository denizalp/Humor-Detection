There is a new game out there called \"Chubby Cattle\" where you stuff large amounts of meat into your mouth and say nothing... just chew, swallow, and let the serotonin do its job to your body. \n\nSetting: I have been here during its grand opening and have returned for its re-grand opening. The decor of the restaurant has been updated with an improved layout to the sauce station. Previously the sauce station was on what looked like a plastic wedding cake design now in a more buffet style, but is a bit cramp as many diners will be all over experimenting with sauces and other additions. The party area does boast individual hot pot stoves for large parties and a large stove in the middle for the larger broth option. \n\nService: Pretty typical but it was a busy Saturday night, we seem to have three different servers tending to our tables. Drinks were a tad slow but nothing to lose yourself over. \n\nFood: The oxtail broth, new cuts of meat, add new items on the conveyor belt (chicken feet, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon). Being a big oxtail fan, I chose the oxtail broth which was... a bit bland. The sauce station helped play a nice role as I experimented with my broth by adding spicy, salty, bitter, sweet etc... till it matched exactly what I wanted. Wagyu was beautifully marbled with a nice chewy but not so melt in your mouth texture. \n\nPersonal Choice: Tomato broth and the spicy broth are great! Brisket + Wagyu Beef + side of enoki + rice. Bam! \n\nOverall: One of my favorite places to eat hot pot. Great quality meat and savory flavorful broth, this place has it all!
