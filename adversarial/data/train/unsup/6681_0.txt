This place is ok. Very clean. Sushi is decent. One of my friends is obsessed so I have been a few times. It is average. Quiet place so if you want to talk this place would work. Seems like a good place to go if you are dumping someone. It's cheap enough and the polite atmosphere would deter a scene.
