OK, Pusateri's has some fine food indeed.  At the same time, I love to poke fun at this Yorkville location since it's so posh.  Here's my particularly crass review:\n\nAt this Yorkville location, they take care of all the \"basic essentials\", like valet parking your Porsche, deveining an entire piece of foie gras for you, and always keeping stock of your favourite Beluga caviar.\n\nThey once had a slab of Kobe beef for $1030 (I kid you not!) \n\nIf you have elbows, you're probably too wide to fit into this narrow Yorkville property.
