Little Shop is a pure gaming shop; no comics, no other books, no frills. For the space they occupy, they have a huge stock of games that runs the gamut. Card games, tabletop, pen and paper books, and board games that range from fairly \"family friendly\" entry level games such as Catan to ridiculously complicated all-night Euro titles. \n\nThe bright shiny core that makes this shop stand out above others to me; I am a woman, and I have never felt awkward here. MAGIC indeed. Normally I either have to play the \"are you nerd enough to have a pull drawer\" question array, or the \"are you lost, sweetheart?\" stare. I do not have to do that here. Some women even work here! It's magic. So easy to spend money on stuff you love when you don't feel like a pariah.\n\nThe staff is pretty knowledgeable; as much as you can be in a store with a selection that huge. It's simply impossible to know everything about all of those types and titles. But they usually know who knows. \n\nThe store has a wee tinge of that \"MTG Tournament Funk\", but it's either tamped down with a lot of febreeze or well cleaned.
