Great food!! Omg outstanding to be exact!! It's exactly what I wanted and to top it off we got $30 for $15. Cheese pizza is BOMB.. Philly cheesesteak more BOMB and the garlic knots OH MY YUMMY BOMB!!! Prices were great and they have awesome specials. The bartender was so cool and fun! They had a trivia night going on (every Monday I guess) we didn't play but everyone was having a blast! Totally kid friendly and for that I will be back with the kiddos!! Thanks guys for taking care of me!! Drove from Fiesta Station just to eat HERE and well worth it!!
