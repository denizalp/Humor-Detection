Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat thanks for providing me with a comfy booth and tasty treats. And yes, I'm that tool who sings the Smelly Cat song in my head every single time I walk into this cute little coffee house. \n\nSmelly Cat is one of those adorable local coffee hangouts that is chock full of fun. They have coffee, they have ice cream, they have pastries, they have tea...I mean, comon' they even have cheesecake. The staff have always been really friendly and eager to please. Hubs and I have strolled in here a few times during Friday gallery crawls and have yet to be disappointed. \n\nI've enjoyed a very good, and very sweet, white mocha. No doubt it would put most folks straight into sugar shock. On another occasion I've taken down a hefty strawberry croissant. While it wasn't at the caliber of other local bakeries, it was still flaky and scrumptious. I also remember a time that I enjoyed some type of mango iced tea. Even unsweetened it was the perfect accompaniment to a sweltering summer day. \n\nUntil next time, Smelly Cat, I'm going to try to get this song out of my head now.
