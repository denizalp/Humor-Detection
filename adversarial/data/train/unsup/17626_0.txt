Zorba's?  Isn't that the name of a sex shop?  Not like I would know or anything, but I do believe I've seen it somewhere on Scottsdale road.  Perhaps I've even parked in their parking lot, but I swear it was only to dump my car off somewhere so I could get into Sugar Daddy's.  \n\nAnyways, this is a great Greek restaurant in Chandler.  I've only been once, but I really liked it.  They call it an authentic restaurant, but since I've never been to Greece, I wouldn't really know.  What I do know is that my hummus was absolutely delish and my falafel was really tasty.  You know how falafel can sometimes be too dry and bland? Not here.  It was a little spicy and really flavorful. Plus, they didn't skimp on the tzatziki.  Well played Zorba's.  Well played.  \n\nNow if only they would consider joining forces with the \"other\" Zorba's to create the ultimate sex shop\/Greek restaurant combo in the world...
