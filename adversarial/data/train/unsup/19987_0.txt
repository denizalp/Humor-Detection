This place used to be a good place for some good finds. That is: It USED TO BE, until a small group of people took this place over!!!! This Goodwill allows the SAME group of 3 to 5 people to SIT ALL DAY, and I mean ALL DAY!!! I have even seen them break out sandwiches and EAT LUNCH while sitting on the couches RIGHT at the double doors where all the 'new' stuff comes out!!! They take EVERYTHING worthy of buying and they leave the CRAP behind for everyone else!!!!\n\nThese people literally have carts overfilled with stuff and they BLOCK the isle where they sit!! You can't even walk through the isle!! Every few hours they check out and start all over again, on the SAME day, OVER and OVER and OVER from opening at 9:00 to 5:00 p.m. when stuff is no longer put out !!!! \n\nI cannot even find a damn pair of shoes for my kid because they take ALL of the shoes unless they are beat up!! They break up their group when the huge (smaller item) carts roll out from the opposite side of the building. One stays behind to grab the stuff by the furniture and the others will run your ass down and even literally GRAB the same item you are grabbing right out of your hand!!!! I'm so disgusted that I don't even bother to go to this Goodwill anymore!!!\n\nDon't bother going here unless you want their leftovers, and they don't leave much behind that is worthy of buying!!!!
