Judging by the muffled screams that are coming from the rooms on the side, this must be an torture chamber! Strangely, all the women leaving have big smiles on their face. But seriously, this boutique salon makes sure you feel comfortable (even if you're just the guy waiting) with pink walls and frilly furniture that are quite inviting! I personally haven't gotten anything done here, but my wife swears by them.
