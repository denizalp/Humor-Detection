I contacted Blast Master to clean my pebble tec pool. I was initially impressed because Ryan came out to give an estimate right away. I asked him to perform the needed work and he said he'd be by the same night with a pool pump to drain the pool. That was two nights ago. He did not show up. I called yesterday morning and he assured me he'd be by to start draining the pool. Again, he did not show up or call me. I called him again and left a message asking him to contact me to let me know either way if he could do the job. He did not return my call and is blowing me off.  I have very limited time and he's wasted a great deal of it. If he is too busy to do the job, that's fine, I understand, but have the courtesy of telling me that rather than making me wait, call him back, and now find someone else to do the work. Very frustrating and disappointing.
