I love this place - I come here every time I visit Cleveland!\n\nThe make-your-own tacos are excellent and reasonably priced.  Try the Stoner taco (softshell and hardshell with chorizo in between) and any of the meat options with their cilantro-lime aioli.  Delicious.\n\nI've found the service to be quick and enthusiastic, and helpful if you have questions.\n\nThe only issue - and I'm not docking any stars for this - is the drink specials are rather expensive.  Still, it's downtown Cleveland here, so take that into consideration.\n\nIf you like tacos, give Barrio a try.
