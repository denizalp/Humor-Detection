First bad sign is they didn't have milk  for our 3 year old. Second bad sign only one other family there. Third bad sign teenagers running the place sitting around texting and talking. \n\nPizza was mediocre and greasy. Caesar salad was made with old lettuce and all hearts. Honestly not impressed with it at all. I would rather eat Totino's party pizzas.\n\nThe bathrooms were nasty, toilet paper sitting on the toilet and the sink was falling off the wall.
