Driving home from Charlotte Boyfriend and I decided to stop by D9, Ass Clown Brewing Co and Primal Brewery since I have been dying to try them and they are all within 2 miles of each other. Out of the 3 around this area, D9 was definitely my favorite! \n\nFlight 1 - Our Town Brown, Holiday Hope, Wishlist Christmas Collaboration and Battle Hymn\nI enjoyed the Battle Hymn, a black IPA, and the Wishlist, a tasty collaboration ale but you have to like ginger to enjoy this one. I was so impressed with flight 1 that I had to get another to try more D9 beers plus they changed the TV to the UNC V Georgia Tech basketball game so I couldn't leave before half-time..\n\nFlight 2 - Southern Tea, Whiskers on Kittens, Witless Ale and Hakuna Matata\nThis was Boyfriend's favorite flight, minus the Whiskers on Kittens since he does not like sours but I do so I got it all to myself. I let him have the Southern Tea since I do not like tea, not sure how that is possible since I grew up in the South. Hakuna Matata is a smooth drinking IPA plus the name is a wonderful phrase! Our favorite beer out of all 8 that we tried was the Witless Ale, it tasted similar to apple juice and at 13% it is dangerously good!\n\nThe bartender, I think her name was Brie?, was just as passionate about beer as I was which made for great conversation. I almost forgot to mention that the tap room is spacious and nice. There are several games to play as well as an outdoor seating area. I wish this place wasn't as far away but I hope to make it back for another visit soon.
