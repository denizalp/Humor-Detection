The icecream we got was delicious. Lots of toppings and mixed alright. 2 stars because I was trying some flavors of icecream and was told I could only have two samples because they didn't want me to get full...... Is coldstone hurting for business. I'm a grown ass man, I think I'll be ok with three little sample tastes without it filling me up. Very low class.....
