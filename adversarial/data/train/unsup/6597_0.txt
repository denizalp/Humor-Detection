Authentic Ethiopian food with, sadly, authentic Ethiopian service.  \n\nThe good news; the food here is great.  You can eat at a small hut, and have the bread spread over the table like pizza dough, and eat little bits of spiced vegetables and meats by tearing off the bread and then scooping it up with your hands.  It's phenomenally tasty, even though you should be warned that the bread WILL expand in your stomach.  \n\nWhen you're done, you can have genuine Ethiopian coffee, which is like thick Turkish coffee but a little more cinnamony.\n\nThe only problem?  Don't come here unless you have some SERIOUS time to kill.  We spent two hours, and the coffee took - no joke - another hour to get.  It was delicious, but every time we've thought about going back, we asked, \"Do we have the time?\"  And we've heard from friends that the situation hasn't improved.
