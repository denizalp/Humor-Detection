For March's International Supper Club we picked Rula Bula, a local favorite Irish Pub in the Tempe area. \n\nWe were a party of 14, and for some parts our server struggled a bit with keeping orders straight, for got some drink orders, brought the incorrect ones but overall it went well.\nIt was a few days before St Patrick's day and we were out on the patio area, and have to say while the weather was perfect, seating outside was the place to be, you sort of forgot that you were just right off Mill ave.\n\nI ordered a Smithwicks and that was delish and hit the spot, then ordered some potato skins and 3 piece fish and chips. The potato skins to me were slightly over cooked, instead of the cheese being oozy it was a little crisp, but don't worry they still were eaten. I should have gone with maybe a 1 piece fish and chip because they do not skimp on the sizes! 3 where just too many! But the fish was perfectly fried, it was crisp and tender and flaky, I was bummed that I couldn't finish the dish haha it was so good!\n\nRula Bula does offer codes to paid for 2 hours of parking, call them and they will give it to you, some of us were even worried that we might run out of time before our meal ended but our server took our parking numbers and added more time to our tickets, I thought that was cool!\n\nIf you are looking for a fun local Irish Pub to chill and enjoy the surrounds, go the patio area and enjoy yourself at Rula Bula!
