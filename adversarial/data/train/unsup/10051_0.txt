You feel like you stepped into a supermarket in Russia with beautiful brand names and foods you've never seen before.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and the quality is high.  The fresh fish, meat and produce sections are all pretty small. But the prepared food section is huge with lots of tasty options at very reasonable prices.  \n\nI usually try to avoid places with yummy in the title, but this place is fantabulous.
