Had a very unpleasant experience at Uncle John's Candy Shack. Strolled in after getting some gelato up the street, thought the shop looked inviting. As I was looking at some candy, the man (I assume he was Uncle John) began yelling at a customer that had entered the store after me. He did not take into consideration the fact that there were young children in the store and used some profanity. In addition, he was rude to me afterwards when I asked about a certain product. Who thought that I'd receive one of the worst customer service experiences ever from a candy store's namesake? Safe to say that I will not be returning to this strange shop.
