Benny's is my favorite pizza in Charlotte. If you are going to order a whole pizza, make sure you look at the size of the slices first. They are huge! I usually get a slice of pepperoni and  that is enough to fill me up. It is $5 and about the size of 3 \"normal\" slices of pizza. The sign is somewhat blended into the brick, but its connected to Heist. I am excited to try one of their other locations in Virginia when I am up visiting family.
