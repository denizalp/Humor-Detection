The food here is 3 stars, but the service is one star. I met a friend for dinner at 5pm on a Friday. The bar was full, but the dining area only had two other people sitting in it and they already had their food. The waitress kept walking from the cash register to the kitchen every 3-4 minutes.  She never once stopped to ask for our drink\/food orders. And she never even acknowledged us or said hi. After waiting for 15 minutes, we walked to the cash register to ask her when she would be able to take our order. She told us that their policy was for the customer to order at the cash register, and if we wanted another drink or anything else we would have to get up and walk back to the cash register. My friend and I have eaten here several times, an every time there was waiting staff. We ordered a drink, walked back to our table to look at the menu, and sat down. The waitress again walked right by us to go to the kitchen. Each trip to and from the kitchen put her within inches of our table. We walked up to the cash register to order our meal, but a male employee came from the kitchen to speak with the waitress just as we got there. The waitress gave us the finger (not the bad finger, she gave us the hold on finger). The two employees began to whisper and giggle with each other. I turned toy friend, and with our bff esp abilities we mutually agreed to go wait at Grimaldi's for 30 minutes for an open table. We paid four our drinks and left. I don't think my friend or I will be back at this Wahios ever again.
