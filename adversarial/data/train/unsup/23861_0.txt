Lovely restaurant in the Borgata, typical trendy decor that the Fox restaurants have going for them.  My girlfriend and I met up for margs and lunch on a Saturday, it was busy but we were able to get a table right away.  \n\nOur server was slow and not very friendly.  I had the cucumber and kumquat margarita with shrimp tacos.  The margarita was far better than the tacos - they were just normal shrimp tacos.  My friend got a cheese crisp which looked amazing and I would highly recommend that dish to anyone.
