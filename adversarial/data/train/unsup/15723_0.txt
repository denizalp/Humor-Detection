Listen, folks.  Maybe I'm just another gringa who can habla enough espanol to properly order from this place, but I friggin' love this place.  And yes, I only order two things, the Carne Asada Nachos and the Carne Asada Torta, so perhaps my 5 stars won't cover all of Salsitas offerings, but damn, love it, love them.\n\nHere's why...\n\nThey make the chips fresh, as in made-to-order, literally cutting up the uncooked corn tortillas and frying them right after you order, making them warm and crispy and delicioso.  Whatever combination of goodness it is that is then placed on top of the chips is amazing.  There's beens, guacamole, fresh pico de gallo, sour cream, jalepenos, carne, grated cheese that is melted by the piping hot chips, and I'm sure I'm missing something, but the culmination of these ingredients result in a flavor fiesta!\n\nThe torta is a mess to eat if you unwrap it, but inside is a toasty bun of some type of bread the likes of which cannot be purchased at Gringo-Mart, holding together layers of beans, some sort of white Hispanic moisty cheesy goodness, tomato, lettuce, onion, carne, jalepeno and cheese.  \n\nCan you tell I ate there last night?  That's the only reason I'm not gnawing on my mousepad as I type this.\n\nGo there!  Vamanos!
