Got a recommendation for this restaurant from a friend, and SO happy we came.  Made a reservation to eat on the patio, it was a bit chilly and we were warned to dress appropriately. We got there right at sunset and the backdrop of camelback mountain was spectacular! The whole dining patio was amazing...heaters everywhere, fire pits etc.  it was about 50 degrees while we ate and I never had to put on my jacket.  The food was amazing, the service excellent. Can't wait to co e back!
