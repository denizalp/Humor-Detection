Looking for a coffee shop on Eastern? Don't get sucked into the newly remodeled 24hr Starbucks, Mad House is only a shopping plaza away. The prices are better, the drive thru is faster and the baristas are friendlier! \nThe macchiato I ordered was way too foamy, at least 1\/3 of the cup! However, I won't complain since it was only a dollar and some change and also yummy. I probably got more macchiato in my cup than I would have at Starbucks for that price, anyways. \nThe shop is a little small, no place for intimate conversations. However, there are always tables and spaces available. Great, quiet place to study!
