Pad Thai was good, but the Pad See Ew tasted liked the noodles were burnt. Medium spice was very spicy so beware of that. Our kids ordered Sweet and Sour chicken which was not good at all. They didn't touch it. The chicken was breaded in a weird cracker breading and the sweet and sour sauce looked liked it had chunks of gelatin in it. We did delivery which was rather quick. All in all won't be going back.
