I am eating one of the goodies I picked up from Petal Dust Bake Shop and writing this review. So bare with me, I might be a little hyper, but in a good way.\n\nPetal Dust Bake Shop is a new bake shop that opened in the Bathurst and Rutherford area. \n\nThe deco is simple and welcoming. You will see the actual baking area where all these goodies is created through the glass window. \n\nYou can check the website for the different offerings but a lot of items are seasonal or on rotation.\n\nIt was just hard to pick one treat from here! Cupcakes? Bars? Cookies? Brownies? Mini Tea Loafs? Coffee Cakes? What should I do? Everything looks deliciously good and pretty..... \n\nEnded up I left the store with some baked goods nicely boxed ready for gifting:\n- Ultimate Ginger Cookie ($1)\n- Butter Tart Bar (with no raisins of course) ($3.75)\n- New York Style Coffee Cake ($3.75)\nAnd No way I am giving them away !\n\nThe ginger cookie was moist and have a nice kick of ginger and not over sweet. I am saving my coffee cake for breakfast tomorrow and going to have the butter tart bar as my night cap!\n\nThere is a \"Treat Your Friend Tuesdays Offers: Buy One Get One Free\", check their website for detail. And of course, you can do what I would have done, buy one and get to eat both without treating your friend!
