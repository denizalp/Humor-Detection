Came here last night with a group of friends looking to try something new. Some of us were more familiar with escape games than others. \n\nThis place was a lot of fun, but the challenge was a little different than the traditional escape room. We had a series of three challenges, each in their own room. The motive wasn't to escape the room, but to complete the challenges as quickly as possible using clues from around the room. You  find out your score when you finish all three challenges. \n\nOne of the staff members accidentally rebooted one of the challenges midway through, so it had to be reset. That was the only hiccup of the whole night. The staff were all super friendly, and the rooms themselves were impressively put together.\n\nI wouldn't complete the same room again, but I would definitely go back to see what else they have to offer.
