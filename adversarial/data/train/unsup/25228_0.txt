Best vegetable spring rolls I have EVER had. Served with a spicy sauce, they were delicious. I had the fish w\/ basil in a clay pot, and my boyfriend had fried pork cutlets over rice. Everything came out quickly and sizzling hot. Our server was kind and attentive as well. Even the drinks! We ordered a small pot of tea and it was light, soothing, and hot. Perfect end to a wonderful meal.
