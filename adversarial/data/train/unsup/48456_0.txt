My boyfriend and I go the the Atherton market every Saturday to get breakfast from Roots. We love getting our food, sitting out in the sun and enjoying the market festivities. Some times there are animal adoptions going on. It is seriously my happy place. Farmers market, incredible food from a food truck and puppies? Incredible combination.  \n\nThe menu is always changing and we are both always pleasantly surprised. One time they had a pork tenderloin with a coffee rub....heaven. I was so sad when it was gone. I haven't gotten the chance to get lunch from them yet but if you follow them on facebook you can see where they are on a daily basis. The staff is always so nice and you can tell they put tons of though and creativity into their creations.
