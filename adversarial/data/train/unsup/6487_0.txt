Ruth Chris would you marry me? After that night, I couldn't get you out of my mind. You have forever changed my view on steaks... lol\nOkay, let get serious, shall we? We're going to do it \"Chopped\" style!\n\n1.Presentation: the filet mignon was still sizzling when brought out (even 10 minutes late the plate was still freaking hot). My plate was very simple since there was only a piece of steak right in the center of the dish. And I received a bowl of mashed potato which was filled to the top (southern style).\n\n2. Taste: ......Marvelous.... after taking the first bite, I thought to myself, \"what have I been eating my whole life?\". Yep, that's how good the steak was. I ordered medium-rare, which I was expecting a steak that once sliced that the juice would come out. I was terribly wrong. Instead, my steak was well aged, which allows the meat to be flavorful and moist. As for the seasoning, I didn't add any! The meat, itself, was seasoned with salts and peppers. So unlike typical southern's steak (thanks god) it wasn't buttery. Though the cheesecake dessert could've been better because it was kind of plain-jane.\n\nCreativity: Obviously everything was simple since they want the steak to be in the spotlight. Which I think was suitable for the restaurant.\n\nSadly, the only flaw that matter to me is the price. It's not a place that you can go everynight (good god, $40 for a steak) but it's a great place for a special occasion. Such as a date or something along that line. :)
