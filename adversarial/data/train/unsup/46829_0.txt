Disappointed in the flavor and taste of hash hash a go go. I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over medium. The biscuit was dense, heavy\/thick, and overall not good. The jelly they offered was delicious however. The orange juice they gave me which looked like a double shot was quite good as well. The corned beef hash was decent and the home style potatoes were okay but overall it was not a dish that made me want to come back for more. The portions are generous.  The waiter was friendly, quick, and attentive. Overall experience was 30 minutes because it was early on a Saturday morning.
