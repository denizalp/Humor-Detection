I would give this place NO STARS but I cannot.  My family spent $67 dollars on sausage pizza, pasta, sausage sandwich, and fried zucchini... WAITED 90 MINUTES (paid cash or they would charge an additional 2 bucks, what?!?!)! \nIT WAS HORRIBLE!!! \nWay too much sodium, my mom's legs swelled up and I could taste salt well after eating the pizza! YUCK!!!\nCalled for a refund and they would only give us 10% off our next order, WHAT???\nThe manager was an A$$hole!!! He told my mom to write a letter to the US president if she did not like his offer.\nWOULD NEVER GO OR ORDER FROM NAPOLI AGAIN... NEVER!
