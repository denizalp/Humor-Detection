We recently made our first trip to Las Vegas.  On the recommendation of a friend who has a house there, we went to Gaetano's.  The experience was so great that it was the only restaurant that we went back to before we left town.  It is definitely a classy place but you could go there wearing anything from blue jeans to a tux and not feel out of place.  From the time you enter the front door you can tell that this is a family owned and run place as the owners (Dad, Mom, and son, Nick) are extremely attentive while still making sure everything is running smoothly.  We have Italian-origin relatives so we know GOOD Italian food when we get it.  From the appetizers to dessert and a great wine list I don't see how anyone could be disappointed.  If you are in the area be sure and give it a try.
