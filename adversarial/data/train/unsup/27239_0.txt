Service was exceptional, I'll give them that. When we asked for additional towels, it arrived within 10 minutes. The pool area was great and the kids had a lot of fun. It was also  located close to a bunch of great tourist places like the Underground City of Montreal and the Notre Dame Basilica. However, the comforter had stains on it and the room had a bit of a musty smell. That was very disappointing.
