So I spent the night before my 30th birthday at Surrender's nighttime pool party. Odd thing about this place is that we asked several people in Vegas about it and everyone kept telling us that there was no such thing. A friend told me that the night pool party was only on Thursdays, so we ventured over to Encore to see what we could find. Well, we found it and it did not disappoint!\n\nThis was my first time at a Vegas pool party and my friends and I had so much fun! The music was great, we got in free, and we got a free drink. I guess a draw back would be that the two guys we were with had to pay $30, but 8 girls got in for free (I wasn't the one complaining). We spent hours dancing in the pool, which is perfect considering Vegas in August was 90+ degrees at night. My sister and I finished off our evening dancing around the pool in a conga line. Great way to bring on my 30's! I plan on coming back here for sure.
