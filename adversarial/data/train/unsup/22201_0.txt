Drifting around Aria, me and my buddies sought out lunch food.  Bobby's Burger Palace got me excited considering Bobby Flay's higly acclaimed burger derivations.\n\nDecor looks like a fast food joint.  Gourmet burgers or fast food?  * scratches head*\n\nMy overall impressions?!  Worst burger experience I have had in vegas!\n\nBobby Flay is known for potato chips layered in his burger.  Fine!  Adds a crunchy texture.  Crunchify works so add points for that idea!\n\nHow did BBP lose me?  All of my group's burgers were extremely salty!  Can I get some beef with my salt, please?!  Shocked at how salty our burgers, we watched as the cooks lathered up other orders with an avalanche of salt.  Oh boy!  I would assume cooks would know when too much is too much...\n\nIn addition, my patty was overcooked!  Ordered medium but received medium well...  You have one job, make burgers!\n\nCan you customize your burger at BBP?  I didn't see pricing for that... =(\n\nEnding this review on a positive note, the shake was delish!\n\nMove along folks, nothing to see here!
