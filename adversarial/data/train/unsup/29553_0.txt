Damn good pizza. Since I ate there no idea about delivery. The cheese steak was pretty good. Still, the pizza was perfect, big long slices with a thin seasoned crust with just the right kind of cheese and a little grease to make it bad for you when you fold it to eat it. I'll definitely get the slice again if I am in this part of town.
