There's only 2 things that make Indian-owned casinos okay: \n\n1. Winning.\n\n2. Indian Fry-bread w\/ honey and powdered sugar. Ecstasy. \n\n\nThe only other comments I have are that it's smaller than SD casinos, and you get no kind of cell phone reception here, which makes finding people in your party much, much harder.
