So I had read good reviews on the other sites and one of my coworkers at another branch had indicated Z Pizza was good eats. When the location at Monroe and 1st Ave opened, I was very excited since it's just across the corner from my office. There are a few pizzas ready for by-the-slice options--all have proven to be very good. My boss ordered a salad and she liked it; however, as a rule of thumb I don't order salads as a meal. Overall, I really like the pizza, the setting is clean and appears to be efficiently laid out, and being so close to my work could get me in trouble (but that's totally my fault). With the weather cooling off, I'm sure their patio will see increased traffic.\n\nThere are signs indicating beer and wine are on their way so that will be a plus.\n\nWe're ordering from here today as an office meal, so I'll be updating with this experience.\n\nIf you're in the downtown area, check out Z Pizza.
