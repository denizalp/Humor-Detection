Another 5 star review for Cleveland Tea Revival! \n\nI discovered its existence on yelp last week (thanks, Cara!) and couldn't wait to get back to the west side to try it. On today's rainy day, my fiancé and I stopped in after lunch at Bon Bon. I fell in love with as soon as I saw the colorful sitting area outside, the yellow (my favorite color) telephone inside, the quirky tiled ceiling, and all the canisters of tea. I told the employee that I have been waiting and waiting for a great tea place ever since I moved to Cleveland three years ago! As I searched the menu, I smelled a few of their excellent teas. As a tea lover, I can tell you that this menu is exceptional and very unique!\n\nMy fiancé chose Church Ave, which includes mint and fennel. He deemed it one of his favorite herbal teas he's ever had! I got the Lapsang Souchong, a black tea with an extreme smoky flavor. In fact, one of the ingredients listed is \"campfire.\" Well, it SMELLS like a campfire, in the most appealing way!\n\nThe employee was helpful in telling us that we could combine certain teas, etc. There are so many I want to try. But she was even more helpful in allowing me to hang out with the resident pooch, Louie! I crouched on the floor in the back corner and pet the sweetest black lab mix for a handful of minutes. I think my fiancé thought I might try to steal the dog. ;) (Don't worry, I'll just visit...)\n\nCleveland Tea Revival, I have been waiting for you for years! I'll be back many times, for your quaint atmosphere, super tea selection, and the dog. I do love that dog.
