All the five star reviews seem a bit questionable. Friends and family, perhaps?\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is weird. It's huge, with mismatching decor, and on a Saturday night, basically empty (only one other table). There was no artist on stage singing. In fact, the server didn't turn on music until a few minutes after we sat down. So quiet...\n\nOur table was missing forks. The server seemed surprised when we asked for some, as if we were asking for extra flatware or chicken teriyaki. I don't know. Did I step into a culture that doesn't use forks? That's the feeling her reaction stirred in me!\n\nWe ordered some yogurt\/onion appetizer, shirazi salad, and beef and chicken koobideh. Our koobideh came with a complimentary salad, which I could have done without. I don't find iceberg lettuce, some cucumbers, and some tomatoes appealing. The dressing was so sour.\n\nEverything else was decent. The portions are quite large, as we took everything home afterwards.
