We stop here every time we come out to Phx..Sun City West to visit because it past my wife's taste test....She is picky, born in Asia and her mom is the best cook in the neighborhood, she know her food. We load up everything and usually get some to go for the day after. Very busy but not to busy. The only draw back we found was lots of staff but we had to flag down a waitress for service....w\/ so much staff I was surprised no one picked up on a waiting customer. Overall it was great food...hot and tasty and will always stop in when we are in town.
