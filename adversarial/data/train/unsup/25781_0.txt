Went to French grocery today for some lunch. We ordered take out since we were on a time constraint. I ordered a grilled cheese and soup. Honestly I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the milk-water they call a soup. The grilled cheese was amazing! Next time I'll just get a sandwich and maybe grab a couple of macaroons. (The refrigerator was broken so they didn't have any out)
