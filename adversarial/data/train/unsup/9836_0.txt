What a nice hotel. I mean it's beautiful with all of the African artwork and hieroglyphics all over the place. The outside lights up at night and the Pharaoh statue outside is breathtaking. \n\nThe elevators are rickity and loud and scary. The best part was getting on them with a drunk person to watch them freak out..FUNNY!! Because The Luxor is the shape of a triangle when you go up  you kind of lean in and when you go down you tilt backwards..like a rollercoster..\n\nTry and get a room that is facing all the action.. our room was stuck behind all of the raised decor so our view sucked but I could care less...\n\nI swear to God if one more MLife person had come up to me and asked if \"I wanted to see a show\".. or \"how long I was staying\" I would have socked them in the face. This one lady asked me and my mom twice in the same breath. I was like \"ma'am you just saw us walk pass you!\"\n\nNice, clean hotel rooms \nLots of slots \n2 Starbucks inside\n3rd largest hotel in the US
