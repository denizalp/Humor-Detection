Everything about this place is great. Great food, great location, great atmosphere, and some of the best service I have ever had.\n\nI had the New York strip steak (naturally) medium rare, which the waiter guessed what I was ordering exactly correct pretty cool. The steak was top 3 for and reasonably priced. Best of all it was cooked to perfection. This paired with an excellent beverage selection. I couldn't have been happier!
