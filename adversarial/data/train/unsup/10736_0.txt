Do not buy any puppies from pet pros!!! They are scam artists and get sick puppies from puppy mills. Had our 6 month old sheltie for less then 10 days and 1. We had to pay a ton to get all her shots done because they hadn't given her any since her first visit!!!!! In 6 months you should have more than a first round. And 2. We spent over $400 at the vet bc she has a small intestine problem of some sort. Yeah I believe the vet they recommend is also in on it to make money. Save your money,time,heart,effort and mental well being and DO NOT go here. They also give you the run around when you call and say that within the first 10 days something is wrong with my puppy just like it states in the contract they should cover med expenses. Well not only until we were going to pursue legal action that a david wrote us back a very rude and demeaning email. I hope they get shut down and the puppies rescued. If I had a million dollars I'd do it myself!!!!
