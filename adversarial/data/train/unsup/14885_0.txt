3.5-4*\n\nRiddle:  What spreads through the Chinese community quicker than \"Guess who got into Med school?\" or \"Guess who got divorced?\"\n\nAnswer:  The newest, decent Chinese restaurant with Happy Hour!\n\nEnter Blue Lagoon Seafood Master, located at the Mississauga Chinatown.  Sorta like the city's answer to Scarborough's popular, Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant. Could this place be the saviour of this dying tourist stop??\n\nI only went for dim sum, so I'm not sure what they offer in terms of their dinner menu.  Monday - Friday, they have Happy Hour before 11am.  So that means you should arrive well BEFORE 11 so you have time to do all your ordering, allow wait time for the food to arrive, then eat it.  Most dishes are $2.60\/plate, with the exception of \"special dishes\".\n\nMost of the items that I ordered were above average in the city.  I found the steamed items not as good.  The wrapping tasted as though it was over\/twice steamed.  More attention than usual were paid to plating and presentation.\n\nDim sum for 2 ppl was approx. $30 for 8 plates, including a coupla dishes that were $6.50\/ea.  Servers were plentiful, cheerier and helpful than other places.  Would go to and recommend for anyone who wants to do dim sum in the 'ssauga!
