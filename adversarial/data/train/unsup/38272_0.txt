My last review has Thomas making a comment that i must be a competitor.  I would like to state clearly that neither my friend or myself even live in Nevada much less have anything to do with a strip club except visit when we come to town. But his response to my critical review only solidified my overall opinion of how things are run at the male venue at Hunk Mansion.  Instead of trying to rectify a situation or improve customer service..they blame the customers. .accuse them of being fake...or don't even respond.  Your competition doesnt need to put fake posts on Yelp. .you make yourself look bad with your poor service on the front and back end! !!
