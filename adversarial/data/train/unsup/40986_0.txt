What a great margarita selection! Their flavors are endless and Rachelle is always so helpful and attentive. Each time I've visited she would tell us flavors she can make that are not listed on the menu. \n\nMy friend and I made this our go-to spot every few weeks for margaritas and their amazing spinach queso dip (it's dangerously addicting). We usually sit at the bar or a high top to watch the games on the TV. Haven't tried anything else here, but definitely will next time! The great service and delicious drinks is what keeps us coming back! \n\nMake sure to get the check in offer, the Groupon deal, or check you mail for coupons! Love that there are lots of ways to save at this restaurant. Will definitely be back!
