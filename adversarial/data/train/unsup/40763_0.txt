The best Chinese in Charlotte PERIOD!!! The sesame chicken is one of the best I've ever had! Service is good and prices very fair! Everything is good and has a unique flavor. Not like most Chinese restaurants that all taste the same. This place puts its own spin on all the classic Chinese-American food you know and love! Crab rangoon is really good and unlike any I've eaten before! And I love that you can get anything \"Spicy or No Spicy\" aweee to hear that just makes me get all warm inside and smile cause I know the deliciousness that is going to be in my mouth shortly!!! And I don't even like Chinese food that much - LOL!!
