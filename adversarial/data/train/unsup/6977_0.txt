Holy Crap. These people are the most wonderful human beings of the week. I literally do not have anything bad to say about the magnificent body-workers of Triad Chiropractic. These people are saving my comfort, one vertebrae at a time.\n\nI came in here today for my first visit to aid in the repair of my neck which was traumatized in my accident. I have never been a fan of Chiropractors, its always seemed like just a quick fix with no long term results, in my experience anyhow, but Triad is not just Chiropractic care, they are so much more. I went in, was given the undivided attention of Dr. Baca, who is an angel sent from above, for about an hour, where we went over everything from my family history to the events of my accident. From there he examined me and gave his prognosis, and then the treatments began. They do everything from Spinal adjustments to x-rays to Prolotherapy to Physical Therapy to ultrasounds. Its pretty much the one stop shop for auto injuries because not only do they do everything in their power to help you and make you feel better, but they also serve as a liaison between you and the insurance company you are dealing with. Its amazing. They even recommended me to the perfect accident injury lawyer and discussed with me all the possibilities with my case.\n\nIts rare that I rave about anything to do with doctors.. I usually hate them all, but not here. I am actually wicked excited for my upcoming visits and finally feeling some relief. \n\nSeriously, even if you were not in an accident.. go here. Whether its for Headaches, Carpal Tunnel, Tendinitis, Sciatica, Chronic neck\/back pain, etc.. they will fix you!
