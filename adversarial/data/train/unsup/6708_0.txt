Upon entering, we found the place to be very attractive.  It was Saturday night and they had their share of clientele.  By the way, while the signage is immediately in front as you enter the shopping area, the entrance of the restaurant is kind of around the bend.  \n          We ordered the bruschetta which are 4 for $15.  They offer one with smoked salmon, one called PLT, one with goat cheese, etc.  One is $4.  We ordered the salmon one and the PLT which attracted me because it has prosciutto and arugula--a great combination. They arrived on a thick piece of crusty bread that had a very nice chewy texture.  What I failed to note on the menu was that it was crispy prosciutto which tasted more like crunchy pieces of bacon.  In my head I thought I was getting a luscious piece of uncooked prosciutto just as mother nature intended it.  But that was my fault for not reading the menu correctly.  Someone who doesn't mind crunchy prosciutto would probably have enjoyed it.  I didn't.  \n          The smoked salmon on the bruschetta was very light in color and the smokiness was not there.  But what do you want for $4 right?  My dining companion would not order that one again.  \n\nI ordered the shrimp scampi which professed to be sauted shrimp on angel hair pasta in a white wine butter sauce with fresh tomatoes, parsley and basil.  The angel hair pasta which is my favorite of the pastas was so overcooked it looked disintegrated--almost like a plate of ramen noodles which has been overcooked by a college freshman in the dorm.  I didn't let that deter me and began to move the pasta from the bottom to the top so as to spread the white wine butter sauce.  But really there were no more than a few tablespoons of the sauce.  The shrimp were fresh and not overcooked but there were just too much wrong with this dish to overlook.  I couldn't eat it and moved it away from me.  My companion decided that I was not going to sit there and not eat so he called the waitress over.  She took it back and offered another dish which I declined.  I was too afraid of getting another disaster and then what? \n         My companion had the chicken marsala which had two large chicken breasts which were under seasoned but not overcooked.  The marsala sauce was not overly sweet and had a sprinkling of mushrooms.        \n        Not having eaten much of anything I decided to try the desserts.  I spotted the chocolate mousse for $10.  My companion thought it was ridiculous to pay $10 for a few scoops of mousse in a champagne glass but I wanted to try it anyway.  I did.  I liked the mousse although not the best I have ever had but when you haven't had dinner anything (almost anything) tastes delicious.  \n        Milan, our server, was friendly and accommodating considering that the evening for us was a bust.  When one person gets to eat and the other one doesn't, it kind of puts a damper on things. \n \n       I think this very attractive restaurant has the potential of being something super great if only they got some amazing recipes for classic Italian dishes.  For example, my shrimp scampi did not even have a hint of garlic---isn't shrimp scampi supposed to have garlic?  And over cooking pasta is a cardinal sin of Italian cuisine and more of a sin is breaking pasta and then cooking it.  Pasta has to be put in the water in its entirety and I believe that is partially what caused the angel hair pasta to be overcooked.  How do I know this? I am a cook--not a chef but a damn good cook.  To make up for the meal at S & V, on Monday evening I made a ragu sauce with red wine over al dente rigatoni.  Yes, that's how it's done.
