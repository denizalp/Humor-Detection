I understand that good places are hard to find. So, I'll save you the trouble and let you know to pass this one by. \nWe moved into Landmark in August of 2014, and since then we've had problems getting things done and fixed. \nMove in day was a disaster. They wouldn't let us see the apartment beforehand because it was trashed. I know it was trashed because when we got there it was trashed!\nWhat a terrible welcome to your new tenants. \nWe were in a rushed to find a place to live because our house fell through so I guess it's our fault because we didn't do enough research. \nWith that being said, while we're taking care of responsibilities, this complex doesn't take any of theirs seriously. We've been out of hot water at least five or six times since August. We've had the kitchen sink worked on numerous times. The current problem is with the A\/C, we don't have any. We're not paying a ton for rent, but for what we are paying we shouldn't have cracked walls, leaky hot water heaters, holes in the walls, mold growing because of leaky pipes, broken security locks...etc(the list goes on).\nI'm one to give credit where it is due. We do have a roof over our heads, we do have working cable and power. So if you are looking for bare basics. This is your place. I pray to God in Heaven you have a \"know how\" when it comes to home improvement. If not, you'll be waiting 5 weeks for maintenance to get a 3rd call from the off-cite office to remedy your hot water situation.
