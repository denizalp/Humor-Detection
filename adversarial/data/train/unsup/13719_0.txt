OMFDOUBLEFINGOD. This place is fucking fantastic. This is what the dining experience is all about. Mom and pop place where English is the second language, and I would not have in any other way.\n\nAmazing holy fucking guacamole. Simple and perfect, right amount of lime, cilantro, salt. Simple but fantastic\n Less is more people.\n\nChicharrones, the new trend, i have been eating this porky delight since a junior in college,. My first experience with this food group was with the Villamil family in Mexico in my study abroad life altering experience.  These pork skins with a fine layer of meat do not let you down.  Served with a pica de gallo, source cream and a dollop of guacamole. Throw this shit down mis cabr√≥nes.\n\nOk now to the meat. Get the Columbian meaty meat platter. Chorizo, from the meat gods themselves, more Chicharrones, avocado, beef stew, tostones,cilantro rice, and charro beans. If you do not order this you are muy tonto. \n\nMy date had the shrimp Diablo. A shit ton of  shrimp in a smack tu madre charred mexican Hot sauce. Really good as well.\n\nThis place rocks out with their clocks out.  Totally Escobar.
