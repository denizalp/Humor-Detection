I attended a private party at the Elliot house, and I was really happy with the entire evening. \n\nThe setting is a colonial stone farmhouse, built sometime between 1836 and 1850. Although clearly renovated, it has retained all of the colonial style charms. \n\nWe had a set menu, of course, as it was an event and there were about 30 in our party. We were given a private room just off of the main lobby and it was beautifully decorated with a fireplace and all.  \n\nThe service was great, very attentive and the food was good as well. I wouldn't go as far to say that my dinner was spectacular but I was impressed that we were all served at once, no one sent anything back and it was all cooked well and good quality.  Catering to such a wide variety of tastes is difficult at the best of times, and I feel that they made a clear effort.\n\nThe set menu gave a beef, fish and vegetarian choice along with salads and desserts. The Crème brûlée was definitely the highlight of the meal.\n\nOverall the location is really special. Super unique. Very pretty and cozy. Another party was enjoying cocktails in the main room as we arrived, this would be a fantastic spot for a private cocktail party as well. \n\nLots of parking and several options for private rooms to suit parties of various sizes.
