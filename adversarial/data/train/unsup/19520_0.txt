Mellow, ramshackle, tasty cafe on Bernard with a tiny green spot in the back and live acoustic music at the piano or up front in the window. For singer-songwriters looking for afternoon gigs, Cafe Dep might be worth checking out. The coffee is strong here, the breakfast is fresh and tasty and alright, but if you're sitting in the window with a lovely crooner nearby everything tastes extra fine. (Assuming you like a crooner.)
