Ok, so I never thought I'd be writing a review for a \"nail salon\" place but here goes. Heard about Elegant Nails from a friend and decided I was going to get a pedicure for the first time in my life. Well, wish someone had told me about this sooner. I had a great experience with Julie and her staff. I was seated right away without an appointment but I'm guessing you can schedule one if you want. A nice, comfy massage chair started off the pedi process. Felt good on the back. I'm not sure exactly everything they were doing to my feet but it all felt great! The foot massage was fantastic, almost put me to sleep. Overall, I was really happy with this place and I'm considering making this a part of my normal routine when it comes to foot care.
