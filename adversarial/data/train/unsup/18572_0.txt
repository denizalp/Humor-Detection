If playing frisbee golf in a canal that's been converted into a park isn't your thing, then feast your eyes on this beast! Hills, or are they mini mountains? You decide when throwing those frisbees to your heart's delight!\n\nBe forewarned, this is not a course for the beginner. There are many desert shrubbery, trees, and other unforeseen obstacles that await you around every turn. Make sure you bring extra bright frisbees, because you can spend countless minutes, sometimes up to 15 or 20 minutes searching for them! The scenery is great though. Around this time, there are many wildflowers that grow and it's not too hot this time of year in late January and early February. \n\nThis appears to be a popular spot for frisbee golf enthusiasts because there were two groups not far in front of us and two groups after us during the midday Saturday before noon. With only 2 people, you can get through games fairly quickly, but with 4 people in our group we let some groups play through since only two of us actually had some skill while the other two didn't. I shall return though! This park offers a difference change of pace and scenery!
