A pleasant experience getting some recall work done on my vehicle. First time in, they did not have the part available. My fault, as I probably should have called ahead rather than just making an appointment using their online app the day before. An appointment for a week away was scheduled and when I arrived for that one, they had the ordered part in stock and my car was worked on, the replacement made, and I was on my way.\n\nThere's a decent waiting area here with coffee, vending machines and a large television. They also have some desk areas with outlets for those of us with laptops. The wifi worked well.\n\nI can see returning to Williams should I need some \"paid\" work done on the car.
