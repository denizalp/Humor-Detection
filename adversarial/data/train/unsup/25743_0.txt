Mattress shopping sounds very boring, and very confusing to me. I just signed a lease at Juhl and have NO furniture. So I've been putting this errand off for too long. Anyhow today I found myself in Green Valley for random errands, and decided to get my mattress situation figured out finally. I chose this place because it was nearby and had the most positive reviews out of all my options the map showed me. Melissa greeted me and I hopped around on all the firm mattresses as she politely juggled me and a pregnant couple shopping for their new mattress as well. The customer service was amazing, she explained the differences in the mattresses with such care and detail that I really felt like I could grasp the information. With her patience and help I found MY DREAm freaking mattress, no joke. I am beyond thrilled. The price was amazing and I am beyond happy with my experience here. I look forward to referring any of my friends who are mattresss shopping here because of my top notch experience and the quality bed I got. Can not wait for delivery, which by the way- they are very accommodating as I told her I start my lease and move in only 4 days from now and she organized the delivery already for that day! Thank you Melissa!!!
