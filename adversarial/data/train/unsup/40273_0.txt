I just moved to Vegas & stumbled upon Battista's Hole In The Wall, which has truly become my #1 favorite Italian Restaurant in all of Vegas!!!\n\nI absolutely love their food........you cannot go wrong, no matter what you order.    The employees are really friendly and helpful.\nCarey, who was the server helping me the first time I dined there, made my dining experience really great and she is a great part of the reason I go back.
