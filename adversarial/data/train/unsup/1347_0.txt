Great food, beautiful setting, impeccable service. The entrance doesn't look like much, but the lakeside patio seating makes you feel like you've left Las Vegas completely. Came by for a lunch during restaurant week and brought my guy for dinner.  \n\nThe goat cheese Napoleon is one of the best appetizers I've ever had, a crazy-great balance of sweet and savory coming from the honey and pistachio harmonizing with the cheese and phyllo dough. The chicken and forbidden rice dish was well-executed, particularly the black rice. Dessert was a beautiful creme brulee I was too full to finish. Server Scott was attentive, genuine, and professional throughout.\n\nThe menu had something for everyone,  and the lakeview patio is a big draw for date night.  Looking forward to coming back and browsing their wine shop!
