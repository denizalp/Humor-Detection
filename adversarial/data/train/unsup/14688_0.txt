I have been to Brar's for a few years. I'm embarrassed that I have never uploaded a single photo from any meal that I've enjoyed here and that I have never done a review. All of these issues will be fixed now!\n\nMy colleague suggested this place when we had two colleagues from India helping us out for a few months. All three of them are vegetarian. This buffet place suits their dietary needs. It also expanded my own. \n\nThis place has lunch and dinner buffets. I have been to both and they never fail. The variety is wonderful and everything is fresh. The lunch and dinner buffet prices include refills on coffee, tea, and pop. If you get the fancier drinks, such as watermelon juice or lassi, you have to shell out.\n\nIn the summer time, I love the mango salad. Mango is shredded and it is to die for! There is also a guy in the parking lot who sells cases of mangos. The restaurant uses the same mango supplier, so the guy isn't some random weirdo camping out. \n\nThere are at least a dozen different curries available. The salad bar is extensive. The soup area has four different varieties. You also have Hakka foods, such as fried rice and noodles. I love the warm naan and pakoras. There are also western food items, such as fries and veggie pizza. \n\nThe dessert section is amazing! You have a milk chocolate fountain where you can dip various chunks for fruit. There is tons of ice cream to satisfy your sweet tooth. I have a favourite dessert there, but I still haven't got a clue what it's called. It's just pure heaven. I feel incomplete if I don't have it at Brar's. \n\nThe place gets busy for dinner at 7 pm no suggest coming earlier. I did with my friend on Sunday night at 5:30 pm and we didn't have to wait. \n\nYou can order filtered water, but you have to pay extra for it. Go with tap water. It tastes fine. \n\nI love it here. I wish that this location was closer to home. I'd be there more often!\n\n(55)
