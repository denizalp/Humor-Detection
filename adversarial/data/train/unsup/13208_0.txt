OMG words cant describe how obsessed i am with this place. i can never go to a \"normal\" theater again. huge leather recliners and your able to bring your own booze? yes please! the recliners are so large my bf and i even shared one to cuddle up. I used to come to this theater as a kid and wow has it improved. I think this is a concept that will catch on fast and major kudos to thinking of it first!
