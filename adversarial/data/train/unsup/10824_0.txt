Not too late to teach this old-dog a few new tricks!\n\nMe and a buddy decided to go \"just for fun\" (not for work), to be better hosts, and everyone likes a bartender right?\n\nKeep in mind that they train us with stinky colored water, so don't get over excited... \n\nThe class is an intense two weeks. I go for 4hrs every night, 6-10pm. They really make sure you know your stuff by the time you graduate. You learn to make shooters, tall drinks, cocktails, shots, sours, margaritas, and highballs.... It's fun, exciting and challenging (proof that my memory sure ain't what it used to be). The class is a mixture of teens to seniors - most of which want to go to work (apparently their specialty is placement). \n\nI hope to graduate this Friday! To graduate you must be able to make 12 random drinks perfectly in 8min, and pass a 1hour written test -- heck, some cocktails have 8 ingredients in one drink! Brain strain!\n\nLikely the best $500 I have ever spent! \n\n*And yes, I now have a new found respect for bartenders everywhere!
