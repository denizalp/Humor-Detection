The first time I came here was just when I arrived to Montreal at the end of winter and when I stepped into the warm humid section that reminded me of home I was in-love.\n\nI read some of the reviews and yes in the weekend during winter when everything outside is frozen and cold, and you have kids you will come here so you will have long lines for tickets. If you know you are coming here you can arrive before 12 (no lines) are pre-order tickets. I due share the rant about the kids shows. There is 5  times a day (weekend) a cool kid show, only one(!) is in English. why 1 out of 5? it was crowded and not as fun. Not all kids speak French or not everyone is local plenty of tourist.\n\nYet, I gave it a five since this is a remarkable place. You can go see exotic or amazing animals\/creatures. I hate zoos since I believe the animals suffer there. In the biodome is is mostly huge open spaces so the Animals dont feel they are in a showcase, they have their space and you feel like you are observing them in their natural environment.Maybe the penguin's are is too small. I also love the fact that during winter they have a huge and FREE kids playing area near the food area and a cool FREE exhibit downstairs. I said Free but if you are from Quebec its only 14$ and if you are a student its around 10$ great price for such a cool place. My kid loves it ! \nCool place, unique, close to a metro, offers some free stuff, great for photos a sure 5 star
