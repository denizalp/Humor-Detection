The meals at this restaurant are not your regular Thai dishes. They are elevated with beautiful presentation and delicious flavors that tantalize your taste buds.\nThe shrimp was cooked to perfection with a spicy and tangy noodles. The hand wrapped shrimp rolls were the best I ever had and the peanut sauce was outstanding.\nThe entire staff at this restaurant were female....never seen that before.\nI highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner or just a night out with friends. You won't be disappointed.
