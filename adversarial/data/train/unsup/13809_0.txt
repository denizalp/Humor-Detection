My dear friend Marisa S. introduced me to the Wine Warehouse for an Oregon wine tasting event!  This is an adorable boutique wine house with a tasting table and lots of wine to choose from.  The staff I met was extremely nice; I had the pleasure of meeting Sharon and Patrick.  We chatted about wine, pets, children, silly Canadians sitting on the adorable patio and everything in-between.  We tasted some good complimentary wines from a distributor representing their Oregon wines and I also had a flight of white wines from the tasting bar.  Happy hour has $2 off per glass and $5 off a flight.  Also they have complimentary tasting events every Tuesday and Friday with light bites to nibble at (cheeses, crackers, nuts, veggies etc).  I had a great time here and will be back if I am feeling thirsty for some vino...which is quite often ;)
