It was ok sushi. Nothing especially memorable. Not family friendly in that the names of the rolls are not fit to be said by littles. The service was not so good unless you were a regular. Smiles and sunshine for regulars. We are looking for a regular sushi place and this will not be it. The rolls themselves are 101 ways to dress up a california roll. Pass.
