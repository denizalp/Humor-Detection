Constantly forgetting customer service bed side manner.  Manager...Ashley is very rude and doesn't know the business or products.    I'm telling everybody I recommended to find somewhere else.  When you approach the staff they all act dumb.  Forgetting towels constantly and say it's our job to remind them.
