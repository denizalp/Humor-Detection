Had a great experience here, tonight! My boyfriend and I were looking for a place that was relaxing and yummy because we didn't want to cook. Perfect comfort food.\n\nService: Our waitress, Red, totally made our night. She is clever, funny, and sarcastic -- just our cup of tea. Ginger friends forever, we love ya! #hiddenginger\n\nAtmosphere: relaxed, but nice. Come in nice clothes or casual clothes, no one cares. There is a private (ish) area for large parties and a full bar (yummmm).\n\nFood: My boyfriend had the Blackened Chicken and loved it. I had the salmon and asked for it to be burned. The manager came out and actually had a discussion with me about how well-done I wanted my salmon -- awesome service!!! And they got it right! THE FIRST TIME! Absolutely amazing. This is the first restaurant to understand me.\n\nGo here, eat here, have fun here. Great place!\n\nP.S. You can color on the tablecloths. Coloring AND  eating! Can't get ant better. Get creative, people!
