Worst hotel EVER. Noisy. Could hear the people in the next room doing the nasty. For 2 hours. The woman sounded happy. The hallway at 2:30 was noisy. In the morning. When the room was made up, they left the USED cup from the night before, with water still in it!!  \n\n\nThe on site restaurant was the absolute worst food I've eaten. And there's nothing close so it's your only choice. The complimentary breakfast was terrible. Bad service. Bad food. \n\nI would NEVER stay here. Ever.
