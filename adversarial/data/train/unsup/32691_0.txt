This was the first and definitely not the last Brazilian Steakhouse if they are anything compared to here! It was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. The atmosphere was chilled, the restaurant seemed clean and the food was delicious. It's a really fun evening out as the chefs are continuously coming round with freshly cooked meats, until you tell them to stop it'll keep coming. They have a full Buffett with all your sides, but my tip is not to fill your plate with sides as there's so much meat. Next time I'm in Calgary I will definitely check it out again!
