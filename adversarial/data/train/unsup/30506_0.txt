Love the outdoor seating and live music. \n5 stars for the atmosphere. 3 stars for the food and service.\nAsked for decaf herbal tea options but was told they weren't sure which teas were decaf. What the heck? The manager\/owner came out and gave me a decaf option after I stated I didn't want to order unless I know if the tea was decaf. My tea was weak and not steeped long enough. They used leaf leaves instead of bags. I did like that. \nOrdered the oatmeal with fruit and nuts. It was ok. Super hungry after hiking and waiting so long for the food. I did eat it all. The bowl they served my oatmeal in had 2 large chips in it which I found extremely disturbing. \nService was ok though they weren't very friendly at all. Nobody was. \nMy husband ordered a breakfast burrito and it took 30 minutes before it was served. \nNice for atmosphere but skip the food ;-(
