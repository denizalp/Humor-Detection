If I could leave negative stars I would. Took over an hour to deliver. When I received my order it was $10 more than the price originally given on the phone. The idiots got both orders wrong, and when I called to speak with the manager he told me he had been in this business a long time and knew more than I did. Really? Well at least now I know not to order from a disgusting and overpriced restaurant (if you could even call it that) with even more disgusting customer service. You'd be better off buying microwave lasagna from Albertsons.
