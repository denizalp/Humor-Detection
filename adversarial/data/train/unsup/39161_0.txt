EBC is the #1 pool party in Vegas that I always hit up! Every other pool party I have gone to isn't as fun or classy as EBC & ends up being a disappointment. And if you're from LA, you are always bound to run into someone you know. Beautiful people everywhere, drinks are fire, bartenders are fast, lots of room to lounge & chill, great food options, always a known DJ playing & just good vibes overall. I can't even count the number of times I have came here & have never been disappointed. Kaskade played over the weekend & always throws it down. The DJ before Kaskade was amazing too. I took a friend who has never been & he said it was the best party he has been to in Vegas. Always a great time!
