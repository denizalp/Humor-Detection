I'd give this place 4 stars cuz it was a breeze buying a vehicle from them, the parts department is a joke.  Very lazy and un-organized.  Was told I was going to get my part in 7-10 business days, after a month still no part and only to find out it's on back order.  I gave up and will have to get it somewhere else.
