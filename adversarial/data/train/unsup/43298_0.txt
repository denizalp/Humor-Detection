Boy there are a lot of  JB'S who stay here.  I love this place, there is no place like it.  The vegetation abounds. You walk in the the complex and it is 10 degrees cooler then Scottsdale Rd. Between the plants and the water it cools things down.  But that's not what makes it so wonderful,  the architecture is in a class by itself.  I've stayed in a number of different units and one thing I have learned is that each unit is different.  I love the racquetball and indoor basketball courts, and the fitness center is number one. I'd highly recommend this complex to anyone looking to spend and extended time in Scottsdale.  By the way, the location is terrific,  an easy walk to restaurants and the mall.
