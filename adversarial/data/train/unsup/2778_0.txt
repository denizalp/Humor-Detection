If you favorite suchi is california roll - don't go to that place, go to Giant Eagle deli counter... or bring some antiemetics with you.\nThis restaurant completely blew me away, swept me off my feet with a delicious, authentic suchi I never heard of! \nIf you are an adventerous raw-fish eater, you will be in heaven!  Sea Urchin and squid, seeweed salad, egg-custard...yum!\nService is always excellent, drinks are delicious...\nGood restaurant to test your compatabilty with your date : it was a restaurant of a choice for our first (blind) date with my boyfriend...Once we were munching away together on Urchin, we both realized : raw fish eaters are rare to come by and should definetely stay together!\nUpside: sushi as good as they get\nDownside: hard to find and could use more advertisement
