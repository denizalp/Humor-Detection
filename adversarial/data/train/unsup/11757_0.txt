Very friendly service, casual cool atmosphere and great food! \n\nI came with a party of 7 including kids and we felt very comfortable and welcome, from the get go the waitress was super sweet and funny, she gave us suggestions on the menu and a little background about the place which made us feel like we were part of the family, it was nice, she did that with everybody.  Loved all the decor, by coincidence we went on 9\/11 and sat at the 9\/11 memorial table. They let their customers leave a mark on their walls, who couldn't love a place that lets you write on the walls? The owner was actually in the kitchen cooking and gave us a friendly wave when we left.  \n\nNow about the food, we started with one of their huge Greek Salads which was really good, good portions of feta, olives and peppers. For dinner I couldn't decide between one of their dinners or pizza so I got both, don't judge me  =P  You can order a slice for just $2.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs which was good, not the best I've ever had but good, the portions were huge and it came with a good size side of garlic bread. I had a slice of their white pizza which I actually loved, they have awesome pizza that definitely compares to what I've had in New York. I tasted their eggplant parm and chicken parm off my family's plates and they were actually really really good, especially for the price and came with huge sides of spaghetti. I had a drink called a Nice based on our waitresses recommendation, it's an Italian Ice drink with vodka, creme and a flavored syrup, I picked orange. It was good, really strong, they didn't scrimp on the alcohol, I should add a fifth star for that alone =) They also serve wine and beer.\n\nI can't decide which I love more,  the ambience, the waitress or the pizza... either way I will definitely be back for all =)
