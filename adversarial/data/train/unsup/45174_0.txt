I order two separate items on black friday for Christmas. I was billed and received confirmation for both.   Both orders were set to deliver by Christmas. On the 20th both items were canceled and the products labeled out of stock. There solution to the problem was telling me that I was more than welcome to purchase some other products that are in stock. Waited 25 days and 2 hours on hold for them to tell me they screwed me. These deals don't exist. They just use them as a ruse to get you to their website.
