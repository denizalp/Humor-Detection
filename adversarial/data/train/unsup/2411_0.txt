Still small, still family-owned, and still the best place in town for some Korean-Mexican fusion food!\n\nDon't think I've been here in a minute...so many places in Vegas to get a bite to eat!  But the wifey was feeling nachos, and I was jonesin' for some kind of banchan when it just clicked..KoMex!!\n\nInside is a bit nicer now with some new chairs & tables, I think a newer TV too.  But thankfully the food is still the yummy same!  I would almost kill for that salsa\/Korean hot sauce combo they use, hits all the right taste notes!\n\nWe got the Fusion Nachos with Chicken and the Fusion Quesadilla with Beef to share.  OMG - still delicious!  Nachos were full of seasoned, grilled chicken, lots of cheese & jalapenos, lots of pico, and lots of that Korean hot sauce!  Spicy & cheesy!  The quesadilla was just as good, nothing but bulgogi beef & a ton of cheese!  So enticing with the perfect crust on the tortilla from the grill!  Crisp on the outside but gooey on the inside!\n\nNo Korean drama here folks, just some damn fine eats!!
