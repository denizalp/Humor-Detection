Best place to drink EVER. Bartenders are as good as making drinks as they are throwing the bottles around. For $10 you can get a mighty strong drink, and between $30-50 you can get the 1.5-3ft souvenir cups.  I handed my friend one of the 3ft-ish purple ones for his 21st birthday...and he lost 7 hours of his life (and a pain to take care of, but we're not reviewing him).\n\nYou don't even need to know what to drink, just tell the bartender what flavors you're feeling like and they'll whip you up something AMAZING.  My *first* there was Vache, whom I saw for the first time 4 years ago, and was still there last week.  \n\nLive band, crazy antics like juggling flaming bottles or balancing giant stacks of bottles (see photos), giving shots with whipped cream shaped penises (also see photos), random pouring free shots directly into people's mouths...3-4 hours here will fly like time has never flown before.
