I love Formocha's original milk tea but today I decided to try something different and ordered Taro Coconut milk tea and it tasted absolutely TERRIBLE!!! I honestly can't drink it. I saw them putting Taro and Coconut Powder into the milk tea and shake. I was already disappointed at that time because I can't drink powder flavor. \n\nI thought they would use real ingredient because their original milk tea is really good. But I was really disappointed today. It costs $6 plus tax for the drink that I can't drink. \n\nI would come back still for original milk tea but I honestly never want to try any other drink beside it. Taro Coconut milk tea should be taken out of the menu. The combination is very odd!!!!
