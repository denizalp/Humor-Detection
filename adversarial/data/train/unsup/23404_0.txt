You should definitely think about heading there super early or taking the shuttle bus from the train station, or else you will be stuck in the long line of traffic trying to get into park.\n\nRemember folk it is a cash only to get in so make sure you bring lots of cash in your wallet!\n\nIt was a beautiful day to stroll around in and out of the tents and buildings taking in all the sights and sounds of the hustle and bustle. \n\nThe typical Epicure, scentsy, tupperware ladies where there. And then there was so many booths with all sort of jams, honeys, breads, tea fudge, cookies. OMG it was pretty decent. There was also some crafty people there selling knitted sweaters, decorated wine glass and all sorts of things. \n\nIt was super busy but a great afternoon out about. And as a tip pets are not allowed please don't bring your dog and tie him up outside the gate while you go and shop your little heart out.\n\nThe light are also amazing! make sure you check it out next year!
