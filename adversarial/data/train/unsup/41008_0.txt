I thought I found the worst car rental company from my previous experience with Payless car rental back in 2015. But no, this place sure claims the top spot of worst car rental ever. Customer service is non-existent. The previous review is correct. These guys tried hard to upsell their auto insurance. When I declined, they just laughed at my face. They will insult you and threaten you if you insist on not purchasing their insurance. \n\nAgain, as previous review mentioned, this place is considered off-site. You will have to take two shuttles to get there.\n\nI reserved a compact vehicle but they gave me a Mercedes mini van. I was shocked when they showed me the car. I went back to the office to ask for another car. They said they went out of car but there were two groups of people came in after me got their compact.\n\nRecommendation:\nRead the yelp reviews before you rent a car from them.
