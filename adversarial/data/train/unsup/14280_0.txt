As of today, 5 March 2013 CE, I still have not received a single, zinc cent of my educational benefits for the 2013 spring semester, although right around the corner 'Spring Break' approaches -- hell, mid-terms loom on the horizon -- shit, soon it will be summer. Fuck, I'll be graduating to UNLV soon (moving on to be another VA office's problem, one which is not exactly the most highly rated in the multiverse either: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/unlv-veterans-services-las-vegas).\n\nOh, there will be some expletives in this review; ye mormons be warned. Perhaps I should have stated that earlier. Ah, who gives a fuck.\n\nIt is March goddammit; I submitted my paperwork in January. \nI am not even a new student at this shitty school. I am guessing new students get entitlements paid out sometime in the 20's (2020). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA break in the two-star review for a 'The More You Know...' PSA:\nDid YOU know that the Veterans Affairs (VA) Department spent an inordinate amount of taxpayer funds (200 mil [probably less than that, but two hund mil just rolls off the tongue]) to have specialized software developed so they can just automate the whole fucking claims boondoggle and only have to audit the very small percentage that have significant errors requiring human intervention? They have the technology; just don't feel like using it. They are hand-pulling every single fucking claim, I don't know how many times, and pulling out their dumb ass iPhones so that they can access their calculator and do them all manually, because they simply like how it all looked in Revolutionary Road (the book was better).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn sum - untrained, blind monkeys, who occasionally work for a couple of minutes every hour, but whose day really consists of chasing each other around and fucking a football could do a better job at processing claims than the CSN Charleston VA office. \n\nI can now rest assured that I have driven my point across. \n\n\"But why the two stars, E? Give them ZERO (one)!!!\" \n\nExtra pity star since they did not take my paperwork and just shred or burnbag it, but that is not something the aforementioned disabled primates would have done either so let's not go handing out medals, citations, or coins for such 'accomplishments'. Fucking VA probably would. - E
