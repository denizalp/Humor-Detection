We went to Kiss The Cook for first time two weeks ago. Even tho we had to wait it really was the 15 minutes we were told. The place was very crowded but server was friendly. Pretty good green chili omelette and Cajun eggs Benedict.  Went a second time last Sunday, this time the server was distracted, didn't bring the mini muffins until asked and coffee refills were non existent. We had the green chili omelette and special Burger Slider eggs Benedict which was English muffin -except not on mine, hamburger patties-the size of half dollars one undercooked  and one extremely overcooked, grilled onions-except not on mine, grilled tomato- one very thin slice for two eggs, eggs, sauce, and cheddar cheese-again except not on mine. The food came out 5 minutes apart with the Benedict first.  When we said something to the server about the missing parts of the Benedict her response was \"Oh, I'm sorry\".  That was it.  When we told the hostess\/cashier about the poor food quality...same response \"Oh, I'm sorry\".  We tried to get someone from Kiss The Cook to acknowledge poor food, poor service and poor responsibility.  Never happened.  We eat breakfast out every weekend. We will not be returning to this place.
