In general, a nice place and we had a very friendly server. I would probably give it a 3.5 if that was an option. And I would put it in the second-tier classes of good restaurant in Pittsburgh. It is a good experience but not excellent. This was my third time being there and all three times ordered their big salad but this time with Tofu. The option without Tofu is definitely better.  The tofu was quite without any taste and somewhat destroyed the salad experience. Also, the iceberg lettuce in the salad does not contribute to much of a great experience. Overall, I had a better memory of the dish that my recent experience.
