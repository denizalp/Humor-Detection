While we were happily downing our wine, trying not to listen to the repetitive trance club music and anticipating our food, our kick-ass server brought us these scrumptious little pastries stuffed with comt√© cheese. I probably could have just eaten 30 more of those and called it a day, but I digress.\n\nSome other things our party had:\n- the best bread basket ever\n- roasted cauliflower\n- roasted beet salad with arugula and burrata\n- crispy duck egg with asparagus and ham\n- duo of Cumbrae beef\n- brown trout\n- Nova Scotia halibut\n- madeleines\n\nPortions were on the small end of the spectrum (you'd probably want a side dish or two) but thumbs up for taste and presentation.\n\nI don't eat meat and Alex, our waiter, happily offered to double up on the asparagus that came with our duck egg. How refreshing to not be penalized for wanting a dish sans something - these days, the norm seems to be either a smaller portion, an extra charge, or worst, the lame \"no substitutes\". Then entirely of his own accord, Alex brought out the ham separately for our carnivorous dining companions. Totally awesome and thoughtful. \n\nSomeone must have overheard that it was my belated birthday because they sweetly lit a candle in our dessert basket of madeleines. Those madeleines! So warm. SO FLUFFY. I wanted to Honey I Shrink Myself and crawl inside.\n\nIn summation: art was terrible, food was great, but service was even better.
