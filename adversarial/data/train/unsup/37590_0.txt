Now THIS is a bakery! Evyerhing seems as if it's made in-house. You walk in and the smell of fresh bread and pastries hits you in the face. It's awesome. You can even see the huge bakery thru an entrance near the front. I had a few of the cookies and they were really good. Everything seems as if the little old ladies that work there made it all by hand (until you see the big machines in the back! lol). Even the signs for the displays look like Grandma made them and the bread that's just a day old is deeply discounted...all the women there seems as if they've been working there for years and were very polite. \n\nThis beats Wal*Mart for sure!
