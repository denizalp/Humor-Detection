When I began my search for pizza similar to the kind I eat when visiting Italy, many people recommended Pizzeria Libretto. Not wanting to be disappointed, I decided to try this restaurant during lunch because their lunch special was very tempting:\n\nLunch Prix Fixe Monday - Friday $15\n\nPrimi\nArugula Salad or Beet Caprese Salad\n\nPizza\nMargherita D.O.P or Marinara D.O.P.\n\nSubstitute any pizza on the menu $5\n\nDolci\nBiscotti or Gelato (one scoop)\n\nAnd what can I say? I fell in love with both salads-the arugula salad has walnuts and pear! I love pears in my salad. I also love beets and mozarella. So the salads alone had me loving the restaurant. But now to the pizza. When it comes to pizza, I am a big believer that  if you can make a simple pizza well (my favorite pizza is Margherita-with only three ingredients), then you have proven yourself as a pizza maker. It's easy to mask a pizza with sauces, cheese, ingredients, herbs, etc. But how many can make a pizza taste delicious with 3 toppings? Well, Pizzeria Libretto certainly knows how to create a delicious pizza that transported me back to Italy. The three toppings on the Margherita pizza is tomato, basil, mozzarella and after the first bite, I could taste each individual ingredient; the cheese, the fresh basil and the homemade tomato sauce. I was a happy camper. \n\nAnother item that I always order but it is a hit or miss for me is the Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti. How can you go wrong with house-made gnocchi with crema fresca, lemon, chives, rosemary? Well, it goes wrong when it lacks seasoning and the gnocchi is not fried enough so rather than having a crispy texture, you get soft pieces of gnocchi (I like my gnocchi crispy on the outside with a soft and fluffy interior). And yet, I always order it because when it is done right, it is phenomenal!\n\nAnd.....\n\nAlways remind the staff about the free bread. Their bread is moist, flavored with rosemary, and worth the trip to Pizzaria Libretto. Now if I could only get the recipe!
