In the universe of Italian gelato, I would say this place rates so-so. Amorino is artisanal gelato that's sold in 'boutiques' around the world. I've seen them all over Europe and there are also a few locations in California (LA and San Francisco) and in a few other states. The location in Vegas was my first time stopping by one of these stores.\n\nIf you visit late at night (which we did) they run out of some of the flavors and they also run out of the flower-shaped cones. Therefore we had to settle for small cups which can accommodate up to 2 gelato flavors. I had the tiramisu which is actually one of my favorite flavors but it was much too heavy on the coffee. For my other flavor I had the amarena which was pretty good. The gelato was creamy but definitely not the best I've had. \n\nThe store is in a prime location on the LINQ promenade. There are a few tables including a high-top area and some couches by the fireplace. What a nice cozy area for those frequent 110-degree Las Vegas days. \n\nSince it's Vegas you can expect to pay an arm and a leg for everything, so the small gelato was $6.
