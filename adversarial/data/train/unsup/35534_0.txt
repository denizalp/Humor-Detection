Had an appointment yesterday for the first time as a new patient. After an hour wait I saw the doctor. After the doctor realized I didn't need surgery on my arm afterall, he was a complete ASS!  He recommended that I come back in 1 month for a followup to check the healing process of my broken arm. The staff could not have been more RUDE and UNHELPFUL in making a follow up! I actually work for a large group of physicians myself in a large practice and I have never heard any staff treat patients like this! If we did we would be out of a job! Worst customer service ever! Do n yourself a favor and find a different group ! Needless to say, I will NOT return to this office ever again! So disappointed!
