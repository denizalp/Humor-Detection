Went to see Pauly D @ $60.00 a ticket....not a problem with the price. Pauly D should stick to The Jersey Shore because he is horrible as a DJ!!! The patrons at this place are young, rude and low lifish....I witnessed not one, not two, but THREE girl fights!! WTF??? The tall, attractive bartender (long dark wavy hair) poured me 'water' with cranberry juice - 7 drinks and I was as sober as when I arrived....I guarantee you, owner of this bar, you have some staff pocketing drink tabs...come on...two drinks I and I am usually wasted....what a rip off place....filthy bathrooms (women's) and overall, a dive!!!
