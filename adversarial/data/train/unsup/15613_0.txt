*** Review is for Restaurant Week August 2104 Menu ***\n\nI was to the VooDoo Steal restaurant about 10 years ago but hadn't been back since.  Restaurant Week gave me the impetus to go for dinner and to check out the new zip line attraction from the patio.\n\nYou have to check in on the second floor of the Rio's Masquerade Tower and then ride the glass elevator up the side of the building to the next to top floor.  The restaurant was almost empty at 5:30 when I arrived.  \n\nI was seated quickly at a window table facing the Bellagio and other south Strip properties across the freeway.  I was soon brought menus--I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  I ordered an iced tea which was soon at the table and I got a nice basket of bread.\n\nFor the first course, I got the classic French onion soup.  It was a good rendition of this soup that I haven't gotten in quite some time.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the flat iron steak extra rare.  It was a little too cooked for me but not enough to make me grimace.  The cut by nature is not the most tender steak cut but it has a lot of good flavor.  The red wine reduction added to the good beef flavor.\n\nFor dessert, I chose the assorted ice creams.  In this case, there were three dips of ice cream, pistachio, coffee, and vanilla with some fresh berries.\n\nService was very good.  My empty artificial sweetener packets were removed from the table as soon as a server or busser walked by.  Iced tea was refilled before my glass was empty, and plates were cleared in a timely manner.\n\nAfter I ordered, my server told me to enjoy the patio and that I should feel free to take my iced tea outside with me.  This gave me a chance to take some photos and to check out that new zip line.  When I went back in, the server said he'd start my order.  This happened on my first visit years ago, and it's a nice touch especially for tourists who want to get photos of themselves with the resort corridor hotels behind them.\n\nThis was a good meal but it's not a place I'd regularly visit.  It's nice now and then for the view, but there are better values closer to home.  But we all have to be tourists in this wonderful city and this is a good way to do it!
