I bought a new unit from Mesa 2 years ago and loved their service. However, I had some problems with it keeping up with the hot and humid weather we have been experiencing in Vegas.  The older gentleman got up on my roof and checked things out, came down and told me that everything is looking fine and the unit is working as expected.  I asked him why would it not keep up? He explained that the new refrigerant 410A does not work the same as the old R-22 and that it actually loses some of its cooling abilities especially when it is humid and hot.  He explained that he has lived in the Vegas Area since 1970 and has never seen the humidity so high during the hottest portion of the year (I agreed since I've been here for 25 years) \n\nThis was in direct conflict with the Silverstate Refrigeration tech that came out the day before. He said there was a possible blockage, need to replace the drier filter, and the compressor because it was probably damaging the compressor too. (Hmmm) He said that my unit was under warranty, which I knew but gave me an estimate of $1200 for labor.  Just spoke with him and told him to not come out to fix it.  Wow! Living in Las Vegas you need to watch this stuff all the time.
