I used to rate them higher, but I am noticing very defined changes, ie Menu and tonight the Birthday program. They gave one meal to the Birthday Girl in this case, now its just a discount.  She expected her meal free, but only a discount.  Now on to the food, Person 1,The Santa Fe Skillet, I believe. She found it too spicy.  Person 2 $10.00 crave pan meal, with chicken had lots of Bacon. Really? If She wanted lots of Bacon she would have ordered a Bacon titled meal.   Person 3, Fries, these tasted better than previous times. Person 4 had a Caesar Salad, asked for Shrimp to be added but only the deep fried Shrimp so she passed on this. Her Salad was not as good as she expected either. \nThe Zesty Nachos eaten up by the others. its okay but a bit spicy.   Also expect Pork where ever they can throw it in. \nAll I can say is expect spicy to tastes, no birthday cake given to birthday girl or guy. I was not liking this place so my return will take a lot longer to return. This place needs to get better menu and promos.    This place is convenient in location by Deerfoot Meadows, but access can be a problem, requiring u-turn unless you enter through Sandman Inn.
