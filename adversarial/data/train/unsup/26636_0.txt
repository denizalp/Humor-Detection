This hotel is conveniently located in the center of Montreal, right in front of the Congress Center and a short walk from the Notre-Dame Cathedral and the old town. \nI recently stayed here for a whole week and truly enjoyed the experience. \nMy room was clean albeit a bit outdated, the reception staff was impeccable and professional at all times. \nThere is a small coffee and pastry shop inside the hotel which is very good if you are craving for a fresh coffee and a croissant before starting your day.
