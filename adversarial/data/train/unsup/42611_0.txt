The atmosphere is nice, digital menu boards are easy to read.  Staff was friendly enough.  I ordered a double cheeseburger, fries (paid an extra 77 cents for salt and vinegar \"topping\"), and a medium drink.  I paid $12.79.  \n\nThe burger was small, somewhere between a real burger and a slider.  It was an ok burger, not great.  Not much flavor in the beef itself.  There were plenty of fries (total price of fries $3.74), and they were good.  But I think it's hard to distinguish yourself as a restaurant based on fries - they have to be good, but they don't make the meal.  Lots of choices on new age drink fountains.  \n\nIf I visit again I'll try a hot dog.  That's probably the only reason I'd go back - to try that part of the menu.  My opinion - The Rail, FlipSide, for gourmet (B-Spot to if you're near one), and Swensons for a fast food type of burger.  I don't see how BurgerFi fits into the \"Burgerfication\" of the nation.
