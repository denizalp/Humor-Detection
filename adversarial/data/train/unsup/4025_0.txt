I was very pleased with the girl who first showed us around very nice and knowledgeable. However, the other young girls seem to have a attitude problem know little about the machines and are inexperienced in general. Very unhappy!!! You go there to be pampered, not hammered! Sauna was cold!!! Long waiting times! Rude people and I felt unwelcome there! One girl said ugmm your coming every day! Like as if it was a problem... I did purchase a month of services. But all they care about is charging you 2 dollars for this 5 for that 15 20 every machine you use it cost money to buy what you need!     Did I mention how young the girl was? I didn't know they hire 18 year olds.  Lol wow.  Ladies beware!!!!
