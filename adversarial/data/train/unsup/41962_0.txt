The Westin employs racist \"security  specialists\" and \"managers\" who blatantly lie about what they've said to me, and they accuse and insinuated that I was doing something illegal in my room. Believe me, as I have video recorded my interactions with these inadequately trained employees. I will never go there again after being discriminated against my age and the colour of my skin. The Westin should invest in training for their employees on cultural sensitivities. Jessica - the manager on duty, and the security specialists - Mai and Andrew, should really be mindful of what they say and how they act towards registered guests of the hotel. I would never recommend anyone staying here. You're better off booking with AirBnB. I also found from what I can assume to be a pair of dirty socks and long johns in my hotel room. Pretty disgusting treatment and stay at the Westin. Beware!
