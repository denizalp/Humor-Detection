Had lunch today at John Cutter which I would classify it as upscale bar food. Had the bone in rib eye, house salad, and the Philly fries. The food overall is excellent for bar food in addition to having a reasonable price point. My sister and I shared the entire meal and the cost was less than $30 which was a bargain. On Sundays, all steaks are half off. The wait staff was very attentive and the ambiance was very relaxed. I really like the Philly fries which was very unique. The dish was a plate of french fries that is covered with cheese sauce, mushrooms, onions and shaved steak which was really good. Overall, if you want a great steak at reasonable prices, you really can't go wrong with John Cutter
