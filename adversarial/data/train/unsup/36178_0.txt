Completely lovely in every way! The delicious food, wonderful people, and soothing decor. :) We enjoyed the kanapki, kartofle, and pierogis. The mixed drinks and authentic Polish beer (Okocim) more than hit the spot. Everything we had was bursting with flavor! Great job Apteka crew - can't wait to come back.
