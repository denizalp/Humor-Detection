Noodle place where you pick ingredients from a sheet and they combine it for you in the kitchen. The theme is healthy, but surprisingly the food is actually quite tasty with good textures to follow.\n\nSlightly higher prices than other noodle places, but the quality of the ingredients and the option to get slightly different dishes is worth the extra cost. Worth a visit to get unique noodle combinations.
