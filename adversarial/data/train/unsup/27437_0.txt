Guess what! They have renovated the checkouts!  Removed the self-checkouts and switched to the single queue system.  That can be so great... like at Winner's...you are never stuck in the slow lane.  UNFORTUNATELY THEY FORGOT TO HIRE ENOUGH STAFF.  I waited 14 minutes, in a line-up that had 18 people in it at one point, to spend $400.00. There were two cashiers...two slooooow ones.  I even called the store from the line, and was told there were no other cashiers.  I was so close to walking out, but you are trapped in the stupid line.  Renewing my Amazon Prime right now.
