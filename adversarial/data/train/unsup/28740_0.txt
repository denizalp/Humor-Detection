GREAT LUNCH PLACE! When people hear \"The Keg\", it's likely their mind goes right to \"supper\". No doubt The Keg at suppertime is something special but it also happens to be great at lunch too! I had their Prime Rib Sandwich recently and Prime those ribs were. The meat was tender and the ciabatta bread it came with was toasted to near perfection. Our waiter was very friendly. Not too overbearing & our group even enjoyed some small talk with him. Great lunch wine selection too, if you're not a \"wine at lunch\" type of person - you'll easily be converted at The Keg!
