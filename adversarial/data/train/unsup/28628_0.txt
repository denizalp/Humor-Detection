I've been with Dr. Vicuna for over a couple of years now. She's definitely knowledgeable and friendly. I haven't had many bad experiences with optometrists at all really, but the staff here are always welcoming with my entire family, so there's absolutely nothing I can complain about. I highly recommend Dr. Vicuna to any local or tourist in need of an optometrist.
