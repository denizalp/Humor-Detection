A hard case clutch with a shiny brass skull clasp. Nice!\n\nVery interesting stuff. I would have never come in here if it weren't for my sister the make-up artist\/fashion guru. \n\nThey had the square blunt toed shoes that apparently Sarah Jessica Parker wore to the Sex and the City premier. Oh, they were flying off the shelves after she wore them! \n\nMy husband was impressed with the sans-a-belt pants. Hey look! No belt! If Brad Pitt is wearing them, they must be in! \n\nAnyways, I'd never buy anything here but it was cool to look around!
