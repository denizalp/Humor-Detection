You have to be a fan of Nathan's to love this spot! The food is spot on and is like any other Nathan's folks. The staff is also awesome and extremely friendly. Prices might be slightly higher due to being established in the hotel, but it's still an awesome options for a quick bite. Less than $15 for a fast meal. I'm a fan!\n\nOrdered the hot dog, chicken fingers and fries. Was nice and full and ready to tackle the Vegas night. It's also located on the same level as the arcade or roller coaster. This alone had a nostalgic feeling bringing back memories of Coney Island as a kid.\n\nThere's enough tables to dine in or take it to go. The service is pretty fast and its made to order so don't stop here if your in immediate rush.
