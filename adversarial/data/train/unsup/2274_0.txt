Omg, I think I'm in love with this buffet!  I actually came here twice! LOL i know!  My boyfriend's grad weekend, we decided to take him here and of course I let him pick all the places to eat! After coming here the first time for brunch, he liked it so much that he wanted to make a trip to here again before we left.\n\nFor brunch, we came on a Sunday, the price was $25 a person.\n\nThere's so much variety here!  The quality is pretty good too! My favorite is the thai food. I was skepitcal that it wasn't going to be really good thai food but it comes pretty close! my favorite is their green curry! It's pretty spicy too!\n\nI literally got a bite of everything here. I was so stuffed.  But I had a system, I would only take one bite of whatever I got and moved onto the next item!\n\nWhat I also love about this place is that wine and beer are included! I loved their cider! My boyfriend loved their root beer! They have the thomas kemper root beer there! \n\nTheir dessert, omg, I liked all of them! \n\nThis place is really great! I did knock down a star because it's off the strip!  It's a bit of a drive!  You need a car to get here! Don't even think about cabbing it! =(
