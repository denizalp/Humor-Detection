First time we came in I asked them to check my daughter for RSV. The doctor told me there was no need and sent me home with no medication and told me I would just have to give it time before my daughter was better. Two days later I took her to her pediatrician and she had RSV and a double ear infection. \n\nSecond time I took her in I thought she had a UTI. She had just recently had surgery on her bladder because of an issue with chronic UTIs, so they needed to get a urine sample and send it off for cultures. They cathed her and told me they would have the results in a few days. My daughter's doctor calls them for the results and they never sent her sample to the lab! So essentially they just tossed her urine sample in the trash and THEY USED A CATHETER ON MY DAUGHTER FOR NO REASON. I am so utterly appalled by this facility. I'm never coming back, and Phoenix Children's Hospital should be embarrassed to have their name on this building.
