My stay at the Bellagio was nothing short of amazing. A fountain view with access to the Chairman's lounge is the only way I'll ever be able to go back to Vegas. The buffet? Not that great. Air quality in the casino? Awful. But macarons and coffee with a splash of Bailey's available when I need it, WORTH IT. Also, those slippers? Never wanted to take them off. The Chairman's lounge is so worth it, skipping the lines for registration and a limo to and from the airport. YES. \n\nThe real reason for my five stars--I started my period early. So I hadn't packed tampons. I call our VIP number:\n\nMe: Hi, I uh, have a weird question.\nLady: Yes, ma'am.\nMe: Well, I know sometimes at hotels if you forget your toothbrush or something they can bring you up one. \nLady: Yes.\nMe: Uh, you wouldn't happen to have any tampons would you?\nLady: Yes, ma'am. We can have those right up for you.\n\nAND IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES I had 6 (yes 6!!) tampons delivered to me in a cute little Bellagio gift bag. I also feel like they left me extra chocolates during turndown service that night which is always appreciated.
