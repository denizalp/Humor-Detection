The best french fries ever! We had the grilled salmon with some grilled squash and zucchini with a basil reduction and some olive oil.  They company and cauliflower was well peppered and beautifully textured. If ever in Phoenix again I would love to come back here and sit try all the other delicious things I saw on the menu. Victoria is the worlds best waitress ever!\n\nThe wine is exquisite. The stemware is Riedel. That says it all.
