I was more than excited to try this place out. Not only have I seen it all over Instagram, but I also LOVE eating cookie dough. \n\nThe first reason I give this place a 3\/5 stars is the parking was a little complicated. I felt that it is great spot if you plan to eat dinner in the old town area and walk over, but unless you find street parking right in front plan to find parking further away and walk over. The second reason I give this place 3\/5 stars is the product itself. And after reading others reviews, it looks like I am not the only one that feels this way. The main critique on the product is its texture. The cookie dough almost has a cake-like texture that did not remind me at all like cookie dough. I feel that it was almost dry and chewy vs. a cookie dough consistency. Being that this place only really sells edible cookie dough, I feel that they could work on their product a little better. \n\nOn a positive note, if you are looking for a cute, Instagramable product this place is for you. They gave plenty of product for the price which was great and definitely would take a few sittings to finish it all. They even guarantee that you can eat it weeks after as well. I will probably not be returning but enjoyed the experience with my friends.
