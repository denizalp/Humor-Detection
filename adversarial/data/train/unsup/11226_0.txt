Do not recommend. I asked for a Cubano sandwich and ask that they leave the pickles out. Waitress came back and stated that the \"chef\" was not able to leave pickles out as it was pre-made with pickles already. We ordered two tapas orders, calamari and chicken garlic. The calamari came out however we had to cancel the chicken as it still had not come out when we were finished with our meals. The waitress stated that the dishes come out separately as they are cooked. I had the fish and chips which were mediocre and not worth $17.00. \n\nWe live in Lake Las Vegas and will never come back. Our meal took an hour and a half from start to finish.
