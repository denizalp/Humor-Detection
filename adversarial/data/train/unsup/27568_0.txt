You are at The Venetian Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas and it is after 2AM with very limited options to eat. Enter Noodle Asia. They are open till 3AM. One can have a full meal if desired. That is exactly what we did. We were seated immediately. The restaurant was busy for 2:15AM. \nI wanted to have the Young Coconut Water however they were out of it. We ordered the Beef Pho Soup & Lamb Chops. The soup was delicious and plentiful. The Lamb Chops were tender however not very flavorful. Service was fast and attentive. \nWill absolutely go back to Noodle Asia again for a late night Pho fix when at the Venetian.
