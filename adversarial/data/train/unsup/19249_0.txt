Ghostbar is worth leaving the strip for. I promise. You won't die. You won't fall off the face of the Earth. You won't even leave Vegas. You'll be 10 minutes away from your hotel and you'll live. You'll even have fun. Like, a LOT of fun. \n\nGhostbar has been around the block for many a moons, and there's a reason. They know how to keep the kids coming back. One, it's a local's spot so you won't find quite as many tourists (speaking from a tourist who doesn't like tourists, ahem). Two, the outdoor space with views of Sin City are unmatched by any other club. Coming from the colder climates of Chicago, it was such a breath of literal fresh air to walk outside with my cocktail in November and dance to a DJ. Three, they cater to exactly what I want and can never, EVER, find: a legitimate dance club at noon on Saturday! That's when I have energy, when my makeup hasn't slid off my face, and when everyone else is dying their slow hangover death by the closed pool parties at their hotel. I feel like I'm in on a dirty little secret. Ghostbar Day Club (GBDC) is everything on Saturday. Costumes, DJs, cocktails, bright lights, and sunshine. \n\nWe were there when Will Smith's son DJ Ace (the older son) performed for his birthday last year and we felt like we were legit there to celebrate with them. He got the crowd so rowdy and made us feel like his guests. Even his parents, thee Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, were up dancing and getting down. Their body guards were fun sponges though, I'll say that. \n\nGBDC was my second favorite part of our trip to Vegas. The promoters were so nice and got us through the long line, the bartenders were fun and attentive, and the party was insane. Ghostbar is a blast day or night. Now I want to go back to Vegas. Dammit.
