Whoa, watch out when you visit this chop shop! We took our dogs in on Friday. About an hour after we dropped them off they called to see if we should reschedule because we didn't drop them off yet. That's scary.\n\nWe picked them up five hours later and after arriving home we noticed that one of them had a cut above the eye. We called Villa and spoke to the groomer who said that we should go to the vet.\n\nThe (third party) veterinarian confirmed the cut was from clippers and found three other burns from irritation. The vet took photos and documented everything.\n\nUpon returning to Villa, we were told there was no need to take her to the vet, even though it was recommended by them. Despite there not being a \"need\" to take her, they wanted copies of everything, to which we agreed.\n\nToday, we received a phone call from Chris, who was acting on behalf of the Owner. Chris had his back peddling shoes on and was quick to change things around. Within 24 hours, Villa's story became\n\n-\"You shouldn't shave dogs, it's harmful.\"  Oh, reallly? Petsmart does ok.\n-\"Your dog's injury happened after she left.\" Is that saying we hurt our dogs intentionally?\n-\"Your dog's injury didn't happen here so it's not our problem.\" Great warranty, guys.\n-\"Our groomers will ALWAYS show you if they made a mistake.\" Chris elaborated that 100% of the time they will be quick to show you their errors..yeah, I'm sure.\n\nThere's no point in going back. We didn't ask for a refund of the haircuts, just compensation for the vet bill..you know..the one we already paid for? Theres nothing in it for us, but to not have to spend $300 (Vet bill + haircuts) for a poorly done haircut. \n\nIt's worth noting that the company also posts a few awards on their site such as an AZCentral readers choice award from '08. A little googling shows they're not even in the top 10. Talk about ethics.\n\nStay away. Even if they learn how to cut dogs right, you'll have to pray that you don't have a customer service issue.\n\n\n****UPDATE****\n\nWell, after a year of battling Villa La Paws' owner through the Better Business Bureau, they finally made an offer to cover the vet bill for my dog after they cut her. \n\nThey repeatedly insulted me in the process and threatened me with legal action. Ultimately, I declined the offer because it required that I remove my online reviews which is deceiving to the Yelp community. I wish any future customer luck when they visit here! You'll need it.
