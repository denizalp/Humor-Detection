This OfficeMax is one of the bigger locations I've gone to.  It's also fairly busy too. \n\nWhen it comes to my favorite office supply store, it's Staples.  Joke only.  Yes, it's OfficeMax of course.  My main reason...I get the best service at them.  Staples, Office Depot, and OfficeMax all tend to have the same goods and services.  But it appears to me that OfficeMax treats me better.  At this location, it's no different.  As soon as I walk in, I'm greeted.  There's always associates on the floor to also assist with your needs.  \n\nNow for the big plus, I get a pretty decent business discount from them.  I can't use it for personal use or share it with friends, but it sure helps to keep my work expenses low. OfficeMax is great for printing, binding, and organizing my meeting presentations.  In some cases, I simply drop off what I need done, give a couple of instructions, and pick it up when it's done.  Never a hitch, always satisfied when I get back.  \n\nMy only issue with this location is that I wish they had a separate copy center like the North Rainbow location near Summerlin.
