David Copperfield reminded me of the character played by Steve Carell in The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.  (If you've never seen the movie Netflix it and you'll see what I mean)  A guy who probably used to be brilliant once and who is now just going through the motions because the money is too good to leave.  But now he's just bored doing the same thing night after night and it shows.\n\nI saw yesterday's matinee and David obviously had a cold or the flu.  His voice was raspy and he looked feverish.  On the plus side I suppose the guy deserves praise for soldiering on with the show when some performers would have just cancelled.  On the other side I'm kind of disappointed I've never seen this guy perform before and then I don't get to see him at his best even though I paid full price.  As other reviewers have also noted he's also like 20 years older than his picture on the side of the building.  My wife still thinks he looks good for his age however.  \n\nAlso can someone explain to me why Chris Angel gets scathing online reviews, Copperfield still gets generally positive ones, yet they perform some of the exact same tricks?  Is the only reason that Angel is a preening narcissist and Copperfield tries to be more down to earth?\n\nIn 90 minutes I saw maybe two or three good tricks, the rest just left me kind of bored.  I probably would have loved this show 30 years ago as a teenager, but college educated adults over 30 can figure out how most of the tricks are done.  Perhaps that's why half his audience seems to be people from other countries who don't speak Enlish.  I guess I'm just not the target audience for illusionists anymore, although I still like Penn and Teller.  Maybe the internet has ruined magic shows, I don't know.  Oh well, that's Vegas I guess.  Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.
