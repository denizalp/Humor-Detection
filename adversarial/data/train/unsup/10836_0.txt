If Vieux-Port Steakhouse was a man, I'd hug him, kiss him on both cheeks and smack him on the butt.\nThis place was down right GOOD.\nLet me set the stage, since I am a writer, and this place just fell into my life like a perfect storybook romance.\n\n It was a chilly evening. The sister and her boyfriend and I had spent the day downtown, shopping and milling about. Our hands were filled with shopping bags with tissue exploding over the tops, hugging our purchases tight. \n\nWe took the metro to Place D'Armes, and as soon as we popped to the surface, I gasped. I LOVE Old Montreal. Truly, outside of Paris, there is nothing better in this world than Old Montreal. Nearly skipping, we walked down the street to the port, and sighed as the boats floated in the water, breathed the cool air in as joggers breezed past us ... but in the distance, the skies were black as night, thunder screaming at us, bolts of lightning shooting over the historical area.\n\nRain began to pour as we turned down Rue St Paul. Boutiques, souvenir shops and restaurants lined the street, each one begging for us to enter. We did, picking up even more shopping bags as we walked. Finally, the rain poured down on the 400 year old cobblestone road and I looked across the street and saw the Vieux Port Steakhouse. So beautiful, so elegant, I knew we had to go in. \n\nWe were seated right away and just fell in love with the old world ambiance of this multi-level steakhouse. The food was divine (NY strip), the conversation absolutely wonderful and tea and dessert was lovely. We stayed for hours, talking and laughing and watching the downfall of rain, while our waiter checked on us every once in a while, but mostly leaving us alone in the way you want to be visited with every so often but left to your dinner guests. \n\nI am counting the days until I can go back to this little slice of steakhouse heaven in the most beautiful place I've ever been. \n\nI love you, Vieux Port Steakhouse.
