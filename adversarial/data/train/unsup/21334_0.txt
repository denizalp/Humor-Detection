Minus 100 stars.\n\nThis company is full of rude scamming turds.\n\nAt the airport, they roll up and take you on the roundabout freeway ride to the hotel. I saw the hotel close then far, then close, then far again, then finally, $35 later, was there. They do not even ask you 'scenic route or freeway?' to try to cover their ass. So technically it is against the policy or whatever, but who is enforcing their policy? \n\nHonestly, the crap taxi service in vegas makes me not even want to visit the city.\n\nIf you see #781, punch that fat no-neck bastard in his #^@(ing balls.
