You must remember: you are going to a chain tavern. Is the food gourmet? Probably not, but are the beers cold and the burgers juicy? Yes. They were kid friendly, fast, and clean.  I like that they have a delicious vegetarian burger along with more traditional fare. The service was welcoming and our drinks hardly wanted for a refill. We have been here before and we will be back again.
