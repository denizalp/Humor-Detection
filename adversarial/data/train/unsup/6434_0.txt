Yum yum yum. Beautiful restaurant in the Cosmo hotel with amazing views of the Bellagio fountain. The food was absolutely spectacular and I was so happy that they have a separate (though brief) vegetarian menu. They also have really great cocktails as well. Service is on point and quick. As others have noted, their mascarpone butter to spread on your bread is simply amazing. \n\nBottom line, this has to be on your Las Vegas food trek. I can't wait to return!
