This is my favorite ice cream place. I have tried many companies and Cold Stone is always the best. The way they mix the ice cream with the ingredients on the cold stone makes the ice cream seem much more fresh. And I love having a treat in every bite as opposed to just getting the toppings when I eat the top part of the ice cream.\n\nI usually get one of their recommendations. This time I got the Peanut Butter cup. But I have tried many other ones like Birthday Cake. They are always excellent!\n\nThe service was great. The girl took my order right away, made it quickly, and was very nice and friendly. I highly recommend Cold Stone creamery.\n\nThey also offer ice cream to go if you need a gift for someone's birthday!
