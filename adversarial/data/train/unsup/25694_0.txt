This guy is an artist.  He tells me he's been doing this for 30 years and it shows.  His prices are fair and he is a gracious host while your job is being done.  He offers coffee, cold bottled water and a TV to watch.  I recommend forgetting the TV and watching at least some of his installation.  Thanks Victor my car is much cooler (and looks better too).
