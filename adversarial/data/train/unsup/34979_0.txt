We stopped in here for a snack and drink while strolling through the hotel.  We decided to go with the fried pickles and they were delicious.  Because we didn't enjoy a full meal, the five stars are based on the atmosphere, the great service we received, and the creative items on the menu...not the typical items you would find in bar and grill.  I'd love to return and try some of the other eye-catching menu items...perhaps the fried Twinkie for dessert...mmmm
