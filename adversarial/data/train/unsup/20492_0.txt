This is probably one of the best deals for a daytime show in Vegas if you sign for the Total Rewards club.  Our hero got a coupon for two \"free\" tickets with the purchase of drinks by signing up for the Total Rewards club in Harrah's and was more than surprised by the quality of the show.  The theatre is a bit dumpy and Mac King looks a bit like a used encyclopedia salesman from Kentucky, but the tackiness is part of the act.  Our hero would have no regrets paying full cost to see this show a second time.\n\nIf you want the chance to be a part of the show, spring an extra $5 to sit in the first few rows.  Mac King pulls out audience members for most of his acts to be a part of the show, and it gives each performance a unique twist.  Mac King is also great at handling drunks and hecklers and and it really adds to the comedic effect of the show.\n\nThe acts are pretty hilarious, and you can expect Mac King to pull everything from a hamster to a fig newton out of his pants.  At the end of the show, you can even grab a picture with Mac King himself free of charge and banter a bit outside the theatre!  Good luck trying THAT with David Copperfield!\n\nPROS:\n- The show is really family friendly, but there's also some hidden adult jokes for the grown ups in there.\n- It's one of the best deals for two for under $30 if you sign up for the players club and you get a free drink too!\n- It's hilarious and Mac King puts a nice story element into most of his tricks.\n\nCONS:\n- The theatre itself is a bit old looking and the lighting isn't spectacular.\n- Fairly limited selection of drinks at the bar.
