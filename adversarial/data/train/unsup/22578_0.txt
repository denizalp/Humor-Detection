Wanting to get away from the Strip and check out a local gem for lunch, the wife and I checked out El Dorado Cantina.  We both love Mexican cuisine, the more authentic the better.  So, we were easily sold on the place by the very positive reviews from the local Yelp community.\n\nThere's really nothing new or different that I can add on top of the nearly 1000 reviews of this place.  Service was fast, friendly and attentive.  The first round-gratis chips tasted fresh made and were crispy without oiliness.  The salsas were flavorful, spicy, and were true standouts.  I applaud the fact that they had Chapulines and our server's recommendation to have the garlic and lime over the habanero was a good call.  They were delicious.  I love pozole.  El Dorado Cantina's pozole was the best rendition that I've yet encountered.  I'll leave it to the wife to recount her experience, but suffice it to say she left completely satisfied.  Prices were reasonable and portion sizes were a solid value in relation to its price.\n\nEl Dorado Cantina was the definition of a local gem.  It served up some of the best, authentic Mexican food that I've had in a long time.  For tourists, it's a worth a trip off of the Strip to eat here.  For locals, thanks for not keeping this place a secret.
