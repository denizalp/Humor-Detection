Not sure what the hype is all is about. Fairmount is good but not worth a special trip here (sorry for the unpopular opinion)\n\nCompared to bagels at Tim Hortons, Fairmount wins when it comes to the plethora of selection and the quality of the toppings (recommend trying the all dressed! But I kinda prefer the texture of the Tim Hortons toasted bagels drenched in butter better. Fairmount's was dense, hard, cold and hurts my mouth eating it.\n\nAgain, try it if you're in the area. It's still a good choice for a quick breakfast, but not worth trekking it here.
