I have bought 4 Hyundai in the past 5 years. I am trying to see if I can switch or get out of a higher paying car due to loosing my job and finding one but pays less. Started to work with Dan and he no longer works there. People on the phone there did not know he was gone. Than I called Reta left a couple messages to see if there is something that can be done. No response. Talked with Mark who I am told is a manager. Called the dealership 2 times both to voicemail? Talked to the front desk they but me to the wrong voicemail.\nMan I buy 4 car almost at sticker price but to ask for a hand it a joke.\nNever again will I tell people I bought from here.\nGot a call the valued my car only 6 k under wholesale for the car. great job guy Never again!!!!
