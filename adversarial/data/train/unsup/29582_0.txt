It saddens me to write this review - as Odd Seoul had become my regular late night spot for the past 2-3 years. I can't count how many people I have recommended this place to, let alone how much I have actually spent here. Last night after a concert me and three friends were looking to grab some bites and drinks so we obviously headed right over to Odd Seoul. We were seated right away which was great but then a drip fell from above. This continued every 5 minutes for the duration of the meal - at one point the drip fell into my cocktail. The drip was coming from hockey taped piping overhead. I didn't say anything because the food was good and I didn't want to come across as a snob. When the waitress came at the end to bring the bill I tamely said \"Just to let you know the pipe above us has been dripping on my head\/food\/cocktail\/lap for the whole night.\". I thought hey maybe that would be good to know for the next customer, maybe they would comp my dripped in cocktail, maybe they would just say sorry for that. No. The girl had such an intense superiority complex - she looked at me with a stone cold face and said \"what - you want me to turn the air conditioning off so everyone else has to suffer in here\" and walked away and literally hid in the back kitchen until we left, wouldn't set up the cash machine for anyone else at our table so one person had to pay for it all.\n\nI wish I could just speak directly with management because this girl should be fired immediately. I don't understand why anyone would be so rude, nobody wants air conditioning drips in their drinks! common!
