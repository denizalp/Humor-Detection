When I first walked in I liked how the restaurant was very clean spacious and modern. That's about all I liked :( My husband and I went here for dinner on a Friday night and they were definitely overwhelmed with the amount of people in there. I'd say the restaurant was a little over half full. \n\nWe ended up getting the wrong appetizer delivered to us, and the waiter spilled a bit of my husbands pho on his hands when he delivered it to our table. We both ordered pho and it was underwhelming. It wasn't very hot at all...just barely warm. It wasn't enough to cook the rare steak that was in my pho. The noodles were also overcooked and just mush.....blech. The broth was pretty weak and had a weird funky aftertaste to it too. Almost like a smokey flavor to it. I didn't care for it at all. No one came to check on us and we never got refills on our drinks.\n\nWe waited a while to get our check and finally my husband just got up and went to the counter to pay. While paying I saw someone else got pho spilled on them big time. I was confused since I saw so many 5 star reviews on yelp which was why I chose to try this place out. Maybe I caught them on a bad night? They definitely need to get their act together or hire more servers. Give this place a womp womp. Don't think I'll be heading back anytime soon.
