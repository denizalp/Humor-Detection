6th buffet in the Buffet of Buffets tour.  The lines are really long here.  Go for the line pass, if you can.  Go to the Diamond\/Seven Stars entrance, which is a separate door, and ask about it.\n\nThis was the one buffet with macaroons, which I was excited about.  I'd been searching for them all day.  But they weren't very good.  Mushy.  Yuck.\n\nA lot of things are mislabeled here.  Some are just funny.  Parmesan cheese was labeled as red onion.  But then mayo was labeled as tzatziki, which angered me. (Holly smash!) I dipped some pita in it and ate it before I realized it was not tzatziki.  I hate it when buffets mislabel things.\n\nThey did have Mediterranean selections, which surprised me.  But you need to hunt for the good stuff.  They had a basket of pita that was stale and nasty.  But elsewhere in the station, they had nice hot fresh pita.\n\nThere are restrooms in the buffet but the ladies room is one stall and completely useless.  Just plan on using the restrooms outside as you come and go.\n\nNot really impressed with this buffet given the hype.
