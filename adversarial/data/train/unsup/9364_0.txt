We have asked him do things like ceiling fan repair, new outlets, new wiring, home theater installation everything electrical these electricians were able to do above and beyond what we've asked them to do. They're always clean cut and we'll magaged. \n\nI would call and make an early appointment with them since they can get a bit busy. They have locations all over the valley so they can normally get to you quick.\n\nThey do solar as well but electrical work is mainly what las vegas electricians wants to do.
