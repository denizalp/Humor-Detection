This place has messed up my order twice.  They are complete idiots.  I ordered two sausage and cheese biscuits, a sausage mc muffin with egg whites and a hazel nut iced coffee.  Mind you, everything was correct on the screen.  When I arrived home, I found that instead of a sausage mc muffin with egg whites, I had been given a sausage mc muffin with ham. Seriously, how hard is it to get a customer's order correct.  It's not rocket science guys!  And these people want to make $15 a hr...give me a break! \n\nI called to talk to the manager who sounded as though he  had yet to hit puberty.  He didn't even bother to apologize.  He wanted me to drive all the way back to that location to switch out my sandwich...Fml.  This could possibly explain why my orders are always messed up!!!
