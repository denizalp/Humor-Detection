Not impressed.  They dont give you very much for your trade but thats expected. Some of there pricing look to be a little expensive for used items. I was excided when this one opened, because I use to go to the one in mesa all the time an always seem to score something great. I use to go to this location quite a bit after they opened but never really found anything like I did at the mesa location. I still vist this location every now and then hoping to see something I cant live without.
