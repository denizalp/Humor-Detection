I wish I could give 6 stars for this place.  It deserves 6++++ stars. We visited on a Friday night and were lucky to get seated right away.  We initially wanted to try the wings but they were sold out so we opted for perogies as an appetizer instead and fish n chips and oxtails for our mains.  My partner ordered their drink special which was eggnog with Kraken. It came fashioned with a cinnamon stick and went down smooth.  Our mains were equally as good. The oxtails were braised to perfection and fell off the bone.  The gravy was rich and savory. The salad with it was fresh and refreshing.  My partners fish and chips were excellent. The fish was thick cut and lightly coated in a malty crispy batter.  With it were hand cut fries that were nicely seasoned.  We took our perogies to go as we were pretty stuffed.  Once reheated later we wish we had ordered two portions.  The bacon used was smokey and fried to a perfect crisp.  Hands down the best perogies we have had.  \n\nCannot say enough good things about this place it's a true gem and offers up a warm friendly vibe.  We were newbies but noticed they have quite a few regulars.  Our server gave us first rate service throughout our meal.  \n\nWe are coming back to try the wings but will call first.
