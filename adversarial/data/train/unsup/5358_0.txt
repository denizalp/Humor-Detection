I cant believe it. An In-N-Out only 3 miles from my place. This is bad... Very bad...\n\nThis place just opened... and it showed. Well, in a good way I mean. I drive by and the dining room seems empty. Its a Friday night around 10pm and I figure this place would be somewhat busy.\n\nI roll into the drive through and there outside in the freezing weather stands a girl taking orders. I wonder if she drew the short straw that evening or just normally out there. She proceeds to take my order and I drive up to the cashier window. The cashier then proceeds to confirm my full order. Finally I pull up to pick up window and my food near ready. A brief 2 minute wait and our food is ready to go. \n\nHere's a list of what we ordered:\n\n- Cheeseburger, Protein style.\n- Cheeseburger, Animal style add a slice of raw onion. \n- Fries, Animal style\n- Regular fries\n- Chocolate Shake\n\nWhen we arrived back at the house, the food was perfectly prepared and everything was in order. Needless to say, the food here is great and the prices are reasonable.\n\nOn a side note: While I was waiting, I did notice they had a lot of workers standing around waiting to make food... The problem is that it was slow so there was no orders to make!\n\nOf course, pictures included!!
