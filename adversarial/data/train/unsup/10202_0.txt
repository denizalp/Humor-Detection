Hand pull, four grinders with beans of various origins, sweet espresso... Yes this is a place for the espresso hounds, coffee geeks, and pull purists.  As someone else noted, your espresso comes with a glass of water (no plastic) and a cloth napkin. Tres elegant.\n\nMy major gripe: they open at 10. If they are striving to be an Institution, they need better hours. But perhaps the locals going to work are not in their audience?\n\nIn any case, there really isn't much good coffee in this part of town, so if you're an espresso hound finding yourself near Berri-UQAM, this is your place.
