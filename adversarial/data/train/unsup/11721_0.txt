This is possibly the worst or second to worst outlet I've ever been to, and I'm a bit of an outlet mallrat. \n\nThe selection of stores in this place is abysmal. I would say the best they had to offer was the Nike Factory Store, and Starbucks. I expected that there would be a Coach Factory or Kate Spade store, or even like CK or something, but nope. They stores that were ok did not even have anything going on. No good deals to be found here. Most of the inventory of the stores I did walk into was MFF (made for factory), so low in quality they didn't even make it into the retail shops. \n\nThere are some pros to coming here. Free parking, free AC, and some good snacks (like Cinnabon). I wouldn't recommend it if you are visiting town and have limited time to see things.
