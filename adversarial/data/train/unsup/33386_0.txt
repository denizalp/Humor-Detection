Went there Saturday 7\/23 about 5pm.  It wasn't very busy and we haven't been there in years but we drove past it and decided to go.   We placed our order and I didn't pay attention to the receipt as I had the drink cups in my hand and stuffed it into my pocket.   When we got called to get our burgers the young lady at the counter informed me that she accidentally overcharged me and needed the receipt to correct the bill.  I appreciate very much the honesty and ethics.   Obviously  It was the right thing to do on their part but they could've gotten away with it.  I wonder how many people today in society would not have done the right thing....  Anyways Good job Fuddruckers.  By the way, the restaurant was clean, the fixin area was clean and well organized and everything was fresh and the burgers were yummy!
