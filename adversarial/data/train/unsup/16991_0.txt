When I crave for pizza, I Crave for Pizza!! At first, I was thinking delivery from one of the chain pizzas or a mom & pop spot in my  area. I wanted to try somewhere new and I didn't want Chicago or NY style pizza (not that I don't like these types).. I thought Sammy's woodfired, CPK.. but they served the usual americanized pies and I've been there and done that as well. So, after doing some research here on Yelp, I found this place and it was Exactly what I was looking for!\n\nI ordered 2 PIzzas\n\n1. Settebello: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven roasted fennel sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil\n\n- I had to order this since they named it after the restaurant! Besides, the toppings sounded more than satisfying. It was Absolutely Divine! Everything from the dough, sauce and toppings were of high quality and was created with such harmony! Pine nuts.. Yeah, they were a nice touch. The only thing is that most of the toppings were placed towards the center and one of the slices didn't have much cheese on it.\n\n2. Carbonara: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, egg, fresh mozzarella, basil, parmegiano-reggiano, extra virgin olive oil\n\n- I loved the simplicity of the toppings and the addition of an egg. Now, it may not sound like much was put into this pie but they didn't have to put much at all. Due to their superb ingredients\/toppings, a little went a long way! I engulfed this 'individual' sized dish in record time! \n\nDessert:\n\nTiramisu: Silky smooth! One of the creamiest and masterly balanced flavors that was subtle yet soooo luscious!! \n\n* Not only are Most of their ingredients imported from Italy, Even their Freakin' Oven is Italian!! You won't find a conveyor belt or deck oven here! \n\n* Just a note, they do not have Pepperoni!\n\nAuthentic, Gourmet Pizza with High Standard ingredients and True Italian baking! This place was a Real Treat!! But the sametime not a place I would often go to fulfill my pizza cravings.. I won't be filled with 1 pizza alone as their toppings were lacking but not because they were cheap but because that's their style and thats the proper way of serving their type of pizza. Not to take anything away from this fabulous place but I may just be accustomed more towards the mainstream pies!
