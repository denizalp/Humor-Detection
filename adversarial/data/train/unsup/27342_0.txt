Best vegan food in this area! A relaxing casual atmosphere, with friendly, prompt servers and interesting, tasty options. We had the perogis, which came with both potato and radish filling, and a luke warm vegetable soup with potato dumplings. Both were fantastic! Good texture and unique flavor.\n\nWe ordered dessert as well before finding out about a vegan bakery only a few blocks away, and the staff happily cancelled our order with no friction whatsoever. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I'll definitely come again.
