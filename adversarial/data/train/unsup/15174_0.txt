So, first of all, a couple of disclaimers:\n1. My only experience with Dandelion Market was on a Saturday night. \n2. I am not from Charlotte, so therefore not familiar with the best places to go or neighborhoods to seek out my kind of scene. \n3. I do not do well in homogeneous environments. \n\nSo yeah, I didn't like this place. On the night I was there, it was disgustingly packed. As in, can't turn around, have to elbow people, feel really bad for the short people, feeling claustrophobic kind of crowded. It was insanely uncomfortable, especially because the crowd looked so... Stepford. If J. Crew doesn't make up the majority of your closet, don't expect to find your kind of crowd here. Just so you know. \n\nNothing they can do about that, I feel like it pervades most of Charlotte, but they *can* control the crowds. Even when we went downstairs we found ourselves standing in the entryway just for a little bit of breathing room. \n\nThey've got a fine beer list but when I asked for a second Two Hearted Ale they made a big deal about changing out the kegs and then proceeded to totally forget about me. I had to flag down another bartender after waiting for 10 minutes, and he poured me one straight up. Not sure what it is about this place that draws in such a large percentage of the city's population, but I think it's safe to say that I don't get it.
