I keep visiting this car shop due to the sheer number of yelp reviews and keep being reminded that this is not the place for me.  They're friendly enough but don't expect them to be able to look at your car unless you've booked 3 days in advance or are willing to leave your car there for 4 hours at a time.  \n\nParking is very limited as the shop is behind a \"lube\" place and parking is already occupied by cars undergoing repair (inside the garage & out).  \n\nTrust me, you don't to wait for your repairs because the office\/waiting area is the size of a broom closet and cooled by a window AC unit.  I've consistently gotten better pricing, faster service, and far more comfortable wait at AZ Automasters.
