Can I give no stars please?!?! Went in there and had My boyfriend ask for a water- bartender refused to serve us because we had been drinking already. Aren't they obligated to do that? What a joke. F the Yelp reviews. Service is what's worth talking about, and Tonys Definitely does not deliver.\nBoooOooOoOoo!
