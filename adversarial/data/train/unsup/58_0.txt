I have been coming here as a client on and off for the past 4 years, and absolutely love it here.  Canyon Falls offers a full line of services, not only for hair, but spa treatments as well.  I have used them for both over the years, and have been satisfied all the way around with everything.\n\nThis is more of an upscale salon....extremely well decorated, easy on the eyes and relaxing to be here for whatever services you may be here for.  I mostly come here to get my hair done, and thats what brought me in for my most recent visit.\n\nI always see Maria when I am here.  Shes a really nice older italian woman who knows her stuff.  She listens, and does excellent hair.  The reason I started seeing her in the first place was because I was told that she deals a lot with curly hair, which is what I have.  Thats another reason I love this salon....if your a new client, and your not sure who to see, (like I did, intially 4 years ago) let them know what kind of hair you have, and they will place you with a stylist who has a strong background in that area.\n\nMaria is awesome..she washed, cut and styled my hair in no time.  It only cost me $55 plus tip, and I looked and felt amazing!\n\nThis is not what I consider a \"typical\" Scottsdale hair salon....the people here are nice, welcoming, and professional...NOT your pretentious crowd that you might expect at other high end salons in Scottsdale.  If your looking for a great staff, with out the scottsdale attitude, come here!\n\n\nLove love love the salon....will always return in the future, weather its for my hair, waxing, massages, or pedicures, you can't go wrong!
