Very fresh seafood. The best crab cakes I've had! Not overdone with saucey mixtures,  just pure crab meat. I wasn't impressed with their signature bass entr√©e. It was a bit too soupy for me compared to others I've had.  Desserts were ok. I think overall,  the appetizers were the best.  My colleagues loved the lobster. Maybe I'll try that next time.
