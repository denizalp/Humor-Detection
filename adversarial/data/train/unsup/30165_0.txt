This Thai restaurant is definitely a hidden gem. We were looking for a Thai restaurant in the west end with another couple. I found this place from Yelp and called them for reservations.  Upon our arrival at the restaurant we were surprised it was empty with only one other table.  We ordered their mixed appetizer and it was very good variety and tasty.  Their pad Thai was soooo good the best I've had.  My husband ordered the stir fry Bangkok noodles and it was very good with generous amounts. Our friends ordered curry and said it was very flavourful.  We would highly recommend this place if you're in the area looking for Thai food.
