E-MOJI of choice? Definitely [relaxed], [smiley], and [hand up]. (Edit: forgot emojis don't work on Yelp lol.)\n\n[relaxed] - the restaurant is homey and comfortable. The roomy clean decor of the restaurant is inviting and the service is happy and attentive. \n\n[smiley] - the food was great! There's a lot of options on the cute menu and wooden board presenting the drinks. I had the takoyaki, the matcha milk tea, and the gyudon ($20 including tax and tip) . All were pretty standard compared to other places, although the gyudon is on the smaller side and certainly not as drenched in sauce as I'd like. I was one of the only ones there on Monday night so everything came out very quickly; I had all three items in less than 15 minutes. \n\n[hand up] - I can't wait to come back to try more of the menu! I also got a free cone coupon after eating!
