They are great. James the owner is very friendly, polite and knowledgeable.  I brought some glasses in for repair and he did them all in one day including replacing some frames.  My optometrist wanted $178 for just doing the frames and he charged me $145 which also included replacing the arms on one pair and repairing the broken nose-piece on another .  His work is top quality and he is a pleasure to do business with.  When he says something will be done by a certain time it is done. I will definitely be going back to them.\nThank you,\nAlan
