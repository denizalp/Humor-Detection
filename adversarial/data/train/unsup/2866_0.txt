heres some news, i can tell you all about how terrible they are because they are. dont purchase anything from them. you can get financed somewhere else....go to a place i just found called VIVA auto on Freemont and Boulder. yes its on used car row, its a little off the street but they are fantastic. I have NO vested interest in either of these companies, however, I did go to Viva to purchase a car. Im here to tell you that if I had dealt with these two brothers, my life would have been so much better, and i would have avoided the 91.00 ticket for the no break lites or blinker lights on the vehicle i purchased from baja. like i said, i wont get into the scam they pulled on me, but i can tell you that if you sue them, things get better pretty quick. but i would like to share my solution to dealers like baja and people like me who got screwed by them. go to viva. thats all i can say, you can certaintly post something on their web site if your not happy with them too. \ni just wanted to provide everyone an option to these guys cuz i wouldnt purchase a can of corn from them.
