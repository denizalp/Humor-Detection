I love the idea of all the \"secrecy!\".  Do you need a password?  Find a special map? Sound daunting to you?  Don't fret.  Just go to the Cosmopolitan and find the escalator and the directory will tell you its on the 3rd floor.  If your faculty to read has left you (and that does happen sometimes in Las Vegas) just look for the folks who are walking around in the hotel with white, plain pizza boxes and ask them where they got it.\n\nWhat's really likeable about this joint is that:\na.) it really keeps to its mysterious charm.\nThere's no sign, just a dark hallway that you would pass and wouldn't even know it was there if you weren't looking for it on purpose.\n\nb.) Its so unexpected.\nYou'd never think you'd find a place that serves pizza for $4.50 a slice in the trendy and posh Cosmopolitan hotel.  There is nothing fancy about this place - they serve your pizza on paper plates and soda in a red dixie cup!  They also have beer.\n\nc.) The pizza is SO DANG good!\nGood in a \"Man I'm so drunk and I hella want a pizza right now\" way as well as when you're sober.  The thin crust is perfectly crispy and you know that its really good pizza when it stays that way even if its been sitting out on the warmers and reheated for you.  The WHITE pizza is has no red sauce but olive oil instead, and has a great combo of parmesan, mozzarella and dollops of ricotta.  Super flavorful and super cheesy.  The Pepperoni and Combo slices we got were just as delicious and with just the right amount of sauce and toppings to hold well with the glorious thin crust.\n\nGreat to have a slice there and good to buy a whole pie to take back to the room.\n\nDid I tell you that I don't keep secrets very well?  ;)  Not this kind anyway!
