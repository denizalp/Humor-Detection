Unexpected quick lunch cause I haven't eaten here in forever. Walked in to a location I'd never visited before. Clean, cool and relatively new. We were immediately seated near the mirror in the back with the pretty wallpaper. We tried three separate items. Our server was a bit hippie but clean? Good service and somewhat fast. It was good and we finished everything. All the lemonades and iced teas are flavored so you won't get it au natural. I had dirty silverware but it was quickly replaced.
