We like Boulder's. \n\nThe staff is relaxed, courtesy (they speak to us when we see them out in the community too), and knowledgable without being snooty. 4 stars\nThe process is simple enough. 4 stars\nThe training that the staff provides isn't overbearing and quite pleasant even when there's other folks in the class. 4 stars\nThe kiddie class is smart & time length appropiate. 5 stars\nThe a\/c is minimal and it's been a hot summer. 2 stars\nThe locker area and layout is simple\/easy\/and purposeful. 4 stars\nThe course options\/difficulty\/design\/aesthetics\/flow tape to designate a path option in level of difficulty - all of these things are smart. 5 stars\nThe side equipment to work on your abs & pull ups. 4 stars\nThe bell at the top of the 1st run = 5 stars. Not just kids need motivation but it's nice to hear the bell ring to show you've accomplised something. \nThe kid DID NOT like the fact that you have to clip in when climbing the single knotted rope, but I understand it's a liability issue - yet in gymnastics its there so we need the practice.  No rating for the kid~ Get a kid Yelp =)\nGreat location in regards to the gym is nearby. So we leave one & practice at the other. 5 stars\nThe low adirondack chairs could go but that's about it. \nThe music is hit or miss. The staff knows good music but the crowd dictates what stays & plays. The cut old school R&B saying it was too slow then flipped to NORAH JONES. WTH~ Did I miss something? \n\nThe lot gets full after traditional work hours but other than that if you bike in you'll get the BIKE BENEFITS hook up. \n\nOh yeah~ Went with a Group On and staying loyal. But the staff isn't all, \"Eww..Groupon. How did you get this? Or \"sheessh I hate these.\" Nope~ Easy breezy. Yoga classes included in membership. Nice message board for sharing everything. It's like an old school gym from what I remember going with my sister. You know before everyone got a tv on each individual piece of equipment (which I love) but this place is social in a nice way. Nothing over the top but each person shares a common interest and conversation is just sparked. OR at least everytime we came through. \n\nP.S. When it rains or when the rain is coming and the doors are open - it's like the best smell and feeling because they have an aluminum roof and a screen so it reminds me of Southern Living...sitting on the porch or in the swing smelling fresh rain on the horizon staring out feeling the cool breeze. It's amazing what triggers the memory (e.g. Snorah Jones will do it to you too, lol. Maybe it was my singing along that got the music pulled.)
