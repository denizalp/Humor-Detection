Calzones Calzones\n\nNorth West Las Vegas has a new unique family run Calzone bakery that is ready to impress.\n\nLocated along the cross streets of farm and Cimarron in the small strip mall behind the gas station 7\/11.\n\nAfter seeing elite yelpers Ty & Lore checking into this new establishment, my desire for calzones for dinner was too much. Being greeted by a trio of owners I had the sense of an already established mom & pop vibe.\n\nAfter running through the menu of calzones I ended up with the Canadian Bacon with Pineapple and Italian sausage. All were extremely tasty, with the bread seeming fresh. This is hand made calzones, not your frozen late night dinner meals from the grocery store.\n\nAlso a great range of Italian soda's is also available.\n\nWhen reviewing Presto they had only been open less than a week. But with a little help from the yelp crew I believe this is another quality addition to the area.\n\nOverall\nFood: 5-5\nDrink: 4-5\nService: 5-5\nComing back: yes
