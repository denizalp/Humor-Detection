When picking up rando couples in Vegas, this is a good place to eat before joining them for a topless afternoon at the European pool.\n\nMeatball sliders?  Great idea!  Too much oregano.\n\nPizza - Nice crust, but not \"as good as anything you'd get in New York\" as promised by Steve Wynn on my tv.  Import the water and try again.\n\nI did not try the chicken sandwich but my companions made much ado about whatever stinky cheese was on it.  (Smelled like asiago to me, they hated it, I bet I would have liked it but the olives kept me away.)\n\nEspresso was good, but not as good as what I got in the Venetian.  Also, WHY would you put a macchiato in a cappucino mug?  WHHHHYYY?   Cupware fail.\n\nMango gelato was lovely but could have been richer.\n\nOkay, this is really a three star experience, but if you score one of the few tables by the waterfall on the patio in the back.... POOF!   Four stars.\n\n(Five stars when you learn the rando couple you picked up is buying, but I can't credit Pizza Place for that.)
