Went there during the 11\/5 food truck festival @ Southpoint. Was very excited to try the tacos and tots. Ended up waiting forever even though the line wasn't that long, and my order looked nothing like what I anticipated. 90 minutes for tater tots with bad nacho cheese sauce is not worth it. Ever.\n\nI'm not sure if the wait poisoned everyone's attitudes, but it didn't seem like anyone was happy with their food.
