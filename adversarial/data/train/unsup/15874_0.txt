Love the concept. It's basically a sushi hand roll packed with fresh fish and a fun combination of sauces and toppings. I got the Mission, which was salmon and ebi shrimp wrapped in white rice. Came with a yuzu avocado cilantro sauce, wonton strips for a nice crunch, lettuce, and pico de gallo. It had a mild spicy kick to it. You can choose to wrap it in nori, tortilla, or soy paper. Definitely a great portion for lunch.\n\nIt's located in the Linq Promenade, right across from Sprinkles and In-N-Out. If you're looking for something different, you found it! :D
