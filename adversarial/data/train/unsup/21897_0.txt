This was in an \"arcadic\" feeling location. And almost seemed as if it was a mall but it was a really a mall. The restaurant was small and cozy. \n\nWhat attracted us to eat breakfast at this location was the fact that we could have a variety of pancakes that were gluten free. However, wishing that we had more options for egg variety (mainly wish their was omelettes) \n\nThey were fairly busy for a Friday morning- only one waitress was taking orders, seating and servicing. She was pretty forgetful and it seemed like overwhelmed which I cannot blame her.\n\nFood and service were average- I cannot say that when I return to Cleveland I will return to this restaurant.
