I can see Bitondo's from my window as I type this. I'd say half the traffic on my street is due to Bitondo's. This is the spot for a good ol' greasy slice of pizza or a meatball sub. The shop furnishings have gone unchanged for 30 years: there's a Ms. Pac Man sit-down game in there. The hand-painted menu on the window reads as follows:\n*SPAGHETTI\n*LASAGNA\n*RAVIOLI\n*SPEZZATINO\n*PANZAROTTI\n*PIZZA\n\nThe panzarotti is pretty much just a massive lump of deep fried cheese ($5). Oh dear god, it's the size of a human stomach and it's awesome. I need to order a side of tomato sauce for dipping ($1), because the cheese is too dense otherwise. Despite my proximity, I allow myself a Bitondo's panzo about twice a year. This only happens when I'm drunk and unconcerned about the 4000 calories per serving.
