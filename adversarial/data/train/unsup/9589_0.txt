I am not impressed.\n\nIt's positively scandalous that in a city that is 41% Latino, most of whom are Mexican-American, that there is so much crappy Mexican food. I really don't get it. \n\nAnyway, there really isn't much to say about this place.  It's a shithole, which I wouldn't mind if the food is great, but that is not the case here.  They are serving up extremely mediocre Mexican food.  \n\nI had the three taco plate with tacos de cabeza.  The tacos were okay.  The rest of the stuff on the plate was crap.  A tiny portion - maybe an eighth of a cup each of rice and beans, accompanied by a really odd and nasty avocado sauce and a very sad little salad with roughly three tablespoons of mayo.\n\nThe price for the taco plate and a large horchata was $9.76.  While not expensive, that's really not that cheap for a place like this, if you know what I mean.\n\nThis is by no means the worst Mexican food I've ever had but reading these reviews you would get the impression that it's something special.  It's not.  You'd do better at any taco truck in Tucson or Southern California.
