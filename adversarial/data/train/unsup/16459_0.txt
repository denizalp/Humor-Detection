Serendipity- means a \"happy accident\" or \"pleasant surprise\"; specifically, the accident of finding something good or useful while not specifically searching for it\n\nFrozen hot chocolate... So will I burn my tongue while getting a brain freeze at the same time? After waiting in line for a tiny $12 frozen hot chocolate drink I was thinking to myself \"this better be amazing.\" Unfortunately, the drink tasted like I was slurping mixed powder through a straw.  \n\nSerendipity my @$$! I just got ripped off! Skip this place and go to a super market and buy some milk and choco powder.
