Great brunch spot to people-watch as you sip bottomless mimosas or one of their fully-loaded bloodys! Other highlights:\n\n- The home fries are crispy, delicious bites of red potato heaven. I think they are deep fried?? Not greasy but have that crispy crust like a french fry.\n- Protein omelet - perfect remedy food for those long, lavish Las Vegas nights. \n- Score a seat outside to dine under the Eiffel Tower and watch the Bellagio fountains\n- Interesting menu items with chocolate accents.
