I just went to this location after trying to call them for the past 2 days and no one answering the phone.  I went there and it was not open.  It was boarded off and there was a big sign saying they were reopening in November.  I called the corporate offices to let them know that there should be a recording or something letting people know this location is not open.  I am ill and leaving the house is very, very difficult for me.  I can't tell you how disappointed I was to finally get there and it wasn't even open.  Then to call the main 800 number and speaking with a supervisor, she 1 - didn't even offer to take my order (ask if she could help me with the product I was looking for)  and 2 - didn't even offer something to make up for my time, gas, and affecting my health (like free shipping or something off of my next order), I don't expect handouts, but it would have been nice to have some kind of assistance today.  :-(
