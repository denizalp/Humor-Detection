This restaurant is not a place for a calm dinner or a nice date.... This is a place you go for an all out experience if you're out in Vegas celebrating something! We came before hitting the clubs for a bachelorette party and we had a blast. There is loud music and performances all night. I remember at one point our waitress said she would come take our order after she performed. Five seconds later she was being held up doing splits in mid-air. \n\nIt was a great place to kick off the night, and the $50 fish bowls might be on the pricier side but they were really good and had a strong kick to them. They also put a big sign up for the bachelorette and comped us sake bombs. So fun! So vegas lol
