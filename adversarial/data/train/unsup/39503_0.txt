Flemings delivers the consistent quality and service that you should expect from a high end steak chain. The food was fantastic and our server possessed that rare ability to always be available when she was needed, but never be intrusive. If given the choice to spend 200+ on a date night, I might go with a Tornado Steak House, but Flemings is an awesome Madison West option, and you can always rest assured that your experience is guaranteed by an upstanding chain restaurant organization.
