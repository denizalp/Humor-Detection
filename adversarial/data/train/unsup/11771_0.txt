This airline STOLE MY PHONE, I had my phone with me while we were on our flight from Dallas to Las Vegas, my baby fell asleep so I was holding her and when we arrived 2 second after I left the airplane I notice I didn't have my phone on me, came back and they didn't let me back on the plane, the lady went in and \"checked\" and surprise surprise she said was not there, nobody could tell me who clean the airplane while people was still leaving and they just flat out will not help.\n\nAnother lady showed up and said her phone was missing too, she said she looked everywhere and there was no more phones left on the plane, we called the manager she came back and went and looked for both phones, she found the other ladies one but not my brand new iPhone, so of course I don't trust their word, my phone was right there!!\n\nOn top of everything my stroller didn't make it to the airport, they sent it a day later to the hotel, my car seat showed up on horrible conditions, horrible customer service, just the worst!!
