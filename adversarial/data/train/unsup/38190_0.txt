Meh, maybe if I was a  big breakfast lover. For me Bkfst is Bkfst-- lol. This place is an experience though. Total dive. The place is like from the 50's with the colors and tackiness of the decor. But hey that's what the three stars are for. I love diners being raised in Long Island. I really miss them. I have eaten here twice and both times something was wrong with the order, cleanliness, and\/or service was very lacking. Very slow, very crowded, and the food is just not that great to keep me coming back. They are also a cash only establishment which is highly inconvenient for me. I have to admit their menu is extensive and the Dutch Baby, awesomeness of that German Pancake was to die for. The other stuff is just regular Breakfast food, and nothing special at that. The first time I went I did not like their pancakes. They was dry and not that great. I am glad I got the Dutch Baby this time around. That thing was darn good!!!!! I just don't eat pancakes enough to make it worth coming back that often.
