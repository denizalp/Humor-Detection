First a business that is in the practice of taking a 'deposit' to hold your appointment time should be ashamed of themselves. Especially if they quote me for one price and then total me out for another. \n\nSecondly - and while this is not the lash artists' fault... Perhaps it is the nature of the \"lounge\" style and it being an academy for lash artists - it took the artist an hour and a half to do my lashes and she concluded by telling me that we could've \"definitely gone a lot fuller\"... When I told her - the service I was going in for was a fill and I wanted it full with lots of volume. The pictures I've uploaded show maybe 60% the amount of volume along the lash line that I am used to. \n\n\nNot to be harsh but --- I am not sure what she was doing the entire hour and a half that she was playing with my lashes and breathing on my face but other lash artists have done more work in the same amount of time and it comes out looking much more voluminous. This was their \"master lash artist\". \n\nI went to check out tipping her $15 and then the lady at the counter wanted to charge me $90?!!! After I'd already deposited $9 over the phone just to hold the appointment??? \n\nI was originally quoted $79 when I booked the appointment by another receptionist at the Rainbow location - however perhaps the business should get their practices synchronized.\n\nAlso the lady that was getting her lashes done next to me fell asleep and was snoring quite loudly...while the ambient noise around me was conversation of other lash artists gossiping with their clients etc... It gets a little awkward in my opinion  - given that it is a lounge I guess I should be understanding, but I guess I've been spoiled with the seclusion aspect of all my other lash ladies. \n\nIt's was an experience. I wouldn't recommend for those that have specific ladies they already go to!! This was a last minute desperate fill for me!
