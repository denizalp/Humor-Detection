Meats are great! Best brisket I've ever eaten. Even better than mine.  I really enjoyed the ribs and sausage as well. I had the cheesy jalape√±o grits and the cole slaw.  The grits were great, the slaw was average.  Also had the pecan pie to finish up.  Yum! The staff\/owners were quite nice.  Liked to talk BBQ.\n\nThe only cons. Parking is tough. We got there at 11:00 when they open. The lot was full and the line was 45 minutes.  They'll need to work on getting folks through that line faster.  Price is on the high side, but when I take into account the quality of the food, I can justify the price. Judging from the lines and reviews, so can everyone else.  Keep up the great work and quality.
