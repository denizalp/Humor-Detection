I've been here quite a few times, I find it to be very mediocre. Food isn't bad but nothing fantastic either. It's a good go-to spot for cheap pitchers (of PBR to be specific). They have awesome choices for tasty drinks, $2.50 shooters as well but they're at that price for a reason. Service is friendly too. All in all, average resto\/bar.
