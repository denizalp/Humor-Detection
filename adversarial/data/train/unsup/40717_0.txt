We had to fight our way through the Blue Jay fans on the street to get to the door, but it was worth it.  A great selection of Canadian craft beer and some of the best food in town to go with it.  The jalapeno poppers with bacon were on point, and the savory garlic donuts covered in shaved Parmesan still make my mouth water.  Rounding out the meal to offset the beers was a great chicken meat pie in a cast iron skillet covered with rich buttery puffed pastry.\n\nThis was our first stop after the airport, and the next time in town it probably will be as well.  Super friendly and helpful staff that all enjoyed being part of the place.\n\nThis is a place to go for pints, flights, food, and great conversation about it and everything else that is right with this world.  Cheers!
