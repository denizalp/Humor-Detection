Arrested for exiting with a doggy bag? or is it revenge?\nThis afternoon a friend invited me to have lunch with them at Cardenas. I had a burrito which I could not finish and so I put it in one of the bags that was left over from the other food. upon walking out with my half a burrito I was stopped by security and asked for a receipt which I did not have. He grabbed my arm and took me to the cashier who said I in fact paid but this was not good enough and the guard wanted to arrest me. I am 62, white, retired gentleman who has never been in trouble with the law. The security guard was extremely rude, never apologized and asked me to never step in the store again. I can honestly say that I never will. This experience was one of the most humiliating experiences in my entire life - to be arrested for taking a doggy bag out of a market.
