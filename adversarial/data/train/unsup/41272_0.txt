My buddies and I just got back from Vegas and we stayed at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. \n\nThe hotel and the rooms were pretty nice. Although, the smell in the lobby when you walk in from the garage wasn't too pleasant. But, the rooms itself were fine and we had a great view of the Strip from our room. The only problem I had with the room was looking out the window in the morning and being blinded by the sun coming off of the Luxor.\n\nWe hit up The Mix, which is the club at the top of THEhotel. That was pretty nice. We grabbed some cocktails before hand and went back up there later in the evening. You get an awesome view of the strip and it looks amazing at night. \n\nAs someone mentioned, it is quite a walk from THEhotel to the strip or to the tram that takes you to Excalibur and Luxor. I guess if you're stumbling in after a late night of partying, this can be a pain. The one thing I really enjoyed about THEhotel was the wave pool and beach that is part of this complex (over on the Mandalay side). It was nice to just chill and unwind in this pool on a 105+ day after a late night of partying. All in all, we had a good time.
