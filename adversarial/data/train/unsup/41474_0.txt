Was mostly positive when taking a 2 and 4 year old to open jump. Good variety to keep the attention of the children. Not very crowded with about 10 under 5 year olds. Staff members were friendly. Problem was 3 20ish adults with a young toddler were playing on the equipment along with the kids. The adults seemed to know the staff. Having adults play on the equipment along with the children seemed like an unsafe environment for such young children. I did speak to the staff member about it and shortly after they stopped, I felt the staff should have been more responsive rather than me having to ask about it. Would return as overall good experience for the children.
