Today we stumbed upon Eatt Gourmet Bistro to find a wonderfully decorated bistro.  Friendly smiles met us at the door.  We were seated immediatly even though we didn't have a reservation.. \n\nOur waiter was so friendly and informative. He practically explained the entire menu to us.  Impressive!\n\nBrunch was served beautifully.  Not thinking it was possible the food actually tasted better then it appeared. \n \nService: on point\nAtmosphere: beautiful\nQuality of food:  excellent\n\nWould I return?:  Hell Yeah
