Rude! Rude! Rude! I will never patronize any of your locations after my last two visits. First Friday September 4th I walked in and hostess said she had tables available but only for parties of 4 or larger. So my party of two went to another neighborhood restaurant which welcomed our business. On Saturday night September 5th we walked in and the hostess says, \"What do you want?'\" We said we'd like a table. Hostess says, \"Yeah I bet!\", in a rude condescending tone. I asked her what she said and she repeated herself. I ask for the manager and he told me he didn't think there was anything wrong with what she said. Fine, Zipps I'll be sure never to visit any of your locations, since you obviously don't want or need my business!
