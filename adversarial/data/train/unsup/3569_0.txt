When it comes to doing Vegas right, many people believe in the power of the pre-party. For those that are not aware, to pre-party means to purchase cheap booze from a grocery, convenience, drug or liquor store and proceed to get buzzed in your hotel room or the parking lot of the venue you are going to... \n\nWhen it comes to the Hard Rock, the best place to get your pre-party started is St Tropez Convenience Mart. Part market, part liquor store, all cheaper then what you will find in the hotel, which is right across the street.\n\nThe last time I was at St Tropez they were out of what I was looking for, but I was able to find other libations easily. The shop is a little on the small side but they do cram a lot of product in. Employees have always been friendly. I'm a fan!
