I would call this 'forest to table' eating.  The meats are gamingly deliciousness (Yes, I make up words when I get excited about chomping on good food). On my visit I got:\n\n1. venison patty - think gourmet Jamaican patty with a pie-like crust served with a spicy sriracha tasting dipping sauce \n2. venison tartar - very good but nothing extraordinary\n3. braised rabbit pappardelle - so delicious and highly recommended,  pairs well with the main course meat plates\n4. Spice Ash Crusted Rack of Deer - the chef's signature dish. It's served with braised neck,\n parsnip pur√©e (so yummy), and swiss chard\n\nBest cocktail on the menu and one of the best in the city - the Smoked Barrel! Scotch (yess!) chocolate bitter (sweet!) maple syrup (Canadian eh?!) and the best part - a cinnamon smoked glass (fancy!)\n\nIf going as a pair I highly recommend reserving the chef's table - it is the only seats that looks right into the kitchen and they often give you extra goodies to sample.
