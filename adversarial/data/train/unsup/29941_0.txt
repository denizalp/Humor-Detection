the owners know us by name, which is a bonus, however, I love this place, I have been coming here for quite some time, you can get a very good lunch special, however, I specifically like to order the combo, which is a large pizza topping with 24 wings, half boneless half bone in with a side of zucchini and I add additional top can't beat it
