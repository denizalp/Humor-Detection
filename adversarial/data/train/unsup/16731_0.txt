I came here with pretty high expectations!  I had heard about this place from several of my Yelper friends and what the hey lets do it!\n\nThe place is dark and 90's style karaoke bar.  I sat at the bar; small selections, but I can make do.  My buddy joined me tonight and we were intrigued by the fusion of American bar food and Korean bites.  We started withe Bulgogi Cheese Fries along with some Korean Fried Chicken.  My buddy also ordered their Ramen.  Starting with the fries I was definitely excited to try!  Needless to say, the fries were cooked well and crunchy with the cheese oozing, but I rather find it lacking in the Bulgogi department. (Insert Sad Emoji)  As we proceeded with the Fried Korean Chicken; pretty much popcorn chicken with a side of sweet and spicy sauce and chipotle mayo.  I can see how the chicken would work as beer food.\n\nIn the end, Drunken Tiger is a cool spot, but it just didn't do it for me.  I like the concept, but definitely needs more crafting in their part.  I rather enjoyed my quick visit, but we'll see if there's a come back! - Enjoy!
