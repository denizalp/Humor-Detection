iHop, waffle house? Are you paying attention. Montreal peeps make fantastic breakfast (and brunch)  While I was on vacation in Montreal some friends brought me here for a nice early breakfast. Loved the decor of the place. Its bright, its cheery. I'm not a morning person so walking into a stylish bright ass restaurant woke me right up. We got there right before the line started forming out the door so get there early. They have a fantastic menu with pretty much any breakfast item you ever wanted. It is a bit pricier then the 2 places I mentioned above. For $11.95 I got a platter which consisted of waffles, eggs, sausage, bacon,ham, toast, creton, baked beans and fresh fruit. Breakfast of champions?.... more like breakfast of fall the hell back asleep. Of course the food was excellent. The maple syrup in canada is great and I brought a can or two back with me. \n\nSo if your in the Laval, QC area and you want great breakfast this is where you need to be.
