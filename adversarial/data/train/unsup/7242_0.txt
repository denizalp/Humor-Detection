One of the perks to being an only child, is \"me\" time. There is something special about having time to yourself, when the only obligation you have is to check in on Yelp, leave a quick tip, and grab a lemonade from the mall because it is 109 degrees outside.\n\nYesterday was that day. I had stumbled across The Art of Shaving. I've been in their stores in other cities before. Of course I have...because if you look at any of my pictures, you will realize a couple things: 1. I'm vain. 2. I'm hairless.\n\nAs soon as you step foot into this store, you are in a true gentleman's club. Not the kind that will take all your dollar bills. You won't make it rain here.\n\nThis is the ultimate shaving store. Soaps, creams, blades, razors, balms, brushes, and mugs. You name it, they have it.\n\nThe staff knows what they are talking about. I explained to them that I have a very old safety razor and a brush. Both were passed down by my Grandfather who passed away when I was a teenager.\n\nThey didn't pressure me into buying ANYTHING, although I did end up leaving with some shaving cream. They even gave me a proper demo on how to use it properly with my brush. I've been used to shaving soaps and the usual aerosol creams....so the little tutorial was nice.\n\nAlso, there is a master barber in the back of the house that does straight razor shaves, haircuts, and men's facials.\n\nRemember earlier when I said that \"me\" time is a perk? This is the best place to spend it if you are a dude.\n\nIf you are a woman, buy your man, or your man-friend a gift from here. This place is simply amazing.\n\nOne last warning. The store is pricey. but worth every single penny.
