I just visited this store for the first time and I'm so mad I didn't go in sooner!!! This is the perfect place for little presents for the holidays or other occasions. The popcorn is made in small batches so it's fresh and delicious. The \"Better than movie theater\" popcorn is amazing. I also loved the Chili Lime - spiced just right. The fruit flavors are also good. Their chocolate is also top notch and very well priced. Most of the items are made right there in the store. I told the associate today that it was my first time in the store and she took the time to show me everything, answered questions and even gave me a very nice sample cone. Yum! So many chocolate places around Baxter Village, Ballantyne are so expensive. This is reasonably priced and just as delicious.
