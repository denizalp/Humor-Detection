Definitely a spot for the nightlife crowd as I was not a fan of the food. Boyfriend and I split a sandwich, The Kilcooly. Our group was enjoying each others company while consuming a few tasty local beers but the food took over 45 minutes to come out. If you are an establishment this large you should be able to keep up with the demand. The sandwich itself was terrible, the turkey was dry and the cheese was overcooked. I took two bites and did not want anymore, the fries were okay but I wanted to eat those just to have food on my stomach. \n\nRecommended for shaking your bum on the dance floor, not recommended for food.
