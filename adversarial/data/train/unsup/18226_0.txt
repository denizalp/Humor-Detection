The best part of Pho Thanh is the flavor of pho broth. It really tastes home made where the bones are boiled for hours. Also, you don't taste any msg here; I've noticed I didn't get overly thirsty after eating here. I only wished my pho came out hotter. Once I added the bean sprouts, the broth wasn't hot enough to blanch them. Spring rolls were freshly made and was really tasty. \nThis place gets packed but service is fast. Tables are set up very close to one another so be friendly to your neighbors. Would go again.
