Ginger is the last place I will be expecting myself going for a quick Pho fix. But when it is -20C outside and you are at Yonge and Bloor and having something warm and slurping delicious just sound too tempting to ignore! So we decide to give Ginger a try with an open mind. \n\nYes the noodle is not the fresh type. \nYes the Pho broth might not be the most balanced one with star anise \nYes that sweetening taste in the Pho broth might be a sign of MSG \nYes the rare beef might not be the best cut \nYes the self served area for utensils and chili might not be the most hygienic \n\nBut me and my friend both has an enjoyable dinner, stuffing ourselves with Rare Beef Pho and Hot and Sour Noodle Soup... and we did not regret that we eat here! \n\nThe service here was friendly and efficient!! In and Out with no fuss! \n\nCheap, Fast, Fulfilling, Reliable and Simple. Ginger really does well in all these departments... Sometimes that's what I want in my meal... or even in my life?
