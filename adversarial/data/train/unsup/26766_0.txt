We were in the mood for Mexican so we checked out the reviews for this place and thought not so bad, would be a toss up. The only negative thing we had heard was that the food came cold and the service was so-so.\n\nThe decor and atmosphere of this place is pretty nice. When they said they had a salsa bar I was expecting more, the salsa cups are very small and the bar was disheveled (and we were there on a Friday night where everything should look tip top shape). There weren't so many salsa options, looked like they had run out of some. And the mild salsa was spicier than the medium, so either they were mismarked...\n\nThe food wasn't great. I had the hard tacos, they did actually come out cold I was super surprised about that because it didn't take so long for the food to come. But for the food to come out cold?! Very bad news for a restaurant. The side of rice was a small shot glass with probably about 2 forkfuls of rice. \n\nThe service wasn't awful but we've experienced better. If you are just in the mood for whatever mexican food then go for it, but if you are looking for great food then I'd recommend somewhere else. \n\nThe other odd thing- some dishes came in a tin foil plate, it was an awful presentation for them.
