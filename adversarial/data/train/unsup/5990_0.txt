We really, really enjoyed this. It is the one thing we did that we would most definitely do again.\n\nFirst, I got a Travelzoo deal that included two night rides (without the open bar) plus a $20 credit for Amorino (a gelato place in the Linq Promenade) for $65. It was a good deal, but next time we'll upgrade to the Happy Hour bar cabin, and no gelato. \n\nMy friends, who are in the military, got discount tickets, but their cashier was new and didn't have much help and it took FOREVER for them to get their tix. Kinda annoying, but we got over it. I don't know why, but there was no line to get in, even on a Friday night before the huge MvM fight, so we walked right on.\n\nIt was really cool (literally, thank god for a\/c), and the sights were amazing. It was also nice to be able to sit down after a ton of walking all night. \n\nWe really enjoyed this ride, and would recommend it.
