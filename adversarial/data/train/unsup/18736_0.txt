I ordered acorn-sized gravel and they Quick to deliver rock to my house. Once they got me to sign, the dumped a covered load of the WRONG sized rock onto my driveway and drove off leaving watermelon-sized boulders on my driveway. Have called at least 6 times, spoke to one of the managers (anthony) and still have not recieved a call back or any solutions. Great company if you get what you ordered, but if they make a mistake don't expect them to fix it. I still have a pile of the oversized boulders in my driveway. avoid this company!
