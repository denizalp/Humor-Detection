Inconsistent with customer service. \n\nThis has honestly been my favorite sushi place for months,but after today, don't believe I'll go back. To be honest,the best thing about this place is the food. \n\nWe asked numerous times for a utensil, didn't recieve what we ordered, and wait for for it... the gentleman told us to leave because \" there are other people waiting\" which,  Idk I felt was rude because I've worked in numerous restaurants before and you never tell the guests to leave lol.  I could understand if we were being rude and loud but it was probably a few minutes after we ordered dessert that he told us that. \n\nIt's ok Jjanga, I won't completely give up on you.  I'll give your other location a try.
