Although it's been awhile since being downtown, I always had a pretty decent experience at this Sunterra, despite their prices being higher than other options.  Unfortunately this place has changed for the worse! I grabbed a bowl of cream of broccoli soup to go but didn't notice until I was back at my desk that it was grey and lumpy with no hint of green or broccoli!  Looked so gross in the Styrofoam bowl.  I dared to taste it and regretted it immediately!  It had way too much oregano (who puts oregano in broccoli soup? yuck).  Pitched it in the garbage and went to Tim Horton's in the Bow building.
