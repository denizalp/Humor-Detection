Went for brunch on Sunday morning. Not very busy at 10:00 am: the 32 ounce Bloody Mary is delicious, and at only $8.50, it's a steal. I had the lobster scramble. Wife had the crab cake Bene. Both had delicious hollandaise sauce: light and slightly lemony, not the thick glue you get at many places. A strange aspect: their \"breakfast potatoes\" are actually mashed potatoes with cheese and chives. They were good, but I would have rather had traditional breakfast potatoes or hash browns. All things considered, it was a good deal and we'll go back!
