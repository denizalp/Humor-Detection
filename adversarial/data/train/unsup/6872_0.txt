I was craving sushi, so I popped into this place. Maybe it's just my taste, but I probably won't be coming back.\n\n1. The food is really expensive. They don't have AYCE, so you'll easily be spending $30 on two rolls.\n2. I wasn't expecting to see real crab in the California roll. I think that's great, but it was really dry and didn't have the texture I'm used to.\n3. My soda tasted flat or watery.\n4. There's only one soy sauce option, and be careful because it's salty AF.\n\nI left rather unsatisfied and disappointed because I couldn't even finish my food.
