Who needs a certain Michelin star Thai restaurant to make commercial center work? Not Saussagefest! I'm so happy they put in such a cute hip ( not to mention legitimate) restaurant in this complex! It's just what the hood needed. \n\nThe ambiance is relaxed,  clean,  and fun. The menu is diverse,  offering something for every appetite.  Feeling healthy? Have a tasty looking salad. Just heading in for swing shift? Get your all day breakfast here.  And who doesn't like a little bit of sausage in them after visiting the Green Door? \n\nThe fries and onion rings are house made.  The sausages are perfect size,  and the corn dog was perfectly battered!! \n\nBeer selection could use a mini boost,  but all in all there's variety. \n\nSo don't be turned off by the surrounding complex.  After all,  commercial center is part of the Las Vegas charm.  Let's support real local businesses Vegas style with a hot dog and a swinger's party!
