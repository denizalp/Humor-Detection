I'm not usually one to slam establishments, but I have to here.\n\nOur mothers went there for brunch today and were eventually asked to leave because their 90 minutes was up. They were even told they had to take their desserts to go. I've never in my life heard of such a crass approach to hospitality. \n\nWe've all felt the subtle pressures of crowded restaurant staff, and that's understandable. And if you have to have a hard time limit, I suppose then you can at least tell people before they sit down. But neither of those happened here. Absolutely terrible treatment of your guests.\n\nThankfully this was a social occasion, and not an important lunch with a client or key constituent member. Even the remote possibility that this might happen at a restaurant has to rule the place out for me.
