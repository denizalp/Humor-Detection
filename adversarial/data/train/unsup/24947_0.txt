DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!\n\nI'm writing this as I sit, extremely grossed out in my hotel room here at the travelodge. \n\nWe checked in on Monday evening where our room seemed fine enough for what we paid. Sure it isn't the cleanest but for $30 something dollars a night you can't be too picky. We unpacked everything that we had for our seven night stay, when we realized there was no key to our in room safe. We called the front desk and they offered to move us right then. We moved to a room two doors down and packed and unpacked all of our things yet again. The next day, we found a small cockroach in the bathroom and a few moments later, a very large cockroach climbing up the wall above our bed. We went down to the front desk to show them what we just came across and they didn't even bat an eye.... That was extremely disturbing to me, that both women working did not seem the least bit alarmed at the sight of two cockroaches found in their hotel!!! They offered us yet another room but we were on our way out to a pool party and we're already running late. So we moved to our third room later that evening. Packed up all of our things again and moved them all upstairs.. We got through the next day without a cockroach sighting in our new room, up until just now! I went into the bathroom and there was a giant one sitting on my tooth brush!!!!!! I would be leaving but it's an extremely busy weekend here in vegas and everything is either booked or too pricey! Each time I try to contact a manager about our ongoing issue, she 'isn't in'. Very disappointed in spending my vacation here, it has been a headache and a disaster. \n\nSave yourself the trouble and pick somewhere else!!! \nI've had a good experience at circus circus manor lodge which is not too much more expensive!!
