This place was so good when it first opened, I used to come every other day.  Over time the prices have gone up, food quality has gone (way) down, and service has degraded to the point where I've sworn it off entirely.\n\nI don't know if management changed or what happened exactly, but at this point it's overpriced, sub-par shawarma.
