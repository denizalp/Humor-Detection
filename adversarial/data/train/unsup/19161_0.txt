Not a bad place for free on the strip.  It is basically a gigantic M&M store that has character displays all over.  If anyone should have to find, let's say 1000 green m&m's to gain mystical powers(Snopes.com it) you could find them here in one of the large individually colored or special flavor dispensers.  Beware taking young children here!  Although the entry is free, your kids will unhastingly empty the funds in your account by the time you make it up the 4 stories of candy covered chocolate product promotion.  My kids ended up getting an M&M hotrod that dispenses candy as it drives around.  Teaching my kids that it is okay to eat candy that falls on the floor. lol.  There is however a free 3D short film on the 3rd floor!  Cute fun place for the kids or any diehard M&M aficionado.  Save some money to spend at the World of Coca-Cola next door.
