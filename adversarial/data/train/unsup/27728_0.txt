I'd give this place a 3.5 rating from my order of a beef burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I bumped it to a 4 because of the complimentary carrot and celery sticks that they offer at the beginning of the meal. It adds a nice touch!\n\nThe beef patty was quite large, though a little dry in the center but was well complemented by the assortment of available toppings. I especially liked that they offered saut√©ed onions and alfalfa sprouts as options :)\n\nThe fries were stringy and chewy - the type you could nibble away on without feeling full until it finally hits you. I personally enjoyed them more than the typical starchy thick-cut fries. \n\nService was friendly but a bit slow and the restaurant was emptier than expected for a Saturday evening. I wouldn't mind coming back for the lunch specials, which appeared to have some good deals.
