I love this location. Great staff that is attentive! Let them know of an issue and it is promptly addressed. Since the remodel they have 3 showers and a total of 4 bathrooms. I don't tan, but that seems like a nice perk too. Everyone is approachable, including the trainers. I highly recommend Mario!
