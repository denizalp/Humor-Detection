Love the theme here; a conveyor belt with food going around the room and you just pick up what you want when you see it. It's like an all you can eat buffet that comes to you. Lol.\n\nSeriously though the prices are amazing for sushi. Price goes from $1-$2 a plate ya can't beat that. The plates that go around are color coded for price so you know exactly what you will be paying. The plates have normally 4-8 pieces on the plate so $2 for 8 pieces is nice. I like this idea for the fact that if I go to another place I have to order a big order and pay a full price for something I MAY not like. Here you can pick and choose which ones you want and try something new without shelling out $12 for something you may end up not eating.To be honest I just got into the sushi crowd and mainly sticked to the cooked and veggie sushi things; BUT since this neat little concept is here I can try something new and not feel like I wasted A LOT of money.\n\nThe quality of the fish is on par with most restraunts here in AZ. You can't expect to have real fresh fish in a desert. \n\nThe service is ok at best. I've been there 3 times and have had the same result. When it is time for us to go it is hard to find someone to bring our check. I seriously had to raise my hand to get someones attention to bring me my check. I felt like a kid in a classroom. The first time I went it was busy so I paid it no mind but the last two times I went in the evening when it was slow and had the same problem. The workers there are polite but I feel I am not attened to enough.
