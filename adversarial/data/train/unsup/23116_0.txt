We came in on a Friday night about  9:30pm, and luckily for us, they had a table!\n\nWe order the $80 Omakase menu and yes, like everyone has mentioned, this is the best and most fresh seafood in town. \n\nIt starts off with homemade sake, and then a series of small plates with a couple of tastes on each plate. For me this menu was more than enough food. \n\nThe stand out menu items were the uni, tamago, scallop, rectangular tuna hand roll, and strawberry crepe dessert. \n\nThere was a plate with some cooked items, among them was a skewer of kobe beef  but it was overcooked. \n\nOther than the beef, everything was great and I would definitely come back for the fresh uni (even though I don't normally eat that!)
