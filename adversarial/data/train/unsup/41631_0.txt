Servers and gamemasters were incredibly sweet, huge selection of games, and the latte was delicious :) i really like the ambience and lighting of this location. One thing was that, due to overuse? Some of the more popular games like coup and anomia were pretty worn out and some seemed and felt a little dirty.
