I have been here a couple of times in the past and never had a great experience.  I would say mostly 2-3 stars.  The staff has never been friendly and it seemed like a chore for them to take my money and get me in to a lane.  The gentleman that ran the safety briefing and showed me to my lane was helpful, he gets 4 stars.  \n\nThe building is pretty new, and they are proud of that, and they should be.  But it doesn't excuse the better than thou attitude.  \n\nCheck on their pricing before you go, they may have increased their prices.  I recently saw a online Group coupon they had posted and the retail value is $234.50 for a day shooting.  $234.50 to shoot there!!!!  I cannot afford that just to shoot for 1-2 hours.  That is crazy.   \n\nWith their retail prices that steep, I am forced to find other places to shoot.  I may even meet a friendly face.
