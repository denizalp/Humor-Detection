Excellent service from Matt who was very knowledgeable of the foreign terms on the menu and made the atmosphere more lively.  He was very patient with the dietary restrictions that my friend had and made great recommendations.  \n\nHighlights were the peruvian corn which were colossal and meaty.  They disappeared very quickly.  We also shared the Rio Grande churrasco.  One of the 3 meats we had chosen were the rib eye which was medium rare and excellent with the red chimichurri dipping sauce (1 of the 4 sauces that came with the dish).  The lobster on the Samba Strip Roll was the best thing of the dish - everything else was a bit plain and for $20, I don't think I'll be ordering that again. We also had the tasty seabass skewers and topped our dinner off with 3 flavors of ice cream on a plate with a chocolate 'Happy Birthday' written on it for the birthday girls. The place is a bit pricey but heck, we were in Vegas!
