Talk about not judging a book by its cover! You've got to give this place a try - I feel so badass and authentic when I\"m there. I know that might sound ridiculous, but it's true. Just a giant counter of meat, and while I was incredibly intimidated at first, it's really grown on me. That, and I've learned that I can ask questions and not look stupid. I'm not a butcher, I'm not a chef, how am I supposed to know my country style ribs from my baby back ribs (other than being a southerner, but that was just for illustrating the the yelp readers out there).\n\nI wish they had more in the way of fresh seafood, but I understand that \"wild caught Pacific salmon\" isn't really what they mean when they say \"great western meats\"...
