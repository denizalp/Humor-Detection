10\/27\/10\n\nHappy 1st birthday, DPPM!  \n\nStopped by this afternoon to help celebrate DPPM's 1st birthday by sampling and voting for the best birthday cake in the \"Birthday Cake Bake-Off,\" which was held from 4p-6p.  (I left before 6p, so perhaps the celebration continued after 6p.)  While I was there, I tried cupcakes by Cake Contessa and slices of cakes by Tracey Dempsey, Phoenix Public Market Cafe, and Bread Basket.  It was so hard to pick a favorite, as each had something more special than the others.  Honest!  Here are participants' offerings (well, at least what I was able to try!)--\n\nCAKE CONTESSA: Vanilla and chocolate cupcakes w\/ vanilla frosting-\nBoth cupcakes were melt-in-your-mouth tender.  Out of the two, my fave was the vanilla!\n\nTRACY DEMPSEY: Coffee-marmalade cake- \nWhite cake w\/ orange marmalade-vanilla icing layer in the middle and coffee frosting.  Loved the texture of this cake, which was more like a pound cake), and I also liked the orange and coffee combo.\n\nPHOENIX PUBLIC MARKET CAFE: Chocolate cake AND Vegan chocolate cake-\nYellow cake w\/ chocolate frosting on top and middle layers, as well as a dark chocolate ganache atop a vanilla fondant layer!  Loved this cake's texture, which was a little denser than that of Tracy's, and the combo of the its texture and fondant\/ganache was new to me.  I've had cakes w\/ a fondant topping, and I've had cakes frosted w\/ ganache, but not one w\/ both!  Out of all the cakes I sampled, CC's simple vanilla cupcake and PPMC's ganache-topped yellow cake topped my list UNTIL someone brought out the...\n\nVegan chocolate cake- Eggless chocolate cake w\/ raspberry jam doubling as a filling and as a topper, w\/ garnishes of strawberries.  The bottom had a tan-colored layer, which I assumed would taste like mocha, but I didn't detect any coffee notes.  At first glance, I thought it might have been flourless, but closer inspection revealed a cake-y texture.  This cake was served slightly warm and tasted very good.  DPPM deserved my vote for \"best birthday cake\" by offering both vegan and non-vegan cakes, IMO!\n\nBREAD BASKET: White cake, cherry and vanilla filling, and frosting.\nLiked the flavor combo and the cake's texture, but I was felt like the flavors could've been a little more potent. (Summers Fruit Barn in Phoenix sells breads and pastries from Bread Basket.)\n\nI also sampled Sweet Republic's Pumpkin spice ice cream, a seasonal item.  It was fabulous!  I must stop by and taste it again before it leaves the menu!  (Crave Ice Cream and Grateful Spoon Gelato were no-shows.  Boo!)\n\nThank you, DPPM, for the invite!\n\np.s.  Forgive the sorry-looking cupcakes-- they fell as I reached for another slice of cake.  (There were so many others who were reaching for plates from all directions...  What?  Why was I such a pig, you ask?  Hey, I had to try every slice if I'm to vote for the best \"birthday cake,\" yes?  OK, then.  :)\n\nHmm.. I wonder which cake ended up w\/ the honors?
