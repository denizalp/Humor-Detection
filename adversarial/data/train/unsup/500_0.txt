I really don't understand why so many people rave about Pizzazz. It's just pretty darned blah.\n\nTheir salads are so cheesey and icebergy that they're hard to stomach. I don't understand shredded cheese on salad. Why? And why so much? If you happen to order a salad that contains chicken be prepared for it to be \"blackened\" aka grossly overcooked. I hate \"blackened\" anything. I thought that craze died in the mid-90's. \n\nThe pizza is passable. Not awful. Not great. Just passable. Or mediocre (my fave word lately). \n\nCalzones or whatever you'd like to call them -- extremely blah. I don't even want to talk about them they're so blah. \n\nSo as not to be too scathing, I do like one item they serve. I cannot recall the name though. It's much like a sauceless white pizza that's sprinkled with rosemary. Pretty good! Also, their chocolate chip cookies are always some of the best.
