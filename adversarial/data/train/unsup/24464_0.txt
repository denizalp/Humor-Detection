We returned to 1130 for the third time last night. I was craving steak, and remembered that I had seen that they had several options for cut and topping. We were seated immediately in a restaurant that was fuller than we had ever seen it. Our server came quickly, and proved to be adequate, but her style needed some polish. Maybe you could wait more than 2 seconds after giving us the drink menu to ask what we want? Anyway, they were out of Fat Tire, to Hubby's disappointment, but I enjoyed my Stella on tap. \n\nHubby ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken (subbed for the shrimp). Bad choice, simply because he had just had Pizza a Metro's gnocchi with Alfredo the other day. No one but Mario Batali might top Maurizio's glorious sauce (Hubby just chimed in with \"yeah, and that's a *maybe*\") . We discovered that the honey butter cheesy bread was now quite different- no discernible honey and too much cheese. \n\nSo why the four stars, when nothing yet seems to have been really stellar? The steak, my friends, the steak. Ribeye, medium rare, Classic Phoenix Seasoning. Pretty damn near perfect. The best steak I've had in a long time. I'll be back for more.
