This is one of my favorite places to get some really good Tex Mex in this part of town. The food is always fresh and the seating area is usually packed full of happy customers.\n\nNormally get one of their tasty Burritos and drench it in their homemade salsa. The Tortillas are made to order and this is definitely what makes this place so wonderfully delicious.\n\nThe menu here is pretty large and offers several combination plates as well. It is always fun watching the newbees standing in line with all their excitement. You can tell they have not been here yet and can't wait to check it out.\n\nGet here early for lunch or visit during off peak hours. The seating area gets very crowded and you may even get to share a table. No worries. Everyone is super friendly here.\n\nThis is not a high end restaurant and it more or less reminds me of the kind of Tex Mex that we used to eat back in TX. Just fresh fast food and a simple eating area to consume it.\n\nBring the whole family and a hearty appetite. This place is great for kids too. Just remember those delicious tortillas can be brought home for a snack later too. ESTOY LISTO!\n\n3.75 STARS
