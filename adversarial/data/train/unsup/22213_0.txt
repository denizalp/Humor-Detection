I have yet to find a better Chinese restaurant in Charlotte.  I actually bought my house in the neighborhood because we kept passing the Dim Sum place and I asked the realtor \"hey, what's up that street in front of the Dim Sum\" and there was my house, For Sale By Owner, I'd never have found it if it weren't for Dim Sum.  And when I moved in and my refrigerator didn't get delivered for 10 days, they pretty much fed me daily.  I was hooked.  Five years later, I still go there all the time, and every friend or family member who comes to town gets taken there.  I've never had anything that wasn't good.  Dim Sum on Saturday and Sunday mornings, with the little carts going full steam, is of course the big draw, but you can order most of the little dim sum treats any time you come in there.  Every now and then the waitresses will tell me that I should try some special dish.  I got a lamb hotpot that way that I've never seen on the menu since.
