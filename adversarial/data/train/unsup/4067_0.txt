Utter disappointment.\n\nI am like Jules in Pulp Fiction in that I love the taste of a Juicy Burger. With this in mind I figured Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay would have been a stone cold lock. Hundreds of beers to choose from, a masculine yet inviting interior, a packed house and even great bartenders had me sprung from the onset. In fact, I was seriously digging Burger Bar up to the point the Burger arrived!\n\nI decided to try the \"Perfect Ten\" Burger which really was more like a Perfect 5. Maybe Vegas grades on a curve? Basically they put down a (perfectly cooked) medium rare patty and top it with Gouda Cheese, carmelized Onions and serve it on a dry and stale Pretzel bun. With exception of the bun, the ingredients were fresh enough and the Burger was juicy and bold, it is just that there was no \"pop\" factor for me and at $16.00 it should have all kinds of wonderful in every bite. Frustrating.\n\nIt being Vegas, I gambled big but lost in the flavor department. If you are going to drop some serious duckets on a Burger, I would suggest going elsewhere.
