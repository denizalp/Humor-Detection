It's Cali Sandwiches so you know it's fantastic. \n\nThis location is huge, clean, very nice with a big area for sitting, cold beer ready to down with your delicious breaded veal sandwich.... just good times all around.\n\nI like mine spicy with sweet peppers and mushrooms but I can't imagine a combo that doesn't kick ass here. \n\nService is fast and efficient. I don't believe they have interac though, I didn't see a machine and ended up paying with cash, but I didn't ask either so beware.\n\nAlso getting in and out of the place via car can be a pain in the ass. \n\nWill be back here. Often.
