I would love to give this place 5 stars because the food here is out of this world delicious!! But I'm forced to give it three stars because of bad service, our waitress was rude to my boyfriend, and she only came to our table twice once to take our orders and the second to give us our bill, she never came to check on us to see if we needed refills on our drinks, we didn't even get her name because she was so short with us from the start. She's lucky she even got a tip from us at all.
