DON'T!\n\nSave yourself, your taste buds and your money! Worst buffet I have been to EVER! Seriously, no joke! I'm not an expert, but I've been around... and this is by far some of the worst food I have ever paid for, in any state I have ever been to. \n\nOnly thing this buffet is good for is making someone pay to eat here as a result of losing a bet! THAT is seriously a punishment. \n\nThe food is gross. Food options suck. Layout sucks. Kinda reminds me of the time I severed people at a soup kitchen, very cafeteria style, with flavorless slop they call food. JUST DON'T DO IT!
