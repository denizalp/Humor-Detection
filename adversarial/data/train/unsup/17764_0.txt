WTF is going on? I showed up on a random Thursday night with a party of four last night. The restaurant appeared to be about 1\/4 full. There were spaces at the bar, huge empty tables, 4 tops, booths and two tops all appearing ready for the sitting. There looked to be ample servers and bartenders to adequately service the entire place.\nWe were greeted by a woman that all but told us to go away. Actually, that is what she said.\n\"Look, our kitchen is backed up, it's going to be at least an hour wait. Tonight isn't a good night.\"\nWe questioned that for a minute, then conferred among ourselves. We decided we weren't in a hurry. We hadn't seen this group of people in so long that there would be a lot of catching up to do. \nWe went back to the woman and let her know we were happy waiting. We'd just go to the bar and have a few drinks. \n\"No, you won't. We don't have any clean glasses.\"\nThe one couple at the bar turned around wide eyed and told us to \"just leave. Seriously, it's horrible. We ordered an appetizer a half hour ago and we can't even get a drink.\"\nSeriously. What the f is going on?
