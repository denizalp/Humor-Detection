Now this is an interesting concept.\n\nI've seen this place for years, but never stopped by. I always wondered, how do you mix Chinese and Mexican cuisine? Exactly as you would imagine: by putting Chinese meat in a tortilla and serving beans on the side.\n\nIt was surprisingly delicious. They took us through a tasting of their most popular items (a HUGE plus in my book) and explained the ordering system. It was so hard to choose, and I felt rushed with a line forming behind us. I ended up with a combo - shredded beef quesadilla and Jade Red chicken burrito, with black beans. The Jade Red chicken is their most popular dish, and it was really good. Sweet and a little spicy. The shredded beef quesadilla didn't have much in the way of Chinese flair, but it was delicious nonetheless.\n\nEverything was as amazing as the 100+  Yelp reviews made it out to be.\n\nBut there was SO MUCH FOOD. So much. I don't think I was even able to eat half. Very greasy as well, but would you expect anything less from a Chinese-Mexican combo? The icing on the cake: COOKIES. mmm. Every combo comes with a cookie, which was a fantastic surprise.\n\nOverall, this food was really good and an amazing value. I could probably get three meals out of an $8 combo! Not something I could eat once a week (for fear of gaining ten pounds each time), but it will be a delightfully greasy treat now and then.
