As soon as I landed in Phoenix my boy took me here. Good job sir!\n\nI got absolutely stuffed in the sushi, which doesn't happen often. I'm a big man. \n\nCan't remember all the rolls I order, but they were all pretty good. I was however a little disappointed with the quality of tuna. \n-minus 1 star\n\nOverall though I would give them another shot to see if that was just not so great sushi night. It happens. \n\nI really dig the ambience of the place. Great tables.
