Let's put it this way: when you walk into Factory Shoe you will feel like you are being acconpanied by a shoe\/foot doctor in every section of that store. Staff here are very friendly, knowledgeable and caring and they will come up to you and ask you if you need help and will take their time. Prices are pretty competitive here for just about any style of shoe you choose; if you want it, they have it!
