I am not sure why it smells like incense. I am not sure why it is covered in tapestry. But, the vibe works, and I like a place that is committed to a motif. It's plush; it's cozy, and it provides one of the best views in Vegas. It is perhaps one of the truest lounges on the Strip. However, the music is generally nothing inspiring, and the drinks are pretty typical. Even so, I always have good times here, as there is enough room for a little impromptu dancing from time to time, and entry is often free.
