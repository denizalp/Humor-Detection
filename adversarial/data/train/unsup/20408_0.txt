Today I re-visited this fantantic place :)\n\nOnce again, the food is extremely fresh and delicious with the right amount of ingredients. The taste pallet is quite different than the normal Latin American food restaurant, and it has a bit more of variety of spices and seasonings from throughout the more southern regions of Latin America. \n\nThe decor is creatively put together, the lighting perfect seats surprisingly comfy (no butt cramps! lol)\n\nThe waiter was polite and friendly. The food prepared in good time. Once again, and again and again \"Ticoz\" has made my dining experience enjoyable :)\n\nLove, love this spot. A gem for Latin American food in Cenpho, five stars! :)
