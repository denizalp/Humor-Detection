This is one of the few pubs downtown that seems genuinely interesting in supporting the western Canadian craft beer industry as well as offering some rarer northern US brews. Often, their $5 craft beer specials are pretty fantastic (recently they offered New Belgium's Snapshot for $5.. that's a very expensive beer to buy here in Calgary).\n\nService is good even though the place can get really chaotic on a Friday afternoon. Food has been a little hit and miss for me in the last few times I've been but it gets the job done and arrives quickly allowing you to wrap lunch up fast if need be. The pork fat popcorn isn't just a novelty either; it really is fantastic.\n\nBut really the big draw for me is the beer selection and specials. Remember beer specials? This place still has some!
