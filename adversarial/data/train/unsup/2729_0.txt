Dear Costco, \n\nI want to express my sincere gratitude for existing. Your presence sooth my ever need to save money in this dire economy called Student life. Whenever I see you, I think of your delicious all beef or Polonese hot dog for 1.50$ with 20 oz soft drink included, and I glee with joy. \n\nYours truly, \nLoyal customer for life \n\nP.S:  Most of the products are of the highest quality. One downside of this place, you don't save much if you get one membership for one person and you don't drive. Save it when you are at least two! Gas is the cheapest you can find but it required a membership.
