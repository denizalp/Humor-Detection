I was introduced to Dicks one Sunday morning and instantly fell in love. Ehm, um, I meant fell in love with Dick's Hideaway.  Not that there is anything wrong with falling in love with dicks.  Nevermind.\n\nI love Mexican-style food for breakfast.  Why can't eggs be served with beans, tortillas, and green chile sauce?  I have had the Carne Adovado with eggs and the Huevos Ranchers.  Both are excellent.  Served with tortillas, potatoes, beans, and a healthy serving of cheese.  It has always come out piping hot on really cool pewter-type plates.  I love pewter plates!  Makes me feel like a knight or something.\n\nIt is not the biggest of places and sitting can be sparse depending on time of week and time of day.  Sundays they offer mimosas.  It is truly a hideaway.  It is hidden on the West side of 16th St in a strip mall, under cover of some viney type plant.  I have used type thing 4 times now.\n\nAnyway, give this place a shot.  It is awesome.
