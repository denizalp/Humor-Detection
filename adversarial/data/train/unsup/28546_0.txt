Kretzler's Tavern has been part of the North Hills dining and drinking scene for as long as I can remember (40+ years).  The place has continued to evolve over time but maintained their German slant on beer and food.  I enjoyed a nice cold Hacker Pschorr Munich Gold draft on tap tonight with my fish sandwich and perfectly seasoned potato cake with applesauce.  They feature more than 27 beers on tap which is nice and have a full bar area with high top tables and some games. \n\nTheir fish batter is a tad bland but the fish was white, fresh, and meaty so that sort of made up for the batter.  The potato pancakes were exactly like my dear Mother used to make: shredded potatoes with minced onion and egg that is formed into a cake and pan fried on high heat to give the outside that crispy texture and keep the inside moist.  My partner loved the coleslaw too. \n\nThe chairs and tables are beautiful rustic wood with a dark stain that must have recently been refinished.  Business was brisk with many casual diners still streaming in as we finished up around 8:45PM.  We love to find places that will accommodate some later dining so this one goes onto the short list of North Hills restaurants with later dinner bells. \n\nOur waitress was very attentive and courteous which created a nice dining experience. The rest of the menu is staple diner\/home cooked food like steaks\/chops, sandwiches, burgers, and appetizers.
