The business said it was open today on a Sunday. We went around 3pm and business was closed. They had around 40 to 50 cars on the lot ranging from BMWs to Chevy malibus. Most cars in the 5k range were pretty best up with visible body damage. Some of the nicer cars did not have prices listed on them. They had signs everywhere that as long as you have a job they will finance you. I gave 1 stat cause I was irritated I drove there and no one around. Also lots of crack head people walking around.
