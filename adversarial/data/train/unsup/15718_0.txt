Just left the salon and feel like I am walking on air. Amazing what a great pedicure and foot massage can do for one's spirit.  Am not new to this establishment and have never had a less that fine experience.  All the technicians are excellent.  Today, Nghia, whom I call Dr. Nails, is the reason I write.  His skill and pleasant demeanor are a treat.  And the massage chairs are  terrific., too.
