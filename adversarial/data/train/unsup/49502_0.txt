Bought a Groupon for a Gel Manicure with the Paraffin Wax treatment. I went on my lunch break and was very limited on time, but the nail tech (I forgot her name!) had no problem getting me out in time for me to get back to work. My nails look great and the hand massage and wax treatment was amazing. Very happy with my nails!! Will be returning! :)
