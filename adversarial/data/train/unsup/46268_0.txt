Went to Arizona Archery Club to buy my first ever bow. I was nervous they would make me feel uncomfortable but that couldn't be farther from what happened. Kenny spent several hours with me choosing the right bow picking accessories, tuning the bow, then helping me learn proper techniques and sight in the bow. Between Kenny and Daniel, along with all the other staff, I couldn't have felt more comfortable or been more satisfied with the entire experience. Love this place and will be a customer for life.
