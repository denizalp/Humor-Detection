Short Story\n\nVery good Pig and Very Good Pickles. The plates are protein heavy , nearly perfect and you can easily eat Pig PIG and MORE pig in a comfortable casual setting. (Insert the Monty Python Spam song here but use Pig instead of the spam word.) With a daily changing menu.\n\nLong Story\n\nThey have many interesting starter plates we picked the pickles and the cheese plate so we could have variety . The pickle plate was colorful and impressive. Each vegetable or fruit I tried all tasted different and was interesting. I thought the cheese plate was very good since it was made of better cheeses  , it also was a good sharing size. \n\nWe had a Pork Porterhouse that was perfect and came with well seasoned beans and we also had a trout dish that differed from the on-line menu example but was delicious and prepared masterfully . Both dishes were light with the vegetables. The only real starch on the trout plate was the breading from the shrimp.\n\nDecided to try a dessert since most have pig in them so we went for a less piggy option and tried the pretzel bread pudding topped with the BEST IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD peanut butter ice-cream. A yummy blackberry complimented this dessert making it taste like a yummy peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This dessert was nearly perfect my only criticism is that the bread pudding was chewy and hard but it was so tasty I ate it anyway.\n\nOur server was very well trained and knew the menu well.\n\nThe ladies room was clean and nice but the stall was extremely small with the door opening in instead of out so even if you are tiny it's hard to get out.\n\nVery solid very good.
