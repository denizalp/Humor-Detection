This place is amazing! Perfect place to take a date. Beautiful atmosphere with a laid back vibe. I was Intensely listening to her speak.. Until I took a bite of that divalo pizza... Ooooooi that sauce! It was love at first taste. Forgot I was trying to impress a lady.. completely ignored her for roughly 5 minutes and made love to that pie. \n\nI had an app too. No idea what it was called but I it was fantastic! Cream filled mozz ball with tomatoes, bread and of course balsamic reduction. \n\nIf I lived closer I'd be broke! Nough said.
