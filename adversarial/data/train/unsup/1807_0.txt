I just recently discovered this place, as it's just down the street from where I'm working in Avondale. I have twice ordered the #2 special (slice of pizza with a salad and drink) and was not disappointed. It tasted good and was cheaper than going to the under staffed and over crowded SUBWAY next door. The lady behind the counter is extremely polite and has allowed me free refills on my soda both times. This is my new lunch place. I love it.  See ya, SUBWAY!
