When Rand H. told me that our lunch group was having a UYE here, I looked up the yelp reviews for the place and decided that I *must* go. And I'm glad I did! I had the fish, chicken, and carnitas tacos - all really good, especially the carnitas where the pork was slightly crispy, the way I like it. I also ordered a chile relleno and it was the best I've ever had - so flavorful and tasty that I easily finished it even though I already felt full after eating the tacos. This place is quite a distance from where I live but I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again and again; it's certainly worth the drive.
