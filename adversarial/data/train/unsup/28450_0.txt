Less than friendly front desk lady. I had a 10% check-in offer from Yelp and she had no idea it existed. She said, \"you have a what?\"  \n\n\nPlace was pretty clean. They have a basketball area in the back. They also have TVs and DVDs for each station. Kids and toddlers can sit in the car of their choice. \n\nI waited about ten minutes until our hairdresser was available to cut my son's hair. I had called and made an appointment. My son's haircut went as expected. Blood curdling screams here and there. Our hairdresser, McKayla was very patient with him. She was able to give him a nice haircut. I am satisfied with McKayla's service and will probably be back. \n\nHeads up: they will be taking cash tips only from now on.
