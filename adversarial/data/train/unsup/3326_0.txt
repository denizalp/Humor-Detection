Wings Plus Things is the halal hangout I wish I had when I was growing up.  Good food, great prices and a pretty awesome venue to hang out with your friends (open until 3am on the weekends).  \n\nThe chicken shawarma was really good.  What sets it apart from most other shawarmas is the fact that it was pressed and served in a manner where I felt like I was eating a chicken shawarma panini...different, but in a great way.  \n\nWhat I liked most about this place was the atmosphere.  They have a very nice lounge located on the second floor.  They have comfy leather sofas, a big screen tv and they servce sheesha which makes for the perfect place to hang out with a the friends on a Friday night.  The food and atmosphere are of great value.  Whether you want a shawarma with pop for $5.99, or if you feel like splurging a bit and having a shawarma, pop and sheesha for $14.99, you will not be dissappointed for what you pay.
