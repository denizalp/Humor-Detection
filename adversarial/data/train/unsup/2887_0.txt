Babbo's, a family-owned restaurant chain, recently opened this new location down the street from where they had another location.  This newly-built location is beautiful, modern, feels much larger than the old location, and has much greater visibility from Bell Road.\n\nAnd the food... is still just as good as ever!  I previously had the Sicilian pizza (multiple times) and Caesar salad, and this time ordered a calzone.  I chose to build my own calzone and added sausage, mushroom, and fresh tomatoes as fillings.  All calzones come stuffed with mozzarella and ricotta cheese as well... and come with a big bowl of some of the best marinara sauce I've ever had in a while!\n\nThe service here is almost always spot-on and quick to take orders, fill up your drinks, get you containers for your leftovers, and take care of your bill.  \n\nWhether you're looking for a (fairly) quick lunch stop or a nice(r) place to bring the family for dinner, Babbo's is it!  \n\nI am definitely a fan and will continue to frequent this location.\n\n*****FIVE STARS*****
