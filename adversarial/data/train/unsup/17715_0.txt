What an amazing place! What a smorgasbord of all things outdoors! \n\nThe parking lots are spacious and have alot of tree coverage. There are lots of pretty boats to see outside as well as some ATVs. You wander inside and are confounded with 2 floors of clothes, guns and equipment. \nThere are mounts of every kind to inspire you. There is a shooting gallery for the kids, but the guns were a bit heavy for my small kids to hold. They felt about as heavy as real rifles. They have two large fish tanks  one in the fishing section (fresh water) (you can watch them feed the fish on Tuesdays & Saturday) and one in the restaurant area(salt water). There is a lovely stream that is stocked so you can enjoy the big trout swimming by. They have a bow range upstairs to try out all the goodies. Their gun prices are decent along with a good selection of accessories and ammo. Nice selection of all kinds of ladies clothes and shoes for every outdoor endeavor.   The restaurant & bar are pretty comfy and have a decent menu. They are open the same hours as the store The service there is decent. We have enjoyed the burgers and the cobb salad mostly. I ordered the shrimp scampi one time and the shrimps were dry.  The only complaint I can really put forward is the front store cashiers\/employees. I've had fairly poor service each time I've come. The cashiers are grumpy, distracted, unhelpful and I've actually had a girl walk away from me while I was talking to her cuz she was off. Oops! \nSo take it or leave it. I'd love to let Bass Pro Shops know their cashiers are terrible! Hello?
