This week end I celebrated my 14 year old daughter Confirmation. It was a party to remember. My daughter didn't want \"a boring restaurant \". So I booked Dreams Imaginarium. It was better than I expected. The children had so much fun. I believe the Adults had just as much fun as the kids. With them playing pool and other games that they have. The staff is over the top professional and nice. They are there to assist you in everything you need. The party room was VERY CLEAN!! I booked the room of four hours. When it was time to go the adults and kids that attended the party, didn't want to leave. Dreams thank you for the AMAZING games and Rock Climbing for my guests. I can't wait for my son's communion in two years. I know exactly where I'm having it. Dreams I can't wait to have my next party at your playground. Keep up the good work
