Walked in 2pm-ish, place was empty.  After some time an older gentlemen slowly approached, stopped, and stared, silently.  I mustered the courage to ask if they were open.  \"Yes\", he said, offering no further syllables.  The stare-down continued for another moment, then he turned, picked up a menu on his way past the bar and proceeded to walk towards the back, and so I followed, undeterred.  \"Thank you\" I said, hoping to turn the mood.  Sadly, my efforts proved fruitless.  Was it something I said?  Was it the way I parked my car?  My choice of hat, perhaps?  We'll never know, as I decided I had seen enough and exited with my craving for a gyro unsatisfied.  Happily I found joy just around the corner in a chile relleno.
