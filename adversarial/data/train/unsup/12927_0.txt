Seems like this place is getting worse. Instead of adding a tanning booth they should have upgraded and fixed some of the equipment. The rates are pretty high for what you get compared to other gyms. Parking here is also a real pain so you might get a workout just from having to walk from a mile away. The inside is kept really clean though so I give props to the cleaning crew who I always see working hard.
