I was recommended by one of my closest friends and couldn't be more happy with my experience! Every time Diana comes to pick up Charlie (my 11 month old lab) for a walk or I come home after she pet sits, Charlie is always so excited and happy. You can really tell Diana loves what she does. Diana has also been very accommodating with my sometimes crazy schedule or when I've needed to go out of town for work last minute. I would absolutely recommend Citizen Canine if you're looking for someone to love and care for your pet like you do!
