Had an extremely pleasant experience. Ortal and Sean we're both very personable in providing exceptional service at the Las Vegas locations. My girl and I both got burgers that were made to order and arrived almost immediately. Compliments to the chef in preparing the food as the taste and presentation were exceptional. Almost the second we sat we were able to order drinks and have them delivered promptly. Their attentiveness and timeliness was above and beyond expectations. This made for excellent hospitality. Will definitely return and recommend to friends and family! Thank you again for a great experience! Definitely recommend if you are in Vegas. If the weather is great, outside is a must!
