Disappointed! Wanting to taste a Smokey wood burning brisket and it was no where near the taste of B-B-Q brisket like back home in Chicago. Brisket seemed boiled and not smoked. Travel to Madison often and will not be coming here for BBQ. Dumb founded how they won all these awards on the other hand have not ate anything else and plan not to spend the money here to do so...
