Not too ecstatic about this place.  We were there fairly late in the evening on a Sunday, place was packed.  With the starters and cocktails we were off to a fantastic start.  My girlfriend had the carpaccio, I had the spinach salad.  We loved these. However, for entrees both of us were disappointed.  The lobster ravioli was fairly light and ok tasting but nothing special.  My girlfriend said it tasted exactly like the lobster ravioli we get from Costco, definitely nothing to write home about.  I had the Dover sole special. The preparation and smells coming from this were amazing.  My grumble here was the prep was done the other side of the room, table side would have been memorable.  The fish was mushy, not firm and delicate, as I was expecting.  As well it had very little taste and too many bones.  The wine selection\/service by the sommelier was a disappointment to say the least.  Overall compared to other fine italian restaurants I have eaten at(Cafe Juanita, Bartolotta etc) this one is low on the list from this experience.
