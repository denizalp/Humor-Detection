The food was great, and very reasonable. The food is simple breakfast food, nothing too fancy. There is a lunch menu, but breakfast is the star of the show.\n\nThe hostess was very rude, which is why I only gave 3 stars. When we arrived and put our name in, we asked if we could have a glass of ice water, as it was rather warm out. She said we could pay for a glass, but would not give us water until we we were seated. This is ridiculous and her curt tone added insult to injury.
