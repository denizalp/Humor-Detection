I'm so confused as to why everyone loves this place. I HATE this place. I roll my eyes and swear every time someone invites me to a Friday or Saturday night birthday party here, because there is a line-up to get in at least 80-85% of the time and it's always one-in-one-out starting relatively early in the night.\n\nThis in and of itself is not why I hate it; I hate it because once you finally get inside, you realize that you could, as my mother would have said, \"shoot a cannon through it,\" meaning, it's effing empty.\n\nI suspect this is a zoning\/licensing thing related to the fact that they have tables and chairs and couches (so a seated, tables + chairs patrons limit.) But on Friday and Saturday nights, they drag most of these out of the way and everyone is standing anyways.\n\nPerhaps I'm soured by the fact that on Hallowe'en 2012, I told some smug white guy that his \"I'm African\" costume was vaguely racist, got into an argument with him over it, and then got chewed out by his insecure girlfriend who sidled up on the conversation thinking I was pulling his metaphoric schoolyard girl pigtails and hitting on him... She sucked, he sucked, this place sucks.
