Disappointing. After waiting 50 minutes to have someone acknowledge me, I was ready to leave. My friend approached the manager and let her know. The manager sincerely apologized and promised to \"make it right\". That lasted about 5 minutes. This place is AWFUL!!! Yes, we got a discount. But it wasn't worth it. Worst service EVER.  Don't waste your time or money.
