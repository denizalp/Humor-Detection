This is my FAVORITE place for Middle Eastern Food, its not fancy, but oh is the food tasty and reasonably priced.   I've been coming here for years and try to get here at least once per week.   The servers know me.   They know that I like to sit in the window so that I can people watch, and that I like my water without lemon:-).   The place is always packed at lunch, but I never have to wait for my food.   I love the Chicken Shishtawook rolled pita and the tabbouli.   The rolled pitas aren't stuffed with lots of ingredients like other places, but still very good.  Each order arrives with a side of peppers and pickled turnips (yum).   I usually park in the back which means that I literally walk thru the kitchen to get to the dining area.  The place is family owned and everyone in the kitchen is busily working....chopping up fresh veggies etc.   As other reviewers have noted they don't accept credit cards, so I have to make it a point to make sure that I have cash before I go.   \n\nThe Fattoush salad is very popular and also very good and I also enjoy the chicken noodle soup which has a unique Middle Eastern twist.....cinnamon maybe???\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
