Blue Ginger is a new Asian restaurant in the SE Corner of Parma in the Acme plaza at Pleasant Valley and Broadview Roads. They have been open three weeks. We came in at 5:30 PM on a Saturday and there were about 20 people - some couples, some groups including a few families with kids. We were greeted and seated immediately and our drink orders were taken quickly. The menu covers a broad swath of Asia - available are Japanese soups and noodle dishes, sushi, Thai curries and Chinese entrees. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the staff was courteous and attentive. We ordered two pieces of sushi and a spicy tuna roll and they were delivered to the table in short order. The salad from our also-ordered sweet and sour chicken and the tempura shrimp for an udon bowl came shortly after. The sushi and tuna roll were very good and the tempura shrimp was perfectly cooked; crisp panko and tender juicy shrimp. I should point out that I rarely comment on salads in Asian restaurants; salad is never great in an Asian restaurant and is such a western addition to Asian cuisine that I think it should be avoided in favor of soup....but that wasn't my order. The sweet and sour chicken came with the sauce on the side and perfectly fried chicken served with flash-fried peppers, onions and sweet pineapple. All of the dishes were presented well and tasted fine. There was no new ground broken in the presentation, preparation or flavors and everything was quite good and just as one would expect. No disappointments but no stunning revelations either.\n\nThe price was agreeable, though. Two pieces of sushi, spicy tuna roll, sweet and sour chicken, Udon bowl and drinks came to $35. My family is such that we could easily order a Thai dish, a Chinese dish, a Japanese dish and some sushi were it only possible.....and now it's possible for what we consider a pretty affordable price, with good quality food and excellent service.
