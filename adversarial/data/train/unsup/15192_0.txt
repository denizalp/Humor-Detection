I'm so pleased. I didn't know what to expect here, but I had a really good time and the stuff was really funny. \n\nWe went to the Friday night show. The tickets were sold out, but good thing I bought tickets before hand. (tip: if you're in a hotel, check the wall with all the minicard discounts. I got 20% off my ticket)\n\nGet there earlier to grab a good table, they assign them as you get in. I wish I knew this earlier, but parties of 7 and over, can pre arrange tables, and get there max 10mins before the show starts. \nWe got there about 15 mins before the show started and got a nice table at the back of the bottom section. Although in the back row, kudos foe giving us stools rather than normal chairs. Great seats.\n\nThey have full bar service at the tables, and you can get finger foods too. i didn't expect. glasses of beer at $5.95 and pitchers are $19.95 = 7 glasses. \nHad sweet potatoe fries with mayo. Good, but got cold and soggy quickly. \n\nThe show was AWESOME. After the scripted show (which was really just a bunch of random skits that got melded together nicely), they had FREE IMPROV (which they had everynight at 9:45 - Fridays) I expect this to be theatresports style, but it was just the players doing skits that were purely improv. Still good. \nTip: if you go for the later show, you'll have seats for the improve afterwards (on Sat) otherwise there's this break in between for the 2nd show.\n\nAlso another tip. Found free parking on Blue Jay Way in front of soho met, and the cora's.  You can park there after 6pm. No standing from Apr-Nov until after 12pm. Does no standing inherently mean no parking? Not sure. \n\nWould come again!
