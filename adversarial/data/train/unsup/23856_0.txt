The place is a dump! Water damaged room (The wallpaper and paint are peeling off of the walls in the corner), no towel rack in the bathroom (you can see where it once was - where it was ripped out of the wall), The headboard has cigarette burns in it, housekeeping is terrible, a dirty rubber glove was left on our countertop after they \"cleaned\" the room. Both my partner and I woke up every morning completely congested and could barely breathe from the the dust mites in the room. The soap and shampoo were not refilled after the room was cleaned. The hot water tap is either bowling or completely cold, no middle ground there. Internet service did not work all the time and was extremely slow when it did. The fire alarm went off with no explanation, I was told by security to keep an \"ear and eye open\" for what?? A FIRE! \n\nAnd this place has the nerve to charge for a resort fee!! And a parting fee!! The manager Diane I spoke to completely dismissed my concerns. I will Never stay at a MGM resort again. \n\nThe only thing we wanted to do each morning is get out of this place as quickly as possible. Talk about a dream vacation! \n\nThanks Diane for your professional help.\n\nSave your money, avoid this place!
