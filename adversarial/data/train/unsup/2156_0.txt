4 stars for cake (not sure about drinks) but 1 star to service!!!!!!\n\nI think I didn't ask too many questions!\nI think I paid correct amount!\nI think I didn't bother her sleep!\nI think.....\nI think.....\nI think she just unhappy to work, or maybe work there!\n\nIf so.... please don't work at this nice sweet bakery store, cuz you are going to make customer go away. Come on! You are losing ppl = losing money! If you are doing business, especially with services, then please be nice a little, just a little will be fine! \n\nHowever, I like their cakes for my breakfast....
