Really great restaurant! Excellent and attentive service, good food for a reasonable price that was quickly prepared. All of the staff we encountered were friendly; the outdoor seating was very comfortable. And the end of our meal, we received a complimentary dessert from the owner, who expressed his happiness that visitors to Las Vegas were coming to his restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant!
