So happy that another katsu place has opened up downtown! Katsuya offers different types of katsu sets, with proteins like pork and chicken served with various sauces to choose from (original sauce, carbonara, chili garlic, spicy garlic, curry, etc.). All of the sets come with unlimited refills of miso soup, cabbage salad, and rice.\n\nWe came on a Thursday night and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. I reckon they will get more and more popular in the coming days though.  Interior is very cute - rustic with cozy lighting. Service is attentive and friendly. My fiance ordered the carbonara chicken katsu ($17.50) and I ordered the original chicken katsu ($13.50). The chicken was soft and juicy inside the crispy batter. We both got our sauces on the side, which I would recommend as the sauces can get heavy! The carbonara is creamy and comes with tiny pieces of shrimp. The sauce that comes with the original chicken katsu is reminiscent of ketchup and you add self-grinded sesame seeds to it.\n\nYelp pro tips - check in to get a free pop and write a review to get $5 off your next meal!
