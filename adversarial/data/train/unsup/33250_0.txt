Decided to try this place since it's so close to where I live. It's a small place and are currently renovating to expand. I went at night, close to 6pm, so it wasn't crazy busy but I imagine it gets busy during lunch time since there are many businesses around. \n\nI got the fresh burger with poutine. I was pleasantly surprised to see them drain the oil from the burger before putting it on the buns. It made the edges of the patty a bit crispy which was nice. I wish I opted to change the [processed] cheese topping to something better though. The poutine was really good, not too salty, and they give you a decent portion. \n\nBetter than settling for a McDonald's run. You can also order online from their website for a quick pick-up.
