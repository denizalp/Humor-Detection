So after an In-Home Unlicensed Daycare fiasco I faced, I pulled Baby C out as quickly as possible.  Searching high and low on Yelp, DHS, and asking fellow mommies - I found Little Explorers. \n\nCan I say - THANK GAWD!!    \n\nBaby C has been here at Little Explorers since the end of November 2012. The change in this kid in the 2 months he's been there is amazing.  The infant room is within teacher-child ratios.  Baby C LOVES all the teachers there.  Especially Miss Angelica and Miss Letty!  \n\nHe has room to crawl, explore, and play!  AND he has other baby friends to be around and play with.  He's not just placed in a jumper or play pen OR left unattended in a room to fend for himself and scream til he passed out from exhaustion (true incident at the In-Home...I was PISSED!).  \n\nReasonable rates for babies.  Awesome Hours: 6am-6pm.  Wonderful Teachers.
