We had been wanting to try this place  for a long time and stumbled upon it on our way to see the Dolphin Habitat at the Mirage.  We got the Carnegie Famous Reuben with corned beef and it was so amazing.  The wait for the food was half an hour but how gargantuan the sandwich was was very impressive.  Our sandwich came with a pile of sauerkraut and ooey gooey swiss cheese, and we made sure to drizzle hot mustard onto each bite, which made it have the perfect balance of flavor.  I believe this sandwich was $24.99 but if the price keeps increasing, I guess this visit will have probably been my only one.  Worth the try!
