An absolute gem if you love anything retro like yours truly. They have the classic pinball game (apparently largest pinball arcade in Montreal) laid out in rows of giddy and flashy arcade lights across the middle of the bar. On one end, overlooking St Laurent, you have a few tables and chairs (mostly occupied with coats since its human owner is probably hoarding a pinball machine). There's a projector playing clips from 90s Hollywood cinema on a blank wall and you have North Star (the shoe brand) merchandise stamped across the place. If all of this isn't 90s tweens enough for you to throw up with nostalgia, there's also a jukebox in the corner with some hardcore Britney and backstreet boys. I had a cocktail and a few shots there and the price really varies, there's something for everyone regardless of whether you broke away from the genX cycle or not. My cocktail was called Golden Arrow (pineapple syrup) and I loved it! In short, this is a no nonsense solid place for a good night out with friends who also lived through the Y2K glitch without surrendering to the illuminati. Top recommendation if you want to pull off that \"Rachel from FRIENDS\" haircut with no judgment in 2016.\n\nP.S. They were playing Hillary and Haley Duff when I was there
