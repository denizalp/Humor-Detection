Aaaammmmmmmmaaazzzzzinnnng!  The quality and freshness of the food is incomparable.  \n\nWe had a server who was so attentive, I wouldn't have thought that he was serving anyone else but us.  The experience is something of it's own.  They have a display where you can actually walk up to it, learn about the fish on the menu, and then hand pick the fish you will be eating that night.  \n\nWe had an appetizer, an entree and dessert between two people.  This place is not cheap...but man, you get what you pay for!  For our appetizer we had the charred octopus.  ORDER THIS!  You'll think that it was caught right out of the ocean, just for you and your dinner that night!  I'm from Hawaii and it was like the fresh tako that I am used to back home, but much fancier and much tastier.  This was followed by our order of a 1.8lb fish that was some sort of mediterranean bass.  This thing was grilled to perfection and served with fresh lemon, herbs, and a drizzle of olive oil.  Alongside this dish, we ordered a platter of grilled vegetables that came with peppers, asparagus, some sort of greek cheese, and zucchini.  EVERYTHING TASTED SO FRESH and was perfectly seasoned.  The food was so good that my friend and I stopped talking for a few minutes just so we could enjoy the flavors in our mouths!  It was so good that I'm writing this review over a month later and I still remember every part of that meal.\n\nWe topped it off with the baklavah.  This was good baklahvah.  My boyfriend is turkish, I've been to greece, and my very good friend is from lebanon.  I've had my share of this dessert.  I wouldn't say it was the best bakalvah, but it definitely was good!  Not overly sweet and it comes with ice cream to accent it. \n\nGO HERE!  ...and prepare to be amazed
