Do you like Matcha before it was trending? Do you try to think of ways how to get more Matcha goodness in your day, but can't think of how? Then this place is for you! They have high quality Matcha in their Imperial drink and it was selling like hot cakes. Or more like green tea cheesecake! Because they have that too! \n\nService was friendly and fast. I opted for the white grape oolong tea with cheese mousse and adjusted sweetness of 50% on the server's recommendation. The cup has a unique open mouth top so you can try the topping without popping off the whole lid. Smart. The cheese mousse was slightly salty and very creamy. Not like eating a whole piece of cheddar cheese asI feared. It is more like a mild flavored white cheese transformed into a whipped and creamy topping. When stirred with the white grape oolong tea it added more body and soft mouth feel. The tea flavor is strong and I think I would of been fine with the 50% sweetness level, but I decided to have it readjusted just a tad more sweet and it was perfect for me. The grape flavor became more prevalent. As a result, I think maybe 75% sweet will work out for me next time around.\n\nGlad this place opened up on this side of town. The place is clean, has free Wi-Fi, and customer service is  helpful. Will be back to try the tiramisu topping!
