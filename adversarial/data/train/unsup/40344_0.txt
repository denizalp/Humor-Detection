We have been here for two years in a row as a post carb-up meal for the Las Vegas Rock n' Roll Half Marathon in December.  The food is fine, and the atmosphere is awesome, cheesey yes, but fun.  \nWine is included, and you can order from a variety of dishes off giant menus on the wall - and the best Accordian player makes his rounds and sings songs to you!  We love throwing bucks his way to hear him sing state-specific songs to us like \"California Here I Come\", and \"New York, New York\".  I think next time I am going to be from Oklahoma.\nIts perfect for a big group - make sure you have a reservation because its been packed when we have been there.\nYou can either park in the lot or walk from the strip (its back behind Flamingo\/etc.)
