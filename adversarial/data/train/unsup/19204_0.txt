We stopped in here tonight to grab some kona coffee ice cream draped in hot fudge and there were a few issues, so I'm deducting one star. \n\n1) They had a small acoustic group performing that was 70's wonderful but they were so loud we literally had to scream our orders to the staffer. \n2) The staffer was either new, or short bus special, because we had to tell him that the whole point of ordering a sundae was to get the toppings (he didn't offer and I wasn't paying $5.25 for two scoops of ice cream). \n3) The previously larger than life scoops have experienced significant shrinkage. They really aren't even normal size scoops anymore. \n4) Some how my $5.25 sundae came out to $6.27 after tax. I know AZ is experiencing a budget crisis, but there is no way that taxes have gone up that much, so I must conclude that I was overcharged. \n5) The place was so full of Zpizza customers listening to the music that there was literally nowhere to sit, unless we went to the noticeably empty pizza side. The result was not only a complete invasion of my personal space (I simply don't like rubbing up against strangers just to get to the counter unless I'm at a bar) but it also created a really strange odor comprised of pepperoni and sugar... far from appetizing. \n\nAll in all, the visit was a complete disappointment - but the band was great.
