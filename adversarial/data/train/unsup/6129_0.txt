There is so much to like about the Signature!  The rooms are either studios or suites--some with full kitchens.  Each tower has their own pool and gym--all which are really nice.  The only down side for me is that there is no casino--I love to be able to run downstairs and hang out.  And you can, but the walk is long and far.  If you are in tower 3, you are closer to Planet Hollywood than MGM!  It's great for families.  It's great if you are staying for a long convention.  But for me, if I'm in town for a quick weekend, I need to be in the thick of things.  Nothing personal and I still love you, Signature!!
