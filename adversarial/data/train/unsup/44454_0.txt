It was okay. If you're in a hurry, don't go here. This is a mom and pop place. Literally a house with seats on the patio. I enjoyed eating outside since it was sunny but not hot. However, I didn't enjoy that there are like 5 flies flying over my food. They are dog friendly so that's a plus too. On the food, it was forgettable. The french toast was good but not great. It'll be better with no hashbrowns. Maybe because they were bust when we went in this morning but mine was cold and too hard.  But yeah overall they were just okay. The only thing that stood out to me was their green apple smoothie. Will I come back? Sure, maybe, but not soon.
