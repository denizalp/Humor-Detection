Needed a few extras and the local Walgreens is a must for these essentials . This store was organized very well and the staff was very helpful. When we walked into the store there was a man puking and in distress. One of the cashiers was down there holding a bucket for him on the ground while the paramedics were in route. This site of human compassion was very impressive since with Walgreens being a pharmacy and all. \n\nWe found what we needed and the emergency that was happening they handled very well. They kept customers from being in a panic because of this odd scene. I paid for all the purchases that we found and even found some things that we did not need too.
