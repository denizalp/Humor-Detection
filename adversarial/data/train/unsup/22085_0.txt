In this cool little speakeasy-style bar they take their mixology pretty seriously. I witnessed the bartender mix up a doozy of a drink, stick a straw into it and use his thumb to capture a sip, taste it, reflect on it, and then pour it out and mix it up all over again. High standards, bitches!\n\nI recommend the \"Ward 11\" cocktail (bourbon-based) because it's pretty friggin delicious.\n\nPretentious factor: they dedicate an entire wall (to the left of the bar) to broadcast a handwritten message to patrons, telling us that vodka is tasteless and for 'the masses' and that's why you won't find any vodka-based cocktails in this bar. Uh, okay hipsters, whatever.\n\nAlso, the cute side patio closes at 10pm...on a warm night in June, midnight on a Saturday, that really sucked. But on the plus side, the service was friendly, the music was jazzy and the sweet\/spicy nuts ($4) were tasty.
