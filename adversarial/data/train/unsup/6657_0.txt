Yonaka is impeccable and blew my taste buds away.  \nThis items on the menu where unfamiliar to me and I would not have tried any of them if it weren't for the recommendations from the servers or my friend ordering for the table.\n\nFirst, everyone that works there (servers, chefs, hostess) were absolutely amazing and they all have such a happy and welcoming attitude.  They consistently check up on you making sure we are not only enjoying ourselves but enjoying the wonderful tasting food.\nNow, about the food...I was really amazed how the precise of flavors were all blended together to create the perfect bite.  I recommend tasting:\n-Karraage (fried chicken & love the taste of their onions that goes along with it) \n-Machitaki \n-Crudo \n-Hamachi Kama \n-Sliders (during happy hour)\n..Unfortunately, there were other dishes that we ordered & I dont remember the name, but I am sure everything that is on the menu will be AMAZING. :) \nOverall, I am so pleased with my experience at Yonaka, the taste of their food and service that they provide is very upscale.
