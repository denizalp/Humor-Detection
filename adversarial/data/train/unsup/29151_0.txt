the apartments are definitely cheap, they have not been updated for years, the wiring is bad so if you run more then 2 items in the kitchen, such as a kettle, toaster and a microwave at the same time it will trip the switch and turn off power to them all, hot water is synced between the apartments in a block so if someone else flushes a toilet while you are in a shower you risk being scolded, they have total control of heating and air conditioning so buy your own fans and heaters as they turn them on and off to their own schedule, everything is antiquated to the point that at least once a month the water is down for a day for repairs.  if cheap and old is what you want then your at the right place
