Maybe I was here on an \"off\" night, but this place was yuck and lame.  One of my friends loves it because it's so close to where she was living at the time, and I think she was friendly with one of the bartenders, as well.  But I did not get the appeal AT ALL.  The music and sound system were horrible, the sparse crowd was made up of young wanna-be-gangsta types mixed with girls too big to be wearing what they were wearing, and the drinks were weak.  I believe it was a Saturday night, but I can't be sure...it was a few months ago.  The main reason we ended up there was that the above-mentioned bartender was really pushing for my friend to invite her girlfriends, assuring her he would \"hook them up.\"  Did we get the hook up?  Nope, not even a little bit.  Maybe we weren't trashy enough.  I'm not claiming to be high class...I do live on the west side, after all...but this was definitely not my scene.  Next.
