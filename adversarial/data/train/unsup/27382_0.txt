Brand new to the body figure competition so I needed help with meal prep.  Mr Scott and his crew were patient, understanding and knowledgeable for what I needed.  I have order my meal prep for my 2nd week already and I have to say VERY VERY impressed!  My husband also orders his meal prep here and loves it too!  5 days 2 meals each day for $80!   You cannot beat that.  I do however special order some of my meals so comes out to $92.  Buuuuut  i spend more than that a week and have to find time to prep my food.  Id rather spend that extra time at the gym or practice posing.  My fave hands down Rocky Balboa!!  Pocahontas is my 2nd fave but I do add egg whites to it.
