Our favorite local\/import store. A huge variety of spices and canned goods and seasonings, fresh produce, every type of rice and oil, frozen goods, and our favorite is the meat department. The chicken is fresh, halal, no antibiotics or preservatives. And they carry the lamb riblettes that they know I love so much. Their lamb comes from California! Their prepared kebabs are delicious- the work is done, all you do is put it on your grill! Delicious every time. Store is clean, well organized and staff is friendly. Have a look around- there is a lot for the eye to enjoy.
