This place is stuck in a past century - or a communist country!  The bureaucracy to just make a purchase is absurd.  Customer service is non-existent. I also made the fatal mistake of buying the wrong thing - now I can only imagine the nightmare waiting for me when I return. This is my first and last time as a customer.
