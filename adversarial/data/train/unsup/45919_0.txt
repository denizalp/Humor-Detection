The only down fall to this place is the wait. It is that popular that every time we go we have to wait for an hour and half. They are plenty of beers to sample while you wait. They brew their own beer at Fat Head's and it is quite tasty. Plenty of room of large parties and the parking is made for the busy restaurant. I recommend really any burger on their menu! Great place for a burger and a beer!
