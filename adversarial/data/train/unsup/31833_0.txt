Only reason we went is because of the deal we got from our stay with the hotel - buy 1 get 1 free. \nThe food selection was very limited. The taste was bland and mediocre. The staff not too friendly and attentive.\nYou pretty much serve yourself including drinks.\nNot much more I can say but will not go back there again unless it's free.
