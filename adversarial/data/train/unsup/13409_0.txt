3 words....SUGAR LIP SCRUB. That keeps these ItaliRican lips nice and soft. \n\nSweet mother of monkey milk y'all...this place is the bomb digidee! From soap to bath bombs. Lip scrub to lip balm. It is all right here and smells OH SO GOOD. The staff at Lush are always there to answer questions, demonstrate products and teach you why Lush is worth the cash.\n\nThis location is located in the new part of Crocker Park...close to my favorite place in the entire world, Starbucks. Now I can go and fill my lip scrub fix and fuel my love of coffee. \n\nGreat addition to Crocker!
