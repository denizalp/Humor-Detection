I've been there at least 5 times. The decor is perfect to give you that more adult, higher class beer tasting room feel. \n\nThe staff is always friendly. The beers are great. You should definitely get the sampler. It's not terribly expensive, and It will give you a good idea of what 4 peaks range of beers taste like. Make sure you share it though. Unless you like pounding beer , the ones you're not drinking will be warm by the time you get to them.\n\nIt's a cool spot. Trust me. Go there. You'll like it.
