Great food when they get it right. Thats not very often. Delivery is always 45 minutes to an hour. Always ends up being way over an hour, how do they handle it, oh well. Never a sorry we are slow ass liars. Done ordering here. Its to bad, because the owners worked to hard to have it turn this bad. To many other great places to have to put up with this. Good luck folks.
