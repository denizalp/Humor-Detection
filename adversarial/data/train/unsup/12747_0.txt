I don't understand why this place has as many stars as it does. Your palate has to be awful to nonexistent if you think the food here is superb. First of all, the hostess was plain weird. She may have been drinking since it was happy hour. Second, too much crap on the table. Too many plates, too many bowls, too many carafes of salsa, too many cups. Oh and the salsa and\/or hot sauce is tomato paste. The chips are okay, not the yummiest. The Cabo Maragarita is cool to look at but it tastes mediocre. I had a border chimichanga (bean) and it was ok. Honestly. You have to be kidding me if you think this is good Mexican food. I'll just call this place McNando's because it's so Americanized and bland. Might I suggest an awesome place? Go to Los Dos Molinos. Leave Nando's to the senior citizens because this is far from authentic.
