This place was okay, I might come back just because the location is really great. I had a full set done and my nails aren't exactly the same shape, some are more pointy than others, some more rounded and some are thicker. Just minor things, but they have a great selection of colors and they were all really nice. Only complaint is when I went to sit down the person doing my nails was on their phone, so I waited for at least two or three minutes before they acknowledged me\/ got started on my nails. The pricing for this place is really good though!
