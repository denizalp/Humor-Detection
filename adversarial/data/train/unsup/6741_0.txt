Very upscale. Location= winning. Drinks= superb. Food= so so. Service= fairly decent. Calamari was good in a tomato soup. Risotto was yucky in an acorn squash shell. Everyone else I dined with seemed pretty content. I was fairly underwhelmed. Whatever, I like Long John Silvers. What do I know? Go there anyway.
