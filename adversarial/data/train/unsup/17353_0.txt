Loved this hotel, not just for Vegas, but for anywhere.\n\nHere are the reasons why:\n1. Our standard suite was roughly the size of our house\n2. Full sized kitchen (we wasted no time in make the fridge look like we'd been there for months)\n4. Bathroom bigger than the bedrooms in our house COMBINED with a jacuzzi tub, large shower, and dual sink\n5. \"Green\" room with AC that only turns on when you put your room key in the special slot\n6. True suite with living room + hide-a-bed and an enclosed bedroom\n7. Full patio with table and chairs attached to every room\n8. Lovely pool with lots of chairs and beds.  Less \"party time\" than your typical Vegas pool, but one can still have fruity rum drinks delivered to their chair.\n9. Friendly front desk staff and bag guys.  We were also greeted with a call as soon as we were in our room asking if it was up to our highly discerning specs.\n10. Entirely non-smoking property and you don't have to walk through a maze of casinos to reach your room\n\nThere were some cons too....just a few, but still worth pointing out:\n1. Valet parking only\n2. Somewhat surly valet dudes\n3. Slow\/somewhat surly service in the bar.  Happy hour seems good, but I would have hated to pay full price for what we received\n4. Weird sulfur smell at the pool (but I smelled it all over Vegas, so it could just be a Vegas thing)\n5. Terrrrrrible in-room coffee.  Truly offensive.\n\nAll in all, a great value and a great hotel!  We paid $77 a night as part of a promotion (CHEAP!) but the standard of about $130 is really not too bad.  It was worth it to stay off the strip a bit in a place that felt like home and I loved opening up my suitcase and not having it reek of casino when we got home.
