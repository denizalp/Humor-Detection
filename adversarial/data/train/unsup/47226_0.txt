Jerk Oxtails and Jerk Chicken dinners were both delicious. The chicken sauce  being a bit ' dry ' compared to the sauce administered to the Oxtails , but still very tasty nonetheless.  Dumplings were huge and filling.  Small diner with what seemed like young, hard-working people running the place. It was a nice, random  stop for me. I'd go back.
