A very pleasant surprise. My date and I had no idea they were a restaurant I thought it was a ice cream shop, (marquee in front was advertising ice cream)then the hostess talked  us into eating there and we were so glad we did. The rice crispy squares were awesome follow by the fire and ice ramen. (Smoke salmon kimchi sauce cabbage radish and more).  Ordered a flight of Sake which was just enough for two. A little hard to find but the prize at the end of the trail.\nOur waitress Janeille was a joy!
