I come in at least once a week for beer, pizza, and sports. I recommend half BBQ and half Buffalo Chicken pizza. They also offer wheat dough and have different drink specials depending on the day. It's the perfect place for dad to grab a beer while the family enjoys some pizzas to share. Great variety of craft beer. Wish they had Triple C Golden Ale on draft but now I'm just being greedy. Awesome staff, shoutout to bartender Chris who held onto a Northface I left there one night, the bartenders literally have you covered. Thanks for being a great dinner option any night of the week.
