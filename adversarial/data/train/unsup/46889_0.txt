Checked out a lot of shops around Vegas then I talked to someone I met at a restaurant with some awesome tats and he sent me to Pelon. My buddy wanted to get some work done on his forearms and I wanted to honor my Dad on my shoulder. Jake and Pelon came thru with flying colors in my book! Great work by some great guys!!!    From Virginia so it might be awhile but I will return!!
