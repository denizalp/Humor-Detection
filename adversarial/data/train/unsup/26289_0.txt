I enjoyed the Aquarium, I purchased the tickets on line ( NO SERVICE CHARGES :)). I This saved a lot of time waiting in line. Plenty of signs to read and people happy to answer questions. The people even knelt down to answer my 5 year olds questions. It as nice to watch her touch things and be curious enough to ask about them. We enjoyed our visit I am eager for to see phase two get underway.
