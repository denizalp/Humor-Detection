I went here for the first time this week to see \"Wild.\"  I really like the theatre.  I had checked online for tickets and saw that there were only a few already reserved.  Since I'm retired, I don't have to plan an evening when it will be crowded.  Instead, I can go during the day almost any day.\n\nI got to the theatre about 12:45 PM for a 1 PM showing.  The man at the register showed me the seating chart and explained which color meant the seat was taken.  I chose my seat.  There was no problem.  There were only about 10 people in the theatre.\n\nThe screen seemed huge to me.  I think I'll sit farther back another time.  The sound was excellent, and of course, the seating is great!  With the button to raise the leg rest and recline your seat, you could be having a great snooze instead of watching a film.\n\nI look forward to going back when they have a film I want to see.  It's 3\/4 of a mile from my house so there are three Regal cinemas within a mile of where I live.  I have a choice.
