I was hoping when Pancho's replaced the Roberto's at this location it would be an upgrade, but was sorely disappointed. I'm sad to report that the burrito I ordered for take-out was probably the worst I've ever had. The burrito was cold, the tortilla was flaky in a stale kind of way, and my order was incorrect. I asked for french fries in my veggie burrito, but there was none to found. Instead, there was pico in my burrito, which I did not ask for. In the description of the veggie burrito, there is no mention of pico de gallo being added. Whose bright idea was it to pour onion laden pico in my cold burrito?? I was starved but couldn't get past the half-point in my burrito because I was so dissatisfied with the taste. I opted for leftover take-out pizza in my fridge instead! \n\nUnlike Roberto's, Pancho's does not have a salsa bar. An option of red and green salsa are provided when your order is handed to you at the counter. My burrito and a small drink set me back $7.36. There's a $0.50 charge to use a debit card and a $1 charge for using credit. It's painfully small inside, so I would recommend take-out only. The only positive thing I can say is that my order took about 4 minutes to make. Because my experience was a fantastic failure, I will not be coming back.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #253
