Dr. Tim Kuiava was my dentist for the past 26 years.  Imagine my surprise when I made an appointment to see him and a \"new\" Doctor, Dr. Lee walks in.  I was not informed of him leaving, no letter, no courtesy phone call.  Did they think I wouldn't notice?  The new office staff was unfriendly as well.  When I asked what happened to Dr. Tim, one staff member said he retired and one told me he was \"exploring other career options\"!  They can't even keep their lies straight!\nShame on you, Dental Designs!  Very unprofessional!  I tracked down Dr. Kuiava at Carepoint Dental.
