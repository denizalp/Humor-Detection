The service here was awesome.  Our waiter, a transplant from NYC whom we affectionately called Suspenders due to his uniform, was above reproach.  He was funny, personable and patient with our large group of girls out for a night on the town. He cracked jokes with us and showed us pictures of his young son.  Also, he wasn't bad to look at.\n\nThe ambiance was of the trendy lounge-cum-restaurant variety.  The same cookie cutter recipe seen over and over in most cities. Think exposed brick, low lighting, brushed cement floors and ambient music heavy on the bass and low on vocals.  Nothing wrong with it, just nothing to write home about either.  I could walk right now to about 50 places that fit that description.\n\nThe food?  Underwhelming.  To say the very least.  I ordered the gnocchi and was warned prior that it was made of semolina, so I should expect it to be denser than what I may be accustomed to. That may have been the only interesting thing about the dish.  The truffle cream was simply adequate, the rabbit ragu was meh and the whole thing came out tepid.  It seems that whomever was doing the timing back in the kitchen should have waited for the Chicken Dominic that my fellow diners ordered to be nearly done before putting my dish up in the window.  The assessments from the other people in my party (of 7) mirrored my own.  The Chicken Parmesan was 'okay', the Chicken Dominic came off as 'something I could make better myself' and the Chicken Marsala was actually deemed 'worse than the Marsala I made at home last week'.  There was one bright spot in the group: the Lobster Scampi Pizza, which my friend ate up with delight.\n\nOverall, I can't say it was the worst place I've ever eaten.  But it was forgettable.  And a little disappointing.  Perhaps a little more spice, a little more flavor and some better timing in the kitchen LAVO could elevate itself to 4 stars.  But I just don't see that it will ever have the legs to climb the rungs all the way to the top.
