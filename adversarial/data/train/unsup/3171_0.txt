08\/22\/11\n\nClean, very spacious, and staffed w\/ friendly employees.  One in particular was very efficient in informing us of the new Stubz membership ($12 annual fee) that replaces the obsolete Moviewatcher card when I asked her for more info, but gently reminded us that we could get more info after the movie ended.  (You may save all of your past receipts and get credit for them when you do sign up for the new Stubz promo...)
