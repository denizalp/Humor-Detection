I think the photo says it all, but Yelp keeps encouraging me to review this business, so here it goes. I wanted ice cream after eating some awesome Venezuelan street food, and it was too late for Luv-It. Burger King's gingerbread sundae sounded good, so I ordered one and an order of the new sweet potato curly fries to try. The gingerbread syrup was too thin, and not as satisfying as the caramel sundae. When I checked the fries before leaving the drive thru, the container was barely half full of sweet potato... nubs? Stumps? Not a curl in sight. My husband showed this to the cashier, who briskly replied, \"yeah, they're supposed to be like that, all chopped up\"... and with that, we drove away.
