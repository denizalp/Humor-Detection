This location is too busy and not worth it.  We went to the Centennial location when we lived in Aliante and thought the minimal wait was worth it.  But given the wait in Summerlin, I'd rather eat just about anywhere else.  We put our name on the waitlist via the app.  We checked in and were told 20 minutes.  At the 30 minute mark, I inquired about how much longer?  She told us there were 5 more tables ahead of us.  All the while, we waited, she kept quoting everyone 20 minutes....clearly not accurate.  It was so bad, there was a family with young kids that had been waiting over an hour and the kids were crying from hunger.  Other families with young kids left while we were waiting as well.  We also gave up....
