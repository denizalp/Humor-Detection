The Strip with all its lights, attractions and sheer enormity will amaze you whether it's your first visit or not. The Strip extends from the Mandalay Bay on the south end all the way to the Stratosphere on the north end.  It's been six years since my last visit and I am still amazed with the Strip and new properties that have opened, such as The Linq and expansions of the classics, such as Caesars.  \n\nWalking along the Strip, there are people you can have your pictures taken with scantily clad showgirls, superheroes and cartoon characters, for a fee, of course. You have guys passing out flyers for shows and tickets to clubs. You have your card slappers, who will try to have to take one of the business cards to adult entertainment and also for Lyft.  The free water fountain shows at the Bellagio and the evening volcano shows at the Mirage still draw the crowds.  The other popular free siren\/pirate show at Treasure Island has been cancelled.  Otherwise, you can people watch on the Strip, as that can be a show in itself. \n\nBesides gambling, the casinos have shows, buffets, and shopping, since there are shopping malls attached to most of the larger casino properties. Prime time entertainers have residency shows here and we were able to catch JLo at Planet Hollywood.\n\nOne thing that has changed is that casinos now charge for parking in their self-parking lots.  It was nice to be able to drive to different casinos and park, but now for most, the first hour is free and parking for first for four hours at $6-$8 to five+ hours at $15-$18. However, there are three casinos that still offer free self-parking, Treasure Island, Venetian and Tropicana.\n\nThe Strip is Las Vegas and is what people from around the world have come to know. You'll have a great time here, as there is something for everyone.
