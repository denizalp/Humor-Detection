I really enjoy going to the movies here. Their theaters are big and clean and also have comfy recliner chairs. The only issue I would have is that if it's a really popular movie you're going to have to get your tickets online ahead of time. This is totally a new era of seeing movies at the theatre, where you can't really show up 10-15 minutes before the movie and still end up with an okay seat. Now that it's reserved seating, you might end up with front row seats if you don't order them in advance. I mean, the new system has its pros and cons as do most changes in society have, but it's definitely smart and could bring more good than anything. You don't have to rush to find your seat anymore and you can already relax knowing you've got a seat in the theatre that no one can save or take.
