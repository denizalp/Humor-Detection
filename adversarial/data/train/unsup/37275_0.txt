I was a little hesitant coming here due to the reviews. First time here and It was amazing! Our server Jherica (I'm sure I'm butchering her name) was constantly checking on us too see if we needed anything.The manager came over to check on us too as he heard it was our first time there. Food was great, cooked perfectly and the bread was hot,fresh and VERY tasty. The peanuts kept my three small children busy. Way cooler than coloring to keep them occupied. We are only in Arizona for the weekend and may have to eat there one more night before we head back to Vegas cause it was that good.All around a great experience.
