I booked & paid for my non-smoking room 2 months in advance. Upon arrival @ 4:30 pm (30 min after the standard check in) my room was still not ready at 6:00 pm. After I went to the front desk to inquire they did however give me a smoking room. \n\nI walked into my room which had very hard linoleum floors. I looked for a place to charge my devices but, all outlets were in use and there were no extra outlets you typically find at all hotels today. I needed to unplug multiple lamps to plug in my multipe devices so they could charge.\n\nAfter I sorted through the \"re-wiring\" of my room I went to take a shower at 6:15 pm. I was only able to take a 2 min shower as the water was so cold. \n\nAfter my night out I went to sleep and woke up so cold because the comforter is very thin. \n\nWhen I woke up and attempted to take a shower at 7:30 am the shower had no hot water. I could only manage to comfortably wash my face and wet my hair in the sink. \n\nThe cost of my king bed room was $470! There was not room ammenities \/ appliences. There were no outlets to charge your devices, thin blankets, I didn't get the room reserved, &there was NO hot water! It was bare bone. \n\nI will never book a night at the Flamingo ever again!
