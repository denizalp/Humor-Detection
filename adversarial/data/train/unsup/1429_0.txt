Dear Tilly's employee who greeted me with 20 questions...\n\nMind you, the answer to every question you ask me is, \"No, I'm just browsing, thanks.\"\n\nAnd the questions I was asked were.....in chronological order...\n\n\"Can I help you find anything?\"\n\n\"Are you looking for anything specific?\"\n\n\"Are you shopping for, like, a nephew or something?\"\n\n\"So, like, do you know how the store is laid out?\"\n\n\"Are you sure I can't help you find anything?\"\n\nNo, I'm just browsing, thanks.\n\nSorry I was dressed improperly for the occasion of going to Tilly's to look for a sugar skull t-shirt.  Next time I'll leave my RL oxford and brown loafers at home.  The funny thing is, after this visit to the store at Meadows, I went home, took a nap, got hot and put on shorts, took off the oxford, changed to barefoot boat shoes and was only asked one question at the next Tilly's I went to at Arroyo.....coincidence?  \n\nYou tell me...
