It's a different experience altogether walking in here. The owner, Daniel is very welcoming and makes you feel like your business matters. It's wonderful to deal with a business owner that cares about customer satisfaction and actually delivers great service.\n\nTheir prices are way below what my dealership charges for the same exact, factory direct parts\/service etc. They treat people like human beings and not a number to shuffle back & forth to other uninterested employees like F-n Joke unIMPORTant dealership.\n\nI will never, ever go back to my dealership for anything now that I'm a loyal customer here. German Motors offers 5 star service that goes above your expectations. I'll take supporting a local, family owned business who's built an excellent reputation any day.
