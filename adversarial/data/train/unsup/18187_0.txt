Ha! I'm downgrading to zero stars (even though yelp wont let me) because Tim just flat out lied in his reply. I have posted the receipt for payment for the services he states he provided for free! I paid $429 and the kicker is the dart machine still doesn't work and I had to take the slot machine (\"hot peppers\" on the invoice) somewhere else to get fixed properly. \nThe Buck Hunter I paid for was in stock and not something he had to go searching for, as he implys. \nHe did fix the Pac Man so I will give him credit for that. And I will say I appreciate him trying for a year to get the Big Buck Hunter working rather than delivering a bad product. But still no\nexcuse for not returning phone calls and emails and keeping my money.
