The restaurant is beautiful as is the rest of the Wynn.  We came here on a recommendation from my bf's parents.  We sat at one of the sofa tables which was pretty cool.  I ordered the double down breakfast with the pancakes and corned beef hash and it came with hash browns.  My bf got it with an omlet and corned beef hash.  We both loved the corned beef hash.  It was actual corned beef chunks of meat.  I was not impressed witht the hash brown.  It was too undercooked in the middle.  The pancakes were tasty but a little too heavy.  Our friend ordered a blueberry muffin with his breakfast and he said it was not as good as Marie Callendar's muffins.\n\nWe had also eaten at the Wynn buffet on this trip and for $5 more than Terrace Pointe you can eat at the buffet which is the same high quality food but obviously all you want of a big selection.
