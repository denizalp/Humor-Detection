There was no way I was stopping by Charlotte without trying one of their craft brew.  Having only drank wine for the past couple of months, it was a change ordering a pint of cold, delicious beer.  But as the saying goes \"When it Rome...\"  Anyways I was excited to get a taste of what Charlotte had to offer so making sure that I would be close enough to my gate for the next leg of my flight, I chose \"A Taste of Carolina.\"  What better way to get a taste of Charlotte's offering than a restaurant that claims to provide a taste of Carolina.  Having just had my fill of delicious barbecue at another establishment, I was in no mood for a bite.  I went straight for what I came for and ordered the Olde Mecklenburg Copper.  This beer, from The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery of Charlotte, is \"an authentic Dusseldorf style Altbier with a full-flavored start that transitions to a smooth, balanced finished.\"  I had no choice but to quote the description from the restaurant because there was no way I could have said it any better.
