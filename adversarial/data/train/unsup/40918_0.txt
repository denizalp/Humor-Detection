Considering how much we love the chain of wonderful temples to capitalism otherwise known as Target, Inc., I thought we would really like this one - it's convenient, well-located along a major weekend route for us, and much closer than many of the other Target stores.\n\nUnfortunately, this one just doesn't fire us up... for a few reasons.\n\nIt all starts when you have to park underneath the store, which I thought would be a great way to save space and keep your car out of the sun. Unfortunately, it is a somewhat difficult lot to get in and out of, and for some odd reason, seems to make people really, really impatient. I hate all the driver angst I see there when we go - and really don't like the feeling like I'm in the classic video game, \"Frogger.\"\n\nThen, there are the cart elevators. Straaange. It's sort of like you are being kept hostage, waiting for your cart to go uuuuuuup, and then doooooown. Feh. They could totally have put long ramps in, and saved on all the electricity that they blow on these unique contraptions that always seem to be breaking down.\n\nUnfortunately, I found the overall selection of items somewhat lacking, and we usually have to go to a secondary store to find whatever we needed, unless it's something in the shampoo section or kid section.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is an incredibly convenient store for people who live nearby, saving them lots of time having to hoof it across the river to get to a Target, but it's just not as good as the one over in Harmar, which is quite a bit closer.\n\nNow, on the really positive side, it's just next to Station Street Dogs. Did I mention I love this Target?
