Huge outlet about 10 min drive north of vegas. It's an outdoor one and there are lots of stores like Nike, Juicy, Pacsun, Vans, Gap, Coach, Tory Burch, etc. There wasn't much of a sale going on Mother's day weekend and the size of the shops are actually pretty small compared to other outlets. Overall I'd say it isn't worth your while to go out of your way here. I actually prefer the Indoor outlet at Primm or the outlet near the airport
