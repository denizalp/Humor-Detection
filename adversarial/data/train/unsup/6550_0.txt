Best brunch in the Lake Norman area.  Not there is that much competition.\n\nIt is a quaint little restaurant nestled in an old house on highway 115.  There isn't a whole lot of room inside, so the tables are packed pretty tight.  Knowing this, we went ahead and made reservations, just in case.\n\nFirst off we got the house made mozzarella ball, with pesto and cherry tomatoes.  It is only available at Sunday brunch.  Great fresh mozzarella.  A little peppery arugula too top it off.\n\nWhen it came down to actually ordering, me and my date both wanted a benedict.  And since there were 2 of them, we just decided to get both and split em.  I got the crab meat with prosciutto.  I made the right choice.  With a super citrusy hollandaise to brighten up the whole dish, I was impressed.  At $9, it was a steal.  My counterpart ordered the other benedict with asparagus and goat cheese.  Both were borderline too rich, but both still very much worth the price.  Add a couple mimosa's to that and I'd call that a great brunch.\n\nBottom line:  I'll be back, probably many times.
