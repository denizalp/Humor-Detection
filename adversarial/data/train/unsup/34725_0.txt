Avondale Toyota is 5-stars in my book. Scottie Williams would get 10-stars, if that were possible. Scottie is awesome.\n\nI write good reviews and I write bad reviews. I am the type of person who likes to help people, even complete strangers like you. So, I share this experience to vouch for one of the good guys, Avondale Toyota. They do this one person, one price thing. If you are the type of person who hates negotiating, paying way too much, and\/or talking with the sales person, then the manager, then the finance guy, each trying to weasel out every last penny you have in your pocket, then Avondale Toyota is a place you should visit. If you love to negotiate, then look elsewhere. The \"one person\" thing means that you only work with one person, Scottie William in my case. He presented me a fair \"one price\" that everyone pays. Well, I verified that indeed it was a fair price. Unfortunately, Avondale Toyota did not have the Camry that I wanted and Scottie could not find one that could be dealer traded. That made me really sad since this is a super dealership and Scottie really treated me right. I REALLY wanted to buy from Avondale Toyota. I eventually found the 2015 I wanted from another dealer and bought from them since the $1,500 Camry rebate will expire soon and I will be on business travel until after the rebate expires.
