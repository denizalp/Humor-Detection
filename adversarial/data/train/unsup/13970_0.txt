Okay. The protein pancakes are no joke. Sooo delish i have been trying to make em at home. \n\nThe blueberries provide enough flavor it requires just a tad bit syrup. \n\nThe skillet was decent. It wasnt wowzahs but maybe the pancakes were just that good. I got the santa fe skillet. In my opinion its better without chorizo. I messed up!! Keep in mind im vegetarian 6x\/week.\n\nSanta Fe skillet: chicken, tomato, chorizo, green chile sauce. I reckon extract chorizo and add bell peppers, mushrooms, onions and green chile or jalapenos.\n\nThe green chile sauce has more kick than i thought. Initially i was like this sauce is just green food coloring so i added a few tobasco ounces and shirtly after i was a dragon. It was edible but not as comfortable. \n\nThe hash is standard. Wouldnt be surprised if its from a bag (commercialized) rather than freshly cut from a real potato.\n\nThe english muffin was ok. Jam selection sucked.\n\nService was great as amaaazing. \n\nThank you Arizonians fir such great hospitality.
