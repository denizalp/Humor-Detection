In a recent online interview, Penn Jillette recommended the Mac King Comedy Magic Show as a cool thing to do in Vegas.  I followed Penn's advice, saw the show and absolutely loved it.  Mac is an outstanding magician and a hilarious entertainer who knows how to wow a crowd.  My favourite segment was an Elvis-Liberace tribute illusion that rocked the house. The event was a highlight of my Vegas experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone of any age.
