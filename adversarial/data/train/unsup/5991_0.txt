Seeing how the average rating of this place is 4 1\/2 stars and I'm only giving it one star, makes me slightly reconsider my rating for a second -  am I just a super picky a-hole or is everyone else missing the queue here?  I'm going to go with the latter, although I'm going to say right now that my rating is based off of what we ordered.\n\nCame here for a big group birthday dinner, and I must say, the staff was very accommodating and patient.  That's half a star.  \n\nNow on to the food - \n\nI ordered the pasta trio and the boyfriend ordered the clams linguine.  \n\nPasta trio - Basically a sample plate of three different pastas ( tortelli, gnocchi and ravioli.)  I wasn't expecting Lake Michigan portions, but I also didn't think my meal would be bite sized.  I'm not even exaggerating  - $19 dollar plate to feed an infant.  And it was mediocre.  I'd rather pop open a can of CHEF BOY R D and squirt some Sriracha on top.  \n\nClams Linguine - If you want to know how this tastes and you happen to live near near the ocean, jump in it and swallow the water - and try to get some clams in there too if you can.  The dish was sodium overload, although clam count was abundant.  \n\nI'd rather eat at Olive Garden.  Yeah it's a chain and it's not hip and trendy and lots of  old people frequent it, but its a safe bet vs paying 50 + for a meal and then paying another 15 for Filibertos cause you leave starving, still.
