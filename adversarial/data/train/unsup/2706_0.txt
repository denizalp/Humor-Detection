My husband and I had dinner here 2 days ago. Got there for the Happy Hour and was pleasantly surprised that my beer cost $1.  Happy Hour is from 3-6pm and a great value.  The special offer for sushi rolls - 3 rolls for price of 2.  These are all specialty rolls. The sushi was fresh and the service is excellent. Met the owner Moon who is a delightful person. We are definitely going back and plan to be \"regulars\"!
