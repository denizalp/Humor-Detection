I love this place for their hand made flour tortillas. They melt in your mouth. Served hot and fresh. You see the lovely ladies behind the counter cooking them on the griddle. They taste as good as they smell.\n\nI'm a basic Mexican food fan. Very plain and simple. Throw me a taco and I'm happy. I love their Chicken Tacos. The meat is marinated in its own flavor. I love to top them off with their tasty salsa. They have some of the best salsa in town. My only issue with this location. That I have been dealing with for years is they mess up my order every single time. I order the same thing every time. 2 hard shell chicken tacos with no cheese and a side of Flour Tortillas. Why is there cheese always on my tacos? The cashier even selects the no cheese button and they still pile it on. I even mention this when I place my order and they still get it wrong. Not sure why this very simple process is such a hard task? \n\nIf your going during lunch plan on waiting. The lines moves fast as they have plenty of staff cooking the food. \n\nIf your looking for real Mexican food served at a hole in the wall establishment this is the place to go to. There food is amazing.
