I confess...I get jittery and awkward inside when I start reviewing chains on here.  *ducks*\n\nThis is simply a review for the happy hour.  Since 2 nights ago we spent over $18 wasting money at China Tango across the street on soup and bad beef, I felt it relevant to tell the yelp world that Cheesecake Factory has a decent happy hour.\n\nThe bad: It is from 4-6 PM.  This was the one day in 2 years of living near CF that Eric R. and I both were home before 6.  He was on the phone with a friend from 5:15-5:45 when I finally asked \"happy hour or not?!?!?\"\n\nWe got there at 5:47 and our bartender Sam was cool and patient with Eric (he gets grumpy when hungry and wanted bread and a BIG water glass.  He says CF discriminates against water drinkers because my iced tea glass can eat his water glass).\n\nWith a big debate between 2 or 3 appetizers, Sam assured us they, unlike the evil elephant bar, give FULL appetizer portions for the $5 price.  We ordered 3: chicken potstickers, shrimp summer rolls, and tamale corn cakes sans sour cream.  Full portions they were.  Lots of food, multiple dishes, and my tea = $18.  Nyah Nyah, China Tango!\n\nTherefore, when hungry near CF before 6 PM, meander to the bar area and have yourself a hearty meal at the hour of our grandparents.  There are deals on drinks too.
