Been coming to the Tims since I was 10, their coffee in all that time has always been very inconsistent. More so in the past 8 years. The Tims down the road near the car dealerships (woodchester) always has great coffee.\n\nService tends to be pretty good, a few staff have been here for the past 14 years and they're always amazing and super nice.\n\nThe new Mexican soup that offers chicken has little to no chicken.\n\nGenerally they're quite friendly, it's also relatively clean as are the bathrooms.
