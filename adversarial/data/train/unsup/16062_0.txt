A friend suggested this place. I need to call him back and ask WHY!?! They actually patted my husband down! Now, admittedly, he is a little intimidating looking, but wth? The \"sports bar: name is misleading, it was not really geared towards the sports fan. Anyway, it was definitely wasn't for me. I gave it the extra star because signs in the place said there was a hip hop DJ and dancing on weekend nights, so I suppose if that's what you were looking for it would be an OK place...
