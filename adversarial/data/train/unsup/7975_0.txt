I've only missed one! Other than that, my friend & I have come to every single Phoenix Flea! It's one of the highlights of our year, twice a year! The last couple times they've done a really good job with setup. They've spread the market out into some of the surrounding streets which makes walking around so much more enjoyable. & I swear, every year the local shops bring in cuter & cuter things! If you want to get a big taste of downtown all in one day & spot, come to the Flea! Food trucks, art & beautiful people!
