Here's the thing, you need to get yourself a kabob plate or a salad. \n\nOr you'll be risking a bland landmine. Seriously. Step over those tuna sammies and order some salmon or chicken kabob plates. \n\nThis place is healthy. It's not where you go to feed your inner fatty. Or outer fatty. I can say this because I have been both in my life. I love food. If you want a sandwich, go somewhere else. If you want some lean protein and veggies that you didn't have to cook yourself, come here. And, like, maybe eat a little hummus too, so that inner fatty can get some enjoyment out of life.
