Does anybody really ever say, \"Let's go down to Radio Shack!\"?  I seriously doubt it.  Let's face it, we all make fun of good ol' Radio Shack.  But, like the computer or math geek in high school, there's times when you really need them.  Need that odd-type battery?  Face it, where ya gonna go?\n\nOr like in my case.  My husband and I are leaving for Ireland on Thursday.  \"Susan, did you remember the foriegn voltage AC converters?\"  D-oh!  So I trekked on over to good old RS (luckily, this one is practically right around the corner).  And sure enough, they had them!\n\nBless the high school math geek.  Bless Radio Shack!
