It was a delightful, the atmosphere was very nice.  Enjoyed the background music as well as the old movies on the glass screen!\nThe service was good; but nothing exceptional.  The food was unique and the flavors were very nice.  One of our party had the scallops which were very nice but were quite spicy; which was OK but nothing in the description alerted anyone to that; could be a problem for some.\nAll in all was a delightful evening!  Would definitely visit again.
