For a Real Canadian Superstore, it's not bad. It's reasonably clean. They don't always have stuff (produce in particular) in stock if you go on the weekend, but it's not as bad as other Superstores I've been to. They can have some really great deals on some things, while other things are priced on par with other more upscale grocery stores. They seem to have a lot of \"buy x or more and save y\/unit\" which I don't love because often I only need one of whatever it is that I'm buying. I like that it's not so huge that it'll take forever to get through it all, but since I've moved here (less than a year ago), they've reorganized their shelves twice, which is so annoying. They usually have all cash registers open on the weekends between certain daytime hours, which is really convenient because it does get quite busy. There is underground parking but I find I can find a spot more easily if I park outside. There is a small Beer Store and wine shop on the main floor which is nice, but the selection isn't great at either. I wish they would carry beer and wine like some other Superstores in the city. The Joe Fresh section is quite large, especially for women. They also have a great greeting cards section, and a decent home furnishings section. They have more brands in the baby section than I expected - a few types of Boogie saline nose wipes, Wabbanub stuffed toy soothers, Lulujo muslin blankets, 1st year photo card set (I loved using this with my baby) and stroller clips, and the ever popular Fridababy snot sucker. I really like the PC points program (have been able to redeem a lot of money - love saving on groceries) so that's an extra incentive for me to shop here.
