If I could give zero stars I would. Came their later at night with my friends after blossom, so we were expecting a wait. We were told by the waitress to seat ourselves. Well, the waitress took everyone's order who came in after us, not even saying a word to us besides telling us to seat ourselves. We've been sitting here for 45 minutes and still no service. Polity we asked for the manager and she was very rude, going off about how we haven't been their for 45 minutes and how because you aren't supposed to seat yourself is why we didn't get served. And when we explained the situation she got even more rude and we walked out and left. NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN!!
