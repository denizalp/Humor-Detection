My local haunt.\n\nI've been coming to the Cue for the past decade, and I've always had great and attentive service from the staff. Whether it's coming down to share a drink on the patio, take part in a pool tournament or hold a meeting, this place has always had a very relaxed, casual vibe about it. The prices are a bit much for pub food, but overall, the Cue has always been a reliable and friendly neighbourhood spot for my friends and I.\n\nHighly recommended.
