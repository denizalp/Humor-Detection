BFG...now THEY do chicken right.  Whether your appetite is calling for baked, fried or grilled chicken, Jin will do you right.  The menu is kept simple and sticks to what they do best.  There are several combos to choose from, but I think many will customize their own meal: choose your chicken, your side and two sauces.  Easy peasy mac'n'cheesy!\n\nI'm a big fan of the grilled chicken.  The baked is easily some of the best baked chicken I've had and the fried is the most unique fried chicken I've had (thanks to the panko flakes used for breading).  But the grilled chicken gets you the grill flavor without drying up the poultry.  Go for the wasabi sauce to give your chicken some kick.\n\nWith your chicken you're given a choice of side, and you also get a slice of bread.  The mac'n'cheese is awfully cheesy in the best way possible, making it one of those foods you enjoy eating because you know you shouldn't be eating too much of it.\n\nService here is great, with Jin checking on all of his customers during their stay.  He's a really personable guy, seemingly remembering every customers name once they step through the door.  (He remembered my name after one visit!)  The one thing that bummed me out in the past was that my BFG cravings always came on a Sunday, the one day they're closed!  Fortunately, Jin has sensed this disturbance in the force and will be fixing that in the near future...
