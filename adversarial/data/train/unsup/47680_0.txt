Bono had obviously not done a pre-concert taco run to Tacos Chiwas because we definitely found what we were looking for. Fueled by what @theflav said were \"maybe the best tacos I've had in America,\" we pounded this taco feast on a lightning fast overnight trip to PHX for U2's epic Joshua Tree tour. Just simply terrific tacos! Everything. That signature taco chiwas though...sooo good! Perfectly mesquite-grilled smoky carne asada, jalape√±o and Anaheim chiles and queso. And that quesadilla and the \"Best in Phoenix\" award-winning frijoles charros?!?! Mercy! Can't wait to go back!
