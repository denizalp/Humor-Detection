The Pinball Hall Of Fame is a \"do not miss\" while visiting Las Vegas. Anyone who grew up with pinball will be ultimately satisfied with not only the unbelievable array of pinball machines on display, but also with the performance and upkeep of these games. If you are visiting Las Vegas and need a change of pace or a break away from the casinos, this is your place. We had so much fun there, and will go back every time we are in the city. With a portion of proceeds going to local charities, that even adds more satisfaction to spending time playing pinball here. Thank you Pinball Hall Of Fame!!!!
