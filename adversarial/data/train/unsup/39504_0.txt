When I am rating this resort, I am not rating the timeshare waste of time. Don't do it. It's a long presentation that most people have no business attending because let's be honest, you don't need to pay for a resort in Vegas with the hope of one day becoming a hip new strip. \nI am rating this resort due to the outstanding service from the personnel and great atmosphere created to make your vacation a real dream. The amenities of the resort are outstanding, great workout rooms, pools, computer room, free wifi, and all I had to do was use my RCI deposit to enjoy a vacation in Vegas.
