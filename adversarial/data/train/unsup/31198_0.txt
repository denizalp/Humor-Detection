I would give this place no stars if there was an option for that. Their tanning beds are superb, I'll give them that. However, they are the biggest scam of a place I have ever had a membership with. My account was frozen, and I decided I did not want to have a membership anymore. I went to cancel my membership, and they lady was very rude to me and said you can't cancel on a frozen membership and you have to give a 30 day notice before canceling. I must admit that I was very frustrated to have to pay for 2 extra months because February only has 28 days. That's not even the bad part. Money was drafted from my account for the month of February, and I was a level 2 and I wanted to go change my membership to level 1 for the next month, so I would not have to pay as much. I just went there the other night and changed my membership to a level 1 and was ready to pay.  The girl working there told me that the manager would allow it, but I would have to come in the next day and pay for it because the manager had already left that night. I came back the next day to pay for my membership, so I would be done with them, finally.  Another girl was working at the desk and told me where to sign, but never gave me a total. I figured I would be paying for level 1, but after she ran my card, and as I was signing, I saw that I was charged for level 2. They refused to give me a refund when it was a mistake on their end. I am not trying to bash them, but I just want everyone to be aware to watch yourself at this place. I will never have a membership with them again, nor will  I recommend this company to anyone
