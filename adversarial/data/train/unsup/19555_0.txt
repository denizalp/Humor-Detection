The outside of our Tomahawk steak was burnt and the inside undercooked. The outside crust was not done right and the service was subpar with our server non attentive and even a bit passive aggressive. Perhaps it was because my partner and I were dressed casually in a tee shirt and jeans but with the bill hovering around $160 I still expected good service.\n\nThe fried calamari is dismissible and not fried crispy. The bacon is delicious however and I would recommend their portobello fries. It's just disappointing that their steak was cooked wrong and rather tasteless. Perhaps it was the thickness of the cut, but it's still surprising considering that's their main offering. Will likely not be coming back or recommending others to dine here. The venue and bathrooms are nice though.
