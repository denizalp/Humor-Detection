We went for lunch and with tip and tax the bill came to $200. The food was quite good. However when I reviewed the bill I see they charged me for a glass of hot water and lemon. I expressed my concern to the manager and the response back was that lemons cost money and that they have to wash the cups. I do not feel that this is appropriate especially when someone spends approximately $200 on a lunch. The cost of the hot water was $1.75
