We visited SouthPoint because it  is closer to where we stay. With its 56 lanes we did not have to wait.  Its ball choices are on the heavy side.  My 7-year old grandson had to use a 8# ball which is their lightest.  My shoes were not comfortable. The equipment shut down in the middle of our game and we had to ask the front desk for help.  Personally I would go to Red Rock the next time even it is further away.
