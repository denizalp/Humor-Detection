Needing to mail a letter and when you need a stamp Murphy reminds us of life happening and not having any stamps. Fast forward to the reason for visiting. Prior to relocating to Henderson this used to be the post office I visited. It was close to my house and open 24\/7. When I went in the building I decided to get stamps with a teller rather than the automated machine. I was also seeking the new scratch and sniff ice cream stamps. \n\nThere was no line and I was grateful for that. In the conversation with the mail teller she delivered me the bad new that the fun scratch and smell stamps will not be unveiled and available at the post office until June 17. That being a bummer. I did find some other stamps that are forever but they are not scratch and sniff. The mail clerk was helpful in providing the many types of stamps and taking payment from me. This was a great visit to the post office since I did not have to wait in line, got extra stamps of defeat Murphy, and found out some new information.
