Have to be honest the conveyor belt part of this restaurant is what drew my attention. I was completely curious so I had to check it out. With all the hot pot places around the area now I was looking for something different. \n\nI like the individuality of the meal, you can pick between two soup bases. One is not spicy and looks milky while the other is spicy and spicy is not an understatement. I love spice but ieven had to take out  a heaping amount of the chili peppers and various spices put into the broth. They even warn you that you shouldn't drink the soup, which was a bit of a bummer for me BC I like to enjoy my soup broth at the end. I just took out about a cup full of the peppers and spices and I was able to drink some of the broth.  The servings of meat is small in my opinion. The seafood presentation is beautiful however. They do have many choices of meats, vegetables, noodles, etc. And what you don't order you can take off the conveyor belt. Unfortunately not everyone in the restaurant can enjoy this conveyor belt feature, so if you are going strictly to experience that make a reservation or don't go during peak times. \n\nThis place can become quite pricey for what it is. Especially since there is another hot pot place down the road which offers more food for less the price and is jist as good. I will say the experience here is unique so check it out at least once.
