Was told about this shop while visiting another local vintage shop that I attend frequently and had forgotten to check Chelsea's out until yesterday. My first impression of the place was that it was a bit different than most shops. Boy, I was right. After browsing for a bit I mentally made a check list of items that I'd be coming back for tomorrow. On my way out the shop attendants were very rude with stares and no \"good byes\" or \"comeback soon.\" It left a partial bad taste in my mouth, but I wanted those items, so I went back today. It was a bad decision. I rode my bike and parked it next to a partially bent fence on a grassy area. There is no place to put your bike that wont make it a target to get stolen. One of the women was outside and passively aggressively\/ sarcastically said \"you know my dog is buried there where you parked your bike. I'm going to have to get a grave stone to mark it.\"  She could asked politely for me to move it instead of angry words. Nope. Went inside. No greeting again. Cant find some items and ask about a skirt that was there yesterday. Got the answers I needed and stormed out of there. Was finally talked to nicely after I bought something. I spend several hundred dollars a year on vintage clothing, but never again will they get my money. There's plenty of other respectful shops in the area.
