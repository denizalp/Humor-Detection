So i came in this afternoon after my workout at the gym.Needed a post work out meal. So I thought I would check out OMG sushi. A pretty spacious place with a sushi bar at the center of the front of the house. The ambiance is pretty casual nothing to crazy going on but I do enjoy that they play music and have a tv to watch when dining alone. \n\nI choose to do al a carte I didn't wanna over stuff myself with food since my self control is terrible lol. But honestly the All you can eat (a.y.c.e) will be the best bang for your buck here. I only ordered 3 things and my bill still came out more then what I would of paid for if I had just done the all you can eat. I wish this place had lunch specials that would of been perfect. Bottom line is that the prices of individual rolls are expensive! \n\nThe food was ok . I had a poke salad it was average small portion and I paid like 10 bucks for it so it wasn't worth it. The salmon roll was good! The sushi chief made it in world record time by the way lol ,and last I had the yellowtail sashimi the lack of flavors came in to play here . Although the fish wasn't smelly or tasted old but it also didn't taste  fresh either. It literally didn't have a taste lol I recommend putting a little ponzu sauce and a very small dollop of wasabi on the fish. \n\nOverall the staff was was nice and friendly they greet you when you walk in and say good bye to you when you walk out . I would eat here again but I would definitely have to come here for the all you can eat and I suggest you do the same as well, I do recommend GO GO GO!
