I've been in showbiz for 40+ years. This is the most original and theatrical show I've ever seen. I wasn't a Beatles music fan, until I saw this show. I've seen it three times now and can't wait to go back.\n\nUPDATE -- Saw it again last night (3 NOV 2014). Again, best show I've seen in my 41 years in show business.  This is the most theatrical, creative and spectacular show I've ever seen. It has so many layers and so, so complicated to produce, but looks effortless. THIS IS A WORK OF ART.
