Yummiest AYCE sushi in town! I stumbled on this place after my boyfriend's show at the hard rock and fell in love! The staff is decent and the sushi is super fresh. It's pretty close to UNLV and it's nice cause it's just far enough from the strip that it's not too busy. I definitely recommend checking this place out for all my sushi lovers. \n\nI always order the spicy tuna roll cause it has an extra kick that other places don't have around lol.
