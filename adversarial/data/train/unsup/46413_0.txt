I love the ambiance of the place.  Its gorgeous, beautiful, and classy.  When the dance floor gets too hot to handle you can step out to the pool setting with huge lounge areas.  There are cabanas that give you the summery getaway feel.  I love it. If you don't know a promoter get to know one or else waiting in line can be a pain.  Thankfully for girls its free if your on the guest list and if your a guy just expect to pay.  \n\nI went during Spring Break and we all know how that goes.  IT GETS PACKED!  Even so don't let that stop you because the more the merrier.  Yes you may get shoved and pushed here and there but its a dance floor its expected.  The music they played was mainly house music and it was not that bad.  \n\nBar: It was pretty pricey.  We ordered 3 adios and two cranberry vodka that came out to be $77.  If you were to average the drinks out its about $15. I wish there was less ice and more alcohol. :\/
