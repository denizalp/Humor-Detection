I really, REALLY wanted to like this place.  How can you hate on a place that is decorated with teddy bears?  Seriously now... I'm like an overgrown she-child, so this place should have been paradise for me.  Instead, I left with a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.\n\nIt took us ten minutes to be seated.  The woman at the cash register up front wasn't the hostess (I guess), so she left to find someone to seat us.  We waited FOR-E-VER for someone to finally show us to a table.  Then, we sat for another ten minutes after deciding what we wanted to eat for someone to come take our order.  I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup to start.  It was tepid at best and exactly the same consistency and overwhelmingly salty flavor as Campbell's Chunky soup.  For my meal, I ordered pot roast.  Over 50% of it was fat.  The sides were pretty nasty as well... a hard and cold baked potato and burned vegetables.  My fianc√©'s turkey dinner was so bad that he left it untouched like it was an alien life form.  \n\nThe service was the worst part.  From start to finish, the waitress was surly and rude.  It was like we were ruining her day by just being there.  I really, REALLY tried to be nice, but it seemed like she was more mean the nicer I got.  I couldn't WAIT to bolt out of there.\n\nSeriously, people.  There are better diners in this city.  Maybe I had a random bad experience, but besides the decor, there was nothing I liked about this place.
