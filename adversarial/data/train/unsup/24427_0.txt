My dad told me a new juice bar opened up on Detroit. I would rather eat whole fruits most of the time. Juices taste good but I rather get all of the nutrition and fiber though. Plus if you just eat a bite of each fruit, chew on it for a while and eat another one at the same damn time, your mouth turns into a juicer! It is really cool and I sugest trying it! I saw a couple people reviewed Helvetica and said it was good. I decided to stop in. I found out that it is the same owner as Barocco right up the street on Madison. It is great to see someone investing on this side of Lakewood. The food was excellent. I had a passion fruit drink that I chugged before my food was done. I had the beef, rice and beans dish which was great. I only ate half then had part two after a few beers late night in my apartment. I added an avocado which really set things off. The Cuban sandwich is also really good. They carry Rising Star coffee which is also a plus. I had a good conversation with a guy who worked there about sneakers and what our all-time favorites are. Mine would be the Jordan 5, original Bo Jackson's and the 1995 Jason Kidd Zoom Flights. He only wears sneakers but I tried to explain the merits of a pair of Wallabee Clarks or Timberland work boot. I refuse to wear sneaks with jeans!
