How in the world did it take me this long to come here?  How?  I feel like I haven't used Yelp to it's potential for living here for nearly three years before my first visit to this perfect book store.\n\nI had, of course heard about some cool events that had taken place at Changing Hands in the past but somehow, I didn't ever make it to one.\n\nAfter lunch, the boy and I decided to check this place out.  This is the kind of store that kind of makes me feel like I should move to Tempe as it is more hippy than Cen Pho and therefore would correlate to my persona a bit more.  \n\nI left with another book that is going to strengthen my vegetarianism, a Christmas gift and a couple cute little liberal leaning bumper stickers.  Since the boy was in tow, I exerted more self-control than I normally would.\n\nI love the trinkets and random hoopla along with the diversity of the books that they carry.  This is a great spot to find a unique gift for someone (Tis the Season, right?) and spend hours perusing books.\n\nThings that made me warm inside upon this visit (warning:  cheesy girl alert):\n\n1.  A little boy ran up to his dad and insisted he needed a book.  This boy was quite invested in said book, and the dad grabbed it without any annoyance and purchased it for his son.  I know, I'm a cheesy teacher and wish more kids were passionate about reading.\n\n2.  At the cash register, someone was complaining about Palin's book.  We had a back and forth bashing her stupidity, and then I suggested everyone read Going Rouge (a response that details her stupidity in a fun way).  We all laughed and understood that Palin is an idiot.\n\n3.  I had a conversation with a random lady about a pooping book.\n\nChanging Hands rocks and makes me feel all warm inside.  I know, I'm such a cheesy book nerd, and if you happen to be, as well, then check it out.
