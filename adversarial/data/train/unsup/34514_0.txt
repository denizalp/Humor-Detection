Ate on the patio since it wasn't too warm.  The server was pretty confused at the beer offerings and couldn't explain them.  A little preparation is a big plus if the word \"Brew\" is in your name.  The waitress was adequate once we got past the beer debacle, but not tremendous.\n\nHad the Sea Bass with a side salad, and corn polenta.  The fish was a little over cooked, the salad good, and the polenta was excellent.  All in all, worth another try, since the seafood menu was extensive for the region, and a restaurant of this size. \n\n Could easily give them 4 stars if they tweaked the fish prep and the beer knowledge.  In fact, giving them a second shot tonight, and I'll be surprised if they can't garner 4 stars.  Give them a try and see what you think.
