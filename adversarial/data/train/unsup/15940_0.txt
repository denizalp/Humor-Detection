NOT kid-friendly. Kid-tolerant maybe, but a limited, inflexible menu with no true kid choices. And no kid drinks even!  Food was fine, but not fabulous. Perhaps a little pretentious, because its just trying too hard (battered fried poached egg??).  Service was acceptable. I won't be back.  it just wasn't THAT good.
