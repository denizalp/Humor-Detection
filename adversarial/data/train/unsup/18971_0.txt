I stopped by this location at 11:30 on a Friday, before the lunch hour- or so I thought... This place was PACKED full of customers in line. The line was concert waiting long, really. As I was looking around to decide to stay or go, I noticed they were fully staffed, and the line was, well- moving. Upon closer inspection, it was moving very well. To help expedite the line, an employee came out from the counter and asked if anyone was ordering a hot sub, and he began taking those orders, and getting them started, which thinned the line quite a bit.\n\nWhen I got to the counter, I was greeted warmly. I placed my order, picked my toppings and went to pay. Each employee was very nice, and the cashier and I were even joking back and forth, and it was really nice. It wasn't forced corporate speak, they were just nice and seemed excited about their product.\n\nThe sammie was very good, and while not as good as a Mom & Pop deli, it was good and the bread actually appeared as though it had seen an oven. The meat is sliced fresh (cannot understand why people eat at Subway, where it just sits, pre-sliced, for days). The veggies and condiments are fresh and plentiful.\n\nTips for success:\n-Carpool. This parking lot is very tight- no joke.\n-While  in line, check out the menu. It's silly to wait five minutes to order, and THEN look at the big menu and go 'Uhhh, uhhh, I think I want........ uhh.......\"\n-\"Mike's Way\" is basically most of the toppings, there are signs that explain it\n-Call ahead or email your order, saves time\n\nEnjoy!
