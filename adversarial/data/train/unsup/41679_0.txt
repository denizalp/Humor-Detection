Had some issues at first but they were quick to get it resolved, if you need any help at all I would recommend talking to a manager immediately. Management is great and I'm happy they care about their customers the way they do. Thank you Kathy and Adam for helping me. Happy to be getting my new furniture I really needed! :)
