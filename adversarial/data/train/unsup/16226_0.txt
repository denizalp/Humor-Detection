This review is over a year in the making! I waited until the dreaded membership cancellation to give this place a proper review.\n\nThere is nothing I don't like about this gym, except maybe the artificially coloured sugar water offered in the vending machine. The cost of membership is comparable to others in the area and you get to use all of their other locations because this one is a \"signature\" club. The place is large, brightly lit and rarely ever smells. I've never had trouble getting a machine (there are more than enough) and the classes are pretty good, too. I never used the lockers, swimming pool or sauna. I have also never had any personal training. They offer fresh towels at every visit and there is also a juice bar.\n\nSigning up was fairly pressure-free. When it came time for cancellation (I moved away), yes I had to go in person during the week between 9-5pm, but the process was totally painless. I was asked why I was cancelling but wasn't in any way pressured to keep the membership. I have had memberships at Extreme Fitness (way too crowded) and Goodlife (shiesty membership practices) and this gym is better by far than both. We had to pay a $100 initiation fee and also first and last month's membership up front, so be aware of that. There was no contract and they are happy to suspend your membership if you are not going to use the gym during a particular month.\nThings that could make it better; allow cancellation over the phone at any hour. Offer organic food options and get rid of the vitamin water. Oh and make the pool saltwater instead of chlorine.
