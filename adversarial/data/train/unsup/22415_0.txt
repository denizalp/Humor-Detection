The last time I visited the Sultan's Tent it was situated in Yorkville, Nirvana's \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" was blasting on everyone's Discman, and this restaurant was seemingly on it's last legs while featuring belly dancers that looked like dead ringers for Courtney Love...not a good scene...\n\nFast forward 20 years later and I'm here for a Yelp get-together at the nouveau incarnation of The Sultan's Tent, now located at Front Street and y'know what?? I have to say bravo as they've cleaned up pretty nice! The interior is an exotically elegant mash-up of \"Rick's Café Américain'' and Scheherazade's lair if you'll pardon my layman's description, the belly dancers are lookers, and the food is surprisingly very good!\n\nOur group was here for Summerlicious as the menu had a generous variety of three course offerings.  I decided on the Harira, a minestrone-like soup with chick peas, lentils and Kidney beans, the Chicken Marrakesh which featured chicken braised in apricots\/prunes and a generous helping of broth infused couscous, which was simply divine and to finish I have the Cinnamon Apple Cheese Cake.  \n\nI have to give props to our lady server who was ON THE BALL!   There were other male servers who seemed to be super confused, and playing musical entrees with our orders, but SHE whipped 'em into shape and had our orders all sorted out.  That's right fellas...Leave it to a woman to get things done right!!!\n\nA big thank-you to Food Blogger extrordinaire Viviana M for orchestrating this amazing UYE.  My taste buds are still reeling from that savoury Chicken Marrakesh and yes I've already devoured my take-home portion on the same night while watching the Colbert Report...it is THAT GOOD!!!\n\nOne last note : My experience could have yielded 5 stars, but alas I was a bit crestfallen as one of our male dining counterparts was a little \"too shy\" to get his Shakira moves on.  Ahhh well, I guess his hips don't lie http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-Z-_mzd0lWM&feature=related
