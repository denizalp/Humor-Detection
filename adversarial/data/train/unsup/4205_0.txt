Found this cute little shop when helping a friend find a certain sods. So we came and wow blast from the past. The haribou bags, the asian gummies, and the pop rocks! Weren't those banned as kids? Lol\nWent with the redrageous mike and Ike, got some hello kitty jelly beans and their brand of cinnamon bears. The service was helpful as they were patient and kind in helping us find things. They even have the old school metal lunch boxes and star wars pez dispensers. My friend got a 6 pack of soda and they have a punch card if you buy a certain amount of soda at once. Have to go back and try different things.\nThey did have some of the candy bars from Canada that are memories of summers for me. However limited selection and not the ones I wanted and they said they couldn't get them. Only 4 stars as had trouble finding things in the store as the same candies weren't always grouped together.
