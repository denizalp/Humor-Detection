Finally, a place I can get a massage where I don't have to keep up awkward conversation with my masseuse. She was awesome-- it was relaxing, and I'd totally go there again. Only downside- it can get a little pricey. I used a Living Social and only paid $35, but prices are usually $80-$100 for a 1hr massage. I guess this place will be relegated to my \"mental health\" couple times a year =)
