Probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced from any store.\n\nWalked in, asked one of the employees where a their glue guns were. Told me to go to aisle 7. \nWhen I couldn't find it, I asked a different employee if she could show me where to find it, she said aisle 7 - I then asked if she could actually show me since I couldn't find it. She says, oh we don't have glue guns.\n\nWhy tell me to go to the aisle, then as soon as I ask to be shown it, tell me they don't carry it. Either 1. You're too lazy to move, or 2. You just don't care about customer service.
