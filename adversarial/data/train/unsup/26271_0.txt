If you're picky about how you look in your glasses and the run of the mill frames found at the 1hour places do not suit your style - Head on over to Sassy Glasses! \n\nI got my glasses a few weeks before the wedding so I could get used to the new prescription. I wore them EVERYWHERE, except around J. I had a few people ask me what was wrong with my old frames. Or better yet, why I was going to wear glasses on my wedding day. Why not get contact lenses. Seriously?! I know your wedding day is a special day, but why would I wear contacts that one day when I wear glasses on a daily basis. \n\nDan and Quida understand this and helped me pick out the best frames that suited my face, would look fantastic on my wedding day (almost like another wedding accessory..an extension of my veil, jewelry, etc), and would look fantastic for everyday wear. \n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE my Alain Mikli glasses and get tons of compliments on them\/how I look in them! \n\nThe first time my hubby saw my new glasses was when I was walking down the isle. After the ceremony, he laughed and said, \"How long have you been hiding those?!\" To which I replied, \"Oh just a few weeks!\" \n\nThank you Dan and Quida!!!
