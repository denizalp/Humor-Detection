I went to this Buffet twice in one day. I went once in the morning for brunch then for dinner before the Britney show (let's all send healing thoughts to her ankle). They probably have the best deal in Vegas with 12.99 bottomless mimosas. The food is well above decent and there were soooo many options! You can have eggs benedict, chinese food, sushi and pizza on the same plate! The buffet was clean, the food was hot, the service was great (we sat at the bar). I can't say no to a good buffet! I wasn't a huge fan of their hollandaise sauce for the bene, but everything else was pretty delicious! Great value. Especially for the Vegas.
