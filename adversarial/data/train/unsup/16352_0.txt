For some reason, I'm a pedi-phobe.  In case that is not a word that comes up in your dictionary (I JUST MADE IT UP) allow me to elaborate: pedicures freak me out.  I don't like the touching, and the soaking, and the scraping, and the scrubbing. \n\nBut I sure do like the results.\n\nThankfully I was wrangled into a pedicure at Vanessa Nails when it first opened, and have returned many times since for pedicures, manicures, waxing and threading.  All services are done efficiently, and very affordably by Toronto standards: \n\npedicures run $25;\nmani\/pedis $30; and \nthe standing special for waxing is 20% off for any services over $25.  \n\nThe space is clean, on-street parking is rarely tough to secure right in front, and the double wall of polish colour options has me willing to face my fear of pedicures regularly in the name of sandal season.  \n\nYelp note: if possible, I (strongly) recommend visiting Vanessa's during an off-time *in addition to* calling in advance for an appointment.  Many times I've seen walk-ins during peak times and - in the name of business - employees never say that they can't take them, regardless of how busy they are.  A pre-existing appointment buffers you from that (a little.  No promises that you won't still be playing Musical Chairs with one of the five massaging pedicure chairs).
