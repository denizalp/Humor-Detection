Tj the owner is terrible. It's cash only so they lie to you on the website saying you can pay card. They push and shove you when they say they won't touch you. The manager is terrible. I was 2 mins into the maze when he scared me chased me and held me down and hurt my hand. I thought it was part of the show. I paid for all 3 shows and didn't get to see any of them through. The cast were all drunk and on drugs. It's such a double standard they say they won't touch you then they push you. They talk bad to you and when you try to joke around and talk back to them they say you are verbally abusing them, when they are basically doing the same thing. I want my $70 back!!!! The worst haunted house of my life!! I'm gonna press charges on the manager for assault! He hurt my hand when he grabbed me really hard and threw me to the floor in pitch black darkness. I'm a girl and I'm pretty harmless. I was terrified! Best advice just pay for 1 show, cuz they are crooks and hurt women.
