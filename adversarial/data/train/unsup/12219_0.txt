***This review is for the casino - not the hotel.***\n\nWe decided to gamble and the lowest black jack table is $10. Then we order drinks while sitting at the table and the waitress doesn't mention that the drinks have a fee. She comes back and wants $25 for 3 drinks! I have NEVER heard of a casino that charges you to drink while you gamble and doesn't even mention it when you order! Be careful!\n\nMeanwhile, we tried to get takeout from Ocean Trail and they wouldn't let us. In order to get takeout they expected us to wait in the long line to be seated for food. We ended up not getting anything. \n\nI can't believe the policies in place at this casino. The customer service is horrible!
