Wow the hostess had to be the ruddiest person I have ever encountered in Pittsburgh. The Sushi is great but the horrible hostess will make you want take home sushi from the Giant Eagle. We arrived on time at 7:30PM for our reservation, asked if we could sit at one of 2 open tables that sat 4 and were told \"no you have to sit at the bar\"  which across from the stove and they have very poor A\/C. The heat of the gas burning cooktop made it like you feel like you were in the kitchen, oh well I guess we were in the kitchen. Those 2 open tables became 3 open tables for four but we were not allowed to move.  Then  \"super hostess\" Megan turned away another party of 3 saying \"sorry we are booked.\"  Maybe she could get a job at the DMV.  She would be prefect there.
