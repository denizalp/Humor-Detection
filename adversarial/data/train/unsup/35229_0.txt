Having just moved to the area and setting up camp temporarily in sleepy Cramerton, I was jazzed to find this cute pub along the 50 yards that is Center Street.\n\nIt was a Thursday night, and this joint was packed. Booths on the left, open seating throughout and a cozy bar in the back. Large TVs throughout would make this a worthy destination for game-watching.\n\nThough we were bummed to learn the kitchen was out of the fried pickle appetizer, we enjoyed the consolation handmade chips with ranch dressing. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich on kaiser--with a low threshhold for heat the mild sauce was enough--and my dining companion had the BBQ plate. Ask for extra sauce for the latter, since the amount that comes with it pales in comparison to the BBQ serving. Both entrees were good and better than your average bar food.\n\nAnd let's talk about beer. Local brews on draft, all good, and if you can't decide get the five-draft flight--a tasty tour from lager to porter in highball glasses.\n\nIf you're wondering about the Thursday night crowd, my guess is because it was wine night--$10 house bottles. And CSTR has its ways to lure you in other nights of the week, from trivia on Tuesday to $3 draft night. For us it's all of the above and the fried pickles. Hope they'll have stocked up for next time.
