Festival ends. Writes review one month later. Oops~\n\nHands down LiB was the best music event I've ever been, and trust me, I've been to plenty. The organizers of this event did a great job in terms of lineup, festival set up, food vendors, and ticket pricing! For the price you paid (LiB 2015 headliners were Stevie Wonder, Imagine Dragons, Kendrick effin' Lamar, Carnage, Porter Robinson... need I say more?), you got 100x worth the experience. I paid $270 for all three days and it was amazing!\n\nThe festival was crowded but not packed (o0o0o throwing shade at Hard Summer and Coachella) so you had plenty of dancing room even up front. Especially for a petite person like me, if we're standing shoulder-to-shoulder, back-to-back... all I will be able to see would probably be your shoulder.... But here I didn't have that issue! I didn't even have a problem maneuvering from stage to stage!\n\nOther Pros:\n-festival lines never took too long; there were two entrances to the festival\n-security was respectful and does not manhandle you\n-plenty of water refill stations near and between stages\n-art murals and decorations were spot on\n-concrete! THIS FESTIVAL IS NOT AS DIRTY AS OTHER FESTIVALS #blessed Nothing worse than sweating all day and collecting dirt on your skin as you walk and dance!\n\nCons:\n-I literally cannot think of one. Everything was amazing.\n\nParking costs $45 for the entire weekend but because the festival was located downtown, I just stayed at a nearby hotel (Plaza Casino) and walked there. In fact, most festival goers stay at the Plaza Casino and Hotel. It's not great, but hey, it's 10 minutes walking distance from the festival!\n\nIf I ever had the chance to, I definitely would come back. Highly recommend you attend LiB, you won't regret it!
