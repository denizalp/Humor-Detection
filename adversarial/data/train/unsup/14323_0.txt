I can only give them one star.  I stopped in shortly after they had opened and I was extremely disappointed.  Since I am in the big and tall sizes, I thought I would see what they had to offer.   Well I can tell you that they offer NOTHING in big and tall sizes.  If you are a in the gym and have the body of a Greek god, then I guess this place would be ok, but for any one else over a waist size of 38 and a chest measurement of 48, just go elsewhere!
