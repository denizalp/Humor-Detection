These guys did my Dodge Dakota lets start with that after replacing the radiator mount and condenser on the air conditioning. The work looked flawless but put it in 4x4 and radiator itself was broken. So it's towed back and they fixed it and told me the radiator hose is to close to the hose to the Fan. We will tow it to your house lol thanks geico thank you Invision. . On my Avenger They stated they used OEM not OEM they are all black and dented  I took a video thank god. Jorge stated it's done, Tmro at nine. Well since I had to pay 1,200 dollars for the Dakota. To fix the Master cylinder & booster.  I went down to look at a bent framed wreck. Lol no straightening machine results = bent frame but the deck is missing before the date on invoice and the bumper shows signs of not straightened. Not taking this kind of work back. -10 on body work +10 on cheating the customer  please follow this link  https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/douglasbaker454\/posts\/1010958912347118.
