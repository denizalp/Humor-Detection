DO NOT BOOK HERE!\nYes its dirt cheap but they make up with it with fake claims about damage and fuel. \nFirst: Its not even NEAR the airport! It is about 20 minutes DRIVE down the stripp far away from the airport. The lot is dirty and looks like out of a movie where they have mangy pittbulls running at night. \nThe cars are really crappy the cheapest of the cheap, ok it is a cheap place so I shouldn;t complain here.\n\nWhen you take the car off the lot MAKE SURE TO CHECK EVERYTHING! Even the tiniest little nick and nack on the glass, seats etc. Also, YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR FUEL and compare it to the slip. It is very hard to find on the slip, and there is a reason...\nBecause you take it off the lot half full, their system says it is full.. Unfortunately we didnt see where the stupid fuel check is and of course in tiny tiny letters it sayed it was full.. stupid us,smart them!\nThe check out dude doesnt care and just takes the slip.\nUsually GOOD places check the fuel and nicks and nacks for you, these people dont. Because they want your money!\n\nDO NOT BOOK HERE! Rather spend extra $20 on a nice, good car, GOOD rental company, reputation, help and do not get screwed over. \nWhile we were waiting for dudeheads to do anything, there were 2 !! other people who were told they had damage to their car... All tourists of course too, too bad we are not tourists.\nDont book here, seriously. Save your trouble!
