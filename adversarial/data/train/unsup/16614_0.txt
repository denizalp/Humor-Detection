In my journey to continued healthiness which the journey is going to be very long. I thought it would be smart to swap out snacks that usually have sugar in them for fresh fruits and vegetables. It has been forever since I have been to a Trader Joe's. This used to be the only grocery store in AZ that I would shop at. These little markets are few and far between here. As well as way off the beaten path. \n\nTrader Joe's is such a refreshing and inexpensive store. Their produce department rivals that of some major competitors, with better produce than say Kroger. The exceptional quality of their food reflects in the delicate way that the employees stock their food. The atmosphere of the store was so serene and open. There was not a drop of hate or hostility from any corner of the store. When customers walk in they are greeted with beautiful flowers that are rare and in so many welcoming warm colors. \n\nThe employees here will work twice as hard to please the guests because they want too. The cashier that rang me up inquired about me personally and was able to make conversation on the fly. This takes effort and an ability to love all human kind. Kudos to Trader Joe's employees. More businesses should adopt their business model too!\n\nI was so impressed with the pricing in the store. With the temps creeping past 100 degrees water is essential to keep us alive, they sell their 23 oz bottles of water for 29 cents. So to save on all the water we will drink this summer Trader Joe's is the place to shop. Their fresh veggies were so beautiful and delicious and inexpensive. I was able to get healthy snacks, great service, all unforced, and my day is not over yet!
