Meh.\n\nEverything there was fine, but that's about it...  Shouldn't you want more than just \"okay\" from your hamburgers? When I want a burger, I want a burger. Big, juicy, meaty, with some vegetables and cheese on top; a smooshy bun that got a little toasted on the grill; the grease needs to seep onto the fresh cut fries a little bit so I get some of that flavor on them... and B Spot is NOT the place to get that. \n\nI'm not from Cleveland, and haven't lived in Ohio for several years, so maybe I just don't get the Michael Symon (sp?) hype, but I thought this place was just okay. Maybe it's because I'm a burger traditionalist, and I don't want to have chutney or goat cheese on burgers. Maybe the burgers just weren't that good. Maybe I just want regular old Heinz ketchup for fries that don't have rosemary or something-infused oil on them. I'm not sure. If I was craving a burger, this wouldn't be the first place I thought of. If I were in Crocker Park and wanted something to eat, I might stop in. It's not regrettable, just not worth seeking out.
