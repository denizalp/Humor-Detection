Great location. Great Food. Great Price!!\nIf you're tired of paying 80 bucks on the strip for lunch, check out this place. \nService is quick, portions are MASSIVE and prices are extremely reasonable. Been coming here for a few years now and have had a variety of items on their menu and it's always been delicious. Give it a try.
