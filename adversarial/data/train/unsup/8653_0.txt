I'm a little weird when it comes to attending gentleman's clubs. Simply put, I don't seek them out. They just aren't my thing. I think I know all too well it's all an illusion and start to get bored.\n\nSo, what happens when I get pulled along to come here. I'll tell you. The guys I'm with all go for dances and bringing out the roll of one dollar bills and I just sit there sipping water, watching the people, and trying to figure out which dancers are having fun vs. just going through the motions (hint: look at their eyes). \n\nAs various dancers come past and ask if I want a dance, I generally will politely decline and they move on. Well, that is until one of them stopped by and we started talking. It was such a great conversation that rather than let it end, I handed her $10 and said \"I don't want to dance, I just want to have a conversation\". She smiled and we continued talking for a while. It was a lot of fun and a great reminder that the people who work here are...wait for it...people.\n\nYou all can have delusions that these girls want you, I'll stick with making a real human connection.
