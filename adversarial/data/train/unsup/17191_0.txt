Conservatory & Botanical Garden  -- paired with the Fountains of Bellagio show -- is probably the very best complimentary attraction in all of Las Vegas. It is akin to woods right in the middle of a soulless metropolis. \n\nWhich begs the question: why the rating? Very best ...? That is five-stars bruh. \n\nSure. I cannot ignore the genocide of butterflies during the spring display though. What am I supposed to do that as an empathetic human being? They are sentient beings, and deserve better. One-star during the spring season; five-stars during any other season.\n\n--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­-----------------------\n\nFrankly, anyone who comes here in spring and opens their eyes and takes flash photography of the butterflies and has a jolly-ole time is probably blind to injustice. They have a blindness built in to how they see the world. This is not an insignificant matter. \n\n--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­-----------------------\n\nRating: Three-stars, \"A-OK.\" (Stop the unnecessary killing of gorgeous creatures, you animals.)
