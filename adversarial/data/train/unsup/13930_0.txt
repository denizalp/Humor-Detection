It's aging, charming and inexpensive. The best part is you get to finally catch the movies you really wanted to see but are now out of main theaters. \n\nWhy charming? Because you can get hot dogs, slushy's, nachos, cotton candy, and some other fun treats a little different from a regular theater. Also they have fun vending machines with balls of goodies for little kids and big ones.\n\nI love that this theatre has like 10 movies playing at any given time. I also just find the theatre comfortable and cosy and full of charm somehow. \n\nIt's a great option when you want to go out but not all out. You know what I mean? Of course you do. It's relaxed. \n\nGreat theatre.
