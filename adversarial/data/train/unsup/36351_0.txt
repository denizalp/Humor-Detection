I used this firm to settle an injury claim that I had after getting T-Boned by someone running a red light.\nI must say that it was very surprising when my attorney gave me his cell phone instead of getting a paralegal. He ALWAYS answered his phone and answered any questions that I had.\nLastly he only charged me 25% instead of the normal 33% that the other attorneys charge. That doesn't mean that he didn't work just as hard.\nAll in all I was very pleased and will recommend.
