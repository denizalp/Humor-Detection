I frequent this place quite often, usually during my lunch breaks. I always get the same thing, and it's always good. This time, however... well, there was a slit in my cup. This led to tea being spilled over my pants in a way that may lead people to believe I had an accident. The slit wasn't noticeable unless you squeezed the cup a little bit, so I can understand why it went unnoticed, and maybe it's a little bit my fault for putting the cup between my legs for a second while I was getting ready to drive off. Luckily, I have a cardigan with me today so I don't have to go home to get a change of pants. \n\nIf any staff see this, I recommend checking over the cups before using them, because it looks like some of them have issues. Like I said, they are quite flimsy, so it's understandable, but you never know. One day, you might get some tea spilled on the wrong person, and I've had my fair share of unreasonable customers. Just be aware!
