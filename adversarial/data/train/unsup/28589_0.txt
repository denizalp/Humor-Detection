This place is really a fantastic restaurant with an impressive bar rather than a impressive bar with fantastic food, IMO.\n\nThis place is the sister bar to The Skeptical Chymist, but they have different menus. Skeptical Chymist is closer to me but I'd rather drive the 45 min it takes to get to Fibber Magees. They don't have the same menus, which is disappointing. \n\nWithout a doubt, you must order the lamb nachos. My favorite, by far, and I always order them. Instead of tortilla chips, the dish comes with lightly fried wonton wrappers, ground lamb, feta cheese, and pico de gallo. The portions are very nice; even when sharing the dish with my husband, it's a lot. \n\nEvery day, they have various specials, \"dine in\" only. My husband loves the $5 burgers on Mondays. They're not skimpy, but nice and meaty. He always cuts it in half bc it is so filling. We've also come in and had their sliders. Those were also very yummy. \n\nTheir chicken tenders aren't heavily breaded, but are still fried. I really like those! I have yet to find a place with better chicken tenders. The fish in their fish 'n chips was huge and filling. If you've got a hankering for fish, this will take care of it.
