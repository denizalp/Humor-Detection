They're not bad...they're not the best I've had...props for being the first in Vegas to do Pasteis de Nata though.\n\nI personally prefer Portuguese Egg Tarts over the similar Hong Kong style Egg Tarts\/Dan Tat\nand having been to the birthplace of the Portuguese Egg Tarts and and trying multiple shops, (Pasteis de Belem and Mantegaria  being the top two spots) these don't even come close, but do try these if you're curious, for me, it's a one and done. ALOHA!!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  3
