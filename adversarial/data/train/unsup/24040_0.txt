$5 pizzas....through a drive through window?  What's not to love.  Yes it's crappy pizza but when it comes time to feed a family of five like mine, nothing gets it done quicker and cheaper than Little Ceasars.  I'm in and out within minutes and two hot pies fills up five hungry mouths for $10 and some change.  Can't beat it!
