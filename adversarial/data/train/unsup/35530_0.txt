Came here while I was on vacation and was very impressed. Mani and pedi was on point. I got the deluxe and it felt spectacular. Julia is who did mine and she was perfect. Very polite and really seemed to pay attention to what I wanted. All in all I will be back every time I am in town. Also cutie did not smell of chemicals at all. They must have a really good filtration system or something. Ask for Julia, you will not be disappointed.
