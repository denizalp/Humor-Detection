I never knew this place existed until just the other day.  Finally, I had to give into my urge for Philly and headed down the road to check this place out.  Not very assuming on the outside, I will say.\n\nThe inside is pretty east coast...In a totally good way.  \n\nNot the kind of place you get fawned over it seems (unless you're a regular) but the customer service was certainly nice, and I got the food rather quick.  \n\nI tried the cheese steak with red sauce.  It was awesome!  It ain't the cheapest I've ever gotten but it was worth the trip.  I suspect that I will be back!
