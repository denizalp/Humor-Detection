Only come here if you want a good pickle. \n\nI was really excited to try this place after its 4.5 star review from over 1000 people; however, it didn't live up to my expectations at all. \n\nWe ordered chips and salsa and for an extra $2 you can get guac, but don't do it, it was bland, the chips needed salt and the salsa had no real heat.\n\nI ordered the hatch burger which came with a hatch chili on it and cheese. That's it. No lettuce or veggies or even a spread (menu said chipotle aioli but that came with my tots, not the burger). The burger and the tots were luke warm at best. \n\nService was mediocre at best.
