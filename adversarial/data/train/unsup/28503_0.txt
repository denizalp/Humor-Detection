We visited Dick's Last Resort about a year ago.  It was recommended to me by a friend who said it was a real hoot.  When we arrived there wasn't a wait, but they sat us at the side of the restaurant where you cannot see the stage & the main crowd of people - that kind of sucked because you could hear people laughing and carrying on, but you were not able to be a part of it.  It is the waiter's job to yell at you, call you names, and place silly paper hats with silly sayings on your head.  Of the 4 of us in our group, they chose me for one of their hats.  Mine read, \"I have a crush on Dr. Phil\".  Everytime the waiters pass your table by, they hurl insults at everyone & heaven forbid you should need something & ask for it.  They do bring it to you, but be prepared to have it thrown at you along with a hurling insult.  I ordered the hamburger and I thought it was quite good.  The whole concept of Dick's is pretty neat, but i think for us it was as much fun as it could have been because they sat us off to the side of the restaurant while everyone else was in the middle, near the stage.  Maybe because of our ages?  I don't care if I'm 90, I would want to be where all the fun is.  As far as prices go, I guess you just need to expect it, after all you are in Vegas and since the mob no longer runs it, corporate America does, you can forget excellent food deals.
