My husband had a 1:00 appt for a routine teeth cleaning. They called 3 weeks before his appt asking to switch it to 12:30, which was no problem. His appt day comes, we arrive 10 minutes early, at 12:20. 4 other people come in after us and were called back before us, even someone who had not finished their paperwork. We finally left at 12:45, once the 4th person was taken in the back before us. We will never be coming back.
