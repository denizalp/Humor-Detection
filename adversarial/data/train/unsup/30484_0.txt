My husband and I get massages quite frequently and have been getting them for years. He likes the really deep tissue massages (the kind that hurts-due to back problems) and I like the more swedish type kneading massages and it's hard to find places that are able to give us both what we want (we've tried everywhere from massage schools to day spas to fancy\/luxury spas) but we both agree that this place gave us both one of THEE BEST massages we ever had. We went while on vacay after our drive in from Cali and we totally wished we could bring our girls back home to Hawaii with us. I believe their names were ROSIE and ASHLEY but not too sure. \n\nWhile in Vegas, if you like massages, you MUST TRY this place. Service was AMAZING and the ambiance was cool too. Not your typical spa ambiance, I mean it was still relaxing but there was a rock n roll vibe going on. I don't know if that makes sense but I guess you have to see it for yourself to understand. \n\nBEST MASSAGES EVER...DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. PRICES ARE VERY REASONABLE TOO CONSIDERING IT'S LAS VEGAS! A+ IN MY BOOK! :)
