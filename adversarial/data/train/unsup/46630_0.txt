I can't say enough about this place.  I work near the Alcove and everything we've had there has been delicious.  I'm partial to the Chicken Pesto Panini.  A friend of mine is addicted to the Caesar Salad with Chicken.  We've had them cater lunches for us and it was outstanding.  So happy they opened up in Greentree.
