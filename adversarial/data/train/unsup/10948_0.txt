Still my go to sushi spot downtown after enso dropped the ball.\n\nFor this little occassion, my apartment building was having a social event and Saki bombs and sushi was on the menu.  Never had a saki bomb until then..........not bad........should keep that on my drinking list for the future.\n\nThe funniest thing about this entire visit was the manager\/owner...was doing saki bomb every round.  She'd set them up and do it.  Tiny little thing she was and got a little stinky, which I thought was VERY cool!\n\nSushi was good.....saki bomb was better........still my neighborhood Sushi place!
