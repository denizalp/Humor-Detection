While I get that it's a great bookstore, I don't understand why everyone thinks it's the best. More than once, they've not had newer books I was looking for (that should have been easy enough to find) and the staff seem elitist and stuffy, as if I'm not \"Green\" enough to shop there, and were never around when I actually needed help.\nThis is a great place if you're into, for lack of a better word, Hippy things. But not the non-materialistic Hippy, more like the \"I have so much money that I don't need to buy mass produced things\" Hippy.\nThe best part about this store is that they have a ton of events and seem to be really involved in the community. They also have a ton of unique and\/or handmade gift items - a huge portion of the store is dedicated to this - but make sure to have a lot of disposable cash because it's all expensive.\nBesides events or out of sheer boredom, I wouldn't go out of my way to shop here.
