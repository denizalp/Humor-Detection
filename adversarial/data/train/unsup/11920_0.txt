love it!!! moved over 22 years ago...  and just went back for the first time.... FIRST THING i did after being dropped off at my Grandmothers house was walk over to this place.... i MISSED this food soooooo much!!!!\nCalgary has some good poutins but NOTHING was like this and the grilled hotdogs and the steam hotdogs.. the subs the Smoked meat... i had to limit my  food intake because there were sooo many places i wanted to hit being back in Montreal... in the 14 days i was there i went here 9 times,  i got the cap driver to stop and i got a poutin to go .. eating it on the way to the airport...\ntill next time im back in \" La Belle Province\" i will be eating at \"la Belle Province\"
