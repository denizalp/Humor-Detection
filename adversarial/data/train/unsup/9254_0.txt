Ice Ice Cream Baby\nBy The Rue\n\nMid-day snack is what I want,\nHere is where I end my hunt,\nIt is just ice cream but that's okay,\nIf I could I'd go here every day,\nFree kids scoop if you can guess,\nThe trivia on the board try your best,\nI've been coming here for 5 years,\nIt's a shame they don't serve beers,\nCookies and cream and butter pecan,\nI'd even eat it on my front lawn,\nSorry Julie H. had a bad experience,\nAt least it wasn't like Deliverence,\nJim the owner is a good guy,\nAsk him for a sample, he will comply.\n\nBR31!!
