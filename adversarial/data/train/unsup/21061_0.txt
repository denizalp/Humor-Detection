Beef Brisket with Vegetables over rice - $10 (with tax) - Yum!  The beef were tender and delicious.  The light sauce is really tasty and I love the variety of ingredients in this dish - bok choy, onion, snow peas, mushrooms, broccoli, and carrots.\nI stopped in to order my food to go and they were super fast!  I must have waited no more than 5 minutes before my food was ready and it was good.\n\nThe staff is friendly.  There are plenty of seating inside.  There are many dishes to choose from on their menu including 10 kinds of soup, rice platter, noodles, seafood, egg foo yong, chop suey, noodle soup and fried rice.  They also have all day specials starting from $7 (cash or debit only for the specials, otherwise you can pay with credit card).
