Zizi's! Tucked away in the Gold Hill plaza just north of Ikea on Tryon. Storefront. Tiny. Lots of green paint. Super sweet (and talented) owner\/chef Mer. Pro-veg and health paraphanalia lined walls and bulletin boards. Formerly a Mexican joint. Just behind them, one of those weird strip mall churches. A soul food place next door.\n\nBut most importantly: The huge menu full of vegan-i-fied diner food, plus the ubiquitous smoothies, salads. I want to yell from the rooftops. Not only delicious, were my soy buffalo wings (the best I've ever had, if we're keeping score)... not only low sodium, my fried \"fish\" sammich... but relatively healthy. Not raw food healthy (lets face it - soy meat ain't the most natural substance around) but A-OK. Of course, we had to order fries to go with all of that - and even THEY were unique, slightly curried and spiced.\n\nThis place is vegan start to finish but Mer pulls it off with panache - everything was super tasty and distinctly, carefully flavored. I haven't had a meal like this since leaving NYC and to be honest, some things (wings, chili) blew Kate's or even Curly's away. Take out only (but they deliver up to 18 miles out) and limited hours (12-8 daily, 'cept Sun and Mon) be damned, Zizi's is now on permanent rotation.
