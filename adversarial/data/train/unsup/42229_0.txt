This sweet little cafe is reasonable and always does a great job with catering.  The food is always top notch and I have never had a problem with the quality or their service.  It is great to have a catering option that is both affordable and delicious.  Surprisingly, I have yet to visit Bertha's outside of work, but judging by their catering I know that the food is going to be great once I do.
