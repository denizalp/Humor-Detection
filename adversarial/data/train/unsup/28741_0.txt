The service was good! The girl at the register was super nice and patient with us. The food was high quality as well, pretty good. I'll be honest though it was way too pricey! $25 for 2 burgers and fries?!? Not even some type of gourmet style just normal burgers? I'm sorry but next time I want a burger I'm going to save my money and go to in n out for double the amount of food for half the price. Nothing against this five guys location in particular, just feel like the franchise in general is very overrated for how freaking expensive it is.
