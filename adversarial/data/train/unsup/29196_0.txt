Called Carolina Pines Plumbing to reset a loose toilet in my downstairs 1\/2 bath.  Dawn was great on the phone and helpful scheduling an ACTUAL appointment time.  12:30 to 1pm.   I liked that versus other companies that give you a 3 hour window.  Daryl arrived on time and did great work.  Explained what he was going to do and was careful with our hardwood floors.  Covered them with a quilted type cloth.  Did a great job at a very fair price.  I will definitely use Daryl again and will recommend his services to neighbors and friends.
