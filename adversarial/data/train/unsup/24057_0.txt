I decided to check out Dirty Blonde Tavern because it is near my home and they had good reviews. I went in to check it out on a Monday night - cool decor, lots of space, pool, jukebox, hard cider and margaritas were on special, and the bartender was friendly and fast to take my order. Based on this quick visit, I thought it would be a great place to host my birthday get together with friends!\n\nI had 10-12 people coming to celebrate at the Dirty Blonde. Unfortunately, the service was awful and so was the food. We had to chase down the waitress to get a food menu and then after 45 minutes of not coming back to take our order, we had to chase her down again. During this same time period we also had people from the table going up to wait at the bar to order more drinks - a similar experience with them standing at the bar over 20 minutes and not receiving service. It took over an hour to get a second round. The problem is this was a Tuesday and they were empty. We were one of only two or three tables - so the service should have been quick.\n\nI really, really wanted to love this place and make it my hangout. I ended up being embarrassed for talking it up to my friends. I wasn't even able to get drunk on my birthday at a bar, after begging for service! Also - the juke box does NOT work. We put $20 worth of requests in and heard only 1 of those songs all night. The food was very mediocre, also - reheat quality. My friends kept asking why we went there and not Sandbar. \n\nThe three or four lone patrons at the bar, all middle aged men, received great service. The 22 year old birthday party was completely ignored. \n\nI think this place is full of potential and probably being run by inexperienced management. Your experience will probably differ depending on who is working - beware of the Tuesday night staff.
