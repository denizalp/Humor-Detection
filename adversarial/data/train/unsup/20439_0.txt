Our administrative staff booked the Rockin R Ranch for a team building activity.  It all started off fine.  The old men playing cowboy were cute and you couldn't help but humor them.  The food was just ok, but we weren't expecting much.  But the night took a turn for the worse when the entertainment started.  It was a holiday themed show so when they started off with Jingle Bells and other catchy tunes, we clapped and sang along.  But then all of a sudden things got weird. They started singing very religious songs and playing a disturbing movie in the background.  It was almost cult like, and very inappropriate.  I am Christian and even I felt very uncomfortable, like they were pushing religion on us.  It totally ruined the experience for our whole team and we couldn't wait to leave.
