AYCE KBBQ! This was my first experience at an AYCE KBBQ! \n\nAfter an hour and a half wait (Spoiler alert: so worth it), we were taken to our own table that had a grill and all your basic sides along with a house salad. \n\nUpon first glance of their menu I was a little confused. But enter our server Erika to save the day. She walked us through the menu and patiently waited till we decided on which option to go with and our choices. We opted for option A, which between the two of us, we could get 2 meat options each and 2 sides to start with. After that we could order whatever we wanted. We got the spicy chicken, teriyaki chicken, rib eye and kalbi. For our sides we got corn on the cob, rice, bibimap, and grilled vegetable. We wanted to try the cheese corn but they ran out. The meats were tender and savory. The sides were so flavorful. \n\nOur meats arrived via electronic sliding robot and our sides came via Erika. She regularly checked up on us and offered helpful suggestions. She cheerfulness and politeness made the experience even more enjoyable. \n\nInsider knowledge: it is pricey but worth it, I mean what AYCE places do you know that are less than $20. Wait time is long especially on the weekends during diner. Obviously, this place is going to be poppin so don't come hungry or hangry. And also, kids prices depends on their height and they will be measured. \n\nEnjoy!
