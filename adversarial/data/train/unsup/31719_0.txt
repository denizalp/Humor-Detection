Alchemy is one of my very, very favorite dining\/imbibing establishments anywhere.  Everything here is somewhere on the spectrum of excellent to amazing.  The staples on the daily menu are fantastic - their burgers are some of Madison's very best, and the specials, oh, the specials!  You have to go early because people are onto this place and they sell out fast.  It's worth the effort to get there, and it's worth the wait, even if it's crowded (it often is).  Bring cash or your ATM card.\n\nThe beer list rivals the food menu, with often-rotating beers including some that aren't seen often.  It's definitely one of the best tap lineups in town, and this is a beer town.  \n\nAlchemy is a very casual, unassuming tavern that doesn't necessarily tip you off to what awaits you when you order, and that's part of what makes it such a cool place.  \n\nThis is a somewhat short review but that shouldn't imply there's not a lot to say about Alchemy, because I could go on and on.  You'll be glad you don't have a lot to read because you'll get there sooner!
