Ben Sherman was an institution for many years. Good quality clothing, half decent prices with modern designs for the fashion conscious gent. Then the chavs moved in and it went downhill. You can now find Ben shoulder to shoulder (pardon the pun) with the sad offerings of Michael Kors in Winners and any other low rent purveyor of all things cheap.\n\nSo why did Ben open up a brand new store on Queen west? Your guess is as good as mine but I think it has something to do with the fact that Canadians aren't familiar with the term \"chav brand\". Ben still has a decent reputation here and this store is hoping to capitalize on that. Good luck. You should have opened ten years ago.\n\nThe store itself is small and was once occupied by Girl Friday and Lu Lu Lemon before that so you might remember how big it is and how poorly suited it was to showcasing racks of clothing.\n\nI wish I had more good to say about it but the really isn't anything noteworthy about it. You either like the brand and will shop here or don't and will stay away. I do still like their fitted shirts but isn't it about time we got away from plaid and checker patterns?
