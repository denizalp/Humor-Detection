Scottsdale Gun Club, this is not.  But this is a clean, safe, well-equipped, respectable indoor shooting range.  If this is not your neck of the woods, if you've never shot before, or if you just generally feel you wouldn't fit in here--don' t let any of these reasons stop you from coming to Shooter's World.  They are actually very approachable and happily willing to teach and accommodate.  The whole place is low-maintenance so don't go in there with an ego and you'll have a fine and fun time unloading your mag on one of their many target shots.\nTheir Friday Night Ladies' Night is a bit crowded for my liking, but it's an excellent way to get your feet wet, ladies.
