Smallest Marshalls that I've ever been in. I am always amazed at how this chain manages to stay in business and be profitable. I mean, is this the first place you think of to get a suitcase or a cover for your iPad or a tub of salty\/sweet popcorn? Probably not. I think of Marshalls and I'm thinking semi-name brand clothes and shoes. All of that, they have in spades.\n\nBrightly lit with fluorescents (since the entrance is inside the parking deck) and a very shiny floor, the clothes racks are well separated and decently stocked. Prices are okay - not great but not excessive. And the selection is pretty good.\n\nIf you need a nice outfit or a rollaboard suitcase, give 'em a shot.
