I don't like to write negative reviews so I have been avoiding writing this, but every time I think about my haircut and color that I got done at this salon 6 months ago, I still HATE it! I am afraid to have anyone mess with it after it was so badly damaged so I am letting it be for a while and taking out my frustrations in a review. The salon itself had a cool vibe and I had high hopes for the bumble & bumble products. I had a pretty inexperienced stylist, T, who was charming yet seemed a little overly confident. I appreciated her sense of adventure but my intended color, a subtle ombre, was way too dark and way too light. The under half of my long hair was bleached while the upper half was darkened and chopped to allow the lighter part to show through. This left a shelf-like cut. The owner suggested this to the stylist so I do not entirely blame her and I appreciate that she did her best with a great attitude but it was truly AWFUL. I went back in a week later to get in toned down, which required more damaging dye. The owner did this free of charge and was very nice but very bossy and I felt he didn't listen to what i wanted. In the end, it was definitely better but I still wish I could go back in time and not go in the first place. I think if you can articulate exactly what you want and find someone who can create that look it would be an awesome experience but I was not so lucky.
