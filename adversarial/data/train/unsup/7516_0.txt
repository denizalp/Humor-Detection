The Westin Montreal is located pretty centrally so, it's got that going for them. It's located across from the Place D'Armes metro stop, next to hotels like Embassy Suites, Hotel le St. James, Loft Hotel, the W etc... it's like chain hotel row. If I had kids, I would come here. The swimming pool is huge and definitely a great attraction for them. The rooms were nice, a wee bit drafty and everything was brand spankin' new. Everyone was extremely friendly and kind. Well then, why not 5 stars?\n\nThis is Old Montreal. I want romance, I want rustic, I want Old Montreal. This place lacks that charm. Definitely not romancing the stone hotel here. It's also MASSIVE. With wings and towers making us having to take the elevator down to the ground floor to walk down the hall and grab another elevator to get up to said pool and gym.\n\nWe also had a few technical issues with our room including heat not working, tv not working and there was no remorse from hotel staff. We complained to the manager after we left and were compensated with some Starwood points but, I just felt like we kept calling to the front desk being like now this is wrong, I think a nice touch would be send up some champagne, send us up some macaroons. Do something. That's customer service.\n\nOverall, the price was great and the Starwood points is always a great addition which is a big selling point for my choice in booking a hotel. However, when I come back I may think twice before committing and may see what deals I can scrounge up at the more intimate places.\n\nJust a heads up: I booked on the Westin website and was charged a foreign transaction fee which, I think if you book via Orbitz or hotels.com you may avoid. Just a heads up!
