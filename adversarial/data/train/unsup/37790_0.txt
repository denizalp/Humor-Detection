Stopped in for a bite before the Bonnie Raitt concert. Used a promotion from Palms   - $25 off $75. Its easy to spend $75 here - we were lucky and hit happy hour so our money went a little further. They have a good selection of beers and cocktails. I ordered a Relyx - delicious (and dangerous!) and my husband ordered a dogfish 90-minute. We decided on some oysters, sliders, and the rock shrimp and calamari. All were tasty but nothing very special, not sure I would've paid full price for bar food. The bar is nice, it was full so we sat in the lounge.
