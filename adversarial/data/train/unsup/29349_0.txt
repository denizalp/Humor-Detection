These guys are the bes!  As a local handyman sometimes my customers ask me to take a look at appliances because they know that if they call out an expert the cost goes way up.  Many times the repair is quite simple and only requires a part and a little knowledge to diagnoise the problem and change out the part.  APC has been helping me to help my customers for more than 3 years now.  The will spend however much time is necessare either in person or on the phone to help me figure out what the problem is or what part is needed.  The best part is that they will also tell you when you really need to call someone who knows more than you do to effect the repair.  These are people you can trust and the prices are right.
