I purchased the Groupon for a 2 hour cleaning. It was definitely not worth the $59. I'm giving them two stars based on how nice Jan was on the phone. The maid also seemed very friendly. But, the cleaning job was pretty bad. We were told to leave a list of items that we would like prioritized. I went over the list with the maid. The first thing on the list was to clean the bathrooms. She did not even accomplish this. I also saw that she left my house 10 minutes early. Pretty disappointing.
