Whoaaaa maybe better than Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo!  My party of 8 were very lucky to get a spot for dinner.  They were sold out for dinner on Saturday night and we were on standby.  Only waited 15 minutes!  I think the lady felt sorry because I looked like a sad, starving puppy so she let us in, but split our group in two, which is fine with me!  They have great selections.  Fresh sushi and crab legs!  My favorite was the dessert bar! OMG the ice cream was mad good!! There is always a line here so come early!!
