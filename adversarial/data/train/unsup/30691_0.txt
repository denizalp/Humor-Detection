We happen to be walking around and the area and decided to try this place since we have seen that this place had great reviews. \n\nWe were promptly seated and were given the menu with the specials. After a couple of minutes our waiter came by to take any of our drink or appetizer orders. However after asking him a few questions about the menu, he asked if we wanted to do a tasting menu. He asked us a few more questions about our likes and dislikes. He then said that he would talk to the chef and together they would come up with a menu for us. \n\nThe meal was amazing. Our favorites were the salmon in garlic ponzu and sushi rolls. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great (even though the serving portions were on the small side)\n\nHowever, what really made our night was the service. We never had to ask for anything, the staff was attentive and helpful. We are planning to come back to try more of what the restaurant has to offer.
