This place c ame as a top recommendation from a former Montrealer; I read about it and was a little wary of going to a \"retro lounge\" but took the plunge and headed there one night.\n\nThe decor is actually really neat; it does retro without being corny, and I found myself aweing over their hand chairs, in love with the light fixtures, and captivated over several different items from the bar to the booths to the art. \n\nDrink service was fast, the DJ was playing all the best songs, and the patrons were very social and friendly. I could have gone here everynight I was in Montreal and been happier than a pig in mud.
