Before my favorite churrascaria opened, I used to go here. Although it's cheaper here and they're open for lunch everyday and they have goat cheese at the salad bar, the service and food quality is marginal. \n\nThey have the usual Brazilian BBQ salad bar items such as smoked salmon, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, cheeses, olives, salami, beans and rice etc. They give you pao de queijo, fried bananas and mashed potatoes. The meats include chicken, beef, pork, sausage and lamb. I've tried their Key Lime pie, cheesecake, flan and chocolate mousse all of which were just ok.\n\nThe gaucho guys seem to take longer going around and when I come to a churrascaria, I come famished...waiting cannot happen. They seem careless too. I'd have blood\/ oil\/ meat juice drip next to my plate or my arm! Obrigadinha!\n\nOut of the churrascaria's in Vegas. FdC on Flamingo is #1 on my list, TdB is #2, VB in Summerlin is #3...and that P place in Planet Hollywood? Forget it!
