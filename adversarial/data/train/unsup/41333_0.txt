I had a terrible experience here! First they bring out our drinks. Every single one was wrong! Then our appetizer takes more than 30 minutes to revive. Then our food is brought out, where I ordered beef and receive pork. I'm sorry but that should had never left the kitchen! Then nothing from our meal was compt. Everything that went wrong was their fault! Service was eh. Just no reason to ever go back.
