Hello, the 80s called and they want their grossly gold gilded dated hotel back. The bed seemed perfect until my toe got taught in hole in the fitted sheet. Once I pulled back the covers, I noticed the tan marks on the sheets at the base of the bed. Did housekeeping think we wouldn't see that?!? But nothing tops toe nail clippings on the bathroom floor. Oh wait, the noise from the wall ALL NIGHT long was up there too. When asked to switch to a new room, further from the elevator, I mysteriously got disconnected... twice. Luckily, this was covered by my company. Otherwise, I would have shed tears on the gross sheets over the price.
