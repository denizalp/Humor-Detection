My husband, my daughter, and I ate at SIENNA MERCATO in downtown Pittsburgh, and all there of us ended up getting TERRIBLE FOOD POISENING! We ate in their EMPORIO Restaurant on the first floor. I had the panini sandwich with vegetarian meatballs; my husband had the grinder with vegetarian meatballs; and my daughter had pasta with vegetarian meatballs. The vegetarian meatballs were HARD AS A ROCK AND EXTREMELY DRY! We have had vegetarian meatballs at other restaurants, and they are always moist and delicious. My daughter and my husband both ordered the tomato basil cream sauce, which had absolutely NO CREAM in it at all! It was just plain tomato pasta sauce with dried basil sprinkled on top. Tomato cream sauce is usually pink in color, and you can clearly taste the cream. The mushroom sauce, that I had, tasted like it came from a can. Also, their portions were BEYOND SMALL! That evening, all three of us got food poisoning from their disgusting food, and we spent the entire evening in the bathroom. I can't remember ever getting so sick on food!! Please don't eat here! I don't want anyone to get as sick as we were. I called the next day to let the manager know what happened, and he told me that he was sorry that we got so sick, but there was nothing he could do about refunding our money or compensating us for the bacteria infested food. He also told me that they know that their vegetarian meatballs are hard and dry, because of how they make them. Why in the world would you continue to serve hard, dry meatballs to your customers? Even frozen vegetarian meatballs from the grocery stores are better than the ones Sienna Mercato is serving! We are having my daughter's leftover meatballs tested by the health department to see what type of bacteria caused all of our intestinal problems.
