A rip off. Overpriced and horrible job. I got my hair done there for 500 bucks without the tip. Just to get my hair dyed and trimmed. Was not worth it and they stylist kept answering her phone on the job. Also the guy next to me had his hair trimend and it was 50 dollers without the tip. Should tell you alot right there. It's convient to be open 24\/7 but the prices aren't.
