I have been shopping at this location since I recently moved close by for last 6 months or so. I would normally avoid going to this location due to the poor customer service received in the past however a friendly associate made a huge difference on my shopping experience last night. \nThis place is located in a great location. Store is almost always clean and well stocked.\nAshley offered and helped me with larger items by scanning them in while utilizing the self-service checkout. I am happy to see that she was there to help and assist rather than standing there and not offer any services when I clearly have several large and heavy items in my cart when using the self-service checkout.\nI will definitely start coming back to this location as long as Ashley or someone like her will be there willing to assist me in making my shopping experience more positive. Because of Ashley, I will now give this location a 5 star rating from my shopping trip last night. Thank you Ashley - YOUR AWESOME!!!\n\n(Thank you for reading this review - I am writing reviews of everywhere I eat when I dine out, places I shop, movies I watch and much more. \nStay posted with #ReviewByMariaMescal)
