WHY YOU NO PUT ADEQUATE VENTILATION IN BATHROOM WITH TOILET!??!?!?\n\nSeriously? It seems like every hotel on the strip doesn't have a fan in the bathroom to suck out the smell of shit. If you are in Vegas with a bunch of dudes for a few days, somebody is bound to take a shit soon.\n\nBesides that, I have the Venetian 5 big ones because of the following: beautiful decor, comfortable beds, and every room is a SUITE!!! That last one is crucial. I love having a small living room area where the guys can socialize, drink and be merry. There's also a pull out sofa bed so everybody is comfortable. This place is definitely one of my go-to places in vegas!
