When going to The Keg you pretty much know what to expect. A quality steak...with slightly unadventurous sides. (Read: grilled peppers, asparagus, mashed potatoes etc). \n\nBut the service at this location is Phenomenal! My husband and I come here on a weekly basis because of the great servers! Colin is by far the best! If you go early enough on a Friday you should request his section!  \n\nOkay, back to the food. Over this past year we have had both the \"summer\" menu and the \"winter\" menu items. As I said, the steaks are consistently great! So I'll focus on other items. \n\nOf note: \n\nThe tuna tartar.  AMAZING!  The chunks of tuna are not too large, and always taste properly chilled and fresh. The avocado they use as a base is also fresh and ripe, but doesn't have the \"overly ripe taste\" or the \"green but not ripe crunch\" that avocado can have. Somehow thy get it right consistently. \n\nThe baked Brie: excellent. Served with red pepper jelly and pesto. Tip: ask for the rpj and pesto in ramekins to keep them from spreading on the plate and mixing. \n\nGarlic Bread: self explanatory.  But Delicious!  \n\nMushrooms Neptune: very very rich. If you're ordering this as a starter it might be a good idea to get a salad with your meal to ease up the intensity. \n\nOverall worth the trip and investment!
