Great place in a not so busy area of town and close to our hotel!  Affogato:  liked that they bring the espresso and gelato deconstructed, as with the cafe mocha with the hot chocolate, espresso and dark chocolate sauce in separate vessels for us to combine.  Tried the dark chocolate crepe with bananas and strawberries.  Big crepe and overall well prepared.  Nice atmosphere great location and service and good value for the experience.
