My first time at Steve's Espresso.\n\nI love Steve's!  Cool & funky atmosphere.  Funky music.  Good prices.  Funky barista.  What isn't improved if you rub a little funk on it?  \n\nI had a ham & cheese brioche with my iced decaf.  Surprisingly good!  The filling was nice and not scrimpy.  The pastry pocket was flaky and delicious with a nice rosemary flavor.  Good light lunch!\n\nCan you say free wifi?
