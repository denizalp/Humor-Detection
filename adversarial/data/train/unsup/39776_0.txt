I don't get all the bad reviews! I really enjoyed this place. \n\nI stopped in on a Friday night right before the dinner rush so my wait was short. The cashier was kind and patient as I asked questions and ordered my food. \n\nI ended up going with the ShackBurger and fries with a chocolate milkshake. \n\nThe burger was delicious! It was cooked up hot and fresh and had great flavors. I'd absolutely recommend this! The french fries are crinkle cut and delicious. I enjoyed them plain today but they also offer cheese and bacon which I might try next time! \n\nThe milk shake was so thick and yummy. I added whip cream...because what's a milkshake without it? And it added a nice touch. I'd recommend grabbing a spoon to enjoy it. \n\nI also tried the hotdog with all the fixings. I really enjoyed it. \n\nEverything was delicious! I can't wait to come back. I also can't wait to try using the app and grabbing a mobile order so I don't have to wait in line.
