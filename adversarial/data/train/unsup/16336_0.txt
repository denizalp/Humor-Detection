Surprised I'm the first to write a review on Cable One as I've read online and there are quite a few other customers who are experiencing similar pains.\n\nJust canceled my Cable One \"preferred\" high speed Internet today.  Not because the internet service is bad, no not because of poor customer service, but.. because on their 50mb high speed \"premium\" plan they cap your data usage at 50GB a month and charge you for every GB you go over.\n\nAll we do is watch netflix, hulu and I play an online game to keep in touch with distant friends.  I haven't done any bulk downloads and they've reported 14 days into our billing cycle we had acceded 100% of our usage.  I called customer service over the weekend but their billing department was closed so I had the privilege to talk to a technician.  This is where it gets good!  He completely agrees with me that the plan is bogus, he tells me he uses 6GB a month just on his cell phone alone and that 50GB cap is ridiculous for home Internet usage with today's technologies and streaming content.  He says netflix uses 2gb an hour in HD so if you do the math you can only stream about 20 hours a month and hit your cap without doing much else online.   \n\nOf course he tells me I can... limit my usage, change netflix and hulu settings to lower quality, etc etc.  It feels a lot like I leased a top of the line BMW but they are restricting me to only driving it 100 miles a month and charging me once I go over on milage. Barely enough miles to drive to work let alone do grocery shopping, run errands or heaven forbid go for an enjoyable weekend drive in the counrty!\n\nIf you live in an area that offers Cable One and you utilize services such as netflix, hulu, watch youtube videos, or play online games I highly suggest looking into other providers as you will soon be sorely disappointed.\n\n*** Quick Update ***\n\nSigned up with a \"No Obligation\" month to month deal with CenturyLink for $29.99 for the first year \/ 40MB plan.  There is no cap on the internet and we are seeing true 42MB+ Download and 5MB+ on the Uploads with their VDSL2 service.
