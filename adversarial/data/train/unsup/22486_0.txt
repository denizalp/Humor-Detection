Back in 1994 I went to Summer School at Lorain High.  I would frequent this place.   it's a diamond in the ruff.  Everything is Fresh, Hot, and delish.  I have been to Puerto Rico a few times and know my \"Rican Food\" and this is it baby!\n\n\nRice and beans some Alcapurrias, and fresh bread.  Si Amigo \n\nRainbow Bakery saved my life, well picture a blonde girl in a plaid skirt w\/ penny loafers.  Yep that be me, I was perceived as being square.   Let's just say I had no fighting skills, brass knuckles or razor blades in my coach bag.  But I did have a car and a pocket full of cash.  This is when I met Miss Kiesha.  Now let me tell you about my new found friend.   Our Math teacher Mr. Doinker was terrified of her.  The whole School was in check when Ki Ki walked in.  Girl was like a dude.   Anywho to get to my point I would give Kiesha a ride home from time to time and buy her lunch here.  \n\nLet's just say I was a made girl.  Never had any issues I just had to keep my girl's belly full once in awhile \n\nBueno
