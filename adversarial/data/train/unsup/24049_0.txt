For those who don't know, pizza & a coke\/pepsi is probably my favorite meal of all time! Pizzeria did not fail me =]\n\nAfter we got our hand stamps at Marquee, we were hungry and decided to seek this place. It is a bit difficult to find, we found the pool table but couldn't find Blue Ribbon Sushi =( but we finally found this place when we saw people walking out of a hall way eating pizza, BINGO! \nIt is located near the pool tables, on the 3rd floor to the left of Jaleo's, which is a pretty loud restaurant. Blue Ribbon Sushi was closed, so that made it even harder to find, and also it's not too far from the back entry to Marquee. Hope that helps! Or just be on the lookout for people holding pizza\/pizza boxes =]\n\nI ordered a slice of a pepperoni and sausage pizza, bf ordered pepperoni, sausage, & mushroom pizza, and of course we got a cup of coke, total came out to about $16.\n\nThe pizza is huge (duh it's NY style) & was very satisfying. The crust wasn't as crispy as I'd like but it was still good. \n\nI'd definitely come back here next time I hit up Marquee =) Good luck finding this place!!
