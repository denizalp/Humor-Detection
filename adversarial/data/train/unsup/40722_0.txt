What a lovely little spot for delicious teas and coffee beverages! My friends and I came across this cozy sweet establishment and were immediately greeted by the welcoming girl at the counter on 9\/6\/18 around 1pm. They had so many succulent dessert drinks and teas, we took a moment to analyze their offerings. Our order consisted of an iced matcha tea, watermelon flavored beverage and pistachio delight. The ambiance is pleasant for friends to meet up for a chat and to enjoy an after lunch or dinner drink or dessert after dining somewhere nearby. Furthermore, they have a couple of benches out front when the weather is nice. Please stop by for exceptional service, delectable beverages, savory desserts and a pleasant ambiance. Next time we go, I want to try that gelato coffee item on the menu!
