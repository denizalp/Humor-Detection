First time shopping here, it's a great store with tons of items for every room in the house.  The employees, one girl in particular was very snooty and rude.\n\nWe wanted a c-table and the particular one we wanted they only had one in stock in the back.  Since we were looking for a matching set we asked if we could just purchase the display model. She said no. She said they could order it for us though.  We said ok, she went to the computer seeming very annoyed and came back and said the table is on back order, she did not know when it would come in or if they were even going to get more of them to which I asked them why can't we buy the display model?  \n\nHer response was they had to wait and see if they were going to get more in and if not then they would sell the display model.  I asked if there was anyone who we could ask if buying the display was possible and she said no there are no managers at the store and none were available anywhere to contact.\n\nDisappointed we took the one, I even tried Veterans Day is coming, she just walked away.  At this point I didn't care because she started off with a very negative attitude and my feelings toward the usefulness of this employee were quickly fading.  When we were ready to check out lucky us got the same rude, snooty girl at the register.  Her personality did not change any she became more snooty and rude.\n\nGreat store, bad employee and not helpful at all.
