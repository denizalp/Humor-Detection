When I say \"rip,\" you say \"ples.\"\n\nRIP!\n\nRIIIIIIIIIP!\n\nOkay, that didn't work, but the very least you can do is stop by for a cone. Or a cup. Or a shake. Ohhhhh, yeah do that. The shakes here melt in your mouth! I know, I know... that's what their SUPPOSED to do. But even if these shakes were frozen solid or sealed in concrete, they'd still melt in your mouth. \n\nThe summer is still here, so take advantage and go visit Ripples.
