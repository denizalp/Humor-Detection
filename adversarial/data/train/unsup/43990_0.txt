This place is 0 for 3 with me. The service here is terrible. It's a nice space, but they haven't quite figured out what they want to be.The fact that you can walk right in here before a downtown event while all the other establishments have long waits should tell you something. Too much competition downtown now to put up with attitude and bad service.
