Went for brunch yesterday. Took some friends from out of town. The food here used to be interesting and good and it has gone seriously downhill. We went around 12:30 after there being a 45 minute wait a couple doors down at Moo&Brew.\nThere were only two seated tables in the restaurant and one person working both the bar and floor. I guess that is telling of how business is going, unfortunately. The server was kind but not very knowledgeable. They were also out of a few things.\n\nI ordered a house salad with steak and it was so gross. The steak was chewy and thin and the salad looked was very watery and full of chopped red onions and big chunks of carrots. I was seriously beyond disappointed. The kids flat bread pizza was gross. You know if a kid won't eat bread with cheese on it, something is wrong.\n\nApparently the burgers were pretty good, but the Parmesan Fries were lackluster.\nDoubt we will return
