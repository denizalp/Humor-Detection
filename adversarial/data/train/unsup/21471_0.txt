Go family style or go home!  \n\nI think I'm still full and it's the day after.  Plus there's food in the fridge so I'm already pre-full just thinking about lunch!  That's what happens when you do the family style.  \n\nFamily Style includes a starter of papaya salad, tom yum soup, spring rolls and two entrees.  Each comes with a big ol' spoon for you to dish huge heaping quantities on you and your friends\/families plates.  It's the perfect way to try many things on the menu but not have a horrendous bill, in fact, it's only $18 and I guarantee it's worth the money.\n\nThe papaya salad is bright and perfect for the summer, the tom yum had shrimp and mushrooms that helped mitigate the clean spicy soup and the spring rolls were to die for (although, I am pretty sure that typically spring rolls aren't fried?  Not like I'm complaining...).  For our two entrees we ordered the avacado curry and the pad thai.  Both...awesome.  \n\nFavorite drinks btw: Shanghai Redux and the Lychee Mochito.  \n\nSo okay, what have we learned here kids?  Bac is great but order family style!  You'd order that stuff off the menu anyway but it ends up being a great price for a great meal.  Got that?  Cool.
