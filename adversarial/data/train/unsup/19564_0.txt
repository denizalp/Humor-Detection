Great place for Mexican Baked Goods (Pan Dulce). They have cochitos, churros, zinger rolls, Mexican wedding cookies, empanadas, and several other festive pastries.  I like to drop in on my way to the office when I'm feeling nice and want to treat my co-workers to a little culture. Unlike bagels and store bought doughnuts, these treats are always gone by mid morning and that's how I like it.  Also good for a hearty breakfast burrito.  Try the Chorizo, Potato, Bean and Egg 4-way. Que Bueno!  I can't vouch for any of the lunch\/dinner combo meals but will return for the baked goods and burritos.
