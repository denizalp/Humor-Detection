Just skimming through some of the reviews I saw that: \n\n-All people went for dinner\n-A lot of people like the decor\n-Most people liked the crab legs\/seafood\n-Some people were not impressed with the decor or the crab legs\/seafood\n-No one went here for breakfast.\n\nWell, guess what? I did. So did they have the run-of-the-mill Hashbrowns, breakfast sausage, bacon, ham and all you can drink orange juice? Of course. Did they have the tell'em to make whatever you want Omelette station? Yup. What about a variety of coffee and pancakes & French toast? C'mon, isn't that expected? So, you're probably thinking: WTF, Shannon? What's with the 5 stars???\n\nSmoked Bacon. Yeah, I know. \n\nNo, it's not \"Thick sliced Applewood, peppered, pan fried in it's own grease bacon\". Just a big slab of pork belly, SMOKED. And waiting for you under the heat lamp at the carving station. I don't know about you but I've NEVER seen that. Big deal, right? Smoked bacon...so what? Well, next time you go to Vegas and aren't hungover enough to wake up right before dinner, roll out of bed early and go to Studio B Buffet at the M Resort. Go pay your $16 or whatever it is and go straight to that carving station. We'll see how unimpressed you are then. Smoked f*cking Bacon. \n\nOh and when you go, tell 'em Shannon sent you...\n\nNo, they won't know who the hell I am but just do it anyways. For laughs...
