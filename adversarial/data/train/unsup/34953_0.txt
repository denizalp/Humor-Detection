First time dining here and I loved it!  Awesome menu variety...can't go wrong with good ol' heartwarming breakfast food.  Pretty much like Cora's (with fruit decor all all) but without the hefty price tag.  Ordered poached eggs with French toast, home fries and buttered toast and happily devoured it!  Coffee was steadily refilled.  Waitress was quick and friendly, despite the heavy Sunday brunch crowd.  Was totally impressed with my first time here and will return to slowly try out the other menu items...great to pair with mall shopping!
