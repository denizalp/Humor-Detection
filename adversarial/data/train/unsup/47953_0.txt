So much for me not reviewing chains, but I felt a little shout-out to this Shomar's was in order.  I'll note from the outset that I have ordered the same thing every time I've been here, so the scope of my review is slightly limited.\n\nI have worked near this place for over 2 1\/2 years but always thought it looked a little dodgy and never went in. Decided to give this place a shot the other day. Turns out, it is quite nice inside although it has a slightly 80s feel to it.  I've only gotten take-out at this location, but it was pretty fast both times.  I ordered the grilled chicken pita with a side of green beans.  Both were delicious--so much so, that I went back the next day and ordered the same thing.  The pita is a little soggy (at least, it is when you get it to-go), but the chicken is nicely grilled and the tzatziki sauce is also tasty.  And while green beans sound super-boring, they must jazz it up with some spices because they were quite delicious.  \n\nIf I ever venture off this recipe for success, I'll update accordingly.
