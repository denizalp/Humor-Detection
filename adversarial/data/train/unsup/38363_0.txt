I had been reading the reviews and wanted to give this place a try. I am glad we did. The staff working there are very welcoming. Make you feel right at home. I honestly do not know alot about Hawaiian food. I was eager to try. \nAs a person allergic to pork, :( there were a few chicken and beef options.. \nI did make an excellent choice, I had the short ribs. They were delicious. I chose the side of mac salad and the fried noodles. I did not realize when I ordered it had pork in it. I found out I can order the noodles without pork and will do so on my next visit. \nMy DH had the fried chicken. He loved it. The chicken had great flavor, super crispy, crunchy and fell off the bone. We also ordered the waffle fries. They were the star of the show. Perfectly seasoned, and crunchy. It was gone in seconds. \nThe restaurant is spotless. The portions generous. The prices very reasonable.\nThe two suggestions I have is bigger plates, for these huge and generous portions, and a steak knife. \nWe will be back. \nI hope I do not jinx this place as I have to Bona, Carlos Kitchen, and Paparazzi Grill. I am running out of places to go with good food on this side of town.
