Superb. And the low price borders on outright petty larceny.\n\nI've ducked into this venue on-impulse several times now. I've discovered these places work a bit different than they do back East. The massage areas tend to be mostly 'communal,' one bed right next to the other ... as opposed to me being used to being shuttled into a singular area with at least folding room dividers or sheer drapery to privatize it somewhat.\n\nSince every customer is zoned out into their happy place, I don't suppose it really matters that much.\n\nIt must be that, because they can squeeze so many customers into such a relatively small square footage ... that is what keeps the rent down ... and the prices low.\n\nOne hour here, about half foot reflexology, the other half full body massage, is priced at $20. I mean you can skip-by Chipolte or Five Guys, fix a cold-cut sandwich at home, then blow the money on this joint! What a no-brainer.\n\nIt's pretty clear they are expecting at least a $10 tip on top of the base price. I suppose making the techs rely on tips (versus more so relying on a cut-of-the-door, so to speak) keeps them motivated to do good work. That's a win-win!\n\nThe foot treatment is on-point. Digging in with those knuckles and loosening everything up. It certainly passed my \"snore-snore-oh-is-that-over\" test. \n\nAnd my techs (each was male) have employed some serious muscle a\/o weight into the body massage. I was merely a sack of bones when I left. And I noticed the petite female techs actually walking single-footed over their clients to ensure similar effect. And whadddayaknow I thought that was just some kind of visual cliche from the movies.\n\nAs long as you aren't squeamish about the lack of privacy, you can drop in here inexpensively and let them just melt your worry out of your mind. \n\nFor an hour, at least.
