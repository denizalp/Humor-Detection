How do you ever give a rescue mission any less than 5 stars? Quick answer...you don't.  But if I could give the Las Vegas Rescue Mission more than 5 stars, I would.  The Las Vegas Rescue Mission has to be one of the most organized rescue missions that I have ever been a part of. I've donated some of my time giving back to shelters and rescue missions in San Diego and in Los Angeles.  Both those areas are big and sometimes disorganized.  Here at the LV Rescue Mission, I was quite impressed with how organized the staff was.  You're given an quick orientation when you start, then they assign a job for you.  We worked dinner service and the jobs ranged from the food assembly line, meal counter, bus tables, trash duties, in the kitchen, or dish washer. I had trash service and absolutely loved it. Trust me, this is the job you want to be assigned to. This one of the few jobs where you get to meet and socialize with people that you just served dinner to. \n\nI'm not about to imply that I'm a saint. In fact, there's a lot more that I could do to help our community. When I have an opportunity, I will do my part. \n\n\nThe Starfish Story\nA young girl was walking along a beach upon which thousands of starfish had been washed up during a terrible storm. When she came to each starfish, she would pick it up, and throw it back into the ocean. People watched her with amusement.\n \nShe had been doing this for some time when a man approached her and said, \"Little girl, why are you doing this? Look at this beach! You can't save all these starfish. You can't begin to make a difference!\"\n \nThe girl seemed crushed, suddenly deflated. But after a few moments, she bent down, picked up another starfish, and hurled it as far as she could into the ocean. Then she looked up at the man and replied,\n \n\"Well, I made a difference to that one!\"\n \n-Adaption of \"The Star Thrower\" by Loren Eiseley.  You too can make a difference.\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (405\/500)
