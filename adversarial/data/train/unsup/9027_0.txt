Love the simplicity of selecting a car and driving off. No lines or fuss. The value proposition is getting minimized by their rates and nickel and dime . While checking out the booth arttendant actually apologized for the lengthy sales pitch. The latest was $6 a day for serious radio which has always been free. That's a new hidden 10% plus charge . Service always great but getting close to switching due to high rates.
