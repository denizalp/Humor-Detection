The great thing about The Foxes Den is consistency.  Lots of screens to watch the game.  The quality of the food is always amazing.  The staff are incredible. And Honestly, the people are pretty great too.\n\nThis is the bar you throw up when no one can think of something to do, and everyone always goes, ya, it's always a good time. let's do that.\n\nAlso, one time, we stepped in to the Twilight Zone here.  Now, I'm not bragging or anything, but I'm not the ugliest dude on the planet.  But that night, I was.  It was like HOT GUY\/GAL CENTRAL!  Couldn't believe this little hole in the wall off Bay street was hosting the likes of the cutest of the cute.  Very Outer Limits.\n\nAnyways, if you're looking for somewhere consistent, this is the place to go!
