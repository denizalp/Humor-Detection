Finally, someone amazing and affordable in Vegas. This salon is wonderful. The owner is super talented and has quite a personality. She is authentic and funny! She does amazing hair and I will be back; will also bring family here. Her assistant is pretty awesome also, he is friendly, fun, and attentive! I really like this place... my hair color and cut looks awesome (as did the other two people's who were in there when I walked in) and it's a nice vibe they have going! My only regret is that I didn't find them sooner!
