Crab claws, prime rib, shrimp, tasty soups, this buffet has it all. It has to be impossible to go here and not find more than a few things you'll love.\n\nMy only minor complaint was the lighting. Super bright lights bring me back to my cafeteria days. I don't want to be reminded of elementary school cafeterias while having duck or lobster. It just isn't quite right. \n\nOther than that, I would certainly recommend this place especially if you're traveling with a group of picky eaters or have a few who are indecisive. Problem solved. Something for everyone.
