I think we should start by just acknowledging that this place has three floors catering to three different menus and Italian based food. Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time for work we ran in there starving after hearing great reviews. We couldn't even make it to the second floor so we stuck to meatballs and boy we're we not disappointed \n\nFood: my coworker and I got fried pickles and a salad to start. I'm a lover of fried pickles and boy was I not let down by taste and portion size - let's top it off with their bacon ranch dipping sauce. I then got the saucy classic balls with their crack sauce (ranch and buffalo mixed together) over mashed potatoes. I think I saw heaven for a split second. My coworker got the saucy chicken balls with the spicy sauce over Brussels. She's not a huge meat eater but she consumed the whole thing in seconds, i'd say that's a good sign. \n\nService: For how busy this restaurant was I'd say service was pretty fast. \n\nAtmosphere: the main floor was definitely pretty loud since there was a game going on. \n\nI'd definitely go back there just to try out the second floor pasta and see the third floor rooftop. Go Pittsburgh Go!
