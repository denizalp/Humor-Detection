UPDATE at end of this review! Be sure to read the whole review!\n\nWe had been having problems with an AC unit on our 2011 Tiffin Phaeton. The circuit breaker kept popping with the high heat. We had another service company come that thought it was the circuit breaker overheating and replaced the circuit breaker. However, the problem continued.\n\nWe saw the ad for Busted Knuckle in the Oasis Las Vegas RV Park brochure and they were recommended by the guy that made the first service call.\n\nJohn came by the next morning and looked at the circuit breakers and then went on the roof to check out the unit. Said the whole unit needed to be replaced. But, they could not find a unit as they are on National Back-order.\n\nCame by today to collect for his service call. Cost $225 to have him come out and look for 30 minutes or less.\n\nMy fault for not asking what it would cost to just look at it. I was shocked at the service call price. Especially when they did nothing for me.\n\nThe guy that came out and spent an hour and replaced 2 circuit breakers only charged $135.00 including the breakers.\n\nBe an informed consumer!\n\n\nUPDATE!!!!!!\n\n2 weeks after the fact and having the AC unit checked out here in Phoenix I had occasion to contact John. We discussed the situation and the diagnosis on the unit. John was very professional and suggested an accommodation and reduction to my bill.\n\nThis says a lot about the way he does business! Thanks John!!! With this type of response, I would highly recommend travelers in your area give you a try.
