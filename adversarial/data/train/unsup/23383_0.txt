Eating at Prime is one of my favorite steak dining experiences....Predisposed with a warmly lit restaurant which faces the Bellagio fountains helps with that experience and really makes it special.  Every 15 minutes or so, you'll get a glimpse of the show and really creates a relaxing, decadent ambiance.  The table service \/ waiters, for the most part, are professional and up to par in fine dining service.  \n\nI've had some outstanding meals here...the best ones included the Seafood Tower which included fresh oysters, gargantuan crab legs, huge prawns\/shrimp, and lobster claws - all accompanied with all the dipping sauces.   As for the meal, I go for the New York strip as is my favorite cut, and sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes are never-miss choices.  I just love the whole experience from soup to nuts.   A great one to put on your bucket list if you're looking for a high-end steak house while in Vegas.
