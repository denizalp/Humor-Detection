A few pluses but many more minuses here.  \n\nI'll start with the pluses:\n\n+I was able to make reservations for ahead of time\n\n+not far from subway\n\n+was able to get separate bills at large party table\n\nMinuses:\n\n-WAY too much sauce for chicken.  WAY too much is an understatement to the point that they might as well submerged the wings in a bowl of sauce and let us fish them out.  To me the key thing about KFC is the fact that the batter is LIGHT and CRISPY\/CRUNCHY.  You completely lose all of that or it won't matter if the chicken is completely wet and surrounded by sauce for any length of time.  Every piece I grabbed was dripping sauce off of it.\n\n-environment was not very comfortable.  I felt warm inside this place like we were eating outside or something.  AC goes a long way that or some fresh air if the night was nice enough.  It was too warm inside with no fresh or cool air at all.\n\n-our server... where was\/were he\/them?  We had a large party and we had to flag them down for more water or other drinks.  With so much sauce you'd need napkins yes?  Somebody had to go up to the counter and ask for them.  Even wanting to pay and leave we had to ask them to come back and bring us the bills.  \n\n-NO wetnaps.  You serve some of the sauciest chicken I've ever witnessed in person and you don't have anything to help clean off?  I had to go to the restroom just to get unsticky and wash off.\n\n-DID NOT give me what I had ordered.  I had ordered 2 dishes the first being chicken with green onion on top and the second being a large order of spicy chicken wings and received a large order of spicy whole chicken.  The server even knew it and and they made a mistake but was giving it to me as if they couldn't make wings instead.  I said I'd take it since I didn't want it to go to waste but I wasn't happy for them basically trying to persuade me to take something I didn't ask for.\n\n-NO GARLIC SOY chicken at all.  The most confusing menu I've ever seen.  It's easier when you have photos like on their online website.  I had ordered off of that only to have the server tell me they don't have any garlic soy.  Strange and disappointing at the same time.\n\nWhile the food was semi-OK the service was anything but.  My first dish I received which was the chicken with green onion on top in a lemon mustard sauce.  It was completely covered with onion so much I couldn't even see where the chicken was or how much chicken I actually had beneath.  I didn't count the pieces, I couldn't see them!  There was however a HUGE pool of sauce underneath which was so unappetizing to look at afterwards I actually had to cover it so I didn't have to see it.  The taste was good, but the chicken was in there somewhere, drowned in sauce.\n\nMy second dish which I had asked for was fried spicy chicken (large wing order).  Instead of bringing me what I had actually ordered the server brought a whole chicken (fried spicy) and told me they had made a mistake but was giving it to me as if it's ok to make such a mistake.  I had really wanted wings since I already had a whole fried chicken in the previous order.  I don't know what I was charged exactly.  I couldn't read the receipt because the line items were in Korean.  \n\nI left 55 dollars for a 45 dollar bill.  I wanted to tip properly but I have to say the service was not so on the ball, giving me what I didn't order wasn't cool and the overkill of the sauce really ruined it not to mention they didn't even have garlic soy which is what I really wanted to get.  \n\nIf you're going to eat here I'd suggest either getting dry wings or specifically ask for your chicken to have sauce on the side.  They use too much sauce to the point that picking it up will cause it to drip.  I only ordered chicken and nothing else.  Chances are some of the other dishes especially rice or other things could be better.  \n\nBottom line, way too much sauce, non attentive service, not very comfortable inside.  As far as KFC goes they aren't the worst I've had in the city but overkill on the sauce makes them a very close second to worst.
