I hesitate to review because I hesitate to relive the experience, but...\n\nProp up your silicone and enjoy the hot mess that is Jackrabbit.\n\nThe 'stars that could have been' breakdown (in chronological order of the evening...):\n\n#1) Nothing says classy VIP and bottle service like faux-strippers...\n\n#2) Everyone loves a Mr. Ed smile on a server right? (just go, you'll see...)\n\n#3) Is that a man or a woman?...Best shimmy spotting evah. (ladies, really? come on)\n\n#4) MILF's livin' the dream...need I say more?\n\n#5) You mean Astroglide doesn't count as lip-gloss?...square.\n\nNo, seriously, one star because I L'dMFAO...\nIf, however, you are planning on leaving your \"make-the-best-of-it\" attitude at home...I'd suggest another venue.
