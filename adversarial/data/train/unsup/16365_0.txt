You can check waiting times for the DMV online. This location is pretty large inside. Lots of windows and employees working at them. My best advice is to get there EXTRA EARLY (8-8:30am) or CHECK ONLINE to see which one is the least busy before going. \n\nPROS: Checking online the waits\n             No waiting at 8:23am\n             The lady who helped me.\n\nCONS: The two miserable people working the photos. They are JADED.\n             Not knowing what your picture looks like until it arrives at your house.
