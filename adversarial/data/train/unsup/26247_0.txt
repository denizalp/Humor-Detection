This Guy has been in plenty of kitchens around the US soaking up recipes.  I sort of have high expectations but currently I'm sipping this cucumelon martini and its superb!\n\nSo my food is here my hubby ordered the Mac n cheese burger and brisket nachos too late for me so I shared with him.  The nachos had an excellent flavor fresh tortilla chips, and beef brisket. Only thing is some of the pieces of brisket were over cooked and dry, because they are nachos you have all of these flavors disguising the most important thing the meat. They weren't terrible, just a few pieces were dry and tough. But the sauce amazing I guess that's why he's packaged it. Now this burger was a whopper elbow macaroni, bacon, crispy fried onion rings. Excellent flavor, taste like it was cooked on a barbecue grill. Really great flavor, so overall not bad. Would go back
