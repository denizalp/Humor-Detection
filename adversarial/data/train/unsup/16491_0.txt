The fact that I cannot even seem to get into the place at lunch makes me really want to give them less than 5 stars.  At least 75% of the time, I have to go somewhere else because I can't spend my limited allotment of lunch break just standing around drooling.\n\nBut the place is undeniable.  Their burnt ends are a revelation.  I could eat the Carolina Red sauce with a spoon.  In a moment of semi-health consciousness, I ordered the applesauce, and even that knocked my socks off... literally.  I spent 35 minutes trying to fish them out from under my table.\n\nI am so tempted to give the place 1 star and tell the rest of you yokels to go eat somewhere else.  For goodness sake, let me have a lunch here every once in a blue moon.  But I cannot do that for it would be a fib.\n\nInstead, I'll just be THAT guy standing over by the door... looking over your shoulder... and trying to use my powers of telepathy to get you to eat and leave sooner so I can sit down.
