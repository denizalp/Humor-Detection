Food looks smells and tastes great. The service is great, and the prices are great. The portions are great. And for some reason this place reminds me of living in NYC. Anyway, I've been to this place 3 times already in the past 2 weeks. It's now my go-to for lunch on days i work from home.\nSo far I've tried the lamb philly, the fries, lamb shank, yellow rice, plantain soup, and felafel.
