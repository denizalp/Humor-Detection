I came in with my 20% off coupon and found the display item for a trailer hitch cargo carrier, good deal with the discount!\nI took the stock card out of the holder and went to the cashier, apparently they won't ring up your item until they find it in the warehouse, so I stepped aside and waited.\n10 minutes go by and the cashier is telling me they will bring it out soon, then more waiting....20 minutes, no response from the warehouse....Then over 1\/2 hour and the cashier asks if I still want the item.\nWhat???? Really???! \nI can see the terminal on the cashier's display and it said they had 3 in stock.\nThen finally the cashier says they don't have it and I said why did I wait to long to find that out and I asked to speak to a manager.\nTo make a long story short, I walked out without anything except 45 minutes of my day wasted! The manager says to me, \"Have a good day\" and I don't take that in a good sincere way, I take it as, \"get the hell out of my store\" if you know what I mean.\n\nI will now shop at the store on Sunset, it's miles away from my house, but at least they know what they are doing over there.\nLike most places this store was great when they first opened, but now those people that worked here have moved on and I will not shop here ever again!
