We have been long time members now, and we have not added a review previously.  Not for any reason other than the Science center just does it right.  That being said the recent addition of the CREATE building with a heavy focus on s.t.e.a.m. And interactive units is amazing.  But the real trigger in my review today was the temporary installment of Dinosaurs in Motion, by John Payne.  The displays are absolutely intriguing with all the reclaimed machinery and metal fused into intricate life size, yes LIFE-SIZE dimosaurs.  And if that were not enough, they are interactive.  Using diverse mechanics from kinetic springs and counterweights to complex servos and reclaimed wi-fi video game controllers.  And everything in between.  Take the time to study the plaques in each display the information and story behind his creations and inspiration help draw a connection to the art.  I have taken my kids to many past temporary exhibits, and this by far is our favorite.
