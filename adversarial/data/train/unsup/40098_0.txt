No, no, pay more stay somewhere else. Flight delay caused miss connection. Ended up here. This is NOT a hotel vibe at all. Think motel. Outdoor exterior doors. No spa. They will call someone to you room, hmmm.. happy ending?  What kind of place did I get? Furniture worn, ceiling peeling from water damage. Carpet worn. Needs a facelift for sure. Front desk girl was friendly. I checked out as quick as I could that same night. Strong air freshener covers up musty smell, a plus. But would never recommend. Driver friendly. But motel rooms used and worn, think motel 6. Tops.\n\nAlso, I found this MOTEL on expedia, very misleading. Should have checked out Yelp, my fellow yelpers are spot on with the majority star rating given.
