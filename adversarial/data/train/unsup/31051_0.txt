I'm the Program Chair for the Az Museum of Natural History and we used  Wandering Donkey to cater one of our largest yearly events. They did an extraordinary job. The food was amazing, for the time in the history of this event we had NO negative feedback from customers or staff on the food choices. The service was wonderful. Thank you Lance and Beth for a great experience.
