Note: I forgot to take down their hours, but I do know that they were open until 9 P.M. And we barely got in under the wire last night. \n\nKay's being more supportive than skeptical or cynical about my Yelp activities (fixation?) of late and suggested we hit Moe's on the way back to her abode since it remained unreviewed. \n\nI know. She's comin' around. \n\nI really knew nothing about this chain, assuming that it was akin to Chi Chi's.\n\nNah. Think Subway meets TGI Fridays meets Taco Bell. Yeah.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no. C'mon. Don't walk away from me. Please.\n\nWe walk in and a chipper, supra-motivated 20-something bellows to us \"WELCOME TO MOOOOOE'S\" in life-is-good, kick-ass fashion. He then proceeded to explain the menu to us (Kay's had been here before, I hadn't) as a slew of fixing lay in front of him behind glass. Portraits of ordinary people who resemble deceased, famed musicians hang on the walls. That's there the TGI influence comes into play. \n\nI tell the kid I want a beef burrito with everything since that's the way I like to rock and roll. \n\n\"OH, you want a Homewrecker,\" he tells me with an excited grin on his face, rubbing his palms together as if he's gonna build a fire via pure friction. \n\nAnd everything was what I got, masterfully wrapped up in a beach towel of a flour tortilla. Bacon, olives, guac, onion, cucumber.\n\nYes, cucumber, artfully cut I might add. Yeah, verrry Subway. \n\nI cannot emphasize enough how adeptly engineered this burrito was. Nothing burst out from the ends of it. Everything stayed inside this burrito despite it being stuffed with ground beef, rice, and uncounted other garnishes. I mean, this was as cornucopian as Thommy Friedman sans the wide-eyed glee over globalization and fatuous metaphors and analogies. I mean, if Friedman's ideas had as much meat as a Homewrecker Burrito from Moe's (not to mention an air of peace and justice) I might climb aboard his intellectual bus. \n\nAs advertised, we got free chips and fresh salsa in various flavors (can't recall the names) of red and green with our respective meal (Kay got a fish taco with a cinematic hoot of a name). I covered my chips in X-Mas time style and found both soupy, somewhat chunky salsas to be a cut above canned, Moe's purporting to make their own, the author being inclined to believe it.\n\nOh get this, Moe's also claims to offer sustainable fast-food... \n\nhttp:\/\/moes.com\/mission\n\nThey have tofu??? Equally impressive and refreshing is their aversion to microwaves and freezers. The Fresh Food Revolt is spreading.\n\nI'll knock off a star for their cookies (again, how Subway) which tasted like the kind you'd find at a supermarket bakery (geez, score one for Subway for having better cookies). \n\nBut I'll return one (I won't give them more than 4 stars) for Moe's enthusiastic service and fun, hip, relaxed, upscale cafeteria atmosphere\/concept.
