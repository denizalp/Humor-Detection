Located on the Corner of Stephanie and Warm springs is Sprouts.\n\nFirst of all,\npacked parking lot.\npacked. Tons of people.\nTons of people with their terrible driving and parking skills.\n\nIt's so funny to me that the people who shop here, you know, the ones that are sooooooo totes compassionate about the earth, and whatever else they talk about...are complete jerks.\n\nYou get in, and about 90% of the people think that this is their own personal store. Carts not pulled close to them, so like...when I want to look at cheese, I have to try and move myself, along with my cart (because it has my daughter in it) and try to squeeze between this person and their cart. And do they move it...? NO.\n\nOnly one staff member even looked at me while I was there, when I asked where their juice selection was.... There, I found juices, that were mostly from \"concentrate\". What happened to just regular old juice? So, I pick my concentrated juice, ($5) and keep on looking. \n\nThey did have okay selection of produce, but like another reviewer said, there is only one table that has all the green organic stickers on it. I did find a decent selection of bell peppers. But other than that, I just still feel that this place is too over priced. I mean, they want almost $7 for white vinegar. So, if your kids have the volcano baking soda science project, don't come here. Go anywhere else normal, and spend $2 for the exact same thing. \n\n32 items comes to $100. So, about $3.12 an item. I just don't find that these prices, mixed in with the crowd, and the unfriendly staff really go together. That's just my opinion.
