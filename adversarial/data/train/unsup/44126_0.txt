This rating is for the burgers only, as neither my girlfriend nor I had the steak (as tempted as we were though).  \n\nOUTSTANDING burger - just amazing.  Honestly, in the top 3 burgers I've had in my life.  Quality ingredients with the right spices (aka not too much salt like so many places) made this a memorable burger.  I asked for it to be cooked medium and they delivered - and scored!
