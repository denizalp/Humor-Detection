RED CARPET FLAIR and sub-zero cool!\n\nWe just returned from the 2008 Dam Short Film Festival in Boulder City, Nevada - the brain child of The Dam Short Film Society.  Over 100 curated shorts played in about 3 days at the historic Boulder Theater.  This was a fun quirky event built around the mystique of Hoover Dam (just minutes away).  \n\nThese guys know good entertainment.  The film slate was varied and entertaining.  The festival parties were hopping and filmmakers were spoiled.  The Gala screenings commenced with a red-carpet limo arrival of visiting filmmakers.  A fantastic silent auction peddled both kitschy and decadent items.\n\nAll of this set amongst the turn-back-the-clock charm of Boulder City.  This is a must-do for 2009.
