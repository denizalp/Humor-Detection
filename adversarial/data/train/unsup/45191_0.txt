My boyfriend and I have gone in here twice now and will never return... The first time we came in the wings were  cold the manager came and said he tempt them they came out at a temperature of 145 if you know food chicken needs to be cooked to 165. We left unhappy and hungry ... Went back a few months later walked in at 945 and said the kitchen was closed and they couldn't serve us.. Weird since the door and online say you close at 11 . If you changed your hours change your website... Will not be returning.
