Our group came to Central Diner based on the recommendation of our local colleagues.  We had a very productive, but super long day involving lots of driving and visiting facilities.  Doing some additional work for a few hours back at the hotel and I was getting slightly hangry and irritable at 830pm EST.  \n\nIt is impossible to leave Central Dinner hungry - just looking at the desserts display will put Cheesecake Factory to shame.  The restaurant feels like an upscale version of Denny's, except imagine the menu expanded to include Seafood, Greek, and Italian cuisine.  The portion sizes are among the largest I've seen at any restaurant, and at rock-bottom prices.  Overall: 3 stars - food was good, but not spectacular.  Definitely quantity over quality here.\n\nI ordered:\n\n1. Spanakopita Appetizer: Flakey, decent, but wished it was warmer.  Gigantic for an appetizer.  One of my vegetarian coworkers got the entree version which turned out to be 3x the size (I expected 2x) of mine.\n\n2. Italian Wedding Soup: This came as a free side dish with entree.  Pretty good - can't go wrong with meatball soup.\n\n3. Grilled Chicken Plate: Gigantic, so large I could not finish all the carbs.  Chicken white meat grilled and seasoned perfectly and paired with grilled onions and bell peppers on top a huge 6\" diameter flatbread.  Then next to it, a gigantic portion of rice pilaf.  The food was good but overwhelming.\n\nA good place for dinner as they open late.  Maybe best to order just one item each here: appetizer, entree, or dessert since everything is massive here.
