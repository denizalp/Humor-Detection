the only place near our hotel that had availability of walk in clients who wanted to get their manicure and pedicure done. \nso we were please with that. \nI went with one of my brother gf...while in Vegas, we wanted to spoil our self a little bit and get our nails done.  \nAll I wanted to get my feet rub, get rid of dead skins and make it smooth again.\nHEY I ROLLER SKATE I need this in my life =]\nThe lady who did our nails n toe nails (forgot her name) she was pleasant. Great person to have a conversation with. There wasn't a dull moment. \nOverall though, she did an amazing job. If I lived in Vegas, I would go back to her.
