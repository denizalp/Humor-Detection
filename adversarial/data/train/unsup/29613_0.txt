We were initially disappointed with the service here. New to McCarran rent a car, we did not know that we could go downstairs for the priority service. So we waited upstairs for 25 minutes to learn that. However, our frustration was short lived when we got to Liz in the priority area! She was efficient, personable and very helpful!! Go Liz!!!
