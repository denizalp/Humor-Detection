I stop in here from time to time for sliced deli meat, bread, and pastries. There has never been a time when it was not reasonably priced and delicious. Some of the great things about this place include....\n\n1. It has a well-stocked variety of choices. You could stop in here for breakfast, lunch, or an early dinner.\n2. They have fresh meats that they will slice for you. They will make a sandwich while you wait.\n3. You can get a whole fruit pie here for around 5$!!\n4. They will slice bread for you on this cool slicer that sits by the window.\n5. The cinnamon rolls are amazing!!!\n6. Free smells!\n7. And even though I don't love olives, they have a nice olive bar.
