Paying for table service is the equivalent of paying for real estate at a club. It's not so much about the bottle service and the drinks as it is the convenience of having a place to call your own for the night. Being able to sit is a luxury one must pay for nowadays...it's one I've never paid for but often enjoyed...ahhh I love vegas, it's all about who you know. \n\nWe celebrated my bff's bday at Drai's and pink bubbly with strawberries were what we had on deck. It was so girly and pretty! I loved watching the sexy ladies and gentlemen come by to check up on us and pour our drinks. Clap! Clap! Service! \n\nWhen it was time to dance, I climbed up behind the seats of our booth and precariously twerked on that tiny dance space in sky high heels. It's a talent that I've cultivated throughout the years. Woot! Woot! Boom chica chica! Love the birds eye view of everyone having a blast.\n\nThe central dance floor of Drai's reminded me of the set up at the The Marquee, but a bit larger. There is a stage with the Dj and dancers. The place doesn't fill up till about 1:30am and you can party till 5 in the morning. Nothing really distinguishes Drai's from the other nightclubs. It's just a bigger, newer version of the standards, but since this is one of the hottest clubs it's filled with some pretty cool peeps and that's what makes it fun.
