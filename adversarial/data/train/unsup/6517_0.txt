I know how crazy I might look for giving Supercuts 5 stars.  But I've frequented this location numerous times and the staff is always very friendly and I always get the simple cut I want.  I've never had a long wait and if I think they might be busy, they offer a call ahead service.  Prices can't be beat.\n\nIf you're in a rush and need a good cut fast, hit up this Supercuts.  For reals.
