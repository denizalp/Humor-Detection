Why I love Naked Sushi: A Review\nBy Jessica M.\n\nNaked Sushi, you complete me. Our love affair begin in March for my BFFs birthday. We got there at 10PM (when Happy Hour starts). We order a bunch of different apps that were so reasonably priced. I'll admit, I was nervous with the prices, but Naked Fish, you did not disappoint.\n\nThere are several rolls on their Happy Hour menu, some as cheap as $3! Re-DONK-ulous and the most expensive is around $7. Not. Shabby. At. All. \n\nThe restuarant is small, dimly lit, and intimate. (Last I checked there was a breif close for remodeling)\n\nThe sushi chefs are willing to accomidate any request. I've even created rolls all of my own and they have accomidated.\n\nThe green tea isn't that great, they use matcha powder, similar to what we used for green tea frappuccinos at Starbucks.\n\nThis place hits the spot after a night of drinking and dancing. They are open until 2 AM. And they are just as friendly and accomidating to guests at 1 AM as they are at 7 PM.\n\nAll in all, Naked Fish, is the business. Definitely check it out if you are in the neighborhood. It's yum to the yum yum yummy!
