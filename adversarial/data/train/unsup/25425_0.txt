I choice red ribbon to get my birthday cake this year. They have a wide variety of flavors to suit everyone's taste. My favorite is the mocha cake. I totally recommend the ube coconut cake. It is sooo divine. Dont forget to pick up some cheesy mamon or the creamy ensaimada when you stop by. I highly recommend this wonderful bakeshop to family and friends
