My buddy and I attempted to eat here at 11pm on a Saturday night but we were unsuccessful. \n\nWe were greeted by two hostesses upon entering HEXX. We were told there would be a 5 minute wait because they had to clean a table up for us. That being said, I expected there to be a packed restaurant. Hostess #1 asked if we would like to sit at the bar instead because there was no wait there. We replied yes.\n\nAs we walked into the main dining floor\/bar area, we noticed HEXX was practically empty aside from a few occupied tables and a handful of patrons at the bar. As we sat at the bar, this male bartender told us that this other blonde female bartender would be taking care of us. She came up to us and asked if we wanted any drinks tonight. We replied with \"No, can we start out with two glasses of water?\". She replied yes, and that was the last we saw of her.\n\nLong story short... we never saw those glasses of water. Our bartender never came back to us with those waters even though we saw her standing idly by, 20-25 feet away from us on the other end of the bar. She never returned to take our order even though we had read over the food menu for five-to-seven minutes already. My friend and I cut short our dining experience here and left abruptly because we were put off by the service here at HEXX.
