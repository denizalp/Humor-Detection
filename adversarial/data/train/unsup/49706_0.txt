**worth it if you use the Yelp deal OR Groupon ($24)**\n\nWhew!! Serious work out and I'd tried pole dancing multiple times.\n\nYou'll come away learning 3 basic moves ( Fireman is one of them), an idea of how to do a chair dance, AND a fancy schmancy stripper license with a name of your choice  :-) \n\nFeel free to bring a friend or 2, they have about 16 poles available and a changing room if you wanna try heels on or whatever. \n\nNote\/ suggestions: would be nice if the dance room was brighter with wall to wall mirrors. I also like classes where I learn an actual dance routine :-) also finding the location is difficult , enter the main mall from the garage and pick your tickets up at the V theater. The wait is long so come early!!!
