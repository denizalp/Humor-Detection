We went for dinner, very excited to t\nCheck this new place out.... it was a disaster... the kitchen was behind on orders, a lot of customers were getting the wrong order plus some food will come out for your party and the rest will be out about 30 Mins later, and that was if they remembered.... the waitress was all over the place it took forever to get a refill on our drinks or just to even get extra napkins.... never returning here again.
