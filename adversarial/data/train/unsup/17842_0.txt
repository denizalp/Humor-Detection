I want tons of ingredients in my ramen.  I'm the one with multiple ticket toppings when using the ramen coin order machines in Japan.  Extra, extra, extra!!  The deluxe ramen was my only choice.  I already plan on getting even more of their fantastic chashu next time.\n\nI'm not big on miso ramen.  Not that I dislike it but it's never my first choice.  The shio was great and I thoroughly enjoyed every slurp of the noodles.  My wife opted for the miso butter corn ramen, a northern Japan specialty, which she liked a lot. \n\nBased on the Yelp buzz, it was a flat out guarantee to see a Yelper in the house.  Nice seeing My and Thao T with their little, future food connoisseur in tow!\n\nSolid ramen place but I felt like my meal was incomplete without a big bottle of Asahi Super Dry (no liquor license yet?) and good gyoza.  The gyoza was below average.  I definitely like this place over Monta.  My wife refuses to step into Anime due to the manga otaku factor so I can't compare that yet.  My deluxe ramen might come out to $16 on future trips.
