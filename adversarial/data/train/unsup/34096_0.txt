I had to replace a door handle for my wife's car.  Of course, the door handle comes from the dealer without paint, so I had to find someone to paint it to match the car body.  It turns out most auto collision shops just don't want to bother with a small job like painting a single door handle. \n Luckily, I found ServiceKing.  Josh at ServiceKing took my call that day, quoted me an amazingly reasonable price, and it was painted and ready to be installed the very next day.  Not sure you could get better service than I received.   Josh had the handle painted and back to me before most of the other shops even returned my call.  Thanks to Josh and ServiceKing.
