Came here to use a gift card. The shop was well lit and large and the staff friendly. It's a men's shop that's recently branched into women's clothing.  They have other stuff like grooming kits and socks, shoes and sunglasses, accessories and watches.\n\nThe styles here are very trendy and pricey but they do have a few sales rack and some basic staples.\n\nThere were not many customers but I came on a weekday.  From what I witnessed, most of them seem to be repeat customers as they chatted with the staff like old friends.  \n\nThe change area was big and there was a large mirror for you to check yourself out. \n\nThe salesperson left me alone to try out, didn't push for any sales. I did manage to find a lot of nice quality items. Overall a good place to shop for something a bit special i think...
