Got set meal dinner on the Saturday before grocery shopping at T&T.\n\nThe food, in terms of flavors, is relatively authentic compared to many other Taiwanese eateries. Ingredients are so so tho. Their comp drink, the milk tea in specific, is not good at all. I was glad I upgraded the drink from the basic selection by paying on top. (You get free comp drink from the basic menu but instead u can choose to order another drink off the regular menu at 50% off discount.) When i really in the mood for bb tea, It's worth it or I will rather stay with simple H2O.
