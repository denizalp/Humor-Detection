Good food. My son picked this place. He was very excited to try buttermilk bacon pancakes. Got to say they were very Elvis good lol. \nI had the scramble eggs with pear ham and Camembert with some fennel bread. Unique and awesome.  Fun little  place, very tight seating but very quick turnovers. It's about the food, not the ambiance. It's decor is simple. Service was good for what they do. I definitely thinks it's a good place to try. A bit  of a trek to the junction though. \nI only give positive reviews because I will only review places I like. I would never bash a place just because. Most places that are bad will eventually close down. However, I always love to give positive suggestions. Especially to places that got most of it right. \nFor Little Fish I would say its probably a good idea to have a professional look at you exhaust system. We all walked out of there with a smile on our face  until we realized we smelled like the restaurant. That nasty smell lingers all day. Specially for my spouse  who just had her hair done. All in all I say my son picked a good place.
