Everyone says they really like this place. I have to say it was good. Especially for being in the airport it was a nice change from the usual.\nWe had a long flight in front of us so I wanted to eat a real meal. So we went to Matts. We had a small bit of a wait. They were packed very popular place.\nWe were seated and quickly served. Our server was great! She was fast, refilled out drinks and even brought us a to go box. Sorry to say I do not remember her name. as this was before we went on vacation. A lot has happened since then.\nThe food was good but, not great. I got the pancakes that I ordered with my meal when I was almost through with my breakfast.\n I realize they are very busy. It was decent. I would go back. Maybe when I am not so rushed.\nThe price is a bit high I think. But, it is the Airport and rents are high there. \nI will give it a go another time. Coffee was good. Service was great , food was so so.
