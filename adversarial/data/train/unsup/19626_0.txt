For the most part I am extremely detail oriented and rarely make mistakes when managing a project. With that said, I sat there on a Wednesday morning looking through our upcoming move into our office suite that Friday afternoon just to make sure I crossed my \"T's\" and dotted my \"I's\" ... when suddenly I realized: SHIT, I forgot to book the movers!!! \n\nSooooo... I turn to trusty Yelp to guide me to a moving company that can hopefully be my knight in shining armour and give a call to Camelback Moving. \n\nThey were able to accommodate our move with extremely short notice and we were so happy with the service. The two guys that came were extremely friendly, they got right down to business and did not waste any time. Our move went really quickly and I was extremely satisfied with the price. They clearly disclose pricing on their website and I had no issues after-the-fact. \n\nI would highly recommend Camelback Moving and will certainly use them the next time I have a move! Thanks for saving the day!!
