The line moved quickly and after placing my order at the counter, the two ice creams were ready really quickly too!  Considering that there was only one staff manning the cashier and two in the open kitchen behind him, it was a really fast order process!\n\nFugo's space isn't big and there are only a handful of tables with stools for you to dine in.  Most people order and then go with their ice cream or parfaits.  \n\nAs expected, the Cookie Monster Fugo Creation was highly \"instagramable\" \/photogenic.  Many people like myself took the photo of this dessert creation against their chalkboard wall.  There was chalk available too for you to leave your own comments or messages too.\n\nThere were two scoops of the Cookie Monster ice cream and mini Chips Ahoy Cookies all on an Oreo Fugo Cone.  This was a big portion and if it really weren't for the photo, I could have ordered the one-scoop version.  Upon trying it, I understood why this was so hyped.  The ice cream not only looked good (and cute), but it tasted really good too!  The cookies and cream ice cream was very good and although it was blue, it's not like there was any flavour to the \"blueness\".  The Chips Ahoy Cookies were a good and yummy addition.  The ice cream didn't melt too quickly (a bonus!) and when I finally got to the cone part of the ice cream, the Oreo Fugo Cone was really delicious too.  The Oreo pieces were stuck onto the cone with something that tasted like sweet marshmallows.  After eating this, I'm sure I had a bit of a sugar high. \n\nThe Bangkok Brownie Parfait consisted of Thai tea soft serve, brownie bits, chocolate drizzle, and chocolate wafer stick.  When tasting it, it had a very strong and loud Thai tea flavour.  I was impressed with that! I tasted the brownie bits too and was so satisfied with it too.   \n\nThe only thing I would say is that their desserts aren't cheap.  One ice cream creation or parfait was $6.99 and that's before tax.  That could be a cheap meal somewhere.
