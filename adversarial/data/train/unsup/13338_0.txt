Wow, is there a negative 12 star? Seriously, the only accurate word to describe this place = Ghetto!\nMy GF booked a room here for her hockey tournament, thinking cheaper is better. This place is a rats nest! Cigarette holes in all the bedding, a putrid vomit tinge in the hallways, and the bathroom? Wow. All the towels were stained, and the shower curtain looks like a Petrie dish mold experiment! A new coat of napalm might help the walls and ceiling in there! If she hadn't paid up front we'd be out of this crap hole. Forgot to mention the drunk, sloth of a woman screaming at her man friend at 4 in the morning. Good times!
