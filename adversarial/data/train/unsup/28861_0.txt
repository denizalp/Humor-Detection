I started working out at TPT just over a month ago and I have already seen some amazing results. I was a little worried at first because other gyms I went to in the past were intimidating but the trainers here are wonderful and really customize the workout for each individual. I really love the body scan as well so that you can track your progress. I highly recommend Thurston Personal Training to anyone who is looking for a great place to train!
