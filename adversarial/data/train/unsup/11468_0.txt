Finally came to the Pub.  I've been wanting to for years, but it always looked dead when we walked by so we would turn around and walk away.  We came for happy hour on a friday afternoon.  We will definitely be coming back on our next trip for happy hour again.  \n\nWe went straight to the bar for 2 for 1 drinks and $1 wings and sliders.  The 2 for 1 beers only works with miller, coors, and bud drafts, not the other 70 beers on taps.  Having wisconsin roots i'm perfectly happy having my miller products and of course refuse the bud products.  Unfortunately they were out of mgd so i went with miller lite.  It was $7 per beer, so $7 for two but they are 20 oz drafts so its really not a terrible deal.  I had 3 my wife had 1.  I thought that was a good ratio of sharing.  \n\nWe ordered 4 wings and 4 sliders, so $8 for that.  In reality $1 a wing really isnt that good a deal but it sounds like a good deal in Vegas and they actually were really tasty.  So they were worth it and I would happily go back and order a big pile of them.  The sliders were actually really tasty and that is a pretty decent price I felt per slider.  I was happy to see they didn't have a minimum of how many to buy in order to use the deal.  I was waiting for them to say you must order a minimum of 6 or 10 wings but they didn't.  The bartender was good and attentive.  Overall really enjoyed the happy hour and will be back next trip.
