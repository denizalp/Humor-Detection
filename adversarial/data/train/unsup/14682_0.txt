As many times as I have had curry next to this business I figured I might as well try it. The shop looks very clean and I'm a dessert lover - especially ice cream. I got vanilla with brownies and chocolate - it was ok. Nothing exciting and the vibe was gone.\n\nThe service was mediocre. The POS wasn't working - multiple cards, PAYPAL swiper wasn't reading my cards. I hate when businesses use crappy POS and they make you feel like it's your fault they don't have their s*it together. Once she keyed it in - she didn't even offer a receipt.
