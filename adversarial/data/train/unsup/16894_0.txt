Outrageous prices and you have to sign a contract. Once they got me locked in at the end of my contract they tried billing me double the price (for not being in a contract) as well as extra fees and charges! Not to mention when I did cancel they continued (trying) to bill my card. Obviously I had to stop that with my bank. This was a nightmare to deal with. The gym itself was generally clean. Sometimes you'd get that one gym creep that just comes in to watch. What gym will you not see those? \nI think they did offer classes here which was pretty cool. (I never took one)\nI'm actually almost certain \"Express Fitness\" closed down and it's called something else. \n\nI did look at the website for rejoining this gym and aside from being outrageously expensive, it still requires a contract. \n\n\nBest of luck though!
