Nostalgia!\nFun for all ages!\nVintage pinball machines as well as modern ones!\nVideo games like Ms PacMan, Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., Centipede--the 80s live on!\nChange machines everywhere!\nSome games are one quarter!  Yes, 0.25!\nSoda in glass bottles! (That's a hit with my teen.)\n\nI came here (finally!) with my son and we spent less than an hour inside, but it was fun to drop some quarters in Las Vegas machines that actually give you some real fun in return.  It really is like a pinball museum with machines that are older than me, but you can play them!  Of course I had to play Ms PacMan, my favorite video game, and I lasted pretty long on the Twilight Zone pinball machine, getting a bonus game out of it.  I basically played the pinball machines that had a theme I liked because there are so many to choose from:  Star Wars, Superman, and GoldenEye (007).  My son spent most of his quarters on the Dr. Who pinball machine, and also bought A&W root beer and Mike & Ikes--clearly, he doesn't eat like me, but he's a kid.  \nThis is a great place to bring friends and family for some good, simple fun that doesn't have to cost you an arm and a leg.
