I know what most everyone thinks, Waffle House, really? But l just have to say waffles with warm syrup, mmm so good. And at 2am, even better. You can go to Lo-Lo's for a Waffle House rip off for twice the price and even more disappointing then you can imagine. But now you can have chocolate chip, blueberry, and always a favorite... pecan. Seriously I spent time trying to replicate this batter and it can be imitated but never duplicated. Plus generally, the service is excellent and friendly. The only thing that would make this better would be real butter! I took the whole family in, 8 people and we ate for under 60$. The kids loved sitting at the counter. You can order your waffle extra crispy, softer, etc. And their other breakfast items are great. They maybe one of the few diner's that can properly cook an egg to order. Probably cause it didn't sit on a plate under a heat lamp cooking further after it is done. Plus you know that your food is fresh.
