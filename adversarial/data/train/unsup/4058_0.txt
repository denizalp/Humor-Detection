I have used this company for the last 2 years and I unsatisfied with their services.  Every time i Spoke to George it was always a $200 job this and $300 part that.  With each occasion i rectified the matter myself and avg cost came to $30 in parts and my labor.  Just got tired of the old run around.  What took me over the top to ensure I will not be using them ever again happened on their last visit.  I found my water to the pool was turned off and the vacuum was unhooked.  I called to complain but never got a real answer only that no one knows how that happened and if I can hook everything back up myself so when the end of the week comes someone will come over to oversee if I did the job well.  Enough is enough.  I am done with Pool Daddy for good.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone their services.
