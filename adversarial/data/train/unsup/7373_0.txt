This review is 4.5 stars. The customer service at this location (as opposed to its original location on Durango), is lackluster. The young guy behind the counter literally could not care less today. And the sit-in dining room, though cute and on-trend, is not perfect for enjoying a meal of any length. And downtown street parking is metered. All of this together make service and location less than desirable.\n\nBut the food, though, is excellent. Surely deserves 5 stars. I can speak to the following tacos:\n\nCauliflower taco: spicy, crispy, fried, but not greasy. Wake up your mouth and do a jig kind of flavor! Soft shell taco.  If you are petrified of spicy, this may not be the one for you.\n\n\nCrispy potato: Crispy taco shell and soft potato make for a good combination.  But today's fell a little short.  Shell was just a little soggy.  It was forgiven as an oversight.  Otherwise, good.  (The Durango location killed on the potato taco so I'm willing to give them a another chance). Not spicy; mildly flavored.\n\nRock shrimp taco: Well, this is an indisputable champion. STEP ASIDE carne asada, this is a job for shrimp!  Marriage between spicy and mild, traditional and new.  Even if you don't like seafood, you might find yourself gobbling this up and asking for more.
