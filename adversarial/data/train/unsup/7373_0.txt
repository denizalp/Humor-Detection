If you have a mustang (or other classic) this is the place to come. The guys in the back have been doing this for 20+ years and know what they're doing. For the people that said it takes a long time to get their car back, you should take your car to the regular corner shop down the street. If you want what's under your hood to actually look good, it's going to take longer than Joe Schmoe's auto repair.
