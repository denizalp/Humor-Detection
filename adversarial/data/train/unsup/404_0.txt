Romantic, outdoor eatery, complete with the christmas lights and all the ambiance associated with high dollar ticket entrees found on Sunset Blvd.. \nThis one gets 1 star bcause of the food having some decent flavor. The other four stars were dropped because of the gigantic cockroach that was hiding beneath my plate. \n\nWhat!!??? I know you are wondering what happened, well here is the story. Eating dinner nice and peacefully, nearly finishing up and the waiter comes over to snag my plate to wrap up my leftovers. As he picks up the plate the GIGANTIC cockroach makes an appearance running across the table cloth towards my lap. I jump from the table and my seat, the waiter swept the cockroach onto the ground. ......okay now wait for the ultimate response from the waiter!!!  \"That's what happens when you eat outside\" \nNothing was offered in compensation for the \"gigantic cockroaching.\" \nBeware of the unprofessional service and the unlikely bedfellows!
