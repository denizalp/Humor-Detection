Love ordering from the iPad. Made it so much easier a tnd enjoyable to order the food, since every selection had a photo with it. \n\nThe food was great. the mango pudding is a must if you're going there. The ambience of the place is also very nice.\n\nAlthough it took forever to be seated, the service was great. It can't be helped to wait for seating when it's a busy night, but we always got our food fairly quickly, and a nice server too. \n\nThe only thing is you have to pay cash or credit, no debit. It'd be nice to have the debit option but it's not that big of a deal.
