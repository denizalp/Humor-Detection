Ok so I finally got to check out the high roller with a friend who works for Caesar's Entertainment which means we walked on like a Boss for free. I went on a week night so it was a ghost town we shared our bubble with just three other people. I was hoping we had been alone as I had some Shenanigans in mind, lol. \n\nIt was interesting and I am glad to have been able to check it out however is something you only need to experience once.  I took some cool photos, ours did not have a bar in it which is ok since we were planning on hitting up a bar afterwards for some sweet libations. \n\nShort story, been there done that and won't need seconds in this case.
