I finally found the secret to clubbing! \n\nBuy goddamn table service.\n\nAfter 5 years of sweating and grubbing in dancefloors, I finally witnessed the greatness of being escorted by the bouncer to your own table, having the club waitress (or clubtress, if I may) come to you and ask to make you a drink, and best of all, have girls come to YOU because you can offer a VIP seat and some free booze.\n\nLuxury man, let me tell you.\n\nThe layout is very convenient with the tables laid out in a square around the dancefloor, which was very spacious and accommodating. The design is not as elegant and luxurious as its XS and Tryst counterparts though.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my opulent experience here. And we even got a great deal on the table ($600 for 2 bottles) which was a recipe for a good time. \n\n-----\n\nDistinguishing Factor: The bass in the dancefloor is insane. At one point my entire body was literally vibrating with the music. I've never felt such an intense bass before. Vegas baby!
