My female cat needed to be spayed. She had developed pyrometra, which can be fatal. These folks jumped right in and scheduled an emergency surgery and saved my baby's life. In at 7:30 AM, picked her up same afternoon, at 3:00 PM. Cost was hundreds of dollars less than what a veterinary clinic would have charged. The staff was genuine in their caring and friendliness. I had priced an ordinary spay at over $300. That didn't include the extra steps to treat pyrometra. All in all, surgery, shots, medicine and follow up care was $100. AWESOME!!!. I highly recommend this clinic. They are fabulous!
