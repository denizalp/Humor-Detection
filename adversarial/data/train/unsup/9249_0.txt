Frozen yogurt was the craze when I was a young 'un growing up in Cerritos, CA--I fondly remember the Penguin's we all used to go to as kids.  But then Penguin's closed and it seemed that the fro-yo craze was over.  Then, it slowly came back and as Las Vegas residents, my son and I would go to Golden Spoon regularly.  Then, we stopped.  Since then, fro-yo was just something I'd have occasionally.  That little hiatus came to a screeching halt in the last month when I heard through the Yelp grapevine that Yogurtland had black sesame vanilla for a limited time--thanks, Suzy H. and Emily R.!  Until May 26th, Yogurtland had the flavor on their menu and I'm sure that I went at least once a week to have the stuff, even when I was in SoCal for Mother's Day weekend.  Between this neighborhood location and the one in Henderson at Eastern and 215, I've made up for lost time.  I discovered black sesame at Perfect Scoop Ice Cream and fell in love with the flavor.  Yogurtland's flavor was awesome paired with their toasted coconut yogurt, topped with mango and mochi, my way to personalize the experience.  I'll miss the flavor and certainly hope it returns soon.  Overall, the yogurt at the chain is tasty and really not too bad for you if you choose the right toppings, which are plentiful, from lychees, kiwi, mango to the more evil ones, like peanut butter cups, cookie dough, Lucky Charm marshmallows, etc.  This place is popular for a reason and it doesn't break the bank for what you can get.  For now, I've had my fill and it's time for another hiatus....until black sesame vanilla returns.
