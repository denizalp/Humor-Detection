My friends and I got to come here during their first day in business. They are located next to Chandelier. The interior is so clean and decorated nicely. It's quite traditional yet has a modern hint to it as well. It kind of reminded me of the interior in Kabuto, which shouldn't be surprisingly since they are both owned by the same group. \n\nMy friend got their matcha soft serve while I decided to try their hojicha soft serve and yuzu sparkler. Their matcha soft serve was done quite well: it wasn't too sweet and had a very aromatic matcha flavor. I was actually quite disappointed in their hojicha soft serve. I had hoped that the sweetness levels would be the same with their matcha soft serve but it was not. The hojicha soft serve was extremely sweet compared to the matcha. It still had the aromatic flavor of the roasted green tea but I felt that the sweetness drowned out a good portion of it. \n\nAs for the yuzu sparkler, it was like club soda mixed with a hint of yuzu. It was very refreshing and actually helped out with the overly sweet hojicha soft serve. However, when it is consumed alone, it does very little for me.\n\nUnfortunately, while I'm sure Chamon provides high quality matcha products, they are not for me. I much rather go to SoCal and go to Matcha Love instead.
