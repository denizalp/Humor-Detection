This was my first Pho experience and i'm officially addicted. The atmosphere is very quiet and laid back. The restaurant is very clean and updated. There is options to eat in or take out. The food smelt amazing from the dining area. \n\nThe food was excellent. Everything tasted really fresh and the portions are large. I bought an extra large bowl for two to eat, and i probably could have fed another person. \n\nI will definitely be coming back.
