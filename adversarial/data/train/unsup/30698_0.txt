Their customer service is crap. I went to get my passport photo taken but the one I live by had their photo center down so I had to drive all the way out here. When I got there I wasn't greeted and I waited for awhile. Finally the guy that works in photo came up and acted like I was inconveniencing him instead of apologizing for my wait. He had such a bad attitude.  I decided to not get my photo taken there.  I went CVS after on rainbow and warm springs - it was refreshing because the woman actually smiled and greeted me - complete opposite of what I experienced here. Never going back.
