I first had bubble tea when I was probably 13 and I still get refreshing bubble tea here. This is my go to bubble tea joint when I'm right in Queen street. I always order my favourite bubble tea version, taro slushie. It is very refreshing and creamy. Also I like the fact that the drink is actually cold. Many places that serve bubble tea put the tapioca in the cup while it is still hot. I'm not certain if that's the traditional way of serving it but I hate how that makes the drink warm. This joint also has a very large selection to choose from, so you will probably find your fave flavour.\nOne thing I do hate about this place is the pricing and the sizes. When I first started coming here, I still remember I could get a large drink for about 6 dollars. Sadly a large isn't a large here anymore and would be considered a medium in many other places. Also it isn't 6 dollars anymore but more like 8 dollars plus. They also have these little snacks you can get but I advise you not to eat them. They are mostly microwaved fish snacks and they taste awful.\nIf you want to stay on Queen street, go ahead and get a drink here but if you are willing to walk to Spadina, you will find many more places selling bubble tea just as good if not better, with a better price too.
