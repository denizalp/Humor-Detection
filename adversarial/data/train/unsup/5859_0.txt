Standard-issue American Starbucks. Friendly baristas, coolers with drinks and pastries, overpriced coffee and free wi-fi. Power outlets can be found along the wall. On a bright and blinding morning, you'll want to roll down the shades.\n\nAnd to the folks think that they're only popping in for a minute and can park their car in the roundabout, don't. There are marked spaces and frankly, you need the exercise.
