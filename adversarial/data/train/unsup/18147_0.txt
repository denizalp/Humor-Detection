This place should be called either, \"comedy of errors,\" or \"miscommunications.\"\n\nWhen my main box died on us over a week ago tech support said to exchange the box at the store down the street. Ok. Done. \n\nNew box is not compatable  with our tv nor the contour package we have. Please return to store to exchange. Ok. Done. \n\nOh, we don't carry the original boxes here. We will have to send someone out. \n\nAfter 2 1\/2 hours on the phone, 2 trips to the store, waiting around for the service guy...8 days later my cable is back to square. \n\nFricking this is your last chance to get it together.
