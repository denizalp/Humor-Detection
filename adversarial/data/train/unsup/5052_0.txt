Oh how I wish I could leave a better star rating....\n\nFriendly staff, there's only three of them, but non the less they make you feel right at home. The lady that did my toes was awesome and totally knew what she was doing when I asked for french tootsies. And the first time I came here the lady that did my gel mani was equally as awesome. My mistake was to get pink and whites by the husband. Don't get me wrong super nice guy, but the way he did my nails made my neck hurt. BECAUSE ALL MY NAILS WERE LEANING TO THE LEFT!!! I had to tilt my head every time to try and make them seem straight but to no success. And no its not my fingers that go to the left ,i made sure after i ripped them off 2 days after.\n\nI guess you can say this review is strictly for the mister who does pink and whites, try the wife or the other lady or you'll be tilting your head to the left to the left...
