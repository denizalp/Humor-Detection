Megan the hostess got a new tattoo on her left forearm!! She was most concerned that all customers were made aware.  Top priority!!\n\nGiven a 35 minute wait estimate, after an hour we left without service. See below:\n\nArrival.....\nHost: name please?\nMe: Paula\nHost: Colin?\nMe: no, Paula \nHost: what?\nMe: P a u l a T. \nHost: ok, there's a 35 minute wait.\nMe: ok, thank you. \n\nAfter all that, and spelling my name for him, somehow my name was added to their app\/list as Paul T.   Ok, close enough. \n\nWe browse through the shop area and hear Megan call out, \"table is being prepared for Paul T.\"  I head over to her podium. She doesn't ask my name but quickly tells me to stand to the side because it'll still be about approx 10 minutes.  Ok, no worries. I understand as I've also worked in restaurants. \n\nWaiting, waiting, waiting. Others who checked in after us are being seated.  Ok, More waiting. I ask her to check on my name, Paula T. or Paul T. \nShe's too busy looking @ the new tattoo and putting creme on it. \nShe finally says, \"your table isn't ready yet\".\nOkay, I ask her to at least check for my name clarification. She didn't. \nShe's very busy, but telling customers that this is slow compared to most Sunday mornings so it's no big deal. She's used to it.  I approach again to inquire about name clarification because it's been almost an hour at this point.  \nShe says, \"oh table for Lupe\"? \nNo, Paula T. or Paul T. because my name wasn't properly input by the first host outside at the front door. I'm trying to explain to her. She insisted my name must be Lupe because there is no Paula or Paul on her tablet.  \nWait a minute, you called Paul T about 30m ago so......???? \nAt this point she was looking but says nobody named Paul or Paula has checked in. I remind her that she called it about 30m ago.  If she'd have listened to me, I could have explained it.  \n\nCutting off customers as they speak is highly inappropriate. Customer service 101.  \nBesides the name mix up she should have at least acknowledged that my husband and I both had been standing in her area for a long time. \n\nA good hostess would pick up on that, not Megan though.  Her new tattoo was the most important thing for her. \n\nLeft without service. \nWon't be back. \nCB manager, please retrain Megan. \n\nP.s., I have nothing against tattoos. \nI think they're great.
