Viva has a special place in my heart. I wont make this review too long, but below is what you need to know:\n\n1. Order the quinoa stuffed avocados every time and add chicken! My husband and I always split them, but it's also big enough for a meal. I usually get the 1\/2 order with a side of plantains for my meal.\n\n2. Plantains are a must here! Sweet, savory and delicious. TIP: Dip them in the green sauce- it's so good! \n\n3. Speaking of sauces- they have 3, but my favorite is the new red sauce. A bit of a kick, but not too overpowering. All are made from different types of Peruvian peppers! \n\n4. The Arroz Chaufa is awesome- plus add the chicken. Mix in the sauces and you have a dynamite meal! The ginger gives it a little bit of a kick, but it's so darn good! They usually have this as a weekly late lunch special too during the week (2-5)  so be on the look out for that! \n\nI can go on and on, but these are my top picks here! You can't really compare them to any of the other Peruvian restaurants in Charlotte. They aren't completely authentic, but the food is awesome and it's a great fast casual option that never gets old.
