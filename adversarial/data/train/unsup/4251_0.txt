First time staying here. The place is yuuuge.  \n\nI am not a Marriott Vacation Club owner, but was able to book this location with no problem.  This is the perfect place to take families and children, as the events\/entertainment and the large rooms with family style dining rooms and large kitchens are perfect for that.  They had poolside popcorn and movies during the evenings when I was here with family friendly kids films. \n\nThe Planet Hollywood is across the street if you want variety in dining or entertainment, as it includes the miracle mile shops.  The bar on the lobby level at Marriott's Grand Chateau has food (and drinks), the poolside bar\/lounge on the fifth floor has food and drinks, and the rooftop pool has limited drinks and food during limited hours. \n\nThe rooms and hallways were quiet, which is surprising given the number of families and kids here.  You will find kids and pool toys crowding the elevator and lobby most afternoons here.  The food was okay.  The service here was absolutely fantastic, which plus the large rooms and good location gives the place the five stars in my rating. \n\nWould I stay here again? Maybe as part of a family vacation.  There are so many other places with more excitement and less families than here, so probably not otherwise.  But it's a solid choice for the right vacation.
