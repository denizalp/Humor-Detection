Hmm I don't know...somethin not right here...The Kalbi plate I usually pick up for my family is still sitting in the fridge...\"Tastes like beef jerky\" said B Jr. That's the 2nd time in the past couple months that we didn't care for it. Last time 1\/2 my order was burnt it was a to-go order so I didn't realize it til we got home. Mr B. still thinks their Pot Roast Loco Moco is bomb though! \n\nHaven't seen any of the regular staff either.\nNo \"Howzit Auntie \" cause  the cooks that are there the times we went spoke Spanish only. Everyone is nice, but other than the island music, some ofthat Aloha vibe is missing. \n\nSo this time I ordered something else, Oxtail Soup.... sigh... broth was not like it used to be either and Oxtail was real tough ...what's up with that? So Mr B will have to find someone else get his Loco Moco, cause I can't bring myself to come here for awhile.
