I can't quite put my finger on why I've struggled with this company. As soon as I was about to end this crazy relationship, all of a sudden potential tenants were sent my way. Initially, I thought it was due to the youth and inexperience of my agent who posted less than appealing pictures of my property on numerous MLS listings. I have recently learned that it's not just him but the assistant property manager too who completes work orders for tasks already covered by the HOA management company. Yes, for things that are covered by the dues that are paid monthly. I've had a tenant for ten days and there have been numerous issues that really don't add up. After owning this home for 14 years, I am suddenly faced with clogged sinks, an inoperable dishwasher, and an out of date smoke detector. I get normal wear and tear on a home but none of these issues have ever surfaced prior to the last ten days. They truly do not have the best interest of the homeowner in mind but they seem to be great advocates for tenants and their overly priced contractors.
