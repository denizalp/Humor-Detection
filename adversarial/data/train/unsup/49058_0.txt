I have not been here for a few years and it has certainly grown.  There were areas under construction for more improvements including new restrooms.  Currently there are portapotties.  It was a beautiful day and the zoo was packed, including school bus loads.  I was there with my daughter and 2.5 yr old grandson and 2 month old granddaughter.  We did not get around to see everything.  My grandson was elated to take\nThe little train ride but not so much on the carousel.   You need to purchase tokens for the rides and because my grandson got off the carousel before it started they gave me our tokens back-until\nNext time.  There is also a large play area with a big treehouse that has various slides coming down from it and others items for kids to crawl through\/on.  We packed lunch so after about 1.5 hrs of walking around we headed to a picnic table and relaxed before heading home.  This zoo is free to\nVisit.  They do have various donation boxes around the zoo if you wish to donate to the zoo expenses.  This zoo has plenty to offer and a great way to spend a family day together.  It is next to a park which was also under construction but the play equipment was still available.
