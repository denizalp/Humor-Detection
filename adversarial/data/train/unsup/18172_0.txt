New spot by my house. I'm so happy with all the boba spots opening around here by the way. I just learned this is a second location, never heard of them before but glad I did.\n\nThe service was great, they were all friendly and welcoming. They have a large variety of drinks as well as some added treats. Macaroon ice cream sandwiches and super cute cake pops (bit disappointed BC all of them were chocolate tho). I also liked how they offered a lot of different varieties of toppings for the drinks. \n\nI had the passion tea with Nata jelly and boba, very good!
