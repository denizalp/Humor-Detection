Cranberries is a perfect place for a quick breakfast.  This is a \"go-to\" place for me and my wife on weekends as we live in the neighbourhood.  While not the classiest breakfast place in the neighbourhood, this place has great service, great coffee and a great breakfast at a lower price than expected.  The added bonus is the small patio in the summer.\n\nI love their breakfast sandwich, the toppings and bread are fresh.  The size of the sandwich is quite large too.\n\nI also love their breakfast waffle, it just hits the mark with its fresh strawberries and bananas.\n\nThanks, Cranberries!
