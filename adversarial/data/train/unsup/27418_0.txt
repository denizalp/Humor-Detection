This is my favourite vegan restaurant! Friendly staff and delicious food! \n\nBring a raised vegetarian there has always been a couple of dishes that have piqued my interest, but alas would make me sick of I ate them. Finally I can have chicken and waffles and wings! \n\nHands down the best vegan pulled pork sandwich in the cityand the chilli cheese fries are absolutely divine.\n 10\/10 would recommend.
