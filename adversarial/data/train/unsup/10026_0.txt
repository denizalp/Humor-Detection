Well well I had expectations. 155 reviews to this date BP seems to be a pretty popular joint here on Yelp, well in fact in the city.\n\nI had expectations going. Unfortunately they were not met tonight. :(\n\nSome of these things I've read about this place IMO are blown out of proportion like a legendary fish story! .. comments like  'grease in the air , I have to shower when I get home, go eat in a park to have a communion with a burger. Lol. Haha some excellent creative writing people and props to that.. you know who you are;). \n\nThose comments induced grade \"A\" burger fantasies as we approached on the 501 Queen st E streetcar into no where land. damn you guys :p\n\nI ordered 'the priest ' the house specialty. It's a cheeseburger topped with \"the option\" a deep fried cheese stuffed portabello mushroom. The option is the size of a patty itself. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the order was ready. \n\nI opened my wax paper to do a quick inspection and took my first bite. \n\nThey used fresh ground meat and it cooked on a griddle retaining all of its rich fat and juices. They did cook it right. It was very juicy.\n\nThe bun is kind of lacking though, it's smashed and soggy. \n\nThe option - i'd opt out. is a tad too much cheese. the priest is already a cheese burger to begin with. . \n \ntoppings are pretty standard. Tomato,pickle,mayo,ketchup\n\nIts a excellent grease pit\/diner burger. \n\nBut it's not what i consider an ultimate burger though.. Ultimate would convince me to eat it over a steak. \n\nupdate: I started feeling abdominal cramps about an hour an half after eating this and soon found myself running to the bathroom. I cannot digest this grease so yahh I didnt gain any weight from this experience. Woot! Woot? Wtf\n\n2.5 stars
