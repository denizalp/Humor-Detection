After calling several repair companies, I was impressed with Mike and his customer service skills. I sent my Kate Spade glasses in that had the temples off. My mom's dog chewed them up. He did an awesome job matching the temples to the frames. Great job and fast service. I had them back to me 3 days after they received them. I would highly recommend this company!!
