This place serves standard chinese food in a slightly more upscale setting.  It's an easy spot to grab a bite to eat while at the Wynn.  Great service and  you will get out of there for about $30 a person.  If you are a people watcher get a table by the window and make fun of all the people you see strolling thru the casino.
