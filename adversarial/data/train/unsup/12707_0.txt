Highly, highly, highly,highly over-rated.  I've been wanting to eat at White Castle for ages but obviously, this White Castle is the only location on the west coast.  Since I'm here in Vegas for a month for work, I knew that I had to try White Castle.  Obviously White Castle is a huge novelty and I had huge expectations.  I was sorely disappointed.  I got the meal with 4 sliders (2 cheese and 2 without), fries, and a drink.  The buns were soggy, the meat was extremely flimsy and tasted so artificial, and the fries were unevenly cooked and unseasoned.  The fries tasted as if they were from the freezer section.  The only reason to eat here is for the novelty - there is a ridiculous number of good eateries.  Do not waste your calories here!\n\n1 star for novelty and 1 star for a decently cheap place to eat on the Strip.
