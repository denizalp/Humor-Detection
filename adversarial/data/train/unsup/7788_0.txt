Love this store!  Went to look at leather sofas since I purchased a home and my existing sofa is 18 years old.  Found the store to be impressive and well laid out. The sales person, Captain Kirk, was very personable without being overbearing!  Purchased a new sofa, loveseat and chair!  Leather power recliners and Love Them!! The guys who delivered were courteous and professional.  All in all, I would recommend RC Willey!
