I had my frames picked out in LA so all I needed was eye exam and for them to replace the lens. Booking an appointment was easy.\n\nGot to my appointment on time but the doctor had to leave office for personal reasons. I was sent back home for 2hrs and had to come back again. Eye exam took less than an hour total. I paid $68 for the eye exam (no dilation exam).\n\nI had two frames with me and chose the high index lens since that's the thinnest that could fit in my frames. They have a deal for BOGO free replacement on lens so I paid around $150 which is not bad.\n\nThey promised me 5 business days for my glasses to be done but ended up taking two weeks due to some mistakes on their end. Not too happy...but I do appreciate how their staff was communicative and updated me on the status of my glasses. \n\nMy overall experience was just ok. Staffs are friendly and knowledgeable. It seems like I just had bad luck on both my eye exam and lens replacement which took me more time than expected.
