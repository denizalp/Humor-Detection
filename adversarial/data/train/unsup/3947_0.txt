Going in we know that we go for the food, and expect generally poor service. But this last Fridays experience was more than we could handle... \n\nApparently the server swapped my wife's dosa with someone elses. She didn't realize it and had started eating it.. 10 min later the manager looking guy came in with another plate told us that the dosa was swapped, was sorry about that... all good so far but then he just grabed the plate she was eating off, mid fork... no \"would you like me to to remove it\", no sir... Put the new plate in front of her dumped the food that he grabbed from her into the waste collection bin that was sitting next to him and walked away. \n\nWe felt really awful after that experience, we couldn't finish our meal after that, we paid the bill and walked out. Sigh... we are shameless, might still end up going there after the trauma wears off.. food is still decent.
