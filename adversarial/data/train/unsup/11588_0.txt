I held a happy hour for my co-workers here last month. \n\nThe appetizers were delicious; we ordered some nachos and a plate of onion strings.  We also got the BIG Lucky Strike Combo appetizer sampler, and that could have easily served eight people.  The platter included Buffalo Wings, mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce, sliders, tortilla chips with salsa, spinach dip and a queso dip.\n\nWhile we only sat and drank, the activity selection was dazzling.  I saw video games, bowling, laser tag and something they call Gravity Ropes (an elevated roper ladder type of climbing structure).  It was late afternoon so there weren't too many patrons, but everyone looked like they were having a good time.\n\nOverall we had a good visit, my only issue to bring up was that the volume of music blasting overhead was so loud that our group had to shout at each other just to communicate, which doesn't make for a very sociable outing.  Making the music louder doesn't automatically equate to a more fun environment; the two are not directly proportionate.\n  \nI'd suggest maybe turning down the speaker volume from an 11 to a 8.
