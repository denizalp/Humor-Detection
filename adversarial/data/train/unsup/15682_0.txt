Thank you lucky cab Las Vegas, number 2512, 3\/1, at 20:04, from the airport to the Hard Rock Hotel!Thank you for charging me $22 to go 1.1 miles. Especially after I told you I had just been in an emergency landing after my plane was diverted, delayed, and I'd been trapped on an airplane for 13 hours before winding up stranded in Las Vegas. And it was pouring rain!! So cool of you!!! Imagine my surprise when I went back to the airport the next morning. Apparently I had an honest driver. $8.00. EIGHT dollar fare. He begged me to REPORT you, and was angry that you were giving honest drivers a terrible reputation.\n\nI'm sure this is working for you. But I can't wait to call and report your activity to the lucky cab company. It is not only dishonest, and unethical--it's downright wrong. Shame on you. Karma will not be kind to you.
