I almost don't want to update this review, because I heart the experience I wrote about previously. However, I've been thrice since then and this place continues to dazzle. Razzle Dazzle. Musicals. This place makes me want to siiiiiing, so it's time for an encore.\n\nI came in for lunch and had their burrito special, huge and under $15 - un parfait et spicy lunch. On this occasion I didn't have anything but water, but my friend Kent P had a double scotch. Whatalunch for whataguy. \n\nTwo days later I returned for another lunch about with My 'burbs bud Kris U. At this lunch I had their soup du jour - it was a turkey soup, but it had all the makings of a fine chowder with some huge hunks of turkey thrown in. A salty somethin' else. I followed this with their renowned Mac and Cheese. Oddly, this wasn't my fave... but I'll be sure to *Fois It Up and give it another chance at some point. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: The lunch servers here are superb. They don't normally have horseradish in their caesars, but I asked and I watched her go to the kitchen and grab some fresh horseradish for the bartender to make my Caesar to my specifications. \n\n*Do I want to add Fois Gras to stuff? Always!
