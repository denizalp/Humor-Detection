Worst TSA experience, ever. \n\nAs a sexual human being, with adult content in one's bag, going through the screening process part in Las Vegas... I thought this would be a breeze! I had no trouble going through SeaTac's security, whatsoever. \n\nMy wife was directly in front of me and our bags just happened to be going through the screen much faster, with very little congestion. Soooo, MY bag happened to be seen as her bag. \nBasic lowdown: We are a married, lesbian couple and my wife is the seemingly Alpha one. We aren't used to men getting up in our business, but it occasionally happens - life. So, with little surprise, this husky, mid-30s TSA gentleman comments quietly and condescendingly to her about how funny it is that our relationship needs this extra implementation, laughs, then returns to his station. Rude! \n\nIt wasn't even her bag and we're in Vegas!!\n\nThese employees really need a lesson in professionalism and sensitivity. The worst!
