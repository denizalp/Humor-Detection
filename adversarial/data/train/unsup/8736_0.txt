This was on my 'To Try' list forever.  My wife and I finally got around to going and I was pleasantly surprised.  As soon as you enter, there is a tiny little gift shop.  Quaint, but not what I'm looking for in a restaurant.  Service was quick and polite.  We didn't wait too long for our food to arrive, and our drinks were always full.\n\nI got the Greek Salad, and I wasn't disappointed.  Strange, the salad didn't come with any leaves (i.e. lettuce, spinach, etc..)  It was more of a humongous plate of finely chopped vegetables in an outstanding oil-based dressing.\n\nNext time I go, I want to try one of their Gyros... They looked amazing!
