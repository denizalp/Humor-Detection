I I had taken my Samsung Galaxy 5 into Verizon as I was having problems sending multimedia texts.  The customer service rep suspected my memory card was full. He suggested I go around the corner to UbreakIfix (Promenade location) as he thought they could help me. Jesse looked at my phone and determined I had a defective memory card and sent me to Best Buy to purchase a new one, (much cheaper with more gigabytes than what Verizon had). I returned with the new memory card and Jesse installed it and moved all my pictures and contact list to the new memory card NO CHARGE!  This is wonderful customer service!  I will use them again for any of my phone or IPAD issues.
