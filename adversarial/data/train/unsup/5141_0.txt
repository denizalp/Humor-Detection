We dropped off my iPhone 5 at noon.  We asked how long the repair would take to complete and the polite young man at the counter said \"no more than 45 minutes\".  So we headed to lunch.  Day 6 of our Vegas vacation and we're sooooo ready to make the 4 hour drive back home to LA.  \n\nWe came back around 1:15.  We're still sitting here at 1:45.  We had the gall to ask once again how much longer we'd be waiting and the guy yelled from the back of the store... \"I can't give you a time..\"  What???? You can't give us a time???  Why would you say 45 minutes???  Oh and by the way... this is 2 of this nightmare.  We brought it in yesterday to fix some water damage and a non-functioning home and volume buttons.  So then why are we sitting here today?  Here's why .... because they didn't fix the volume buttons and here's what they told us... the warehouse was closed and they couldn't get the part and they had to solder the home button so come back tomorrow yadda yadda.  \n\n$215 later, and my phone is still not back to 100%.  There's something loose inside when it shakes.  At least the screen seems to be functioning... but probably not for long.  So now they're telling us it's probably something wrong with the mother board and Von goes on and on about how delicate and microscopic and globally economic the iPhone 5 is blah blah blah. Oh and this is hilarious... we paid with $220 cash, since they don't have a functioning credit card machine, and the kid at the counter asked if we wanted change... LOL. Anyway, Von was tried to be helpful, but it's unfortunate that they couldn't get our phone working.\n\nSo now there are scratches all over the bottom of the phone where it was pried open and we're on our way home.  What a waste of time.  Next stop.... apple store... sigh
