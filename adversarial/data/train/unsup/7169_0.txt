Needed some new dress shirts and I have a few brands that I love to buy.  I called this location to see if they had any Geoffrey Beene wrinkle-free dress shirts, which they had, so I made the drive out here.\n\nWhen I arrived, I found only 1 in my size....so I snatched it up.  Then I found a couple of others that I liked too.  I also found a workout shirt and a pair of shoes....dammit, I overspent AGAIN!\n\nI like this store....it's well kept, clean, and the lines were super short.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
