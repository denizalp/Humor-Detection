Maybe I should have gone to Wolfgang without such high hopes, that way I wouldn't have to be so disappointed, but unfortunately I didn't do that. \n\nI was disappointed. \n\nI had a lemon drop to drink. Weak. For 13 bucks, it was not worth it. Didn't do much for me and the sad part is that I'm a total weak sauce. \n\nThen we started off with the crab cakes. They serve 4 mini crab cakes about the size of fifty cent coin. It was pretty good. It was topped with a tomato relish, that lighten up the crab cakes. They were pan fried so they were as heavy to begin w\/ anyways. They were small, but that was expected. \n\nI had the tomato, basil, and mozzarella pizza. Also known as the margherita, which would have been a much simpler name when it came to ordering purposes, but i guess the former is much fancier? Who knows. But the pizza was good. But usually always is. Simple ingredients. Can't really mess it up. The bf had the fish of the day which happened to be halibut. It had to be the smallest portion ever! With no sides. It had a sweet corn puree under it and nothing else! For 30 bucks!? Soo not worth it. \n\nI don't think you get much of an experience from Wolfgang so I can't say even if the food is cruddy that you'd have fun. But if you really must try it then I guess there's no stopping you.
