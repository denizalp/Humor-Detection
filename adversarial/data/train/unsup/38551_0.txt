I would give these people ZERO stars if i could.. but that's not an option.  I added a car rental when i bought my flight out to phoenix.. when i got there i was assisted by a rude person who looked like they just wanted to get off work. They ended not renting me a car even after I called my credit card and told them i was going to do a transaction with budget. I spent over 40 minutes waiting for nothing ..  i was air sick from my flight so this was the last thing i needed. All the guy said was that i could check at pay less rental  a couple doors down from him.!! The attendant though who was checking people in was the only person i would have something nice to say about.  I went over to Enterprise Rent  A Car and i was in and out of there within 10 minutes and got a really nice car for a much better price and model than i would have gotten with budget. DONT GO TO BUDGET... that would be a HUGE mistake!
