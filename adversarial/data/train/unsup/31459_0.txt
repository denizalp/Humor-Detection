Wow this place really lives up to the hype. Everything was extremely fresh and the Akropolis fries are crispy on the outside and soft im the middle just how i like them. The cashier was extremely knowledgeable about the source of their meats and traditional Greek food history. The best part was when the owner came out to make sure everything was good. He really takes pride in his work and it shines as each bite tastes as if it were made with love! Will be back!
