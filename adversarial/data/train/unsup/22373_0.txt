Up until recently I had no real complaints about Sweet Tomatoes but it seems that they are trying to save $$$ and it really shows in their food.. \n\nThe chicken noodle soup was once packed with huge pieces of juicy chicken but is now just more noodle & soup than anything..\n& their chunky chili seems much more watered down than before..\nTheir salad bar is still packed with fresh veggies.. However, they did get rid of their \"premium items..\"\n\nI still go to ST because it's close to me and is a healthier option than other quick fix places but I hope this isn't the beginning of the end!!! Red Rock lunch buffet is only $8.99 and they have a salad bar plus much more hot items so ST needs to get back on their A game... \n\nHOT TIP: join Club Veg to get weekly coupons.. I also noticed that instead of their coupons having a fixed discounted price they now just offer 10% off~
