I think we said \"Oooh, look at that\" maybe once or twice throughout the botanical gardens. This is clearly not a garden meant to cater to all season. We came on July 20th and most flowering plants were either dead dead or just plain wilted. The ground are just okay overall.\n\nWe were particularly upset that it cost money to park ($12) AND you HAVE to pay ($20) per adult with zero discount offers. We tried to explain to the insectarium ticket people we only wished to walk the garden, but they said you must buy a ticket for the insect museum that is included with park entry. \n\nWe felt like we wasted our money overall. We spent maybe 10 minutes in the insectarium and 20 minutes in the gardens because it was boring, underwhelming, and just not set up very well to guide you point to point. The park looked nothing like past visitors' photos. I would not recommend this park to any of my friends or family visiting the area in the future unless they like being disappointed and throwing away their money. I have had much better free garden experiences than this one.
