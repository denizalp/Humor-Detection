This review is for the buffet. It was total crap.\n\nUnfortunately the kid sticking his fingers in the dessert didn't help my opinion of this place.\n\nThis is one of the cheapest buffets on the strip. So if you've had enough to drink you probably won't mind it.\n\nI got a kick out of the Chinese people eating the Chinese food at the buffet because even this white girl can tell that was some really bad white people Chinese food. I started wondering if they weren't eating it just to see what white people thought Chinese food was.\n\navoid at all costs unless you are drunk.
