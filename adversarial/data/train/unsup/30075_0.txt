Overall this show was too strange and expensive for me to fully enjoy.  As other people have mentioned, it is much more about dance than the acrobatics of other Cirque shows, although Love also relies more heavily on theatrical effects.  It's a very trippy show and I think at some point the creators mixed up abstract artistry with throwing a bunch of random-ass shit together.  For example, some burning questions:\n- why was the KKK at the carnival scene?\n- why were the Beatles in space?\n\nThe music was obviously good but didn't use as many of the \"upbeat\" Beatles songs as I would have expected and if you're only going because you love the music, save yourself at least $100 and buy a Beatles CD.  If you don't mind completely incoherent things happening on stage while Beatles music is playing, then go for it - it's very neat - but don't expect anything to make any shred of sense.  That was my mistake.\n\nA few pieces of advice if purchasing tix though:\n- Be sure to check BroadwayBox.com beforehand to see if there are any discounts available - most tickets are priced $150 and $125 normally.\n- I suggest NOT sitting in the very first section (100 series) as there are quite a few effects from the ceiling.  The theater presents pretty good views from all seats\n- If you need to pick up tickets from the Mirage box office, go EARLY instead of right before your show - the line for pickup can be REALLY long an hour before a show starts\n- You get a 2-for-1 ticket for the REVOLution lounge at the Mirage from 8-10pm with each ticket purchased.  Offer applies only to well drinks, beer, and wine.
