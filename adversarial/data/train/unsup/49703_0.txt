My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon. Most of the employees we encountered were fairly friendly, but there were several who were not very friendly. There was a different front desk person everyday, and the concierge was really just attempting to sell tickets to shows and not very helpful. The room was spacious and comfortable, but could use some updates. The huge jet tub was filthy and had visible mold under some knobs and the faucet which was a huge disappointment to my wife who loves a bath. The shuttle system to the strip is  a little confusing, considering all the shuttles look the same for this property and it's \"sister\" properties. I  saw guests turned away from full shuttles at the pick up spots( Tropicana and the Mirage), knowing that they would have to wait an hour for the next shuttle. Overall but not sure I would return
