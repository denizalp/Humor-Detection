Terrible CS.  \n\nIf someone like me approaches you, a young girl who works behind the Customer Service desk, please, please, PLEASE escort me to the aisle where the funnels are. \n\nDo not, I repeat NOT, just point to the other side of the store and say, \"Oh, it's in Hardware\".  It's a complete waste of my time for me to find what is like a needle in a haystack in a place where I am not comfortable, a home improvement store.\n\nI'd much prefer to deal with the elderly associates at Home Depot near my place.  At least they have a sense of customer service!
