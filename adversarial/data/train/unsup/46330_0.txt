Oh how I wish this was still a Mervynn's!!!!! Worst Wal -mart ever. Rude employees that follow the  example of their rude manager. \nI was trying to shop for food and I guess there was some sort of employee meeting going on in the aisle I was in. They totaly (6) employees and manager just stood in my way and would not let me by, even though they looked straight at me. I said, \" excuse me\", then I barged through, gave an electric shock from my cart to one of the employees my cart bumped and they looked at me as if I was the rude one.\nI am a manager at Big Lots, and even though we are a $$$$ saving store, I would never treat a customer like that. Many mornings me and my employees are putting things away on shelves when customers are around, and instead of blocking their way, we ask if there is something we can reach for them. At least I know I do, and if I ever see one of my staff members pulling a stunt like that, they would surely be reprimanded.\nNeedless to say, I was so upset about their rudeness, I left my cart full of items in the aisle they were in and left. I have never been back, nor will I ever go back, no matter what. Not only to this one, but any one. Wal-Mart.... learn some manners!!!
