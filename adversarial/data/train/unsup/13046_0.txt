The place was awful to maneuver around in with a cart. The aisle around produce and everywhere for that matter, you couldn't keep from running into someone you can't stop to look at anything or you hold up other people around you. \nIt looked nice for selection but I couldn't stop to see anything. Someone had knocked over a blueberry stand that's how close everything is to each other. I was so disappointed at the selection for kids medicine. Maybe if you go shopping at 9pm at night it won't be crowded.
