If I could give this place a ZERO, I would. A guy by the name of Kyle came through our neighborhood yesterday. This is a gated community that states no trespassing and no soliciting. When I answered the door, I specifically asked if this was a solicitation and he said no. He continued to tell me he does pest service for 3 neighbors down the street and gave me their names which didn't sound familiar. Clearly, this was a solicitation so he's a LIAR. A very shady guy. After I went inside, my husband researched this company online. This company had a D rating with the BBB with several bad reviews. Later that evening around 7:20 he was still here! We saw him roaming around our neighborhood. A couple other residents had confrontations with him. He's was very rude and pushy. Another resident also told us he was marking homes with an X with blue chalk. I saw them and he marked our driveway. I don't know what these marks mean but if he thinks he can come back, he is WRONG. next time I see this snake, the police will be here to escort him away..
