Whatever you do..\nDO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS COMPANY OR CALL SELECT.\n\nThey have terrible customer service, none of their representatives know what their saying, you can never speak to a supervisor or manager. \n\nThe problem I have with Comwave is that, I made an over payment onto the account and I still haven't got my refund back. Its been more then 2 months now and my bank is still chasing them for payment. These representatives keep telling me different BS each time I call. And apparently if I cancel with them I won't even get my money back. \n\nThis company is a nightmare to deal with and they really need better business etiquette.
