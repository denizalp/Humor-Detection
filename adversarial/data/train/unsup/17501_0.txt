Cool place to relax and more family oriented. Not the place to come if you're one of those types who wanna \"see and be seen\" like those cesspools of nastiness at the better known pools (Rehab, Wet Republic, etc) which is totally fine with me!\n\nPool Attendants were great, always checking up if we needed anything, and totally took care of us throughout the day.\n\nOnly one pool and a hot tub there, but there are a lot of loungers and ample shaded areas. Hours are 9am-5pm with a $5 cover for locals on Weekends, pool attendant didn't charge us though, and towels are also provided. Water bottles are allowed and their drinks were okay as was their pizza which was from inside the food court.\n\nLooking for a place to unwind without the party scene? Check this place out...ALOHA!!!
