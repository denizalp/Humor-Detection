I own a home and have it CLEARLY posted on my door \"NO SOLICITORS\" - yet they still rang the bell.  When I came to the door, I asked \"Are you selling something?\" They said, \"No, we thought you might want some free advertising.\" I replied, \"My door CLEARLY states No Soliciting.\" He shows me a \"No Soliciting\" sign on the bottom of his clipboard and says, \"Yeah, I have one of those too.\" To which I said, \"I am not interested.\" - If it states on my door not to solicit, WHY would you continue to solicit? That is one sure-fire way to make sure that you NEVER will get my business. \n\nThe \"No Soliciting\" tag on the bottom of the clipboard insists that they bother people who clearly don't want to be bothered and his response \"Yeah, I have one of those too\" was unappreciated and inappropriate.
