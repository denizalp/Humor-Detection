2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     52\/100\n\nMore of a 3.5 stars. I'm still a Fausto's over Roberto's fan, but as far as Roberto's this is one of the better locations in the southern area of Las Vegas. This is the only Roberto's I like and go to lately because family and friends live within a 2 mile radius. We usually order take out and eat at their house.  \n\nGreat things about this location: \n- DRIVE THRU!\n- fast service\n- rarely busy when I go. \n- Food is consistently good. Never had a bad experience with taste. \n- My go-tos are the burritos, carne asada fries, tortas, tacos, horchata. \n\nMost recently I had the carne asada torta. I really liked their bread. What I liked about their torta is the bread was soft with a little crisp on the outside. It was so soft that it fell apart easily while trying to eat the sandwich. Good and bad but I didn't mind, I just used a fork. Also the bread is huge, fills the take out container but the torta doesn't have as much meat as Fausto's torta.
