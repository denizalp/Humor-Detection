Previously, I wrote a review about my nail technician(Elaine) under the name of the business called, \"Dana's Nail & Spa\".  Recently, Elaine opened her own nail shop inside of Epiphany Beauty Salon(Trop & Durango).  I'm so happy for her!!!  She is fully recovered from her recent surgery and I'm glad that she is back to work.  No more broken or lifting nails!  I'm highly recommending her to anyone wants to have their nails done.  She has 23 years of experience in NY, Dallas, & Vegas :)  She has been always taken care of my nails sincerely and I know why she has so many royal customers up to these days.
