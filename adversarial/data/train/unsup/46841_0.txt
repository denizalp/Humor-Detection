I went to Onoir last night. I had the arugula salad, and filet mignon as the main. The food was honestly prepared by a lazy chef. No flavour, and just lazy preparation. The salad had no taste to the dressing, and whoever prepared it, though that shards of parmigiano would cover it. Not at all. The steak was ok, but vegetables were just cooked in butter\/oil. It honestly wasn't great. \n\nThe whole dark concept is fun, but honestly the food is horrendous. This was my 2nd time, and this time I went because a friend wanted to go for his birthday. The first time I went was a disappointment, but it was over a year ago, and i honestly had hoped it would have improved.\n\nAlso, yes, i know you're eating in the dark, but you quickly notice you are using cheap tablewear, sitting on fold out tables or crappy tables, and old banquet chairs. I know you're not supposed to care, but i do. \n\nThe mere fact that they continue to receive poor reviews, and their owner is aware of this, and yet they still haven't improved the food fascinates me.
