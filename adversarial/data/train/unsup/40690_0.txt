Scheduled an appointment with Ryan to have a Overhead DVD player installed in our minivan. Install came out great! No hidden fees or charges. Quoted price was what I paid. After install Ryan and the technician went over how our new DVD player worked and etc. Nice waiting area and great selection of products. Ryan was pretty knowledgable about anything I asked him in regards to sound and etc. I Highly recommend Sun Valley stereo for any Audio\/Video needs.
