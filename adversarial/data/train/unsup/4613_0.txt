This place was just \"okay\" to me.  I enjoyed the tour, but it definitely could have been summed up in about 15-20 minutes.  Although our tour guide was nice, there really wasn't a lot of neon lights to see.  Only like 5 out of the 100 or so we saw were actually in full working order.  Especially at night where it was extremely cold, the tour should have moved along a little more quickly.\n\nThere was just a bunch of landscaping lights shining on the actual old Las Vegas signs.  Was kind of disappointed in that sense, but still kind of cool they kept the preservation of the old Las Vegas history.  I just honestly thought there would be much more to see.  For $25 a person, I just would have expected more. Been there, done that, won't be back.  Wouldn't recommend.
