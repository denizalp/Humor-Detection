Absolutely the wrong time to be updating this, but whatever.  Busy week.\n\nAnyway, the booze is cheaper than I remembered, unless they lowered their prices, the grilled cheese sammy is as good as advertised, and best of all, the midweek bar staff are actually decent people.  Sweet.  I can stop hating this place, or at least have no reason to hate it.  I have a hard time refraining from hating things I started out hating.  Good thing I don't hate too many things.
