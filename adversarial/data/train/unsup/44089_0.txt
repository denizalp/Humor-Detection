Came for dinner last night (Tuesday night). It was hard to find the entrance for this restaurant! Anyway, I was a little skeptical about this place after reading all the negative reviews on Yelp. However, perhaps because we went on a weekday and they were less busy, service was quick and they were all very nice. They also have free wifi. We ordered the baked tomato sauce spaghetti with fried chicken stuffed in bread loaf and eel fried rice. While the spaghetti was a bit on the sweet side, we enjoyed both our dishes very much! The bread loaf was not as oily as I thought it would be. It was crunchy and quite tasty to eat with the sauce! Their dishes are priced a bit higher than regular chinese diners, but their presentations are much better too.. They also gave us free dessert after our meal (chilled mango sago). Overall this was a great experience. I recommend you all to go, and I will be back too!
