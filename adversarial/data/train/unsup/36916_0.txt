I am a Hertz Gold Five Star member and after my experience in Hawaii with Hertz said I'd never use them again, so I tried Thrifty...well that was a big mistake (booked car 4 weeks earlier and got there for them to have no cars!)...so here I am crawling back to Hertz, no booking and pretty sure I binned my card in disgust\/while throwing a hissy fit  after my HI experience.\nAnyway, long story short, first I saw the line and thought, oh here we go again, and then I saw a sign for the Gold desk...so up the escalator I went...no line!! \nWithin 10 minutes I had keys to a black mustang convertible in my hand. Sure it cost $50 more than Thrifty, but I wanted a car and that's what I got! The woman behind the counter was very helpful and a total disaster was averted.\nWhen we returned the car, we were running a few minutes late - we returned the car just short of 30mins past the due date. No additional fees as they have a 30 min grace period. Also useful!\nMoral of the story, cheap does not mean good.
