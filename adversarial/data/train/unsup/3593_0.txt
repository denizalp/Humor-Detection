I'm staying at Hotel Indigo the next six nights, and I'm more than okay with that!\n\nThis boutique hotel is beautiful and has been a gracious host thus far. The entrance to Hotel Indigo is a little confusing because you walk in a door that's on the floor below the lobby and there's nothing really down there... I felt like I walked into the wrong door... but then figured out where I was and was able to check in up at the desk. I showed up around 11am but they had a room ready which was a total lifesaver.\n\nThe room's gorgeous and has hardwood floors which just feels so much cleaner than typical hotel carpet. It also has an awesome couch by the window which has been a great work spot for me. The bed\/pillows\/blanket situation is my favorite part of the room and I got the most amazing nap ever in after arriving! It's definitely going to be hard to get up in the morning...\n\nI love the bar area, and I love the outdoor attached patio even more. The lady who was working the bar during the day today was not friendly at all, but the night staff I saw down there this evening looked really fun & attentive. The menu (same down at bar as the room service menu) is just okay and the two items I had (hummus and a salad) were just so-so. I bet there wine is okay, though... considering finding that out for myself!\n\nOnly cons are the thin walls and the noise outside as many yelpers have noted... I hear lots of girls screaming and laughing, so apparently something funny is going on out there. Also, one of the elevators here is really shady and sometimes the doors don't open when you get to your floor until you press the button again, which caused a brief moment of panic for me. All in all a great place!
