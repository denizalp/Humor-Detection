Cute and trendy spot! Nice open outside seating area and a fun dinning experience inside.\n\nCame here for a nice brunch on a Saturday around noon time. There was a wait that was pretty quick the hostesses said it was a 15 minute wait but we were seated in 5. The waitress was very lovely and nice. \n\nWe ordered plain pancakes, plain French toast with a side of bacon and a bagel to share. We really wanted to try the famous Montreal bagels. It was good. \n\nService was quick and food was tasty! Had an eggcellent  time. Will come again :)
