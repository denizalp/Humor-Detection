I am not using uber  again. The driver tonight A) wanted to get my phone number\/give me his personal phone number so he can birthday gifts B) wanted to go into my home for at least 10 minutes 3) he told me he like asians 4) he tried to to kiss me on my lips(with tongue) . I said NO. I have never had a bad experience with Uber in the short time I used the service until now
