went here for the first time and had the $25 summerlicious menu. Even for $25 I find that it was not worth it at all. I had the smallest taco ever, lobster roll was good but it was very small. I expected them to freshly cook or heat up the lobster but it was so cold. I'm not even sure if its fresh. The chips that came with it was so hard over fried that was it too hard. Dessert was okay. I can have a better meal for less than that price somewhere else.
