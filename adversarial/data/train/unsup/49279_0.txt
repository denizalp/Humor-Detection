I got married here in April; I was more than pleased with how everything turned out!!! Carrie was amazing!!!! I only gave it four stars because I thought the pictures were ok! I do recommend you get your own photographer and take pictures off site. Other than that the chapel is great and the little reception room is great!!!!
