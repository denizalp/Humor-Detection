I have been wanting to try this place since they opened.  Today was the day.  Stopped in to place a take out order of Thai green chilli curry, oh my goodness, it was delicious!  We ordered the tofu, a slight heat, a delicious flavor!  Really sweet people work there and we can't wait to try other dishes. I placed my order, grocery shopped at Aldi, then stopped in to pick up dinner.  We will be back soon.
