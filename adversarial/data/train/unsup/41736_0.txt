I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now and finally got around to it today. The service here is very fast. I went around 2PM so the lunch special was still going on. I ordered the Orange Chicken and i choose both sides of chow mien and fried rice. It also came with egg drop soup. Nothing really special about any of the food. I probably won't eat there again.
