Have been here a few times with family and friends and I would definitely recommend Petit Mousse for repe\/galette in the Farmer's Market if you are craving for some.\n\nThey offer a lot of savoury and sweet options. My family usually orders their smoked salmon galette, nutella crepe, and banana nutella crepe.\n\nWe really enjoy both their crepes\/galettes, but sometimes find that the smoked salmon is extremely dry, which is sometimes the case for most of the galettes I have ordered from them. But taste wise the galettes are pretty good. For the most part I would recommend all of their sweet crepes as I find that they are consistently delicious and moist. They also sell baguettes if you are looking for something else other than crepes.\n\nIf the Farmer's Market is busy you will find that there will sometimes be a line up, which usually doesn't take too long as their service is always pretty good.\n\nOverall a very great place to order some tasty french staples!
