I've had this dream to be Samurai since I was little. I would to eat sushi, drink Sake' and charm Geisha's all day. Then I would go pillage and fight other Samurais' with a bad-ass sword. Anyways, that never happened but this sushi is really fresh and good so you should eat here. \n\nThe Saki is warm, delicious, and goes well with cold beer. \n\nThe Chef is a awesome, he makes badass sushi. \n\nIf you can't be a Samurai...... Eat here.
