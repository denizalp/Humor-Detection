DING DING DING!!! Chateau wins the prize for douchiest nightclub - EVER!\n\nTheir outdoor dance floor is the most obnoxious place on the Las Vegas strip.  Now think about that statement and let it sink in...\n\nThey BLAST the loudest, worst, techn-pop music into the open air on the strip, keeping the hotel patrons nearby awake till 4am, and generally giving people on the sidewalk a migrane to end all migranes.  \n\nIn addition, they are overpriced, trashy, rude and should be avoided at all costs.  Using violence against your so-called friends who try to insist you should check it out if necessary.\n\nChateau is so bad, the city should actually be ashamed it exists.
