I can't speak for everyone in our large group as far as how they felt about their food, but my fish and chips was the WORST I have ever had!! I love fish and chips and order them often. It doesn't even have to be that good for me to enjoy! If we weren't there with a bunch of my hubby's co-workers I would have returned it!! I didn't even take the leftovers home despite having a convection oven to reheat it it up perfectly. The waitress took the entire meal and never even questioned if there was a problem! Also their \"tarter sauce\" is runny!! I will say the wedge fries were very good! My husband was \"okay\" with his food. I am not interested in ever going back.
