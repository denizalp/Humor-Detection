Now, I don't know about you, but it's hard to be a fancy lady. Luckily, I can shop at The Fancy Fry's. Sure I might be in my sweats and I'll fight you over the last turkey, but at least this place has covered parking and complimentary valet service. Neither of which I've used, but it's the thought that counts. This Fry's thinks about me and my needs. Do I need twenty different types of cheeses? No. Am I going to buy twenty different types of cheeses? Yes. Fry's has got my back (and my wallet) and I'm okay with that. I love this Fry's. \n\nYou can get all your grocery shopping done here since it has many more items the normal Fry's but all at the same low prices. Plus, there's a wine bar, smoothie bar, sushi bar, omelet bar, olive bar, etc. all located within the store. I really love their huge cheese selection and can get caught up in the frenzy of delicious cheese and barely notice half my cart is gouda, smoked cheddar, and brie. (This has happened more than once.) I usually only come here when I need to do some serious shopping because I always spend way more than I would at a regular Fry's since there are so many options. Luckily, I can stock up on essentials and delicious extras. \n\nThis place is an experience and definitely one you should experience at least once. Even our out of town guests beg to be taken here. I know I'll be back - when I run out of gouda.
