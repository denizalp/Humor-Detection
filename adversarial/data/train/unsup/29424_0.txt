Really good and hot food. Lamb was tender and the sauce wasn't heavy or too rich. Basket of bread was wonderful and fresh. Even the rice was delicious. The service was alright for a fancy establishment, but I'm docking off the one star for the wait. If it wasn't for my yelp coupon, I wouldn't of come here. But I think if someone else paid, or I felt like splurging I would definitely come back here. It is worth it.
