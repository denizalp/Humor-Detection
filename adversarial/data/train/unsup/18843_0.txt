I'm absolutely repulsed. We waited for 5 minutes while a hostess helped two elderly ladies find a table, then myself and 4 friends tried to enter at 6:30PM and they wanted to charge each of us a $5 cover for Dinner after we even called ahead to make sure there were seats available for 5 and they never mentioned a cover. We just saw the old ladies before us sit down and not pay any cover. \n\nAnywhere that tries to charge people a cover for dinner is pathetic, the place was empty and there wasn't even any entertainment playing. The hostess couldn't even explain why there was a cover.
