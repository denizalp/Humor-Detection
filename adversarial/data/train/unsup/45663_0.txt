Took my Saturn Vue in for work on an electrical problem. They gave me my vehicle back with unsafe brakes!!! Almost got killed on I17 after I left to go to work they tied up the parts with zip ties! I took my vehicle to a referred mechanic and he solved they problem with brakes and electrical issue. DONT GO HERE FOR AUTO REPAIR! THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING!  Now I am trying to get a refund and the manager is arguing with me about what caused the problem!! Omg just don't go here for anything!
