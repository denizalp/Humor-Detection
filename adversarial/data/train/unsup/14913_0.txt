Gabrielle and Huriel work their ass off to make you feel right at home amongst friends. But don't let the staff contagious good-heartedness, their eccentric crafty decor or disco\/hip-hop infused playlists fool you, the REAL STAR is their inventive, fragrant menu offering. From the zesty kimchi Bloody ceasar to their crisp pork shoulder green curry served with tons of fresh herbs, there's something for every pallet - whether you're vegan or meat lover, looking for generous comfort food or a good spice kick!\n\nP.S: Yelp doesn't want to change the tag set, but Bighi is a multi-ethinic curry restaurant (mostly Japanese, Indian and Thai).
