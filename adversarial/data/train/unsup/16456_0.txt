This area of town just keeps getting better and better!! \n\nThis is the perfect addition to an already booming craft beer scene in the East Phoenix\/Arcadia area. its located right within the Beermuda Triangle (Wren House - Helton- Helio Basin) and satisfies your craft beer needs daily starting at noon. Seriously couldn't have hoped for a better concept to open here. \n\nThey have an amazing craft beer lineup and if you aren't sure you want a whole pint, you can get a half pour or a 4oz taster - I LOVE that. I love to try new things, so this is the best concept as they give me the option to sample without committing to full beers. Oh, and they have a crazy deal of  happy hour daily until 7:30pm - which means $2 off pints, $1 off half-pours, and .50 off the 4oz tasters! I'm actually meeting a friend there in just under an hour to enjoy some of their awesome lineup :) \n\nLast but not least, they have a killer lineup of to-go options reminiscent of when I used to live by Papago Brewing and would always take some beers with me. The place is a great space, cute d√©cor, clean and spacious for being as small as it is, and there is the cutest pup that is always wandering around greeting visitors. \n\nOnly downsides are parking (I usually uber anyways) and the space. I'm sure they'll expand soon as they're super popular and doing amazing things in the beer scene. Can't wait to see what's to come!
