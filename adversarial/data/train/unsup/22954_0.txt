This location is so different than the court house Terroni in the east end. I think I prefer the fast-paced and casual atmosphere at this one, but once in a while it is nice to eat in a jail cell. For fun.\n\nI'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm a carnivore, but the Spaghetti Limone is the tastiest thing on Queen W. It is so fresh, with lemons, spinach, capers*, red onions and heaps of parm chunks. \n\nThe wine is a bit over-priced, but, well, who cares. When having pasta, one must have wine, so they've kind of got you cornered.\n\nPEPPER POINTS: For their stylish magazine. \n\n*Capers can do no wrong.
