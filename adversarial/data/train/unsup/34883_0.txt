There are many good reviews for the park. For me it turned out to be much to far away and there was heavy construction work on the route to the park. This is home building along the Buffalo from 215 to the park. Many trucks and a rough road with numerous 4 way stops that kept me guessing as to whether it was my turn to go. \n\nThe park itself has a nice paved walkway with, but it is broken up with repairs right now. I really didn't get the mountain part mentioned by others since from where I was, it is fenced off with no trespassing signs, on the fence. \n\nThere is a beautiful expanse of grass in the center of the park which is nice. I only glanced at the kids activities and there seems to be many types of gym equipment and structures. Others have reviewed these.\n\nIf you live close, give this park a look. My drive from the north was 30 minutes on 215 so it is really too far for a short visit.
