This is a welcoming church that prides itself on accepting all people in the spirit of Jesus Christ. Regardless of your race, nationality, sexual orientation, social status, etc -- You will be welcomed, loved and accepted.\n\nShawn has 4 reviews, 0 friends, and clearly has never been inside our church. We feed the homeless every Saturday, provide sleeping bags and warm clothes to the homeless, and they join us in the service on Sunday morning. There are homeless sleeping on our porches because we let them. Unlike the alternative of calling the police to have them removed. We take Jesus' teaching to heart. I recommend Shawn come to our church to discover for himself!
