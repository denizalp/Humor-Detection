Tempe location is on the second floor with an elevator available.\nSat on the Mill St side balcony which gives a birds eye view of street action.\nOrdered a Mosaic IPA and Citrus pale ale. Both were very tasty on a warm sunny afternoon.\nFor lunch we ordered the Pecan Chicken and the Pecan Salmon. Both were awesome and done to perfection.\nService was excellent.\nDon't understand why this place is only three stars. Maybe because a bucket of Buds for $6 isn't available.
