Order arrived within stated 1 hr timeframe. Pizza was warm,  not hot. Tasted good though.  We read other people saying they didn't get sour cream with their potato skins so we specifically asked for it. Didn't receive it.  If it weren't for those problems, this place would probably be our pizza go-to.
