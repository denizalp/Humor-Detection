I can't say anything wrong about this place!! I love the nail bar they have which gives the place a unique touch. I get my nail (mani fill) done approximately every 4wks, and I only have my hands done by Kim. **IG @ nailzswag_bykimjordan ** but I have gotten my pedicures by other technicians. Everyone there is really nice and energetic, which makes the place fun. \n\nThey offer water or wine while getting your nails done.. again another really nice touch, and their stamp loyalty card after 10 visits, you get a pedicure up to $25 dollars free (they have specialty pedicures that vary in price). \n\nNow I always come to Kim with a design i like and she has never failed to deliver. The specialty pedicures they have is spa treatment quality!! worth the few extra dollars to have the speciality pedicures. Another unique feature is for the gel manicures, it comes with free paraffin wax treatment on your hands. \n\nThis place offers other treatments aside from nails such as facials, lashes, waxing but I've never come for those. Solid good clean nice spot to go to for nail pampering.
