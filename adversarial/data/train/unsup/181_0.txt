Anyone who sees me can tell that I am not a skater, nor have I ever been one.  But I am a pretty good spectator.\n\nWhile I really have no idea what happens on a regular basis at the skate park - not being particularly hip either - we dropped into see the Battle Slam Jam (number six, if anyone is keeping track).\n\nThe paths around the park were filled with booths, not unlike the other festivals around town, except the artwork is perhaps a different style.  During the day there were several age groups performing in the park itself, X Games style.  Perhaps a bit more organized than a typical day at the park.\n\nEven us old folk felt generally welcomed.
