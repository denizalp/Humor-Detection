For a romantic dinner, this is definitely the place!\nI took my then girlfriend here during our Vegas Valentine's Day excursion. She loved it as much as I did.\nThis place is located within the Stratosphere, and reservations are strongly recommended. Getting to this revolving restaurant involves taking the elevator to the top, and checking in at the desk. Once your table is ready, you will be taken to the revolving restaurant and you will be amazed by the great views. The restaurant rotates at a slow rate, so you will get a change to enjoy the 360 degree view of Las Vegas. The view is especially great at night.\nThe food itself is phenomenal. It is well worth the price, as it is made with the right balance of ingredients. Thus far, I've had the filet mignon and the salmon. To drink, I opt for the pinot noir. I have a glass to take in the view, and another one to accompany my meal. \nThe service is efficient, and the meal comes with many trimmings. I have not yet tried their desserts, but I will update when I do. Chances are, I will come back here on my next Vegas trip, so stay tuned.
