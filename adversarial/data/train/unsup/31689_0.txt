I took my standard poodle in to be groomed.  Nancy was SOOOOOO nice! She was very patient with my dog and he really likes her. This is the second time I have brought him to this Petsmart and it is because of Nancy that we go back. She took the time to listen to exactly what kind of cut we wanted and he looked great when I picked him up!
