Great prices, delicious options.\nTwo sause options, both of which were really tasty.  The bottles on the other hand and the dispenser top were lame but it works.\nI liked the sample before you decide option.  You come in and if this is your first time they allow you to sample a few of the meats before you decide.  Great opportunity to taste before you order.\nSo many great tasting meat options too.  I like the moist beef brisket which is well marbled.  Unfortunately sometimes it has more marbling (fat) that I would prefer.\nYou get what you pay for here.  Meat is cut and weighed and charged accordingly.
