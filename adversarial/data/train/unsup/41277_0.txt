Was also surprised when I came in here and found there weren't many selections on flavors, and even the basic flavor like strawberry they didn't have. More specialty mixed flavors that didn't sound good. To my surprise Yogurtland and U-Swirl are actually way better. Not very clean and trash was to the top.
