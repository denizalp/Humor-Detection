This is the place my neighbors told me to hit up on my first night in the neighborhood, and I've gone back more times than I can count in the past year. Sardinha is a lifesaver on those nights when you get off the subway and just want to pick up something for dinner that requires no work on your part, and head home.\n\nFor a single person, a half chicken is the perfect deal - for around 5 bucks you can have dinner tonight and one or two sandwiches for later (and if you're ambitious, you can use the carcass to make stock!).  If you're looking for a more rounded meal (or are too lazy to make your own side dish) you can get a chicken dinner for under ten bucks that includes your choice of rice with veggies or potato balls (or both).  They always have some inexpensive portugese pada style buns at the register for cheap.  \n\nOther delish dishes include fried fillet of sole, as well as a few other main dishes.  I'll be honest though, I always get the chicken.  When they ask, try saying yes to the hot sauce - live a little - you won't regret it.
