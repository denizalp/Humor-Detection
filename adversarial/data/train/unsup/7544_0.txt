This frozen yogurt shop is more than frozen yogurt! Under one roof you can get dole whip, snow ice, and boba drinks. \n\nI prefer this place over more well known spots because of the flavors they offer. I love their matcha green tea, taro, horchata, and dole whip pineapple frozen yogurt. I like their toppings as well. Some unique toppings they offer are egg pudding and a variety of mochi flavors. The white mochi is always nice and soft; however, I can't say the same for the other flavored mochi. \n\nThey have decent boba here, but the drinks could use some improvement. I got a blended Oreo drink and it was on the watery side. \n\nWhat really impresses me is the customer service here. The owner is very sweet and runs her business well. You can tell because of the employees she hires and trains. The employee I most recently came across was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about their products. They get their yogurt from Honey Hill Farms! I'm glad I found my favorite frozen yogurt in town. \n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n37\/100
