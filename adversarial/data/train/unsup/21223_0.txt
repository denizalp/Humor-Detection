If you're on the prowl for comfort food, this is your place. Black Bear Diner has a lot of hearty menu items that will leave everyone pleased and full. I can never finish any of the entrees I order even the little less options. Service is always family-friendly and the prices are more than reasonable when you see how massive the dishes are. Their dessert is not any different. When you walk-in you get drawn to the behemoth sized dessert options next to the register. The desserts could be split by 2-3 people, that's how big these bad boys are. The newspaper menus make for great conversation starters and the atmosphere is always laid back.
