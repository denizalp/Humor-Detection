I needed to find an honest, reliable and competent person to refoam my 35+ yr old speakers.  I am so pleased that I found Vince and Galaxie Electronics.  He did a truly excellent job in a timely manner.  He also completely checked them out to see if there could be any other issues.  Vince did such a fine job, so I also asked him to check out my Pioneer receiver and turntable.  I then asked him to refurbish my reel-to-reel tape recorder.  All of the work was expertly done and the price was reasonable.  I highly recommend Vince and Galaxie Electronics.  I would not hesitate to have him repair anything.  I am so glad that I found this place !  And it's also great to check out all the vinyl at Jerry's Records while you're there.  They have everything you need.
