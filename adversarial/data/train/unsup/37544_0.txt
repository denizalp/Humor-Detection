I was a little hesitant to try the Buffet at Bellagio...can't say I've had great experiences concerning buffet lines.  But this one in particular is wonderful.  Yes, it is expensive, but the buffet offers copious amounts of delicious food.\n\nOn my first round, I chose shrimp cocktail, spicy tuna rolls, baked sea bass, and miso soup.  I arranged everything artistically on the plate and proceeded to dine.  Let me tell you, the shrimp cocktail was delicious!  The spicy tuna rolls were satisfactory.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sea bass.  The miso soup tasted a little bland, though.\n\nOn my next round, I tried the different pasta dishes, shrimp cocktail (again), and salmon.  I liked everything on my plate this time.\n\nThe desserts were too sweet.  I tried to fried bananas in caramel sauce...at least that's what I think it was.  They were good, but just started to get too sweet.\n\nThe buffet is a great way to fill up without breaking your bank at other more expensive establishments.  And I think it's worth your money for an extremely satisfying meal.
