Pretty cool place! They definitely hit the theme research, I like that they stuck with it through out the restaurant. Your beer testers come in little beaker jars and their lighting is custom with lab flask! Very unique. Not only do they serve different types of beers (not your bud light kind of place) they brew a few different ones themselves. Pretty decent selection! As far as food goes, I wouldn't recommend the tacos, but definitely try a burger! The pub burger to be exact! Huge, pilled on with bacon, eggs, it was delicious! Stop by and give this local place a try! Ohhh and if you can sit in the section with the waiter with the awesome monopoly man mustache, do it! He was very attentive, nice, funny and lets face it, has the coolest mustache I have ever seen! LOL! Im sorry I cant remember his name, but BRI give that guy a raise! :D
