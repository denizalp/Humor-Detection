Don't let the name fool you. This is \"real\" Mexican food. The owner IS from Mexico but her name just happens to be \"America\", cool huh? Typically this isn't my style of fare, but I DID enjoy my beef taco with just meat and cheese.\n\nThe restaurant is in a beautifully restored historic house (as is typical of new CenPho venues). They have a little outdoor patio over looking 7th Street which was way cool.\n\nOne thing that I think should be stressed is that this aint cheap. They sell bottles of Mexican Coke for $2.50, the tacos were like $2.25 each, and chips and salsa were an extra charge.\n\nStill yet another great addition to CenPho!
