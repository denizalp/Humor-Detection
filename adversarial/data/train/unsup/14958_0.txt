SEEDY, SWARTHY, LYING SCUMBAGS work here.  \n\nWe made two pretty significant purchases here on Thursday night, before the mad rush of tourists pummeled the Palazzo.\n\nOur mission for the evening was a night of craps.  Wil mentioned he would leave our shades at the bell desk and we could call the desk at anytime, and they would have it sent up.  Aww, how sweet & considerate.\n\nFast forward to Saturday morning.\n\nBf was on the way to the World Series @ the Rio and wanted to pick up his shades.  He dropped by Optica, he figured Wil forgot to drop it off at the bell desk and he did.  \n\nGuess what?  Wil barely remembered the bf and even put one the purchases BACK into the case to garner another sale.  WTF?!?! \n\nThe other item was still sitting in the back.  BOTH were supposed to be adjusted and put at the bell desk.  \n\nWil admitted it, but not one apology.  Such bad business and just a lack of character.  \n\nVegas has a 24 hour return policy which overrides store policy, too bad that time lapsed.  \n\n1 star for introducing me to jewelry designers bridging over to eyewear.
