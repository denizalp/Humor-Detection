The price you pay for the biryani you get is a steal. The portions usually come with a good amount of meat. The wait is usually never long. The selection of dishes is not great but the prices make up for that. They run out of a lot of the food which can be frustrating as only half the already condensed menu is available. The quality of food is average but you wont be hungry after. Great for a quick dinner idea. One night i was served chicken that was in fact a little raw.
