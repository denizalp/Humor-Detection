Loved how cute this place is!!!!  Not too many seating areas but so darn adorable.  Perfect for crowds of two. We came here on a Saturday around noonish.  I had the sweet potato cake....I was expecting the southern sweet potato but I don't think it was yam or southern sweet potato. The flavor was not as intense but I really enjoyed it.  Frosting wasn't too sweet and it had crumbles of pistachio and ...maybe cookie crumb on top?  I also really loved the green tea macarons. OMG, they were amazing.  I've never bought macarons from a bakery before (I've only baked them myself with average results). But my BFF has had them at other bakeries and she said they are amazing here.  I also tried the taro bun (it was okay) and the mini fried mocha balls (I wouldn't repurchase).  If you eat your items there, they put them on a cute metal tray with cute little forks.
