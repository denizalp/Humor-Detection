I've been to Momocho twice and maybe I just ordered the wrong things but I wasn't that impressed. But then I came here once and was hooked the food and margaritas are so good! The happy hour has good prices on the margarita and the wild boar nachos. I will always wish the salt on the rim was chili-salt whenever I drink a margarita now. The heat mixed with the cool margarita is perfect. That being said I wish they put their margaritas in margarita glasses. Maybe it's a 'twist' modern mexican thing but I like the festiveness of a margarita glass. \nThe machaca taquito is where it's at. With an egg on top and a side of refritos. Papas fritas are good too!
