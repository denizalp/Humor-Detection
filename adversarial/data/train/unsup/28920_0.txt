Absolutely a must go for some delish Poutine. Place made us feel at home, rustic and charming. Servers were the French version of the Brooklyn servers for brunch. A nice flare of French feel while enjoying this house specialty. My son had a Corn Dog, batter made in House and not from a frozen bag. Nice! A great spot to visit while visiting Montreal from NYC.
