I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a while. It's tucked in the corner of the Mirage casino, and bit out-shined in appearance by its flashier neighbors, but this wine bar\/restaurant is definitely worth your time. They have an extensive selection of cheeses, if that's your thing, and my entree (gnocchi w\/ chicken) was the best I've ever had. Service was excellent, and since it's sort of hidden, there was no wait time. Will definitely try to come back when I'm in Vegas again.
