This is seriously the frickity frackin coolest place ever for anyone who remembers all the old school toys you used to play with!  I get pretty nostalgic when i walk in here and see all the Barbie stuff I used to play with.  Or the Rainbow Bright doll I had in the 1st grade.  Or the Care Bears I sold at a family garage sale because I got greedy and wanted the $5 instead!  \n\nIt's just a sight even if you're not intending to buy anything.  It takes you back to the days spent playing with toys instead of perhaps playing on the internet all day (or working, you choose).  I'm sure if you're an avid collector of \"vintage\" toys this is a dream come true for you!  I feel like they have everything across the board from the 50's-today.  \n\nI seriously think I died when I saw the box full of Garbage Pail Kids collector cards.  My mom never allowed me to buy them.  They were so disgusting yet intriguing at the same time!
