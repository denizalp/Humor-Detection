I'm a diehard fan of Southwest. However, have to say I'm a bit disappointed with flights out of Vegas lately. They generally seem to be delayed. \n\nBesides that, I love the seating policy. First come, first serves makes the most sense to me. I'm kind of disappointed that you can now buy your spot in line. Seems like a lot of people do. I always used to be in the A group, but not so much anymore. Oh well. You get what you pay for. \n\nIt's also slightly hilarious that so many people are confused by this line system. It's literally one of the most straightforward boarding systems ever, but people are still wondering around, lining up when they're not supposed to. Silly people. \n\nAnyways, you can't beat the no change fees. Seriously awesome.
