A great idea but taste left me less than happy. Not certain I would return. \nThe seafood didn't seem to absorb keep the spices and flavors. Most of the spices were lost when you remove the shells. \nWhat a mess. I expected that and was okay with that but the tables need to be much bigger if you are multiple dishes. Overall food was very mediocre. I'm not certain I would ever go back as even the rice and seafood dishes were mediocre. Staff was polite but not attentive.
