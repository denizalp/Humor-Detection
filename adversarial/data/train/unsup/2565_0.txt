A few months ago my friend was having a raging party for his bday.  Before the festivities began Verdel recommended we go to this gem of a pizza place.  \n\nI'm a pizza guy.  Little Caesar's...trash, but it gets the job done.  \n\nBut for that night it wasn't about getting the job done, it was about making memories.  \n\nThe most surprising part about this joint is there was not a lot of people.  Good news for me. \n\nNow about this place...ahem.\n\nThe scenery was on point as some of the staff members were babes (automatic star adage) .  The wait period was next to nothing as they went 0 - 100 real quick.  \n\nThe pizza...ahhh the pizza.\n\nThose square pieces were so tasty that it change my reality.   I am a better person because of this experience.  \n\nSo check out.  If any of the staff members read this hit me up.\n\n#babes #squareslicesofdelight
