Four Kegs is a complete dive bar with a separate restaurant area.  This place has character!  The stromboli is amazing here and the service is warm and friendly.\n\nThe stromboli dough is on par with the best I've had anywhere.  Inside you'll find tasty, fresh cheese, delicious marinara, and good ham and sausage.  \n\nNOTE: If two of you are getting a boli then be sure to save $ and split a large instead of getting two smalls (you'll end up with the same amount of stromboli).  \n\nAnd please say hi to Noriko, she usually serves us and she is the nicest little Japanese lady you can imagine.
