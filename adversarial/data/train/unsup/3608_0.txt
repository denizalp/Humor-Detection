I took a chance based on the Yelp reviews and headed over with no expectations.  The decor was boring, the lighting harsh, and the service was anything but professional.  So far, just what I expected another bad pizza joint. But wait, the pizza was actually quite good. I'm originally from Montreal and know good pizza and pretty much gave up on Toronto on that subject. Not like what you would find in Montreal, but definitely good and definitely Italian thin crust (ask for thin crust).\nWhen I got into my car to take my pizza home, I noticed an unusual smell, the smell was something i wasn't  use to in Toronto, the smell of good pizza.\nThe ingredients seemed extremely fresh, flavorful, plentiful  including the olives which were amazing. I would definitely go back.\nI watched as they made my pizza,  you can see the pride they put into each pizza. Like the French they treat your pizza with a lot of respect.They even showed it to me before they closed the box, a nice touch.\nAll this for an eight dollar personal sized pizza.\nFive stars for sure, I'm not sure it was real or a dream, so I am playing it safe until my next visit.\n\nUPDATE: Been back a second time and it was better than the first if that is possible.  I don't live any where close to this place yet I find myself getting the urge to go for a drive for a pie.  Its real good!
