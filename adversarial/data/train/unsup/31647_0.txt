Every time I'm in Mississauga I stop by Oceans. They have a great selection of fruits & vegetables, baked goods, and hot foods. \n  My favourite things to buy is the sushi and breads. I usually pick up a volcano roll, which is really cheap compared to other grocery stores, and their pork floss bun. Trust me, it's much better then it sounds ;)\n  Selection of foods here are great, and lost items such as produce and hot foods are at a fair price. Overall this is one of my favourite Asian grocery stores in Mississauga, and Ill definitely be coming here for many years to come!
