Dervish grill serves the juiciest, most tender, tastiest kebabs known to the greater Cleveland area, and perhaps the world. It doesn't matter if you order chicken, beef or lamb. I just love how the kebabs mix together with the rice pilaf, shredded lettuce and the little grilled pepper they add on the side. I do beat that little pepper with a passion and mix it with everything, to add FIERY heat to the whole ensemble. So good, like a whirling dervish on your taste buds\n\nThis is the same Dervish that used to be in Avon. I have not been here in a while, but in the previous location, I had them on speed dial for take out orders. I have yet to set foot on the new Tremont location, but I'm overdue for a visit, and it's one of the places I definitely miss.
