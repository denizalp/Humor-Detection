I've been here a couple of times. The good: food is decent. Good location to downtown events. Nice patio. The bad: The quality of service leaves something to be desired. It is slow and sometimes non-existstant. Some of the servers should be more friendly and take more enjoyment in their jobs. Overall, this place is okay. Will definitely give it another shot.
