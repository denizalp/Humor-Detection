A stark contrast to the sushi restaurant just a few doors down.\n\nWe came here as a group for AYCE sushi dinner: $25\/per person including tax and tip.\n\nThe quality is definitely not great, and they are definitely not legitimately Japanese (all of their staff speak Cantonese as far as I heard), but my friends wanted all you can eat--- which Japango does not offer. \n\nThis place is always packed. The sushi that they serve just tasted cheap. Nothing really stood out, the quality is not top notch but it's not absolutely terrible. All the rolls fall apart and the cooked food arrived warm instead of hot. Instead of serving their udon in bowls, they serve them in dishes so you barely get any noodles. The chicken teriyaki is overcooked and dry, and every time we ordered beef ribs, they'd give us at least two pieces of just bone. However, I did like that they actually had Ika as an option on their sushi list, and they always gave us everything we ordered.\n\nI don't think I'd come back here for AYCE, but I've had their bento boxes and they are not bad. I would come back if I was desperate for sushi and the good places were closed. It was definitely a 'meh' experience. \n\nBONUS: Their washrooms are really gross.
