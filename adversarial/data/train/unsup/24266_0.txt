I thought I was trying them for the first time yesterday, but it was actually the second.\n\nOming's Kitchen is a Las Vegas food truck dishing out Filipino cuisine. They've been at Great American Foodie Fest several times, and my friend was interested in trying them today. I didn't even remember having them before, so I guess that's the kind of impression that they left at that point.\n\nThey didn't have the sandwich that I evidently tried last time, so it was pretty obvious that we had to get the Pork Belly Combo ($13 at event premium price). This is a rice bowl with their signature pork belly and six lumpia. The pork belly was still more chewier than it really should be, but it was tender enough that I didn't mind. The sweet sauce on the pork belly was excellent and carried the dish. The rice was cooked properly, which is to be expected if not demanded. As for the lumpia, they're tiny, thin and vegetarian, but they lend enough crunch and flavor that they're enjoyable.\n\nThis is a proper four-star rating this time for Oming's Kitchen. They're not perfect, but they're one of the better food trucks at Great American Foodie Fest and in Las Vegas in general.
