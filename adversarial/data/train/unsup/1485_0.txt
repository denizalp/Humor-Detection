\"We're jammin...i want to jam it with you!\" Do you remember those insipid Bob Marley lyrics resonating from the rafters of the Put In Bay bar on the west end of Lakewood? Well, you can still hear them, but now it's a late night pizza joint\/ college bar. I've heard of Guys before as a pizza franchise, but this one is a unique venture. I just went in for a 1 a.m. pie. The adjoining bar, replete with obnoxious Monster energy drink neon sign and \"guido party lights\" almost made me lose my appetite. \n\nThe pies were average(dough a little tough, generous toppings), breadsticks were a bit plain. They were part of a coupon deal that saved me nine bucks all together. And bringing an idea i'd only heard of in actual college towns, they deliver beer. I don't know if that's been tried here before or until what time they can actually carry this out. All i know is certain Cleveland city councilmen and local sports anchors need to move to Lakewood to get in on this  suspended license-dodging miracle service.\n\nI like the late night pie competition on that end of town. This place has the added benefit of letting one relive some of their worst college era shenanigans as well. Where's my Buckeye  necklace...
