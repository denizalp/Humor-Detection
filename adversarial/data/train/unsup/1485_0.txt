The low score isn't for the food. It gets 4 stars. The service from my cashier, 5 stars. Very helpful. The cook\/manager flat refused to make a substitution of the meat on an order of nachos. Not closing time, only one other customer in the restaurant. Her response was \"no\". Offered to pay difference if there was a cost difference. Still no. It wasn't for something unusual , just something other than carne asade. So it's time to find a restaurant that can make carnitas or chili verde nachos because you won't get them or anything special at Tony's.
