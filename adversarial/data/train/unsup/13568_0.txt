Tried this place out a few weeks ago.  Other than the 8:30 start time Saturday morning, I had a great time out there.  From reading some of the reviews of people who have had bad things to say about this place, here are some of the points I will make in defense of this establishment to refute some of the complaints:\n\nComplaint 1: They don't really let you drive the car to the max.  \nResponse: I didn't really think this was the case myself.  The instructor who rode along with me really wanted me to have a good time and didn't really \"hold me back\" from pushing the car hard.  For those who think they are an expert in driving a Ferrari, if you WERE an expert in driving Ferraris, you wouldn't have to come here because you'd either have one, or already be a race car driver.\n\nComplaint 2: The instructors get too involved and grab the wheel too much.  \nResponse: Again, this didn't happen to me at all.  But furthermore, these cars cost a lot and people can get hurt doing this.  Duh...some limits are to be expected.  This still is America.  Land of the free and home of the litigious.  If you really thought that they'd just let you go hog wild in a $200,000 car without someone in there with you, I've got some great swampland to show you in Florida.\n\nComplaint 3: It is a rip off.  \nResponse: Until there is another place in Vegas that will provide the same cars, level of 1 on 1 service, and a secure closed road course, it is hard to call this place a rip off.  A Monopoly perhaps, but not really a rip off.  After all, no one needs to drive these cars at 110MPH.  The place wouldn't have been so packed if it was truly  a rip off.  \n\nEveryone in my group seemed to have a great time.  The only thing I regret they didn't tell us more aggressively is that 5 additional laps would have only been $50 more dollars.  I didn't realize this until after I had driven my 5 laps.  $249 for 5 or $299 for 10.  You do the math.
