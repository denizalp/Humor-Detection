I have been a pretty intense aquarist my entire life basically. I've set up everything from a nano tank, to a 3,000 gallon reef tank, so when I moved out to Arizona the first thing I did was look for a decent aquarium shop. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that in the east valley there are actually a few really good options. This was actually the 3rd family owned shop that I checked out because if you are into the hobby of fish, big chains are the worst. \n\nOver the last year or so I have gotten to recognize the staff and really enjoy talking to them when I make my monthly pick up of some RO and Salt water as well as making some good purchases. \n\nThis is a quality shop with quality supplies. As far as Mom and Pop shops go this a great one. They are kind, knowledgeable and have a great stock of all sorts of animals. I highly encourage anyone to stop in and just have a chat with these guys about your next pet purchase.
