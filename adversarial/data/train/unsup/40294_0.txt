I like bringing the kids here because they seem to have better deals like timed game cards and reasonably priced. The food is Ok. The reason for the three stars is that we like the Retro games better but most of them are broken. Like on the Street Fighter game one of the joysticks, the up function will not work or the forward function or some of the buttons simply won't work. We've been there several times and they remain the same. Maybe next time we will let the employees know.
