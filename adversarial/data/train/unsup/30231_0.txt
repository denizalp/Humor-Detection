It's a great destination to have fun with the family, friends or colleges. The food is good, service solid and has a great variety of drinks. The only problem that keeps it from a five rating is the nickel and dimming. If you don't have your card (prior visitors), you pay $1 to replace it. I tried ordering just a hamburger patty with cheese, they couldn't do it. I was forced and charged for a full meal which included fries, bun and other dressings. All I was given was the patty. Oh well, the golf made up for the inconvenience.
