I had dinner here a week or two ago and will absolutely come back next time I'm at the Golden Nugget. I ordered the tomato basil soup and it was delicious. The service was great, and we were seated right by the window wall overlooking the pool and fish tank. I felt pretty damn classy drinking soup as I watched sharks swim around in the tank. The only qualm I have are the servings--or lack thereof. My friend ordered pasta (forgot which kind, it was greenish though) and her dish was considerably pricier than mine and the amount of pasta she got was laughable. Like I literally laughed when it was brought over because it was more appropriate for it to be served to an elf. Maybe I'm used to bigass American portions, but if I order pasta for $15 I'd prefer there to more than a few forkfuls. Overall though it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
