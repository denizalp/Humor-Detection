Very much worth it, \"if\" you go at least 3 times!  You can actually get 4 meals out of it...just get in any buffet line around 8pm and once you purchase your meal pass (which is loaded on your player's card) at the cashier, you get 24 hours to use it from that moment.  So, if you purchase at 8:30pm, the pass expires at 8:30pm the following day!  You MUST go through the cashier before 8:30pm the next day...so if you are stuck in line and the meal pass expires...you are out of luck.  Stay away from the Planet Hollywood and Flamingo buffet.  Harrah's and Rio (Carnival) buffets are excellent for any meal...YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!  You can purchase your buffet pass Sunday, starting at 11am and until Thursday evening for $49.99 + tax, \"if\" you have a player's card (I don't see why you wouldn't have one).  You can also purchase a kid's meal pass for $49.99 and the kid's are given a wrist band around their wrist, which has a barcode attached to it (good for 24 hours).\n\nWeekend prices are $15 - $20 more!
