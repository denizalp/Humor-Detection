I've been cleaning my house all the time and i just don't have the time to do it anymore. The first company I've called they offered a two hour cleaning. I was pretty excited. By the time I got home I couldn't seem to find any of important papers laying out on my desk. So I tried going to speak to them personally but they didn't have an office. So by then I wasn't so sure if they were a trustworthy company. Just last week I've decided to call Rhinos Maid. Their deep clean special was more suitable and I got more out of it than what I got from the last company. So from the previous experience I was pretty relieved that they had an office so I could speak to them face to face but overall it was just a way better experience and I really appreciate them for that. Plus I got a good deal for Bi-weekly deal :-)
