The last two Saturdays I have stopped at The Diner on Clifton and got something I never had here before: a burger. And, folks, I'm shocked to be saying this, but it was the best burger I've ever had in Cleveland. Yes, better than Five Guys (easy), Brown Bag (easy), Swenson's (not even close), Heck's (pretty easy), Whitey's (not even close), Bearden's (you jest), and, finally, B Spot (please don't tell Michael). Yes, I have blasphemed. So sue me. No, haven't tried the burger at Little Bar yet but will. \n\nIt was SO good last week that I had to try it again today, and it was not a fluke. It's big, it's juicy, it's dressed to perfection, and it reminds me of why I fell in love with great burgers back when Manners was doing it right. Or at least my youthful taste buds thought they were.\n\nIf you love a good burger and never tried one at The Diner, treat yourself and give it a go. I'm betting your first one won't be your last. \n\nJust one more reason The Diner is one of my favorite casual spots in Cleveland.
