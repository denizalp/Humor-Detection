I'm lucky.  I have a friend who has a grandfather who has an affinity for making money.  And is generous.  And is the shit, in general.  He has a penthouse suite in Tower 2 and we stayed there for one night before moving to our more meager rooms in normal MGM.  Let's just say, this place is baller.\n\nThere are 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms.  The master bath has a humongous jet-filled hot tub like bath as well as plenty of sink area.  The second room has a pull out bed and a dining room table.  Plus a fantastic view.  The kitchen has everything you need, from appliances to silverware to awesome cappuccino style coffee cups.  Given, we ate microwave burritos on the plates and black coffee in the cups, but they tasted more delicious because of it.\n\nOh, and did I mention that  in the main bedroom there is a TV that comes out of the desk?  Yes, it comes out of the motherf***ing desk.  BALLER STYLE.  Even the artwork was unique and beautiful.  Staying at a place like this makes me start to understand why young girls like myself go after older men with money.  It's starting to all make sense...
