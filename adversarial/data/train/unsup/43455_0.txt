Very disappointed...the place is very nice but I'm not sure about the management and technicians!\nI had an appointment for gel manicure and regular pedicure. The pedicure was ok..not perfect but ok. Gel manicure was a disaster! I asked for specific color and the technician started applying it without even preparing my nails( clean the dead skin or file them..). At some point I realized that something was wrong with the gel..well...it was a regular nail polish!!!!! I noticed and pointed out!!! She didn't even know. I expected more experienced technicians..it took me three hours to get done and I wasn't even pleased...not going back!!!!
