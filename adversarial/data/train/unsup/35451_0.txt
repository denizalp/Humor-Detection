1 word: Mmmmmmmmm! Though they don't have the greatest variety of goodies, you will be hard pressed to find better made and surprisingly rich items. They are most famous for their almond tortes- I first tried one at a party- and they do not disappoint. From pastries to tortes to cakes, every goodie I have tried has been close to exceptional. One suggestion I would have is for them to make a larger variety of croissants, as the chocolate ones are the only ones they have. A great little place to stop in on the weekend for a treat.
