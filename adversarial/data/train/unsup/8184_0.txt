It's true that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Especially what happens at a Vegas bachelor party, but this story is too good not to share.\n\nLast day of my week-long Vegas stag party.  Most of the gang already broke out early in the morning, but half a dozen of us diehards have evening flights home and we're gonna get in one more round of blackjack, Crown Royal and T&A.\n\nEarly morning the Rio treated us somewhat nicely at the BJ tables so we had a decent grip of cash to rain with.  About 10am we head out for breakfast, but the limo driver from last night just happens to be pulling up to the curb and recognizes us.  We couldn't say no.\n\nSo we had him take us directly to the nearest titty bar.  The only thing open at that time was Treasures so we head over.  1st points in their favor is they comp us the entire cover when they find out it's my bachelor party.  Only thing is, the place is like a freaking funeral home.  No lights.  No music.  No girls.\n\nUs: Is this place really open??\nHostess: Oh yeah, just come on in!\n\nSo my boy Hap walks past the entryway into the main room as we follow.  Still, dead silence.  \"What, does this fucking place run on headphones or something?\" he asks.\n\nHap almost breaks his neck tripping over a big object in the darkness.  Turns out it's a passed out dude.  \"Oh never mind him,\" says the hostess, \"That's Dan.  He's been here since last night.\n\nThe fuck?  Whatever.\n\nAll of a sudden, the lights turn on, the music starts thumping, we're whisked into plush seats right up against the stage, and a bikini clad blond materializes in my lap like she just came out one of them Star Trek Transporter shits.\n\nFreaking awesome.  I imagine somewhere in the back there's a panel with a switch that says \"Off\" on one side and \"Music, Lights, Tits\" on the other.  Shit was amazing.\n\nWe quickly dispatched a bottle of Crown as the girls came crawling out the woodwork and onto the stage.  Good times, although the one single mom attached to my lap was really starting to put me in a deep sleep with her neverending dreams of going back to school.  Luckily, it was eventually her turn to go up onstage.\n\nAt one point they put on \"With Arms Wide Open\" by Creed and I jumped on stage and belted out a few lines (with my arms wide open, of course) before the manager came and escorted me down.\n\nAs we were about to leave, there was more humor to be had.  A stripper marches into the joint and confronts the manager.  They exchange harsh words and she goes storming off.  A few minutes later Mr. Manager has some security dude go after her.  We go outside to see what's up and girl is a couple hundred yards out, buck nekked except for a bikini top, 5 inch heels and a strip of floss between her legs -- running across the desert in the middle of the day.\n\nSecurity dude jumps in his pickup and starts coming after her.\n\nShe speeds up.\n\nTrips on something.\n\nEats it, face first.\n\nFuck, heels must be murder to run in.\n\np.s.: To Ryan H. - I feel you on the grip of money you burn through at titty bars, but as far as pervs, most people really don't go to these upscale joints 'cause of that.  The pervs get their diddle on at the seedy little local joints.  I'm not a huge titty bar fan, but the fun is in throwing a few dollars around and acting like you got it like that.  Don't nobody really live like that.  Paying double for drinks and cover isn't exactly my idea of a great evening out, but where else can you throw down a few twenties and motorboat a hot gal while she tries to grind your nuts into jelly?
