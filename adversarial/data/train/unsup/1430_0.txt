I walked into Karl's Quality Bakery looking for something small like a donut, or a  cookie.  Little did I know I'd be walking out with 2 cookies, 2 bran muffins, 2 Ham and cheese danish, and a partridge in a pear tree (not really).  That's the beauty with these delicious bakeries.....everything just looks so good!  \n\nKarl's has a nice selection of freshly baked goodies.  I don't know that many bakeries that serve up such good pastries.  I apparently came in too early and wasn't able to experience their wide selection of awesomeness and what they bring out on a daily basis. Like the terminator says...\"Ill be back\"\n\nI give them high marks for the inexpensive menu, quality of food, and the friendly service.  Be sure to check out The Baker's Daughter next door :)
