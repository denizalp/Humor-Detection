This is a must when you are in Vegas! The slut is so delicious with potato pur√©e mixed with a coddled egg and spread over toast spears.  But, that's the just the breakfast appetizer... you must also order the Fairfax sandwich. It's got just enough kick with the sriracha mayo and the scrambled eggs are so fluffy and mix so well with the cheese. YUMMY! \n\nAnd don't get discouraged by the long line, it moves quickly and is sooo worth the wait.
