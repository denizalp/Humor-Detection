We've been going to this place for a couple years now. We ran into an incident where they forgot to clip my dogs nails, but they quickly fixed it by having my dog get brought in to get his nails clipped and we got a complimentary bath. We gave them another chance, but it was a mistake. We took him to get a bath last week and noticed his ears weren't clean once we came home. I told one of the employees, Samantha, about it, but she said it's just how their ear cleaner works, they use an oil where it dissolved any wax in the ear canal and when they shake their head, it brings it up. She then said \"meaning anything your seeing means the ear solution is doing its job.\" A week later and my dogs ears are red and infected. He lives in the house, so he couldn't have gotten it from being outside. That will be the last time we go to this place.
