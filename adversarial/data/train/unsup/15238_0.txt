Why I opted to get a sandwich from a Cinnabon is literally beyond my own comprehension. Alas, I made my sandwich bed, and I had to lie (lay?) in it. \n\nService was deplorable. The employees were obviously closing in 15 minutes and couldn't wait to rush me out of there. When she went to make my sandwich, I literally cringed while I watched her put it together -- grabbing pre-sliced cinnabon-esque bread rolls from a tupperware container, peeling slimy layers of turkey from a cold cut container, slapping it all together and tossing it in a high-speed mircowave.\n\nDespite witnessing this all first-hand, I ate it.\n\nDespite knowing what was in it and how it was prepared, I enjoyed it.\n\nMaybe it was delirium from spending a week in Vegas?\n\nMaybe it was temporary insanity from playing slots at an airport?\n\nRegardless - it earns the additional star. I mean, the worst stuff always tastes the best, right? It actually tasted pretty good. Which grosses me out. Notwithstanding the fact that I went to Vegas in October, it's now December, and that sandwich is still probably coating the inside of my intestines at this very second. You're welcome for the visual.\n\nDon't go here, even in desperation, for a sandwich.
