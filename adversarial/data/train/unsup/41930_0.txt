Want to spend FOREVER with the Keystone Cops of customer service?  Get this service. Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic...did I mention this is the most pathetic service you can imagine?  No matter what anyone tells you about this service if it sounds good...it's a lie.  You enter your info. When they pass you off (always the case) from customer service to technical service to sales to customer service to technical service YOU HAVE TO REPEAT ALL YOUR INFORMATION DVERY TIME...and why you are calling!  Horrible experience!
