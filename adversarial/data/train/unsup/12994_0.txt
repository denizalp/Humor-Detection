I couldn't believe I had yet to write a review for Burger Bar when I went to make a list of burger places. My humble apologies Burger Bar. \n\nLocated in between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, this joint has a plethora of add ons and options for you to create your own masterpiece. Much like El Guapo had presents in Three Amigos! \n\nMy choice of late has been a simple Ridgefield beef(don't splurge on the Kobe or anything special) with Swiss, caramelized onions, portabello and the red wine and shallot reduction. Which, we found out the reduction has veal in it, so it is not vegetarian, much to Dallas G's consternation. Don't get the burger cooked anymore than medium. It comes out perfect this way. Their sweet potato fries are really good too. They have a great beer selection as well. Dessert options are many, but I have been to full to try any of them. I have had the Peanut Butter shake, which is to die for. You can go a little over board on the price of your burger depending on the add ons and the amount you get. This is a staple on any of our Vegas trips. In fact, I don't think there has been one where we have not gone.
