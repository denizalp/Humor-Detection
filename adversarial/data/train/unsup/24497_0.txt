Love the changes guys.  I've been back since the remodel, but this is the first time I have in the bar and not dining area.  Very busy, yet immediately greeted by a man who was busy and heading to do something elsewhere, yet took the time to greet us.  Annie, our server was fantastic especially for being absolutely on the go.  You are appreciated.  \n\nWine list fantastic for a local spot and they serve locally brewed beers, which I will try the Joesph James Citra Rye, a local Henderson beer!  My uncle loved it so note for next time.  \n\nAll the seasonal seafood is located inside of the daily printed menus and since the changes, I haven't had a bad experience.  Today's special was the Lobster.  Usually, I go w\/ the swordfish, but today the Sesame Crusted Yellowfin Tuna was calling me and it was cooked to perfection.  The Chef Mark was delivering food, which was a nice touch.  I like that.  Also I noticed that the delish Shrimp Po'Boy was not on the menu.  Hope they bring it back.  They also serve seafood pasta dishes, sushi and fresh oysters.  Thanks for a great time and great wine on a beautiful evening w\/ the Florida fam.
