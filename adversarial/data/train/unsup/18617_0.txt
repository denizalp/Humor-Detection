I usually try to visit this place on Tuesday's because their burgers are only $2.00 plus $.50 for cheese.  A basket of fries which is enough to feed 2 is only $3.00.  It can't be beat.  I usually go when I take my lunch break from work with a fellow co-worker and friend.  Another reason that I like this place is that they give you a carafe of soda so you don't run out.  They do have a decent Happy Hour which is mostly only discounts off beers.   But they are cool because they have Blue Moon on tap.  Their mixed drinks are more expense than most bars that I visit.\n\nThe regular patrons that I see in the place seem all to be retired because they are always talking about their golf game or when they are going to golf next.  When one enters the place one of the bartender's automatically know their drink and have it ready for them by the time they take a seat.  It is a pretty laid back environment 2 guys that seem to run the place are usually hanging out at the bar.
