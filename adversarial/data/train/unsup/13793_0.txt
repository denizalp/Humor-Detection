Fantastic food, staff is always very friendly. I like the fact it's an intimate setting and you can hear yourself and have a conversation over great food. The meats are of good quality and plentiful. After all most people do go to a steakhouse for meat. There is virtually no wait time between new meat being offered at the table and they aren't stingy with the portions. I have had lunch and dinner here and both are exceptionally well. The interior is decorated nicely and you could come casual or dressed up. Keep up the good work. A definite must eat in Henderson.
