I have been here 3 times and it hasn't disappointed yet. \"El Vaquero\" quesadilla is great! Take note that it is spicy. The sangria is delicious as well . Seated outside with no wait on a Sunday at 5:30 pm. We had our two boys with us who are very well behaved and both had their chicken quesadillas with fruit. Out of the 3 times I have been here it has not been a \"McDonald's playground\" as someone else wrote.
