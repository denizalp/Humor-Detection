Like Lex, I too got a voucher for teeth whitening. I'm not sure if personality is a requirement for working there but the receptionist lacked it, almost like Napoleon Dynamite's girlfriend. Awkward...\n\nI got in the room and went through the same process as Lex... It was nice, until another client walked in for their teeth whitening session. Also awkward...\n\nMy results: Like Lex, the bottom of my teeth were considerably lighter than the entire tooth. \n\nDeparture: \n\"*Cue in the sales pitch* \"... We recommend two more treatments... Blah, blah, blah\" \"No thank you\"\n\"... Whitening pen, Limited time only, blah, blah, blah\" \n\"No thank you\" \nIt was at that point that she gave me the side eye and dropped her hand as if to say \"Whatever!\" \n\nBottom line: I won't be returning.
