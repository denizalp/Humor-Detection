One of the first improvements I wanted to add after buying my home was an automated garage door opener.  The only thing is I had no idea what kind of horsepower the opener would need or what features should be included.\n\nThe team at Barmac listened to what I wanted to do, then asked some questions about my garage and the door in particular.  Thanks to their help, I had no problem choosing an opener that works just the way I want.  They even explained how the installation would go using terms that I could understand.  \n\nIf you aren't a technical person and just know how you want something to work, I recommend talking to the people at Barmac.  They listen and make suggestions based on what you want instead of pushing a product of the week.  If I ever need a new garage door or anything else they sell, Barmac will get my business.
