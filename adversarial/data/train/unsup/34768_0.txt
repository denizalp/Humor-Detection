I was not approved for the Apt. However they have kept my deposit of 200.00 dollars for near a month, and do not seem to intend to return it,. They issued a check payable to three people,.only two of us actually applied., and when I try to let them know my bank does not accept the third party check,.they are refusing to give me a clear answer.
