Wow!! Where to start!! My boyfriend took me here for our date night, first time for us both!! The second we walked in, there were nothing but warm genuine welcomes!! Had the mussels and mozzarella ball appetizer, both very tasty!! Entrees were the bolognese and sea scallops....yet again incredibly good!! Not only was the food great, the service was fantastic!! From someone in the restaurant industry, it exceeded my expectations!! Thank you! And we will be returning!
