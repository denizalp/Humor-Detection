I'm stuck between choosing between a 3 and a 4 star because this place was good, but there many things that could be improved upon. I love the whole concept of getting your dessert served on a boiling plate and then pouring your cream onto your brownie or waffles (their specialty dish). This makes for very cool instagram and snapchat stories. I got the waffle with the green tea, vanilla cream and the fruits as the topping ($8.50). It was quite hard to decide because their ice cream flavours all seemed very good (vanilla cardamom, coffee milk tea, green tea). The presentation was nice; pouring the hot cream on the plate was fun. I did wish that the cream wasn't all evaporated because I would have wanted to eat more of it with my waffle. The waffle was a bit too bland and could have been sweeter. The green ice cream was bland as well. It had the matcha taste but wasn't as creamy and sweet as it should be. \n\nWhat was really annoying was I had to get out of my seat several times to see what ice cream flavours were available for the day etc. I would suggest maybe placing another board on the wall with the ice cream flavours on the opposite wall in the restaurant so the people seated beside the bar, further in the restaurant, can see what flavours are available for the day. Also service was fine, but the server didn't bother filling up our water glasses until we asked her. After that, she seemed to keep on coming to our table to refill our glass.\n\nI will probably come back again and hopefully I can change this review to four stars.
