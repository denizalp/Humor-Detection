I stayed with Cavalier Cleaners too long and now it's time to find a different dry cleaner. The last few times they have been careless.  There have been problems with 4 of my husband's dress shirts and he had to throw one away. These are expensive shirts too.  The employees are unfriendly and don't care.  If you need any type of sewing\/mending, it takes 2-3 weeks. They may be cheaper but their quality is poor.
