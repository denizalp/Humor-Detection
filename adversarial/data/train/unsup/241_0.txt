\"Natural cut\" french fries are worth the visit - there's a heap of potatoes under the cutter and after you order then put one through the cutter and into the frier, and they come out piping hot and full of actual potato flavor.  So simple, I know, but so much better than just about any other place that serves french fries.\n\nSonoran root beer is available here, and you have to love a place that has a separate dedicated tap for root beer on draft.\n\nService was incredibly warm and friendly, and the atmosphere was upbeat and very, very clean.  \n\nGrilled cheese was fairly good, and the onion rings and fried 'shrooms are next on my \"to try\" list for this place.  \n\nOnly minor complaint is that you're ordering a la carte and the portions could be bigger in this case.  Right now, order your dog or grilled cheese and it's pretty much \"add a fries and drink for $4\" which you rarely see for just a small side of fries and drink that are paired with a main course lunch entree.  A combo would be nice, or if you're going to pay a la carte prices then I think it ought to be a larger portion.
