This was my first time going to this particular nail salon. The lady doing my nails was very rude. When I asked her if she could do a design, she refused to do it. She unevenly filed the dip nail polish after it was complete. My nails looked patchy and horrible. Less than 1 week and half of them have chipped. I will never go back to this nail salon.
