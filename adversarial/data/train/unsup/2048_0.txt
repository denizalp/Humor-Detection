My husband and I went there this summer to get limo tint on both our daily drivers, and at the very last minute decided to fix the back window of our Mustang as well.  They were very quick and efficient  and after a phone call or two, the musical cars began.  When we arrived for the pick up of the the final vehicle (the Mustang), they gave us the price and we knew that something wasn't right.  How could a back window re-tinting cost the same as a full window tint..............perplexed?  They ACCIDENTALLY re-tinted the ENTIRE car!  Were we supposed to pay for that?  Would they?  Before we could even say a word, they admitted fault and paid for the tinting!  Score for us, sucks for them........I'm definitely not complaining! \n=)\nThey do exceptional work in a short amount of time, and I'd recommend them!
