We found ourselves in Medina. Decided to look for a place to eat dinner.  Went on Yelp found PJ's. encouraged by the good reviews. Decided to try. \n\nCool space. Old bank. Done up very cool. Sat at the bar. Watched the Tribe game and ordered dinner and drinks. They have root beer on tap. That's kinda cool. So ordered it. Also my friend had a McKenzies cider that's great not many bars carry McKenzies. So far so good! \n\nGot 2 burgers with pretzel buns and opted for the homemade onion rings over fries. You have a choice between 1\/3 # and 1\/2 #. I and my friend got the 1\/3#. Burger was good. Very tastee. Good flavor. The only real down point was the pretzel bun. It was too big. Too much bread. Had to pull some of it off the burger. Maybe the 1\/2 # the proportion is better with bread to burger ratio. \nShoutout to the onion rings. They were really good. Great choice.  \n\nAll in all good experience. I'd go back. Try something else. Definitely worth a stop! Just go for larger burger to not have so much bread. LOL!
