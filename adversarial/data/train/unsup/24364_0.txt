(TL;DR - extra crispy and moist chicken fingers and a unique sauce selection for the sauce advocate. Wasabi cream is what sauce dreams are made of!)\n\nAs far as chicken fingers goes, this place is the place to be. I'm not often finding myself craving chicken fingers, but it's a simple and no-fuss type of meal.\n\nWe went with the 6 piece fried chicken finger combo with garlic bread, and added a side of fries, baked mac and cheese, and extra, extra sauce. The chicken fingers were simple, nicely seasoned, super crispy, and surprisingly moist inside. You can also opt for baked or grilled chicken and add vegetables for a lighter fare.\n\nThe side of fries was a heaping size. They topped off an entire to-go container. They were standard shoe string fries, crispy and simple. I loved dipping my fries in their sauces. Also, the baked mac and cheese was bubbling hot, comforting, and very cheesy. We enjoyed every cheesy bite. \n\nMy favorite thing about this place is definitely their sauces! They have a great variety of unique sauces. We tried the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and sweet chili. The wasabi cream and honey mustard were both delicious, but the wasabi cream is what dreams are made of! It had a sophisticated flavor, like it was from a classy upscale dining establishment. I dunked all of my fries and chicken into that sauce, it was incredible. On the other hand, I didn't care for the sweet chili too much. It tasted artificial and bottled to me, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. \n\nFast, easy, and cheap comfort food, plus friendly service! A good reason to stop in again to try their other sauces!
