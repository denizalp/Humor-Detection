I went this past Saturday around 12:30pm. The place was nearly packed, but my girlfriend and I got a table and were seated within a few minutes.\n\nIn terms of positives, the food was presented really nicely and tasted really good. We got the Benedicto on Brioche and the Galette méditerranéenne (prosciutto, tomato, basil and mozzarella inside a crepe).\n\nIn terms of negative, the food wasn't too filling and the service was pretty slow. There only seemed to be 2 waiters amongst the dozen or so tables, and our waiter only came to us every 15 or 20 minutes. At the very end, when we wanted to order a dessert and an almond croissant, one of the waiters cleaned tables for nearly 15 minutes before we caught his attention.\n\nAll in all, I might come back for a date - a bit too fancy to just have casual brunch with a friend. But otherwise, I don't expect myself to come back too many times.
