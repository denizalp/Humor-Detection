Stopped in with my girlfriend for a late lunch. We hadn't been and didn't really know what to expect. It is a charming space and we were greeted warmly and immediately by the owner Abdul. \nWe decided to dine in and were immediately served water and hot tea, flat bread, olives, and a warm spiced carrot salad! Very nice.\nHe gave us a quick run down of Moroccan cuisine and we were ready in a fairly short time. My girlfriend chose the lamb and I chose the beef. \nThe meals were served with a generous helping of cous cous, and both entree's served in tajines which were layered with steamed vegetables and our choice meats.\n\nBottom line, the meals were delicious, hearty, and reasonably priced. The beef could have gone a little longer as the fat hadn't completely rendered and it was a bit tough but otherwise flavorful and enjoyable. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was inviting and very comfortable. \n\nAbdul also offered us date shakes which were rich and yummy!\n\nGreat place. Would recommend and will return many times!!!
