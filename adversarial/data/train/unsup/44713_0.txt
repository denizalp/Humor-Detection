My husband and I were looking for a quick anniversary getaway from Columbus and we learned about the awesome wineries near Geneva, Ohio. Many of the commercial hotels and super touristy places didn't appeal to us so we started to look a little farther out and thankfully we did because we found Steele Mansion! \n\nIt is roughly a 30 minute drive from the Lodge at Geneva where the wine tour leaves but the owner of Steele Mansion, Carol, graciously offered to drive us for a small fee (way cheaper than a cab). She gave us a tour of the small town and showed us different places around the area. We also got a history lesson about the mansion and the incredible renovation process. \n\nThe mansion is absolutely gorgeous and very clean. The bed was very comfortable and we really enjoyed the breakfast in the morning. \n\nWe had a really great stay and would love to return someday! Carol is awesome!
