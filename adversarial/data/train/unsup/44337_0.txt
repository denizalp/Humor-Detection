Looks nice, but that's about it. Confusing set up with three separate restaurants with their own individual food and drink menus. I went here with a large group after a work conference. We called a week prior and inquired about reserving the rooftop, and were told it was first come, first serve but that sitting together wouldn't be an issue. Not sure how, but our group ended up on the second level, which is again a different restaurant, and we were all at separate tables. It was very odd and defeated the purpose of coming as a group. The menu on the second floor was more appetizing than the rooftop, but the beer and wine selection was minimal. Everyone ordered pizza and I ordered the scallops off the \"medium plate\" section. They came out and I was surprised to see two very tiny scallops surrounded by various greens, pancetta (not \"bacon\"), and a sauce. The scallops were so overcooked they bounced off the bowl, which should have stopped me from trying them but it didn't. They were as salty and overcooked as they appeared, and the pancetta was chewy and not nearly crispy enough. I ended up sending them back. It seemed that everyone enjoyed the pizza, but wood fire pizza isn't that difficult to make palatable so I wasn't impressed. \n\nOur server was nice and attentive, which I appreciated. My only complaint was that when refilling the water I noticed all of the servers touching the mouth of the water to the lip of everyone's glasses. That is unsanitary and just nasty, in my opinion.
