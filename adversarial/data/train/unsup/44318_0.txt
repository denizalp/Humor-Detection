I grew up in a traditional east coast italian family, so many italian restaurants in vegas that others love...i find just \"Meh...\"  This place is my absolute favorite italian restaurant so far in Vegas, and one of my fav overall places as well! The food has always been delicious, as well as authentic and freshly made meals. The service is excellent as well! I love the ambiance here, and the fact that its run by a sweet italian family!! It kinda reminds me of being home I think :) The son is usually our server, but last night i took the BF out to dinner on date night the dad came over to say hello, explain the specials, and the wine list....the BF isnt the biggest wine drinker so he helped us pick out a bottle that he and I would both enjoy, and i have to say we both thought it was delicious!  I try to make myself get something different each time I eat here because everything is always so good, but I am so in love with the gorgonzola gnocchi....i think about it every day I'm dieting!!! haha...  Its really nice to see a REAL italian, family-run restaurant in the area...I hope they continue to do good business!!
