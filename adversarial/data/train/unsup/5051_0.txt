THIS theatre was awful, no room for your legs to move if you have any kind of leg pain or disability, there is no room.  The arm rests are broken and gone, the arm rests have no place or cup holders for your beverages which are expensive and no refills, the lids on the beverages are big and causes your  beverages to leak everywhere.  The popcorn is not free it is $6.00 and no refills at all.  The food is $12.00 and up, and don't forget, A MUSHROOM BURGER IS NOT A BURGER, ACCORDING TO THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT THERE.  EVERYTHING IS MISLEADING and the management makes you look like you are the crazy one.  When we received the mushroom burger with no burger they laughed at us. We said if it is a mushroom burger, then it is a burger with mushrooms.  According to them it is a mushroom only on a bun, NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN ALL MY LIFE.   OH AND THE BATHROOMS HAVE NO SEAT COVERS AT ALL. FOR $14.40 A MOVIE YOU GET NOTHING, DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  AMC IS BETTER ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A  MOVIE WATCHER, YOU GET FREE MOVIES,FREE POPCORN AND FREE DRINKS.
