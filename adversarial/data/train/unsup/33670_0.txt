I have been to all the Cafe Rios in Vegas, this new location is BY FAR the most CUSTOMER FRIENDLY, freshest food, AND has all products on the menu even close to closing!! I will make the drive to this location every time!  THANK YOU to the friendly staff with great smiles and politeness you can't find in too many places today.  It's nice to served by people who get along and enjoy what they do.  Loyal customer from this day on!!
