$10 guacamole but WOW ITS WORTH IT!!!\nLove that you do not ge the standard chips with salsa...instead you get deep fried plantains!!! amazing! takes the burn off the delicious house salsa. Service is great. \ncomfortable seating with lots of room. great colors and natural light! \nPlenty of seats outside and in. \nAnything you order here will be nothing less than amazing! along with the service and experience
