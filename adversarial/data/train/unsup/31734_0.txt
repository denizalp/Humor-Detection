This Dunkin' Donuts location has horrible, uninspired service and the coffee is terrible. I have been twice, and both times, the coffee tasted old and burnt. I do not have this issue with other locations in Charlotte and across the country. I most recently ordered an iced coffee and it made my stomach hurt. I do not suggest this location.
