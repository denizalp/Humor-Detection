Okay 1st thing to do when going to Four peaks Brewery is to get good and baked a few blocks before getting to the place, i mean get totally chiefed out. The parking is ridiculous, I've been there 20 times and have never parked out front, your best bet is to park behind the building in the alley near the old rail road tracks. \nIt looks like a madhouse of loud bitchy A.S.U. girls, and idiot jock dudes everywhere but you get seated pretty quick. Since I will review vegetarian friendly establishments only, i would have to say the vege. burger is the best in town, the fries also seriously rule & you get all your shit served up fast. Wash it all down with a Peach Sunbru.
