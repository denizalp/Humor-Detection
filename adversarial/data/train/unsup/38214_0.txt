I work in insurance and we always recommend Reliable Glass to anyone who is looking for windshield repairs. My auto insurance is through another carrier who uses Safelite so I decided to give it a shot. The repairman came to my work to replace the windshield which was done in about an hour. We both walked out to check out the windshield together and it looked fine so he left. When I came back to my car to leave that evening and started to drive away I noticed he didn't completely close the passenger door before he left so my lights were on the entire afternoon.  Once I was on the freeway, which is about 1\/2 mile from my work, the hood of my car was literally bouncing up and down. HE DIDNT SHUT THE HOOD ALL THE WAY!! What a huge lawsuit waiting to happen, thankfully I was able to pull over immediately and shut it before it flew up and caused a major accident.  \n\nSafelite requested that I review their work and at the end of the survey determined I was not happy and asked if I would like to be contacted. I selected yes and did not hear from them for almost a month. When I finally did hear from them, it was a representative from a call center who obviously did not care at all. He transferred me to the store to speak directly to the manager. The store manager also was very nonchalant about the situation. Her apology was insincere and I will never use Safelite again!! To anyone looking for a no hassle, worry free company, call Reliable!
