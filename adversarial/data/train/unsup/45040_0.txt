I feel very fortunate to have this great place in my neighbourhood! I have used both their laundry machines, and the wash-and-fold service. Love the wash-and-fold. The ladies are really friendly, the job is always done quickly and with excellent quality, and the price is right. The machines are well-kept, and there's a convenient change machine and soap dispenser. Also, there is free internet. Cool thing I noticed last time I was there...they have a pay-it-forward program where you can buy a load of laundry for someone less fortunate and put up a post-it note that someone in need can remove and exchange for cash to run a load of laundry. Great idea! Nice coffee shop right next door, too. Love BSL!
