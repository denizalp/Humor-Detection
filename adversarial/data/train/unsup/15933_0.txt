Yes! Yes yes yes.\n\nPicture it now; cold crisp Halloweenie weekend... dark of night, midnight to be exact. The sleepy neighborhood of Dormont is inundated with a dense spooky fog. Two young ladies, on a haunted Halloween weekend escapade pull up to the theater.\n\nThe street this is on is so adorable and picturesque it's hard to believe it's real. The exterior is clean and a mix of modern and hip vintage theater. Walking inside it has that old-theater charm and you can immediately feel what this type of theater would have been like many years ago. The bathrooms are located down stairs, the ladies room at least is huge and clean.\n\nWe were there to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and let me tell you we were not disappointed. The theater is large inside with many slightly inclined seats and a balcony above. The seats were brand new and cushy. \n\nI looked over the past month's schedule and was thrilled to see so many amazing classic and more modern horror movies. I can't wait to see what November holds... I've heard rumors of The Christmas Story?
