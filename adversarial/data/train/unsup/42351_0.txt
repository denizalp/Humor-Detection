I have stopped at this store several times when passing through or visiting relatives.  I look mainly in the housewares section and the prices are insanely out-of-this-world high.  My most recent trip was about 10 days ago.  No change from previous visits.  The staff apparently thinks everything donated to them is made of solid gold and is priced accordingly.  Pitcher?  $34.  Salt and pepper set?  $15.  Small glass rabbit?  $25.  Vase?  $34.50.  Relish dish?  $15.  and on and on it went.  I started turning over many of the pieces just to see if there was ANYTHING that would be considered a real thrift store price.  I finally found a few saucers and small plates that were a dollar or less, but they were truly in the minority.  Who do they think their market is?  I also tried to get some help from the staff and the manager on duty (Ben) was woefully unhelpful.  I can't speak to the clothes or furniture since I don't look at those, but if you're looking for housewares, you will save a lot of money shopping elsewhere.
