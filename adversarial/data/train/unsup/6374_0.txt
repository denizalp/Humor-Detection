Since 24 hour was sold and local location closed I finally came to this location. I came in and first not very friendly at all. Second I see no one has a towel I'm talking on machines or cardio. Now maybe I've lost it but I didn't see one person wiping anything down. I was like what is this don't they require towels. I did notice that some people were asking for towels behind the counter. What's up with that is that something extra it didn't make sense. I was like is my towel ok. Am I the weird one for not wanting some ones nasty sweat. And of course you have the typical douche bags in the gym what a treat.
