Simply amazing. \n\nMy husband and I went to Kame Omakase last month to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. \nFor this special event, I looked at a lot of other competitive restaurants but Kame Omakase stood out to me with their gourmet ingredients and beautiful presentation that is more than just \"omakase sushi\".\nI was lucky to snatch a seating for 6pm on a 3-day weekend and I loved that they send you a detailed text confirmation immediately to reassure a crazy planner like myself. They are also very upfront about the pricing which is very nice because no one likes hidden fees.\n\n2 hours at Kame Omakase with Chef Eric Kim was excellent. \nI loved the intimate setting of 8 seats that lets us interact with chef while watching them create beautiful food art. Every thing we ate were described to us from their origin to how to eat the dish. \nI went to culinary school and I am a big foodie but trying ingredients I haven't even heard of - such as different types of \"momo\" = peach from Japan with freshest seafood blew my mind. \nChef Eric really put thoughts into each course to bring out the natural flavor of every ingredient and also created art. Honestly, everything was decadent and both my husband and I were thoroughly impressed. \n\nThe whole experience was worth every penny and I am for sure going to have to try his new spot when it opens.
