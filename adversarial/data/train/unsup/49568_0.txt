The manager MARY had poor customer service skills. When I checked out (with a large!! purchase of birthday party supplies) she was at the counter. She was unpleasant and seemed bothered to be at the register.  When I asked about the return policy she was rude and her response was short. When she came to my balloons (2 packages) she asked me \"when do you need these?\" I had intended to have them filled and take them with me so I didn't have to go back, but she was so irritated I said (trying to be nice)\"I guess I don't need them till 2\". I got no response, just a total. I paid and left. It was before 12. When I returned at 3 she was walking out the door with a smile on her face,  obviously happy to be off work. Didn't say a word to me as she walked by. When I go in the store.. there are my balloons ON THE COUNTER.. NOT DONE. I was pissed. Thankfully Kailyn and Kiani were quick to help. They filled my balloons immediately and apologized. 02\/09\/16
