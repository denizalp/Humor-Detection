Before my new world at ASU, I have never been in Cupz-even though it is located under the misters when I wait for the bus in Downtown Tempe area.\n\nAlthough I think its lamesauce they have the soy 50 cents charge on drinks (or on the side), their sandwiches are microwave tastic, and I get a weird feeling the girls who work there may have a nickname for me (and it may not be flattering-although I have no idea what my appearence or mannerisms would have warranted this suspicion-unless it is simply girls being I don't want to work at all girls?), I simply cannot beat the fact I can walk from my office door, walk to this coffee bar, pay, get my drink and walk back with a few minutes to spare to sit on a park bench before heading back to my office in under 15 minutes.\n\nPlus, they have the frequent reader card and I already received my free coffee!\n\nI think under most circumstances, I would award this place a one or two star for not having anything I would or want to eat, zero ambiance, zero bathrooms, but their okay priced soy cafe mochas, the one dude who looks like my friend Brandon from U-Mass, punch card and proximity makes them three-starable.\n\nIf only I could shake off my paranoia....
