I went here for an oil change around 8am on a Saturday morning.  When I got there I was told one hour, so I said I'd be back in 1 hour.  To allow enough time, I went back to the store about one hour and 45 minutes later.  Once I was there, I still managed to have an additional 45 minute wait.  I'm thinking they walked over to Saudi Arabia, extracted the crude oil, and processed it before they put it in the car.\n\nIn addition to the oil change, I asked if they could replace two tires.  The person I was talking said I needed to replace all four.  Once I stated I was only going to replace the two, they had no interest in taking my business.\n\nThis was a very disappointing experience, and it was certainly my last visit to that place.
