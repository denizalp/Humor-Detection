FIrst of all, the food here is excellent. Even if you have never had a crepe, or didn't like the one you had you will find something here to like.  They have both savory and sweat crepes and all are delicious.  The sauces are complex and unique on their own, the flavors blended perfectly and every bite a delight.  They also have farm to table relationships with local growers and bakers which yields great results.\n\nWith that why only 4 stars? Mainly because they are a victim of their success.  This is a order at the counter then take a seat place and on weekends the line can be almost out the door.  They recently expanded their seating space but the kitchen struggles to keep up with the demand.  Thankfully, they don't compromise on quality but the wait can be a bit long (especially when you know what is coming).  I recommend you stop in for breakfast or lunch on a weekday (Wed - Fri, they are closed Monday and Tuesday) and get the five star experience.
