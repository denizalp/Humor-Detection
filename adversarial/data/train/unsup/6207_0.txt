Located in Fulton Ranch, a fairly new upscale shopping center including an AJ's, Sautee seemed to be trying too hard and in some cases not hard enough.\n\nI stopped in for an impromptu lunch, even though I was still slightly full from breakfast.\nOh I hate it when i go somewhere new and everything sounds good and I don't know what to order, so I thought I'd try a few different things.\n\nPretty expensive entrees, up to $29.95! Moderately priced salads and sandwiches around the $10 range.\n\nI decided to start with the Fried Calamari, soaked in buttermilk for maximum tenderness these thick and juicy strips were melt in your mouth bliss.(see pics) \nThe accompaniment sauces however were not a good match, chipotle chile, tasted like spicy BBQ and the key lime red pepper was like a sweetened thinned out mayo, I didn't detect any lime flavor in there at all, I ended up asking for lemon wedges which were just what those babies needed, YUM!\n\nI also ordered the Chicken Satay skewers served with spicy tangerine sauce, these were tasty and the sauce was perfect match(see pics)\n\nThe last thing I tried was one of their Fire Grilled Flat-breads, I chose the \"of the day\" flavor which was urban chicken, with spinach, mushroom and smoked gouda (see pics) \nNot impressed at all, I can guarantee this was not made to order, my toppings slid around under a thick blanket of dried cheese, meaning it was melted sometime before I ever ordered it. I only took two bites.\n\nMy waiter service was good, I was visited in total by 3 different waiters(?) all who asked how everything was and I expressed to each of them my dislike of the pizza. \n\nUnfortunately none of them offered to get me something else or remove it from my bill~which is the courteous standard at most restaurants~especially NEW ones.\n\nThe pizza was even boxed  up for me, why would I want to take home something I didn't like? I told him to toss it.\n\nI'm not sure if I would come back here or not, maybe to try a salad, but I'm not going to chance spending $30 on entree that I might not like.
