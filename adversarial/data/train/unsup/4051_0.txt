Nordstrom is great! Anyone who shops there knows, their cosmetic counter, fragrance bar, and shoe department are the best! Not to mention when they have their annual and semi-annual sales. Nordstrom is of course on the high end as far as cost, but then again most Nordstrom shoppers know that going in-it's about the total shopping experience as far as I am concerned, and I think many fellow Nordstrom shoppers would agree with me.\n\nWith that said, a few days ago I was shopping at Nordstrom in the Chandler Fashion Center to stock up on some YSL cosmetics before my upcoming trip, and I learned they do not have a cafe at this location-Whaaaat? The total shopping experience for me includes being able to stop at the Nordstrom Cafe for a salad, some crostini's, and most importantly a nice glass of red wine. Meh......I was not to happy about this, as the integrity of my Nordstrom shopping experience was compromised that day! Hey, Nordstrom get with it and add the Cafe to the Nordstrom at Chandler Fashion Center-lol!
