Not great but not bad. I got veggie pizza that had a lot of kalamata olives which I like but it was just a little too much for my taste.  Two stars because the \"Meh. I've experienced better\" sums up my experience. I was also hoping to eat in at the restaurant and there is no in dining option, take out only.
