This is the restaurant that replaced the old Kabuki Japanese Restaurant. I pass by this restaurant many times, and finally decided to try it out. Got take out lunch here twice. \n\n- First time was a Chirashi, which included soup and salad for $14. The chirashi included salmon, butterfish (escolar), tuna, and salmon roe. Instead of slices of fish on top of a bed of rice, these were diced into cubes.\n- Quality was okay. Inclusion of ikura was good, as I don't find it in chirashi too often at other places. Not a lot of variety though. Decent value for 14.\n- Miso soup was decent, but hot as heck (almost burnt my tongue)\n- Salad was good. Dressing was good (not sour, like I find at some other places)\n- Service was good.\n\n- Second time was the Kabuki Bento Box, which included shrimp and assorted tempura, tuna, salmon, and butterfish nigiri sushi, and a spicy salmon maki. Also included soup, salad, and a bowl of rice.\n- Shrimp tempura was good, along with a decent variety of other kinds of tempura.\n- The nigiri sushi were a bit lacking, in terms of size and quality. The spicy salmon maki was good.\n- Wasabi was excellent. I believe they used real grated wasabi.\n- Service was a bit slower this time, as they had a few tables to take care of (but wasn't full house).\n\nMisc (possibly quite biased) impressions:\n- If you check out my other reviews, you'll know that I'm all about Toro. Unfortunately, it's not on their menu (lunch or dinner. Closest thing is negi toro roll, which isn't quite the same). Just for that, it doesn't feel like it's up there with the top restaurants.\n- They have an aburi sushi menu (24 dollars for 6 pieces of sushi, according to the menu). I'd like to try that sometime in the future.\n- There is NO sushi bar visible in the main dining area. Hence, the chef works in the back, and food is brought out (unless there's a hidden dining area at the back). Kind of a downer if anyone is looking for an omakase in front of the sushi bar and watch the chef do his magic (makes me wonder who is working back there).\n- Escolar isn't exactly a great fish to serve.\n\nCurrent conclusion: Okay for some general sushi if you're in the area. Probably not worth coming on purpose to try it out. Better quality sushi could be found in the area (closest is Taro's fish).\n\nQuality: 7\/10. Service: 8\/10.  Value: 7\/10. Overall 7\/10 (Not an average).
