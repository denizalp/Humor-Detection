Cool atmosphere and the food tasted really good but the service was poor. Part of me feels like we just had a bad server. \n\nWe had a large party here and the she did not inform any of us about all day happy hour on Sundays. \n\nI asked for salt on a margarita I ordered and didn't get it. I also ordered tacos and she didn't offer any kind of tortilla other than flour. I eventually found out they offered corn and would have preferred this had she offered it. \n\nI'll probably come back and give it a 2nd chance if I have friends that are coincidentally going there but it was a bad first impression.
