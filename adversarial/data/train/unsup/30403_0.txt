We will never set foot in this place again! Charging seniors $4 for parking? Why gouge and double dip against seniors on pension? If you forget your health card, they won't confirm it by calling your physician but charge you instead as they can't be bothered. Dr.Armagon is two faced and an insensitive person. The manager Alice needs an attitude adjustment. We despise your success to the dismay of seniors hoping for compassion and care. Unacceptable... avoid at all costs.
