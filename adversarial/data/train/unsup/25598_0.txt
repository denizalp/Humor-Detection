I will be honest, I am always cautious about what service people will charge. They know that some people won't question how much they charge. I am not one of those people. I had Blue Marlin come out to look at my pool. The pump was leaking. Derek was on time, very friendly. He checked the whole pump, replaced the PVC Pipes and fittings. He also tested everything. They charged a very reasonable price.
