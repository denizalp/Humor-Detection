I looked at a list of places to eat and I was like, If this place is as good as it sounds, it'll be pretty good. Then when I looked at it I was like, If this place is as good as it looks, then it'll be pretty amazing. Then I went there and as I walked in the door, I was like, If the food is as good as the place looks, then this will be phenomenal. When I ate the food I was like, This is better than it looked. \n\nThe place is rustic, charming, high class and casual, all in one. Great aesthetics. It's hard to eat food when one is looking around but it's even harder to look around when they place such AMAZING food before you. \n\nFirst off, we ordered SaluTé kombucha (which didn't have a price but turned out to be $6.) Blue Ginger and Mango Cayenne. The guy that makes the SaluTé kombucha was even there, hanging out and waiting tables. (Maybe he's the owner of the restaurant too...?) Anyway, it was well paired with our pies. With a thin crust, lightly charred in places, they were just like all pizza should be. We tried the Formaggio Di Capra and the Frutti Di Mare. Formaggio: local goat cheese, prosciotto di parma, fresh cherry tomatoes (added at the end), basil, evoo, slivered garlic. Frutti: shrimp, braised calamari, mussels, San Marzono tomatoes, slivered garlic, fresh mozzarella & parmesan cheese, basil, evoo. Simply stunning. Both of 'em. There is no way anyone would think that the Formaggio was anything less than amazing. And seafoodies and even most non-seafoodies would think the same of the Frutti. \n\nIt's not so cheap, $14 average for a personal pizza, but it's as good as you're gonna find. Or better, yeah probably quite a bit better.
