Great place to watch some Arizona Coyotes games!  Although I am a Devils fan at heart, I still frequent here to get my hockey fix.  You can always find free parking although you'll have to walk farther to get to the stadium (get that cardio in, peeps!).  If you arrive early, there are plenty of restaurants, bars, and shops to waste a little bit of time in before the game.  \nOnce inside, the arena itself is easy to navigate, but there are plenty of ushers on hand to help you if you've lost your way.  There are some standard food selections inside (hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, beer) but there are also some specialty vendors who sell fare like poutine (yum!).  Nothing like noshing on some gravy fries smothered in cheese curds to get you in the Coyote spirit.\nOne thing that always makes me kind of sad is how empty the arena always seems to be during game time.  I guess Arizonans aren't into hockey like the other parts of the US.  The upside to this is that there is always plenty of seating to move to if you don't like the location of the tickets you bought. \nThe arena is always having drawings and promotions.  I actually watched a guy shoot a goal on the ice and win a BMW!  Lucky dude, for sure!\nSo head out, support your local Arizona Coyotes, and have a good time!
