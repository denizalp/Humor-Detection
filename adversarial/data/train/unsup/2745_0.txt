Ehh . Will probably not be back . Was visiting from San Diego . I got the apple pie looking waffles and a strawberry smoothie with boba .... first the table was SO sticky we had to get someone to wipe it down when we sat down . Also they serve you on paper plates , not for me. The food was god but verrrryyy sweet . The last thing was that we finished our meal before our smoothies came . All in all just disappointing .
