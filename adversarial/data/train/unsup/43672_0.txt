Rolled in at 10am on a Sunday morning, excited to try some salads and burgers.  Staff was still asleep and hung over from the night before.   Friendly was a 2\/10.  Atleast they turned on the music in the kitchen.  The overwhelming sentiment for todays visit would be that \nthis would be a great place to work if it werent for all of those pesky customers.\nFood 7\/10\nService 2\/10
