I'll start off with the positive. This place has a great atmosphere, it's huge, open, and there's plenty of seating and places to hangout.  There's a covered open-air section with a stage for live music, and backyard games like corn hole, connect four and beer pong. It gets pretty toasty but as long as you stand in front of one of their giant industrial fans every so often, you'll be okay. There's a large parking lot in the back so parking shouldn't be too much of an issue.\n\nNow for the negative...they only seem to hire beautiful skinny girls under 25.  Is that a negative? Well if you're a self-conscious 30-something year old woman surrounded by a bunch of dudes gawking and commenting at the half naked women...  My waitress didn't seem to know anything about anything. We asked if they served \"whiskey flights\" and she didn't know what a \"fight\" was. We had to explain it to her. Turns out Whiskey Row does not serve whiskey flights. Seems like something they should offer. The guys in my group wanted to order \"boilermakers\" which is a shot of whiskey and a beer. The waitress could not tell us which beers paired well with whiskey. In addition, I ordered the pretzel platter, it was just one pretzel, not much of a platter.  Everything was so overpriced, I could not believe it was as busy as it was. People must come for the atmosphere, aka, to stare a women. \n\n**Lastly, please put purse hooks in your women's bathroom stalls. I don't like having to hold my purse while I pee!
