I've been going to Ace of Fades for about 3 months now and my fades come out perfect every time! My last barber I had been going to over the years was too far for me to drive to...but I have no regrets.\n\nMy barber is Daniel, but every person that goes in, comes out looking fresh with any barber there. Each one of these barbers, take their time and make sure you have the best cut and experience possible before leaving.\n\nEveryone is personable and their shop is clean.\n\nGlad I found my new barber shop!
