Mississauga Animal Hospital is a wonderful place with a great staff.\n\nDr. Paul Walker runs the practise.  Very knowledgeable and friendly.  He takes the time to explain things thoroughly, and puts you at ease with your pet.\n\nMy dog has been a real fuss at the vets, he has tried to bite every single one of them.  Dr. Paul Walker?  Nope, once he came into the room, my dog was nothing but obedient with him.  My dog must have sensed  how genuine he is.\n\nMy dog has been experiencing chronic ear infection problems, and most vets I've brought him to would prescribe the same medication or drops.  Dr. Paul Walker while saying nothing is wrong with those medicines provided, he was wondering why they did not give me an effective one.  This leads me to believe, they just wanted me to spend more and more money on the same crap that would not work.\n\nHe will not put your pet through unnecessary tests or procedures, as he believes this burns cash with out great results.\n\nHe told me to check on my dogs progress for two weeks, and to give him a call. While all this time, he was showing how sincerely he cares about your pet, and it does not go unnoticed.  \n\nDr. Paul Walker is a great man, I cannot stress that enough.  He will make himself available to you should you have any questions or concerns in regards to your pet. Call him any time he says.\n\nPeople have different opinions about this place, and most of them are about the ridiculous prices.  What's so ridiculous about the price??  You'll probably spend more money testing out ineffective medicines at other practises, as opposed to spending your money on quality product  that is effective.\n\nWhat most people don't understand is, you're paying for a highly educated and motivated Dr. that actually cares!  \n\nEither way I look at it, my dog is part of the family, and I cannot put a value on his life or well being.  \n\nConsidering this was my first visitation, I will provide an update in two weeks along with the progress of my dog.
