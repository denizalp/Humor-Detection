Interesting place. It occupies the entire bottom floor of a downtown building.  It has a large main bar near the entrance, but a really nice small more private bar in the back.  I sat at the back bar.  My bartender was a nice girl named Bridgette.  She got me a drink immediately and a menu.  I asked her what was good; so she pointed me to the Baja Tacos.  They arrived quick and tasted really good.  The drink was fine, nothing special.  The only reason I am not giving the place five stars was the ambiance of the place.  The lady stocking lamps at the bar were straight out of A Christmas Story, and a little disconcerting.  Also, I was close to the servers station and had to listen to a VERY loud server.  Bridgette did a great job and even took the time to make me feel welcome.  I'd come back if I am in Cleveland again.
