Came here for brunch with a Groupon deal, pretty underwhelmed but I have to say it was worth it with the deal. It would't be without. \nAs a pizza lover, I like my pizza done certain way. I wouldn't send it back if it was done defiantly- every pizzeria has their own style. I got the wild mushroom with an egg on it and I wasn't a big fan of it. \nWith that being said, it's named Pure Pizza because of their:\n- Locally and seasonally sourced toppings .\n- Organically grown California tomatoes.\n- Finest WI and NC cheeses.\n- They offer ancient grain dough (100% whole grains without wheat).\n- Gluten-free dough.\n\nDaily specials:\nMonday: $1 OMB Copper. \nTuesday: BOGO on pizza.\nWednesday: Half Price Bottles of Wine.\nThursday: Kids Eat Free.\nFriday and Saturday: Large (1) Topping Pizza + Beer Pitcher $33\n\nThree and Half Yelps.
