I have purchased some of my favorite items here.\n\nThat said, the prices really are all over the map.  I think they could knock a couple of bucks off some of the items and probably sell more.  I definitely buy much much more from Hip'tique when they are having their sales and exclusive shopping events.  \n\nThe quality of pieces also ranges--sometimes they are really really high quality, and sometimes they fray almost immediately.  I guess it's a little hit and miss, but usually funky, fun, and also an adorable kids' section.\n\nWorth checking out.  Especially the sale rack.
