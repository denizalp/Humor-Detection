My mother has been at this facility a little over a month now, and it is perfect for her.  The staff is absolutely amazing!  I feel as though she has one on one care.  I am constantly being asked what are her favorite foods and activities, because they want to make sure that your loved one is happy.  For Memorial day they  had a big barbecue with live music and families were invited.  I had not seen my Mom smile and laugh so much in a long time. I regret not coming here sooner!
