Against the negative yelp recommendations and in favor of The Boulevard Mall landlord's strong recommendation,  I hired A 1st Impressions and I am so glad I did.   They were very pleasant to deal with, provided very competitive pricing and fabricated and installed three 7x60 exterior illuminated signs, two 9x60 exterior banners along with monument and pylon signs in less than a month and a half!    They did such a great job we have hired them again to create another exterior sign. I highly recommend them and no doubt they will have all of my Las Vegas business.
