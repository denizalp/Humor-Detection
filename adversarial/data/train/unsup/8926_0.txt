Girl that works Friday evening is a fucking savage. I've been given stitches without anesthesia less painful than her thread job. This c*** made me cry. I specifically told her that I like my eyebrows thick and what does she do? Make them silent-film thin. When she was done, no alcohol, no balm, nothing. Now I have to walk around looking like the world's most surprised woman. It's not even cheap. Seriously, stay away from this place. Fuck this bitch.
