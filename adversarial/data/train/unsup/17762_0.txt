Went here for the first time today.\nMy mom ordered an omelet, and I ordered a Loco Motion.\nHamburger patty with sticky rice, 2 eggs and brown gravy.\nI ordered my eggs poached, and my patty medium rare.\n\nThe food came out quite quickly, and our waitress was kind.\n\nMy mom liked her omelet, and I thought that my patty was a little over cooked, but it was still good. However, it almost tasted like they cooked it in A-1 steak sauce, and it was kind of clashing with the gravy. My eggs were cooked nicely.\nIt came with pineapple, but I was disappointed with that. It was not ripe, and more white than yellow.\nI chose a banana muffin instead of toast. \nMy daughter and I ate it, but it left my fingers greasy.... Not something a muffin should do.\n\nThe women's bathroom was gross. \nThere was only one clean stall. \nThe first stall closest to the sink couldn't be opened.\nThe middle stall was clean, \nthe third, and final (only handicapped stall) had fecal matter in the bowl, \nand paper on the floor.\n\nI looked on the rest room sheet, and no one had been in there or signed off on their cleaning duties since 8\/4 (yesterday). Kind of a mood kill.
