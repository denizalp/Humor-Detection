I came here months ago to see Interstellar and it was a decent theater. I just saw a movie here last night (Jurassic World) since I was in the area on my Friday night.\n\nThis place has fallen hard.\n\nIt was dirty inside. The concessions were dirty. The theaters were smelly and the seats were worn. I don't know if it's just a small theater or if they chose to put the newest release in the smallest auditorium because there were not enough seats at all.\n\nAlso, the AC was broken, which after reading other reviews I see is a common occurrence there.
