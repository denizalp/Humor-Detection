Heads Up, I have enjoyed Chou's kitchen for the last 2 and a half years. I have a diabetic service dog, the real thing, I went in to make an order last last Thursday, the second Thursday in February. As I walked in with my dog, the waitress stuck her foot out as she was taking an order, like she was a karate kungfu fighter, and shove it in my dog's face! They know me there, they know I have a certified service dog, why she did that, I have no idea? I went back to pick up my food a half hour later without my dog, as I come in they hand me my dinner and say here no charge we're sorry, and you are drunk please leave! I'm sorry I was not drunk, I have high blood pressure my face is red all the time, I have no idea why she even said that!? If I hadn't eaten there so often, I would hire a lawyer and sue them for their misbehavior and I still might. In making an order there, and getting spit in my food or who knows what else. I will call the health department and make sure they have a good certificate.
