yes, this is a standard Houstons with a different name\n(but the same food)\nbut what made me happy about my dining experience was the service\n\ni tried their famous french dip which was absolutely delicious\nwhile the bread wasn't my fav\nthe meat, au jus and horseradish were very good\ni also opted for the kale salad instead of the fries and liked it a lot\n\noverall, it was a great spot for a nice family dinner
