Good place for a quick breakfast in South End. However, the bagel was too soft and pork roll was so thin it was pretty much just bacon but this is coming from a New Jerseyan used to her bagels a certain way. The sandwich as a whole was delicious. Ooey gooey and cheesy. The jalape√±o cream cheese was amazinggg, best part of the sandwich. My boyfriend got the sundried tomato cream cheese and he said it over powered the rest of the sandwich so maybe only get that if you're just getting a regular bagel. I would go back and recommend that others give it a try!
