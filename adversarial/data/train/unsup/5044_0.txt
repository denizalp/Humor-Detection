Hey, not bad! I wasn't expecting much so there was a lot of room to be impressed, haha. I was pleasantly surprised! I originally wanted to watch a Cirque du Soleil show instead but the group I was with decided on Penn and Teller.\n\nI genuinely was shocked at how big Penn was in person - he's like a Viking! Haha...He is a smooth talker and seems extremely good at multi-tasking. Then again, he's had years to practice his craft and it shows! Teller seems kinda creepy but really nice too. I was surprised at how poised he is in all his stage stuff. \n\nThis humorous and patriotic show was enjoyable and sometimes quite uncomfortable. Like the bit when they supposedly burn a flag or when Penn fires a nail gun into his hand - I'll let your imagination run wild. \n\nMost of the tricks were pretty amazing and slighted with adult humor. There was a lot to pay attention to with lots of audience participation, stage changes, monologues, and all that. \n\nIt's certainly a show for people 18+ which is the way I like it! Haha :)
