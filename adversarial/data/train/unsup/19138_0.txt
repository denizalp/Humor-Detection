I begin this review with a confession: I AM THE WORST! Going out to eat with me is like being in a Portlandia sketch: \"I'm not doing dairy, soy, or wheat these days. And I'm really trying to stay away from nuts.\" \"Is that organic? Is it local?\" \"Do you have a vegan option?\"\n\nNeedless to say, quick-service, grab-and-go dining is a minefield for me.\n\nSo, I'm giving Root Café 5 stars right off the bat for being a place that I can come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and make absolutely ZERO dietary compromises!\n\nOn a recent trip I sampled a Fig\/Orange muffin that, in addition to being DELICIOUS and house-made, was also gluten-free, soy-free, and vegan. The espresso roast I was served from Rising Star (love) was brewed to perfection. It was a perfect breakfast.\n\nI have also partaken in their house-made burritos, soup, and hot breakfast options, all of which have been prepared and presented beautifully. Were they the best thing I have ever tasted? Maybe not. But everything was fast, tasty, well-priced, and as healthful\/well-sourced as one can dream of in a café service setting. \n\nCome here to have a quick snack that you can feel good about. Stay for the bustling energy and distinctive flavor of Lakewood. \n\nThank you, Root Café, for being a haven for the demanding eater! Keep it up!
