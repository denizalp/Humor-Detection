Mediocre. Can't understand some of the reviews that say how great it is. Tempura shrimp and vegetables were greasy\/heavy with batter. Onion soup was barely lukewarm and was like water that had an onion waved through. The salad was ok. Shrimp and chicken combo was acceptable but not memorable. Admittedly did not try the sushi so maybe that's better. Service was pleasant.
