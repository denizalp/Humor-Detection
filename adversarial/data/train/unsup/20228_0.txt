No, this doesn't bring back any nostalgic memories for me. It's just plain awesome. \n\nRocket Fizz is your Daddy's candy shop. The old school soda, candy, and Buddy Holly Rock music playing here is enough to make any person think their Marty McFly at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance. \n\nI walked in and immediately wanted to touch and taste everything. The candy supply here is enough to make anyone dance with sugary delight and the soda selection is ridiculous. I'm not a soda drinker, but if you like to indulge in sugary, liquidity goodness this is your place. I mean there must at least 100 different types of sodas here... Black Cherry Mountain, 1 million cream soda varieties, and even a mixture called Cock Cola, it's good for your... heart. \n\nBeyond the candy and soda, there's tons of old school toys and random awesomeness. I almost bought spy glasses and Bigfoot action figure. Sadly, those didn't end up in my bag, instead I got some snappers, a Goo Goo Cluster, Skybar, and some Garbage Pail Kids cards. \n\nAwesome place, with amazing customer service as well. Ask Damien, the owner, he knows everything about candy and will try to get you a certain product if he doesn't have it in stock at the moment. \n\nRockets Away!
