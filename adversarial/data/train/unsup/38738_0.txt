I absolutely love this place! Bic & Leon are both my favorites, and are amazing with gel manicures. They both do a very nice job, take their time, and do not rush you through at all. The new owners are very nice as well. Shop is very clean and tidy every time I go in. Love getting pedicures here as well. Highly recommend!
