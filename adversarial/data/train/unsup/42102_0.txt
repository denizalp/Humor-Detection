A great place to go for huge portions of Italian! We were there on a weekend night. The quaintness of sitting between the aisles is pretty interesting. I got a whole-size order of fettuccine alfredo, which came with a side salad and garlic bread. The garlic bread was so-so, but the fettuccine alfredo had generous heaps of sauce, chicken with a fried breading, and the salad was made with fresh ingredients. There was so much that I couldn't eat it all. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to order at the counter, and it's a long wait, especially since we got stuck behind some indecisive people who were standing in front of the register staring at the menu for fifteen minutes.
