Terrible service.  I have taken my mowers there multiple times.  Why did I go back?  My riding mower wasn't fixed correctly the first few times.  After the first two times I took it back, I had to argue with the staff over how I was using the mower.  Was I \"starting it correctly?\"  Or, did I \"power it down properly?\"  Yes, I'm pretty skilled in the art of grass-cutting, machine on\/off technology.\n\nI'll be looking for a new business to service my machines this summer.
