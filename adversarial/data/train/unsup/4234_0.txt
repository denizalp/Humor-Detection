I arrived at around 10am, and the airport was empty.  No crowds, no long bullshit at customs, and everything was fairly easy to find.\n\nOne thing I will comment, back in Detroit, I had to leave my carry on bag for planeside pickup (I never check anything in, I pack lightly), because the plane from Detroit to Montreal was super teeny so they store larger carry ons for planeside pickup or baggage valet is what they call it. Upon arrival, they bring your bag to you. No biggie, right..... lol anyway so as I was exiting the plane, had no idea where this planeside pick up was cause I so no bags being handed out so I kept walking with the crowd. A gazillion escalators later, a fellow passenger says they saw my purple carry on at bag valet unclaimed.\n\nSoooo...I walked practically all the way back and ran into one of the employees, who actually put my bag onto the baggage carousel for me. He was nice enough to direct me through customs, walked me through all the way, and even got us a lift on on airport buggy and finally reunited me with my purple carry on. All the while telling me about his children, and what to do while in Montreal.\n\nI really appreciate that he took the time to escort me through what could have been a very frustratingly ridiculous process...\n\nSo for now, definitely a fan of YUL.
