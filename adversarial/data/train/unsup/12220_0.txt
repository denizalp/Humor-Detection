As I was walking through this place I thought it was a throw back to the late 80's \/ early 90's. Then I came across a plaque in the lobby that said the San Francisco Giants stayed there for spring training in 1987 or something. Makes complete sense. I imagine this would have been the place to be then because it does not look like much has changed. This is not a resort or modern in the way you are thinking. The room I had was small, and it had an old school air conditioner similar to a window a\/c. No resort should have that kind of a\/c. If you pay more then $55 you will be disappointed. They say they are a 4-star hotel but this place is really a 2.5 star hotel (and not I'm not saying my Yelp score is a 2.5, this place is a 2 when it comes to Yelp). With that said, staff was friendly and helpful, with the exception to housekeeping after they knocked on my door while it had a do not disturb sign.\n\n*Tip: If you need to take a taxi the hotel has a contract with a luxury car company that rips you off. These luxury cars don't even have a meter in them so the driver just charges random high prices. The bell boys aren't allowed to tell you this, so if you say you want a taxi this is the crap they give you. If you ask for them to call for a real taxi they are more then happy to get it for you, but you'll be waiting for 20 minutes on a busy night. Also, you'll need a taxi unless you have a DD because the hotel is not near downtown.
