4.5 stars.\n\nCame down with a 24 hour stomach flu the day before my flight to Las Vegas.  My symptoms were passing, so I decided to put my stomach to the test and feed it some NY style pizza.  Hunted this place down like a hungry dog.    \n\nNot the easiest place to find as the yelp address states it's simply in The Cosmopolitan.  Don't bother looking at the hotel's directory as this hole-in-the-wall is not listed.  Instead I asked a beautiful casino hostess and she directed me to the third floor via the circular elevators (circa Star Trek Next Generation).\n\nI immediately spot the unmarked corridor of wood floors and vinyl record walls and eagerly follow the scent of pizza.  Place is tiny with standing room only along the perimeter counter.  Ambiance is like a NYC pizzeria, in stark contrast to the lobby from which I came and complete with two pin ball machines and a flat screen playing sports.\n\nAmong the three to four different varieties, I ordered their cheese pizza with delectable chunks of blue cheese.  I squeezed a place along the rail and added me some pepper flakes and indulged into one of the best NY-style pizzas I've ever tasted (sorry NYC!).  Perfect crust, cheese was heavenly and despite its lubed greasiness, the orgasmic blue cheese loved me long time.  So long in fact, I dreamt about it later that night.  And the day after.  I vowed to make it back, but so much of Vegas got in my way :(\n\n#Yelp:  041\/365
