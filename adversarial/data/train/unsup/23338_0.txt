This review is solely based on take-out food delivery orders (through the app Foodora) from this place. Located right beside St. Lawrence Market, I've ordered for delivery from this place several times and, each time, the food was delicious, well-prepared, and satisfying. \n\nFirst, the service. Although I haven't actually eaten in, the communications and service I've had from this location each time I ordered in has been excellent. When they ran out of certain items I ordered online, I received a call directly to my cell phone from the restaurant, within minutes, apologizing and letting me know that they were out of their red snapper, or with other suggestions from their menu. Very professional, prompt, and helpful.\n\nSecond, the actual food. I've always ordered the Halibut with Fries ($13.95) and, each time, both the fish and the chips were crispy, light, and so delicious. Obviously, don't expect the healthiest meal in the word (the take-out container definitely had blots of oil all over it) - but the batter wasn't heavy at all, and the fish was cooked perfectly.\n\nI would definitely eat in when I have a chance, and would order (and recommend) the Halibut with Fries again!
