I came with a group of Yelpers for a UYE.  I ordered a plain half chicken with sauce on side, hot wings (1 lb) and a beer.  Beware of the \"hot\" level, as the hot wings were very hot.  The half chicken was crunchy and fresh, though it was a bit dry.  I noticed that the chicken was completely flavourless, meaning it was not marinated before batter coating.  I didn't see a salt shaker on the dining table.  Therefore, if you wanted flavour, your options were to order a sauce on the side or use ketchup.  Other than beer, all the alcoholic beverages were over priced.  Chicken wings were grossly over priced at regular price ($14).  We got ours half price because it was a Tuesday.\n\nServices was okay at time of ordering.  It went downhill from there.  It took a long, long time for the food to arrive.  The guy sitting across me didn't get his order of beer pitcher even after all the food had arrived.  He was so upset.  The billing was a total embarrassment.  Our bill was charged for an extra beer pitcher.
