This old restaurant is still alive and kicking. You want a big and filling meal for your money's worth, go here! Every time I go to Vegas I stop by here at least once during my trip. This restaurant is open 24 hours and has great food. They also have a lounge in the back which is good size, nice fire pit in the middle of a small water fountain, some pretty hostesses, and decent price drinks. The menu is your typical American food you can find at Dennys, Norms, Spires, etc. But the quality at Peppermill far surpasses those places. I would recommend this place to everyone going to Vegas!
