This place is a complete money grabbing setup. Avoid at all cost. I've never had a worst dental experience. They did not provide the services I schedule and instead spent 20 minutes trying to sell me a bunch of unneeded elective services. Instead of cleaning my teeth like scheduled I was told about all the work I needed, even though every dentist I've visited in my life disagree. When I refused to schedule any of the added on follow up work, and wanted my x-rays, they became even ruder.
