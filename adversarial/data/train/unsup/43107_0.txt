Worst home warranty service. got a bill saying there`s a balance forward on the bill from a service call that wasn`t even covered back in October 2013 was told by Melissa one of the customer service person  that was our deductible but my wife renew the contract in may 2014 never told or inform that we owe this deductible, received no bill after the first payment. And now we have a past due bill from them.  They don`t even deserve  one star. What a waste of money.
