The Lionel Richie Residency - All the Hits was a highly energetic show that turned Zappos Theater into a Brick House where people were dancing all night long to songs that were oh such a feeling that they were dancing on the ceiling. But to me the 1:40 show was easy like a Sunday morning. The timeless ballads were as enjoyable as the more uptempo songs. The fact alone that I can open this review with a reference to four of Lionel Richie's songs is evidence that the man is a music legend.\n\nOn October 19, we saw the second to last show of Lionel Richie's Las Vegas Residency (who knows maybe there will be more shows in the future). Right off the bat, it seemed that Zappos Theater was a full brick house. I was surprised to see a very long line. I did not expect that we'd be at the end of this long line. Thanks to the well-managed Zappos Theater we soon made it to the top of the line as effortlessly as Lionel Richie's \"Hello\" reached the top of the Billboard Number #1 position. Once at the top of the line we passed through one of the best security check points that I have encountered. It was nice to pass through security holding my smartphone instead of placing it in a tray.\n\nWe sat in the very back of Zappos Theater. If it weren't for the large monitors, Lionel Richie would be slightly blurry. No matter where we would of sat in the theater, Lionel Richie's timeless music would be vividly clear.\n\nJust as the name of the show implied, Lionel Richie performed twenty of his hits from 8:30 pm to 10:10 pm. In chronological order, here are the songs he performed:\n\nEasy \nMy Love \nEasy. piano\nRunning with the night\nPenny lover\nTruly\nYou Are\nStuck on you\nDancing on the ceiling \nThree times a lady\nSail on\nFancy dancer \nSweet LoveÂ  \nLady You Bring Me Up\nJust to be close \nEndless love \nBrick House \nHello \nSay You Say Me\nWe are the World\nAll Night long (Encore) \n\nLionel Richie performed his hits with high enthusiasm and energetic level. I observed a positive connection between the Music Legend and his audience. Perhaps Lionel Richie described it best in his own words in a  \"People\" article:\n\n  \"It's the microcosm of the entire world,\" Richie says about the audience in Vegas. \"The whole world's in the audience. What I love is they talk back to you.\" \n\n It is a positive connection between audience and Music Legend that has given the show praise. In 2016 \"Vegas Seven\" voted him \"Best New Resident\" in the Best of Las Vegas issue. \n\n The show is more than music. Lionel Richie is a great entertainer that will make you feel like you are the sun and you are the rain (\"You Are\"  is my favorite Lionel Richie song). Between his hits he'd tell jokes. They were funny jokes that did not resort to crude humor or profanity. Here is an example. Before \"Stuck on You\" he joked that a guy went up to him in the back room and said something to the tune that I made love to you several times. He was implying that he made love to his wife several times listening to \"Stuck on You\" because it is such a beautiful song. Lionel would joke over trying many times to get Diana Ross to join him on a duet of their hit  \"Endless Love\" on stage. He'd make jokes that he had the best seats in the house implying that the audience is entertaining to watch. Being a great entertainer he'd engage the audience in the music. Minus Diana Ross, he had the women in the audience duet with him on\" Endless Love.\" Ultimately being a great entertainer, he brought his music to life dancing with the faster hits and playing piano on the ballads. \n\nThis was one fantastic show that proves that some music legends get better with age. If Lionel Richie decides to return to Las Vegas, I highly recommend seeing him.
