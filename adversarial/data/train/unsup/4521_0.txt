I was very nervous about going to my appoinment- I'm new to therapy. I had an evening appointment and the front office was closed when I got there, so I started filling out my new patient paperwork just as a sign had instructed. There was a bell to ring for service but no one came when I rang it (three times over 40 minutes). As people (I assume they were other therapists) came out of offices, no one acknowledged me or returned my smile. I finally got someone to take my paperwork and continued to wait. \n\nI got into my appointment about 15 minutes late. That happens and I don't fault anyone for that, but my appointment was also cut short. My therapist was disinterested in the entire shortened session. I was dressed pretty nicely but had exposed tattoos that seemed to bother her. She stared and seemed distracted, making me feel the need to explain to her that I was a good person more than once. Mind you, I was there for self esteem and anxiety issues, so feeling judged by an apathetic therapist was pretty unsettling. She didn't smile, she wasn't warm, and she wasn't encouraging.\n\nAfter I left, I jokingly told someone that the therapy session helped in its own way because the woman I saw was so curt and unpleasant that it made me feel like a better person.
