I work right across the way from these guys when ruby sold the shop I was sad. But the new people here seem very friendly they took us in right away no appt.  They offer a wide variety of pedicure options . The ice cream. Pedi sounded great but I'm on a budget so we opted for the simple deluxe pedi for $35 . They give a hot stone massage with purchase.  Very clean environment I just wish they had music. Smells good in here too. And for the guy who I've heard people's opinion about. He did a fantastic job on my massage and the overall health of my nails was tended to. I also got french tip and he did great!
