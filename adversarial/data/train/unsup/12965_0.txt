The Armadillo Grill really surprised me. A dive bar in the midst of all the pretentious restaurants and shopping center around the Baltimore area. A resturant \/ bar with pool tables and a bunch of tv's with sports. I love dive bars, however, I also like when they grow with the times.\n\nI couldn't imagine coming here to watch a game, because despite their large quantity of TV's they are all too small and cheap in quality. \n\nWe came on a Monday night late because a friend of ours has been out of town for a month and we wanted to meet up the SECOND she got back. I had the wings, (I'm sure you are shocked). The size and cooking of the chicken was fantastic, however I'm not a big fan when bars use breaded wings instead of grilled. \n\nThe ladies got chopped salads which actually looked phenomenal. I def got 'out ordered'. \n\nI probably will only be back if a buddy wants to meet here, but I certainly can't see myself coming up with the idea to meet here for drinks especially in the Biltmore area where there are just so many other better options. \n\nHowever, I will say that this place probably has that local, consistent customer base where the same people frequent it on the same night of the week. A total cheers atmosphere for sure. So if you are close and live in the area and are looking for \"your dive\"...this'll work.
