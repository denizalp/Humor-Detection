I've known Robert and used Big Bug Sound for several recording projects since 2004. The atmosphere has always been very pleasant and relaxed. The home is immaculately clean for those fickle about such things. When the rubber meets the road, there's a studio to accommodate every budget. When you hire Robert for your project, you're getting high quality gear and engineering for a fraction of what you would pay in other settings for the same caliber of product.  Big Bug Sound will make your song sound the very best it can!
