United Petsafe in Cleveland, OH.  I have shipped dogs and parrots many times with United (Delta too) with only a few minor problems, but today was terrible,  I went to ship a parrot and had several problems spanning at least 5 hours.  First I arrived with mesh on the outside, but not the door, so I was rejected.  I didn't bring any mesh, so I had to go home.  I went home rescheduled with United, but almost chose Delta.  I put mesh on the door.  It is almost an hour for me to drive one way and pay tolls.  Arrived the second time and was told that mesh needed to be inside.  I was upset and asked why wasn't I told sooner or when there earlier.  The staff acted like they might refuse me service for my being upset.  I went to my car and moved the mesh inside.  Then, United Staff didn't like the duct tape.  So, United Staff gave me zip ties and I went to my car again and zip tied it and redid the door again.  Next, they didn't like that the water dish didn't have balls, but accepted.  After getting home I looked online for a water dish with \"balls\" and one doesn't seem to exist for parrots or poultry, other than maybe the manager was talking about marbles in the water.  I was not allowed to declare value due to United Staff saying without having a health cert that I could not, but a health cert is not needed for shipping birds.
