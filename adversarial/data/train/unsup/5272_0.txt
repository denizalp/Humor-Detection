Just awful.  I picked up two dozen to bring to my work for some friends.  I was super excited about them, but once we opened the  box it was just full of disappointment.  The sliders were not made consistently.  Some of my sliders barely had any meat in them.  Some were really salty, while some tasted like nothing.  I don't think I want to come back.  There are much better restaurants in that plaza, go check those out.
