So lets cut down to the chase. \n\nLunch is 9.99 for a single trip. All you can eat is 13.99. For dinner the all you can eat price is the only option. Kids 10 and under lunch is 5.99 and 8.99 for all you can eat respectively. Dinner starts at 4 pm.\n\nThey give you a medium sized bowl to put all your meat, veggies, and sauces in. If you are doing the single trip, cram as much as you can into the bowl so you can get your money's worth. \n\nYou hand it over to the cooks. They will ask you if you want it with steamed or brown rice. I recommend the brown since its healthier for you. Since the meats are frozen but thinly sliced, they don't take long to cook. You can actually stand there and watch them cook it and hand your plate to you after they are done cooking. The only advice to you here is that to make sure they cook it well because undercooked pork, chicken, and turkey can really make you sick.\n\nWhen you bring it to your table, you have sriracha and sweet chili sauce ready to go in containers just in case you need more spicy or sweet kick to your grilled goodies. Fountain drinks are 2.49 with free refills. I asked for water. Note: Their water is straight tap. Its not filtered.\n\nService is decent for they really don't have to do much except get you your drinks, refills, and your check. Their location is in an ideal spot for they are right next to The Hard Rock Casino Hotel. \n\nOverall, I like the fact that the only time you really have to wait is when they cook your food which is a major plus. I recommend you get the all you can eat and definitely have enough time to enjoy it because it is kind of pricey. Its not the best but definitely better than Genghis Grill over in Henderson.
