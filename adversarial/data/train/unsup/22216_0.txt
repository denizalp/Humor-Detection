Have to say, not great. I have been by here many times and wanted to try it. Finally did. First thing I noticed was the staff. Them were gossiping behind the counter and service took forever. The were friendly but the gossip went on and on and on. And loud with out any concern what was said in front of customers. Bad optics\nNow for the food, the burger simply was not great, meat was not juicy and was tough. The toppings were very fresh but the bun fell apart.Very little taste. The fries were hand cut but didn't taste great, I would have to say with all the choices these days for burgers, like Burger Priest, 5 Guys etc... they could do a little better, seems to be coasting on locals nostalgia . I would give it a pass, I saw I came I won't be back.
