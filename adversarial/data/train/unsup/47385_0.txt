Though I'm not much of a Cirque du Soleil fan, I am a huge Beatles fan.  While visiting Las Vegas recently, it was the only show that really appealed to me, and when you're in Vegas you just have to catch a show!\n\nSuffice to say, I was enamored by the performance.  Seeing the songs put to motion, with rich costumes, fun, quirky props, and outstanding acrobatics, was positively breathtaking.  The endearing love story woven through the extensive selection of Beatles tunes captured and held me from the very start.  \n\nIf I ever have the opportunity to see it again, I am totally there!  This is a show that's not to be missed!
