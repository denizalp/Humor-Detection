Booked a room here online for really cheap. Clue 1 ignored... \nWalk in, its very outdated. Clue 2 ignored...\nGo to check in and its a long line with the people from wal-mart... clue 3 ignored\nAll this aside, the staff was very curtious and friendly.\nThe room is ok, still unclear why theres a lamp right up in the curtains next to the window. \nI go to plug in my phone charger and not an outlet to be found. I had to move the end table and unplug the crappy alarm clock just to get an outlet next to the bed. \nFinally, morning. Go to take a shower and theres no hot water... wtf. How can you charge a resort fee for this kind of Motel8 experience !?? \nIf you want the motel eperience with a hotel price. This is the place for you.\nMy advice....pay a little more and get a real hotel.
