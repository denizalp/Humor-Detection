As most sewing-enthusiasts in Montreal already know, there are many fabric stores on St-Hubert, but in my opinion, this is the only store worth visiting. Every year around this time I pull out my sewing machine and start cracking on my home-made\/home-sewn Christmas gifts. Consequently, as soon as I decide what those gifts will include, I plan a trip to Effiloché to buy some glorious fabric for my projects. I have attempted to buy fabric from other much cheaper stores on St-Hubert, but I find it to be completely ridiculous that the bolts of fabric at the other stores are unlabeled and therefore, it is impossible to know what material the fabric is made of (polyester, a cotton-blend, rayon!?!? Incidentally, your guess is as good as the shopkeeper's). Not only is the fabric well-labeled at Effiloché, there are even some lovely organic cotton options which can be the basis for great baby shower gifts.\n\nThe only reason for my 4-star rating is that invariably the employees seem rather apathetic and uninterested in assisting customers. Admittedly and sadly, this is a common thread with customer-service with almost all Montreal businesses, and I might add that I have gotten used to it since moving here a few years ago, but I find it off-putting nonetheless. \n\nAlso, these well-labeled fabrics come at a great cost... perhaps a bit too pricey for mostly cotton textiles and other calicos, even compared with fabric stores in NYC. In fact, when making a trip back to my former neighborhood not long ago, I paid much less for the equivalent quality fabric at a store I visited in Brooklyn recently.
