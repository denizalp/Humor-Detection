Ok- this place is happening in Vegas so here are some tips... get there early (before 9pm) and grab as many cupons from the guy out front.  Fridays is latin night so they have dancing on the rooftop and on the main floor (first floor after 11pm). YOU HAVE TO EXPERIANCE IT!\n\nNow- with that said, let me tell you why it is only 3 stars.  The food is worst than TGI.Fridays. the nachos were a large portion but it is soaked with cheap cheese sauce, hardly any chicken and a small spoonful of guacamole.   All of that for $20. Not worth it at all.  \n\nSo, bottom line...eat at the food court accross the street for half the price.  Drink up, dance hard and dont drive drunk.
