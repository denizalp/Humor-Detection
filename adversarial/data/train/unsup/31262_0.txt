What a disappointment!   We have been here several times and this was the last. We met out of town friends for lunch.  Nothing I saw on website said that it was only brunch on Saturday afternoon.  Very limited menu!!   My chicken strawberry salad was terrible.  Chicken meant little pieces of dark meat.  Other ingredients were shredded.  It was bad. We shared desserts at the table and the cowboy dessert needed a chainsaw to cut and they did not give us a knife!!   Our water glasses were left empty.  Obviously it was embarrassing and disappointing. It is time to judge by food and service and not pretty flowers.
