The hype is not real. Definitely underwhelmed with The Baked Bear when compared to ice cream sandwich shops such as: CREAM, Slickables or Milk. I'll just say the long line is not worth the wait.\n\nThe cookie selection is typical and so are the ice cream flavors. Think classic flavors. You can do an ice cream bowl (think Pizookie), donut sandwiches or ice cream cookie sandwiches. Decided to split a cookie ice cream sandwich with a friend and chose to mix and match cookies: Cinnamon Bun and White Chocolate Macadamia with their House ice cream, Bear Batter which is a cake batter dyed blue with brownie pieces. We got it warmed and split as well.\n\nThe cookies were underwhelming, crumbly and not warm at all. Definitely expected a soft, chewy and substantial cookie. As for the ice cream, it was icy and tasted freezer burnt. The artificial cake batter flavor was off putting and stains ones mouth blue. Definitely not good nor acceptable to be eating pieces of frost. \n\nThe interior is simple, with a vibe of being unfinished. There is however, lots of seating indoors and out on the patio area.\n\nDidn't think The Baked Bear would lack in quality, but found it lacking. Not sure if it's poor execution since I know TBB has multiple locations in San Diego and San Francisco with stellar reviews.
