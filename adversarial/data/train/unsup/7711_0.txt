Shiki Sushi is one of the worst joints i've ever been too. Its in a great location for me, but I've been there twice and i will never go back again.\n\nI went there for brunch the first time with two of my friends..the service was amazing, and the japanese plum wine was delicious. ALSO THEY SERVE THE SUSHI IN BOATS! That was awesome.\n\nBut thats where the buck stops.\n\nIn the two times i've been there, i've found that \n\n1. The amount of rice they put into their maki rolls is disgusting. You can barely see any of the other toppings. I guess their goal is to try and fill you up on rice so you dont cost them to much.\n\n2. We ordered the chicken teriyaki...i have never ever in my life had chicken teriyaki that tasted like...despair. \n\n3. Not against the restaurant, but both times I was there, there were some sketchy patrons.\n\n\nI'm sorry Shiki, i gave you two tries. But you're not worth it,
