Came here after seeing their cool pictures and awesome reviews. I have to say my results weren't the best. I went in and had my previous SNS removed and had a new color placed. I also went from having long nails to short nails (which are my real nails) My nails were uneven and bulky. They didn't look natural at all which SNS isn't suppose to look like acrylic. The girl that did my nails was rough and distracted by her phone the entire time she was working on my nails. I won't be back.
