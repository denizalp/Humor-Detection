I love this location managers are so friendly and never fail to make your experience a great one. There was a woman (manager) and I wish I remembered her name, but she took such care of us when something wasn't right with our order. We've been to a few chilis and this by far is are absolute favorite location! Thanks for always keeping us happy. We sure will miss this location being that we moved recently :)
