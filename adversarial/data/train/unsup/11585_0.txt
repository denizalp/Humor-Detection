OK, it's Showmars.  So all you snobby food Yelpers need to take it easy.  You know what you're getting - the cute little old Greek guy on TV.  But it ain't all that bad.  This location on 7th Street is right next to a bunch of cool shops (Heroes, VisArt, Ho Ho Cherry House, Sunflour Bakery, Philosopher's Stone, etc.)  So make a day of it!\n\nAnd it's right next to a fun intersection - try not to get hit by a car, it's like playing Frogger.  Yep, you're the frog. Good luck!\n\nService has always been great here.  They are sooooo nice.  Monday night, kids eat free with a paying adult.  And Jason Frame does magic at your table.  His card tricks are really good.  They also have a good variety of side dishes, unlike other Showmars around Charlotte.  I dig the fried okra.  They also have root beer to drink, which is always a bonus.
