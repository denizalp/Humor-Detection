I usually come here during my lunch break. 11-3pm. It starts at 5.95. More for shrimp. \n1. Red curry chicken\n2. Green curry chicken \n3. Panang curry beef \n4. Eggplant tofu \n5. Pad see ew \nLunches come with egg drop soup, white rice, and fried egg roll\n\n- Fast service. Food ready within 5-10min. It's not too hectic where it will take longer than an hour to eat. I'm usually in and out in 30 minutes. \n- Curry is pretty good, but thin. needs more spice. \n- Eggplant tofu, not enough eggplant. \n- Chinese broccoli not in Pad see ew. Regular broccoli.\n- Beef and chicken are tender. \n- Left over spice rack.\n- I feel that food is already made, just microwaved? Not too fresh?\n- Quality is not the best, but for lunch, I rank this place great! Satifying for what it's worth.
