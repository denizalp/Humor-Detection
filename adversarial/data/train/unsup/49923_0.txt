My friend and I were here for Valentine's Day and sampled the Love & Hate menu. While the new Social House definitely has a different vibe from the old location at TI, it's still fabulous and the service was still great. The food was good (especially the lobster) and the atmosphere was fun and lively. It was a bit slow but only because the restaurant was PACKED. The bar area was playing old Jackie Chan movies which I thought was kind of awesome and strange at the same time. Overall, a great experience.
