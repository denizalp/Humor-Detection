I LOVE THIS PLACE. My husband and I are staying for 10 days house hunting and not big fans of strip - dining thanks to the overwhelming prices and super fancy food (which is nice, but not for every day). However, this place is tastey- with large portions and a comfortable atmosphere and although the prices are a bit high, it's worth it IMO. The front is more bar like: tables, bar booths, and video gambling at the bar with tv's for sports if you're into that. My favorite is the back part with spacious booths and a gorgeous fireplace, also very quiet! \n\nNot going to lie, I've only ever ordered one thing- it was what I ordered the first time we went there and I love it so much I just keep ordering it....the turkey burger. It comes with smoked gouda, saut√©ed onions, lettuce, tomato, and onion on a wheat bun. The meat is super flavorful (well seasoned). The bun is honestly always a little crumbly (I think they \"warm\" it) which normally I hate, but it doesn't mess with the final product to me, so it doesn't bother me. It's that good! I always order it with a baked potato and the potato is always half the size of my plate! I love potatoes, so huge win! My husband always orders the same burger I do, only with different sides. He had the baked macaroni and he loved the bits of ham and peas. Fries were good too. \n\nOur drinks are always full and never have issues with service. They are always polite and quick and the manager roaming around always greets us and checks up on us. Our last visit we arrived just barely 25 min before closing and service was still on point and they didn't rush us out. \n\nGets super busy on weekend nights though,  as with most major hotel\/casino restaurants.
