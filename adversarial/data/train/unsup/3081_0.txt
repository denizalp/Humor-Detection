In the tradition of this weekend, I liked the food here and pretty much have a lot of negative things to say about the service.\n\nThe good:\n- it's not that busy but it's still busy enough\n- the food is good; Laura LOVED her special omelette with sweet potatoes and goat cheese. I liked the hashbrowns and the meats are from Rowe farms.\n- the homemade ketchup is GREAT. It's spicy and sweet.\n- the coffee is fine.\n- it's cheap. Two breakfasts for 22$.\n\nThe bad:\n- there is only one cook and the food takes forever.  This in turn leads to long ass wait times for table turnover.\n- they don't have a system for having people wait. We waited outside for forever for a table and they finally sat us in the worst seat in the place next to the kitchen and the cash register. There were two free tables when we sat down and people who arrived after us were seated at a much better table. This was the epitome of annoying to me and the staff seems like they don't know that this was wrong.\n- I generally thought the staff was pretty terrible.\n\nFunny story:\nThere was a woman who accosted Laura M at the parking meter and shouted a crazy rant at her.  It was pretty offensive so I'll leave it out of the review but pm me for details :) it was kinda hilarious and I am not sure if she was a real nutter or if this was performance art.  It involved a lot of fist pumping and a (possibly) fake English accent.\n\nWould I go here again?\nI wouldn't make a habit out of it but I really liked their ketchup. I might try to make that ketchup at home and if I succeed then I would have no reason to ever come here again.
