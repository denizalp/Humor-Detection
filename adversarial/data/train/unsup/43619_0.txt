This place is off the strip in the Palms. We made reservations, but when we arrived, it definitely wasn't needed. There was maybe 4 other tables seated when we arrived at 7p on a Saturday. It filled up a bit more while we were there, but definitely wasn't busy. \n\nWe decided to eat here because it was close to the Rio, which was where we were catching the Penn and Teller show, otherwise I definitely would have chosen a steakhouse on the strip. It had a strange ambience to it: dimly lit, nice furnishings, borderline between a modern, clubby look and an attempt to be fancy? But it was playing rock music. Did not help the vibe at all. \n\nService was ok. It started off great; our waitress was friendly and attentive, but towards the end of dinner....she disappeared for good amounts of time. We're not a needy bunch, but when I notice something like that, it means she was gone for a LONG TIME. It tooks us a while to get our bill. \n\nNow the food....and this is where the rating can also be misleading, but I look at the whole picture when rating (ambience, service, food, location, etc). \n\nThe food was delicious! Lobster potstickers are a must. The steak melted in my mouth. The sides....mac n cheese, au gratin, baked potatoes....amazing. If I was purely rating on just food, this place would definitely be 4 stars.\n\nIf it were on the strip....with better design to help it's ambience, I think N9NE would have been a 4 or 5 star place. But if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and still want some really good food-N9NE would be a place for you.
