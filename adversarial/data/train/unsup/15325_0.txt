Who did I go with:\n\nMy friends from Socal\n\nGoing into the restaurant:\n\nLots of parking. Really small restaurant, not dirty. The toppings or sides like lemons and hot sauce are all located by the drinks so it's really convenient. They also have their prices listed and their taco Tuesday special prices listed on the side. Very good for people who ask if they have Tuesday specials. There was an all you can eat option, but I couldn't go with it at the time.\n\nWhat I ordered:\n\nTacos, burritos, fish tacos, carne asada fries.\n\nPros:\n\n+ carne asada fries are good\n+ fish tacos are good\n+ burrito is big\n\nCons:\n\n- taco is size of palm of your hand. Wtf man.
