A1 Garage Door Service saved me big time today! I was heading off to work but my garage door had other plans. In a panic that I was going to have to call into work today, I found A1 Garage Door Service and gave them a call (at 7am!) Working with them today was a pleasure from start to finish. I spoke with Kat initially who worked hard to get a tech. out to see me asap even though their schedule was packed. Within minutes she called me back stating that a tech. was on the way. Trevor arrived promptly, assessed the problem immediately, and got me off to work in no time. A1 Garage Door Services were extremely fairly priced and I would recommend this company over and over again to any friend or family member in need.
