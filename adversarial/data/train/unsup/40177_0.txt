Couldn't wait to try out this location because we had been to their previous one and thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely did not let us down. Wonderful atmosphere, great service, delicious tapas with beautiful presentation, nice patio area and very talented singer. In addition, owners Larry and Emily both came to our table to see how things were, and chat with us about their upcoming plans for the patio area. Enjoyed our time there and look forward to a return visit....
