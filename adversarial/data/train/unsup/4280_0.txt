What a college fast food place is supposed to look and feel like.\n\nI live around Palo Alto (Stanford ) these days and it's just too clean and sanitary for a college town.,\n\nI miss the look and feel of liquored up frat boys staggering down to this place, to fill up on mass quantities of tube steaks,wings and fried taters.\n\nNothing like a genuine college ghetto to bring back memories of my youthful indiscretions . \n\nPalo Alto reminds me of the Stepford Wives and Singapore rolled into one big sterile petri dish.
