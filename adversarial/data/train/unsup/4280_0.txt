Fly all the way to the Phoenix Metro area and what the heck, let us go to Korean BBQ for lunch!  Hey, I recognize that chain - \"Gen Korean BBQ\", the dance club music , modern, new - only a month old, Korean BBQ restaurant staffed by young, hip, 20 somethings.  For those concerned with smelling like BBQ after eating, you still will, but not as bad as the old style Korean BBQ joints with overhanging exhaust hoods.  At Gen, the BBQ smoke is sucked away through the vent in the grill thus the place is not hazy with smoke.  You cook everything yourself, thus a lot of time for talking and saying Whassup?\n\nWhat to eat for $15.99 of the possible 32 items or $24.99 of the possible 37 items in two hours at 4 plates per order (4 limit plate per order)?  Eat it all like the pudgy NK Dictator would do!  Your server can provide suggestions and did.  Jan ( a cool guy not to be confused with a KPop girl) did a great job, keeping our protein supply going.  Had 3 rounds or 12 plates among the three of us with three changes of the grill.  All within 2 hours...actually only one and half hours as we were stuffed.  Conceptually, a table for four would be the perfect size as you could easily manage grilling 4 orders or 16 plates in two hours.\n\nLiked it all especially with the sesame & salt paste.  We have had KBBQ many times before but had Pork Jowl and Garlic Squid for the first time.  Nice... We ordered Jowl again in the last round since we liked it so much.  The other items were great also.  Beef Steak, Pork Belly, Bulgoki, etc.. Get it all, eat it all, and expand the waist line....
