This is probably one of the more mediocre buffets in the strip resorts (for the price).\nYou're unlikely to be bowled over by the selection, or find anything new and exciting.\n\nOn the plus side, getting wine from the bar was pretty fast and efficient.\n\nTheres the typical line of buffet foods from each region: Mexican, Italian, Southern, American etc. With the very stereotypical dishes that people think actually come from those regions..\n\nThe seats were very uncomfortable... most likely to prevent hordes of the obese from settinling in and eating for the entire dinner or lunch periods. I sort of get that, but most people don't spend hour after hour grazing the buffet, so why should they have to sit uncomfortably?\n\nBonus points for not having long lines at the different buffet stands.. though I wonder whether that isn't for good reason.
