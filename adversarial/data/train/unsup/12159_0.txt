Here we go again. So many people told me how good this place was. I don't know what they are eating or what they are comparing it to, it is horrible. Jay P. who says he is from DC, nailed the description of the omelette perfectly. The service is abysmal, which really hurts a restaurant such as this. When you can't fall back on the food to be good, and your service fails you, you have nothing left. The name implies 'french.\" One bite of a croissant tells you it should be called La Pillsbury. The coffee is good, but it is no secret, it's Kickapoo, which is a pretty good coffee.\n\nThe bland food, the horrible croissant, the uninteresting and dated selection of menu choices does nothing to bring me back, and it won't.
