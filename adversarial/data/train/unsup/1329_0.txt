While others have written some good reviews of what Poke Poku is and what it's not (I know it's not considered authentic by some), for me it just hits the spot. Especially when I have a sushi craving but don't want to drive to my favorite sushi place to get it. Poke Poku takes care of my spicy tuna cravings among other things and has lots of sauce choices and various topping add ons to take care of those cravings with ease. They also don't mind adjusting how much rice gets put in the bowl and that I like to mix white and brown rice too. Tack on friendly service and how easy it is to get to off the 215 when I'm in a hurry and I can't help but come back again and again. \n\n3 Stars. Why 3 and not 4? I haven't explored all of their offerings and combinations yet. That's going to take some time and is something I look forward to doing. I'm sure the star count will come up in due time.
