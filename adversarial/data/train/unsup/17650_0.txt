Appalling! We couldn't get into Local across the street, so went in on a whim. Don't let the updated exterior fool you. It's the same old dark & dingy place, reaking of spilled beer. There were families, eldery couples, middle-aged like us from the neighbourhood. Waitress said that everything was 'awesome' after each order. Well, it truly was not awesome. She said the bartender made the best Cosmo she had ever had - bleh - sickly sweet, no lime. Nothing on the menu appealed to us - same old, same old pub staples, cooked from frozen. We opted for  a couple of the specials. Ribs & wings for my husband, with fries so salty they were inedible. Ribs were grey, no flavour, with BBQ sauce spread on top (Kraft no doubt). I ordered the pork stir fry special. The pork was cooked beyond recognition - yesterday's leftovers I think - a glob of noodles, with teriyaki sauce from a jar, and nary a vegetable to be found. The chef should be embarassed to serve food like that. We can seriously say we will never, ever eat there again.
