I need to start by saying it's been a few years since my mother, sister, or I have returned from Cali. without Sprinkles in tote. I know my sister loves classic red velvet. My mom? Anything with coconut! I am so delighted to have Sprinkles right next to my job!!!\n\nWelcome to Las Vegas, Sprinkles! (Ya took too long ;) )\n\nNow I attended their pre-opening party and satiated my craving for cupcakes and ice cream. Thank you for inviting my family and I, btw. That still didn't deter my plans for being there opening day. My mom and I were 6 and 7th in line and got lucky with Lemon Meringue and Cuban Coffee being the special cupcakes. We each purchased a box of 4 for $15. I chose 2 cuban coffees, a lemon meringue,  and a chai latte. The employees are all very nice and excited to help the next guess. I love how the same person takes your order and boxes it so you know there will be NOTHING lost in translation. I have enjoyed every cupcake I've tasted except the chocolate marshmallow. I'm not a marshmallow fan though \"p The Cuban coffee and peanut butter chocolate are my absolute faves to date. \n\nNow I need to point out a few things. \n\nIs Sprinkles a lil more expensive than you would like? \nSure! But you need to understand the quality of ingredients you are receiving. They use the best vanilla, valrhona cocoa powder, fresh citrus zest and berries. Plus they take care of their cupcakes by packaging them perfectly which isn't cheap. \n\nWill it be busy?\nOF COURSE, DUH! It's not the most popular cupcake in the world or anything, oh wait yes, yes it is!!! There are 3 avenues to get your fix. Cupcakes, ice cream (where you can also get a cupcake), and a 24hr cupcake ATM. \n\nThere will be haters. Let them be. Sprinkles is AMAZING. \n\nThe end.
