After seeing a reviews of this restaurant on yelp, We decided to make a visit. I previously tried many \"authentic middle eastern\" cuisines in the metropolitan area, but the mediterranean grill surprised me the most with their flavorful food and exceptional service. \n Not only was the food authentic, but I was able to remember my childhood which was a pleasant sensation. \n The kefta kabob was perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. \n The chicken kabob was sensational. It was the most moist chicken i ate in the valley.     The beef kabob was great as well, but lacked a little salt to my taste. Having said that, it was moist, succulent, and tender which countered the slight negativity I had.\n The shwarma is great, flavorful, and everything I expected it to be. For a restaurant that just opened, they are doing everything right.\n Visit them,  you will not be disappointed in the very least. 5 stars for food, service, and bringing back the memories of my past.
