\"AYCE SUSHI!!\" (pops head up)\n\nThat light bulb in my head shined bright when I heard we were heading to an AYCE sushi place (+ more). \n\nThis restaurant, located in an outdoor shopping mall\/outlet in Vegas made me yearn for sushi as I saw their sushi display. They had other sections, such as, a soup section (miso soup, etc), hot foods with mussels, noodles, etc, but all I cared for (besides dessert) was just  sushi.  Everything looked good, but there weren't any labels of what exactly each sushi was. Luckily I had an eye for sushi, being that I LOVE sushi, and was able to distinguish what each roll had. Everything looked fresh.. or so I thought. \n\nAs I sat down, I devoured, well, tried to devour each roll. I couldn't eat everything from each piece of sushi because geez, there was SO MUCH RICE. C'mon people, where is my fish?I didn't pay for rice! I literally had a pile of rice chunks on my plate, just so I didn't get full off of rice. I need to make room for other things like dessert! Plus the fish didn't feel or taste fresh at all. But I guess that happens when you're at an AYCE sushi buffet +more. If you've been to Todai, then Makino's is like or perhaps a little bit better than Todai's quality of sushi. I honestly don't think my $16.95 (wkend lunch price) was worth it. But I did eat it any way, and managed to eat some of the tempura shrimps they had, which weren't that bad. \n\nThe best thing that this place offers, besides good service, was their dessert! Yes, there are cookies, mini cakes (that are what ever), but they have GREEN TEA ice cream.. and drum roll pls..... RED BEAN ICE CREAM, one of my favorite flavors, EVER! Oh man, I felt like I was in red bean, green tea heaven. I have never in my life been to a place that offers all you can eat green tea and red bean ice cream. NOM NOM NOM, is exactly what you heard after going back two times to get more of it. Too bad it wasn't mochi.. or I would have stuck with dessert the whole time I was there!
