We came here on Boxing Day morning and the place wasn't too busy. \n\nThe waitress came by to take our order a couple of times before we decided and that was the end of her attentiveness. \n\nOne of our guests asked for his meat side to be plated separately (does not eat pork and instead of ordering sausage as an extra we share it from his meal). I also asked for maple syrup with my French toast and another guest asked for water to drink.\n\nAfter taking our order the waitress did not return and avoided eye contact. I literally did a two handed wave to get her attention for the water. \n\nWhen the food arrived it was mediocre and luke warm. \nThe meat was plated on top of the eggs and no maple syrup. Then we couldn't get the waitress to understand what we meant about the sausage. She did take the plate away and bring it back with the meat separate, they did not replace the eggs.\n\nThen had to chase down the waitress for more coffee, which ended up not being hot anyway. \n\nWould definitely not return.
