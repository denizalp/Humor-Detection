\"Cleveland. Where the lake is Erie and the tower is Terminal.\" -- John Grabowski of the Western Reserve Historical Society.\n\nThis weekend, we traveled 42 flights to the observation deck of the Terminal Tower. Oft heralded as Cleveland's most iconic structure since it's birth in the late 1920's; the view was remarkable. Located centrally on Public Square, the observation deck offered a 30 mile, 360-degree view of city. The Flats, Lake Erie, the Cuyahoga River and the distant suburbs could all be seen from this vantage point.\n\nMike Hudson, lead singer of  the '70s punk band the Pagans compared the Terminal Tower to a \"medieval fortress,\" or the \"Emerald City of Oz.\" Beloved local weatherman Dick Goddard refers to the tower as the \"Gray Lady.\" Call it whatever you'd like, the Terminal Tower is an awe inspiring structure. \n\nIt's architecture is certainly unique to the other skyscrapers in this city. Similarities are often drawn to buildings that came out of Communist USSR in the late '30s-'50s. Whether or not the Stalin inspired Gothic designs were a point of reference or not remains unknown. \n\nPrimarily used today for mixed use office space, the Terminal Tower, despite no longer being the largest building in Cleveland, will forever reign as one of the most memorable symbols of the city. Whether in daylight or at night when lit up in one of the alternating colors depending on season or significance, the 80-year-old tower is plenty deserving of serving as landmark to Cleveland's Public Square now and into the future.
