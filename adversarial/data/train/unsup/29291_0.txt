I was excited to try Guy's spot when I was in Vegas, only to be very disappointed. I had a pulled pork sandwich and there was just nothing special about it. The fries were even mediocre. I was with 3 friends and they felt the same about their meals. For the price, I was thinking to myself, I'd rather be eating at a dive from his show. I think you can do much better in Vegas so save yourself the disappointment....
