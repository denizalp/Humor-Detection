I went to this office because it had all these great reviews well from the moment I walked in it was a major disappointment. There was only 1 other person in front of me it took over a hour to be seen. The bathrooms were disgusting no paper towels garbage everywhere and the front desk had horrible customer service. I went there to get my thyroid checked so they sent me to go get blood work done. Over a week goes by and I never received a phone call so I called them left a message no one called me back and I called again the next week so 3 weeks not since my blood work and at this point I'm frustrated left another message never called back. So I went and got my results myself from the lab and went somewhere else to be told I have to go see a specialist because I could have a autoimmune disease. Thanks for Caring for your patients! I will never go back there worst experience I have ever had.
