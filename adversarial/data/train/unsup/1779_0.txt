Apparently Pandas are plentiful in the Cleveland, Panda BUFFETS that is:) \n\nThis smaller version of Panda Buffet is up in Willoughby,  just off the main drag of Euclid Avenue. it's a nice little place where the food is good, plentiful and fresh and staff are very nice and always on point to make sure you glass is full and your needs are tended to. I don't know if the place is good for big groups, but if you're interested in stopping off before a movie at the local theater, or catching a quick and healthy bite before going shopping, I suggest the Panda. Their prices are good and they won't empty your wallet while you fill up your \"tank\";)\n\nSo, stop by the Panda Buffet, it \"bears\" up very well against the competition:)
