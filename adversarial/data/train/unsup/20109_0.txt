I stopped into this goodwill to buy some roller blades for some good CHEAP fun. I was excited to see that the roller blades we're all tagged for $5 and $6 so I tried on a few and found some that fit me fine but had some plastic cracking off. Figuring they were only $6 would get them regardless. When I got to the register to purchase them the cashier asked to step away to go check on the price and came back with a $20 sticker. She charged me $20 for broken rollerblades and said she had to change the price because the brand was a good brand. I'm sorry but are you serious?????? They were all tagged for so cheap and she was so insistent on overcharging me. Terrible business and communication. Don't go here the prices are not what they appear apparently. Never going here again I got hella hoed for some broken rollerblades.
