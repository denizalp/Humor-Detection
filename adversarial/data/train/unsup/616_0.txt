We always get our hairs cut here and usually have Dee perform the deed because she is excellent at her trade!  I was an observer tonight and she did a great job on the missus and my boy (5\/5).  Highly suggest checking in online as it helps you get through the wait much quicker.   I've not cut the shag in a while but if I do, it will be at the location with Dee!!  I look like a zombie don't I?
