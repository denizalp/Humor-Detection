This is the place to grab an outstanding burger or anything with brisket. It's pretty easy to miss but it is behind The Lion and next to a car wash. The location is kinda small and the ambiance a little wanting so take it at face value. The staff could really make this a 5 star place if they turned up the friendly-o-meter... The food is what you really come here for and it does not disappoint. They consistently turn out great burgers with awesome toppings and sauces. The brisket sandwich brings me back every time and the brisket poutine is a treat to be indulged sparingly.
