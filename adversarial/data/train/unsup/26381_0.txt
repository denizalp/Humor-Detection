Great place. The service is very friendly and prompt. My espresso was perfect. I had tiramisu, and it was solid. I have had better but this one was tasty and smooth, and nice but not amazing. Next time I go (and there will be the next time), I will try something else.\nIf you are planning to take crepes or waffles - the portions are huge - so you have been warned! :)
