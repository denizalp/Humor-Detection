Arizona mills just reminds me of Ontario mills back in California. Nothing really special other than I has the hamster pool thing indoors and a aquarium you can explore. There are a few stores that are as simular as Ontario mills, but still check this mall out even if you've been to the one in California.\n\nJust like any other malls would have: JCPENNY, Macy's, Nordstrom, Charlotte Russ, Forever 21 and etc...\n\nReasons I come here...\n\n+ AC! Don't lie, you probably come here for that too since it's 100 degrees out. D:\n+ weekends are usually the time I'm here because there are a lot of items for sale!\n+ Now that I know this place is close to the house my boyfriend has, I can come here whenever. :)\n\ncan't wait to visit again and shop!
