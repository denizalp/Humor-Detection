No strip club in Vegas depends on tourists to set the vibe more than Glitter Gulch.  When the tourists are flowing and the mood is high energy, this place is great.  But watch out for the slower nights because GG is Vegas' oldest strip club and on the down nights it shows its age with a grumpy air and entitled dancers.\n\nThe club has chameleon-like qualities.  One night it is lively, fun and filled with very attractive dancers.  Other nights, the place is empty, looks run down and hosts older, run down dancers.  \n\nLocals tend to be a little wary of the club since it charges a $20 entry fee to everyone (most clubs will waive entry fees for locals).  To be fair, that entry fee comes with two free drinks, but it's still a shock to the system to be charged as a local. \n\nOn its best nights, the quality of the women and the fun energy in the air make GG a 3 star club.  On its worst nights, GG is a 1 star club.  It's probably best to save your visit for that night down on Fremont when you are too smashed to drive.
