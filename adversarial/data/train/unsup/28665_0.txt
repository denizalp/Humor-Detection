Checking another one off my bookmark list, I was super impressed with this Chinese restaurant.  Small, but a good amount of seating.  More upscale than your typical Chinese restaurant.  What I was most impressed by, was the lack of grease in the food!  Typically ordering Chinese food tastes so heavy and can be shiny with grease.  Not here though.  Friendly service.  And they offer takeout\/delivery.  I'll be coming back here for sure.  Best part is the White Rabbit candies with the bill!
