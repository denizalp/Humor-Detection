It is hard to be two different things.  Is this an Expensive Steakhouses or a Bennigan's?  \n\nEven though the food is really good this place is not nice enough to justify the upscale prices.  It has a fun atmosphere, but $15 margaritas should not be served in a plastic carafe. \n\nI am sure the cost of that location is astronomical, but I doubt straddling the line between two identities is the way to go.
