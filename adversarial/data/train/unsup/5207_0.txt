First time here and not too sure what to expect. Walked in and the place is packed. Booths and bar tables. The place is loud with some good music playing. Let me clarify. Place was loud with everyone eating, drinking and having a good time. Very upbeat environment. \n\nWe started out by ordering the eel cucumber roll, Shrimp Tempura roll, and Rainbow roll. I know my bad, I forgot to order the Surfer. Next time. The sushi was really good. Fresh and good. My wife really like the shrimp tempura but I'm not picky. Liked them all. \n\nI ordered the fish tacos. The soft tortillas were a little hard and the salsa was a little overpowering. Didn't taste the fish as much as the salsa. So the tacos were okay. Not great. \n\nMy wife had the Yakisoba chicken. It had mushrooms, carrots, Broccoli, onions, and zucchini with thinly cut chicken. Loved the noodles and the sauce. Very tasty but the chicken was a little dry. Seemed like it was a little overcooked. My son had the teriyaki chicken dinner. He said the chicken was good and moist and he gobbled it all up. It came with rice and vegetables. I think it had zucchini, mushrooms and a ton of onions. \n\nService was very good. Our server greeted us right away and got us our drinks. Our food came fairly quickly and he was constantly refilling our water glasses and checking up on us. \n\nSo overall, really good sushi, okay dinner entrees and great service with a vibrant atmosphere. We enjoyed ourselves and will probably come back so I can order this famous Surfer roll (thanks Bonnie E)
