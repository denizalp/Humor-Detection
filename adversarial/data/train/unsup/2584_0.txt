Was recently in Vegas and wanted to drop by to visit the famous Carlos Bakery from Cake Boss. It was actually very disappointing and a huge let down. All I tried was the chocolate cannoli so maybe I didn't have the right thing but... It was sold in a pack of 6 for $30. The favor was not there and it just tasted frozen. It left a weird aftertaste too that was also unpleasant. I would say Carlos Bakery is a pass!
