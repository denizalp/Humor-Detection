If I must, I will give Ernesto and this salon one star.\n\nI went in with hair to die for - almost to my waist, healthy and shiny - and came out with it at my shoulders. Layered like crazy. I absolutely hate it, and worst of all, I could not have been more clear that he was ABSOLUTELY NOT TO CUT IT TOO SHORT. But that's exactly what he did.\n\nIf he had stopped showing off and throwing my hair up in the air to cut it like Edward Scissorhands.  Or maybe if he had taken a break from flirting wildly with me. Maybe he would have listened to me say before he even started that I only wanted a 0.5 inch trim, and that i didn't want it layered. He said he was \"thinning\" it at one point and asked if a full inch was ok to clean up some ends. I agreed but suddenly he is getting carried away. I told him MULTIPLE times, be careful, it's getting short. Watch what you're doing - I don't want layers and this feels a bit layer-y. And then it was too late. \n\nWhen I left the salon I tried to convince myself that I liked it. But I played with it in the mirror at home and for the first time ever, burst into tears. \n\nI called him 2 days later and told him very nicely that I thought it was too short. He told me to blowdry it (thanks, I never thought of that), and said basically what do you want me to do about it, in two weeks you're going to love it. Actually he didn't even apologize. To his credit, he offered to refund the cost of the cut but I was so disgusted and upset that I didn't go back to get it. I tried to forget all about it.\n\nI have never been upset about a haircut before. I'm a low maintenance person. But when you go in for a trim on long thick beautiful hair, and you come out with 7-8 inches less and a ponytail that won't hold the elastic band anymore, it's a BIG deal. It affects your confidence -- it's not just a haircut. Giving back my $100 is not going to fix it, Ernesto. You should have been more careful to start with.
