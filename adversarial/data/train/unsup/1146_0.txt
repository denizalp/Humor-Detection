WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nThe pizzas and the pastas. This restaurant is a sister restaurant of the Terroni family. \n\nSpecializes in house made sauces, pastas and pizza doughs, we tried the San Giorgio pizza and spaghetti allo scoglio. For the appetizer we had funghi assoluti. \n\nThe pizza had many pieces of hot calabrese salami on top. Fresh mushrooms were the regular white button mushrooms. I thought they would use some other kind of varietal mushroom that you can't find readily at other restaurants so the pizza tasted alright. I didn't find the pizza interesting. In fact, I added some arugula from the funghi assoluti salad and it made the pizza taste so much better. \n\nThe funghi assoluti was on the pricier side for what the dish consisted of. It had baked oyster mushroom which tasted amazing with the mixture of breadcrumbs, EVOO, balsamic vinegar and parmigiana but the dish itself wasnt worth the $16 to pay. \n\nThe Spaghetti allo scoglio had abundance of seafood in the dish. But be prepared for the dish to be on the somewhat smaller side for $24. The sauce was light and flavourful though, and the spaghetti was al dent√©. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nIf you ever think of Terroni for dinner, this location is the least busiest and often can find seats on a Friday or Saturday for dinner. Perhaps because not a lot of people know this restaurant is also in the Terroni family.
