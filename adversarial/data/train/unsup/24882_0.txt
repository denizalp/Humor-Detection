If you want to know what the color beige tastes like. Eat here.  Nothing good, nothing terrible pretty much bland and dry across the board.  \n\nSushi option is small and awful.  Breads are dry and hard.  Salad bar is so small with few options.  All the meats taste pretty much the same.  \n\nYou can do better for your money at any other buffet in town.
