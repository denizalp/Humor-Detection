Had lunch there today.  Had the Living Social Deal, and what a deal it was. Well worth it . Had immediate service. Asked \"Matt\" the waiter for any suggestions regarding menu. He suggested the pork taco w\/ mango salsa and a carne asada taco. The pork was delicious, the mango salso just as good. All the flavors blended so well. The Carne Asada had an overly charcoal grilled flavor but still pretty good. The meal also came with black beans and a garlic seasoned rice, Very good. Huge portions. Could not finish everything because there was so much. Chips and salsa were served as well. Chips great, salsa was not the greatest (reminded me of a sauce) it lacked flavor but had spice. Not heat. It's hard to find a great salsa but all in all I would definitely return back to Fuegos Tacos. Service was exceptional food was delicious (with the exception of the salsa). And plenty of food at reasonable prices.
