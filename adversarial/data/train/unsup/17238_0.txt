WOW, WOW, WOW is all that I can say! We are SO excited to have this fabulous new restaurant within biking distance from our house. There are so many great things about this place, I don't even know where to begin so i'm going to make bullet points to make sure that I don't miss a thing!\n\n*Dog-friendly patio\n*Happy Hour from 3-7p\n*Gorgeous open-air ambiance\n*Super friendly service\n*DELICIOUS cocktails - I had a cucumber + jalapeno mule and it was so fresh and tasty! Not too sweet either. \n*They use locally sourced, organic ingredients\n*Great beer selection\n*FOOD IS AMAZING! \n\nWe ordered their grilled artichoke appetizer to start and you guys, I will be dreaming about this for days. There were 4 BIG artichoke heart halves + stems, grilled to perfection served over a crunchy flatbread with homemade hummus, over mixed greens with tomatoes and an onion vinaigrette. It was all topped with LOADS of parmesan cheese! Like BEYOND dreamy.\n\nFor the pizza, we split The Doc which was packed with so many goodies! It had mozzarella, tomatoes, fennel sausage, pancetta, goat cheese, asparagus, and basil, to name a few. \n\nWe will be back SO SOON. Like maybe this weekend!! :) Welcome to the neighborhood, Pitch!
