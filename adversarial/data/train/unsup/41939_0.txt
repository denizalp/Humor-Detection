Wouldn't recommend to anyone, food is bland, not fresh, dsnt feel like anything close to east Indian food, in face, my 5 yr old boy would probably cook it better than them. \nI don't see myself coming close to them again. \nI'm going regularly to east Indian places, this one is probably the worst I've ever tried.
