Me and my friend were in the area and decided to stop here for lunch.  I'm always down for some good tacos and this spot looked pretty legit.  From the sound of it, it reminded me of Tacos El Gordo back in SD kind of.  \n\nWe walked in and placed our order.  I got 3 carne asada tacos on corn tortillas (I noticed here in Phoenix, they give you the option most places..corn or flour) and I got a small carne asada caramelo (quesadilla\/mulita).  My friend got some carne asada tacos and some lengua I think.  We had Mexican Cokes to drink.  Quick rundown on how everything was...............\n\nCarne Asada Tacos ($2.00)-  Legit.  The carne asada was cooked over charcoal and had good flavor to it.  Minimal gristle\/fat which was nice.  They come plain on double layered corn tortillas.  I topped mine with some onion\/cilantro mix and some hot sauce.  They were pretty good...best carne asada tacos I have had so far in Phoenix.\n\nCaramelo ($2.50) -  This was a mini quesadilla with carne asada.  It was filling and delicious.  Same good carne asada and a good helping of cheese.  I would definitely get one again.  They have a larger size too (probably in a flour tortilla) for like $5.00.\n\nTotal for everything was around $20.00.  My friend bought me lunch which was awesome and much appreciated!  I even scored an extra taco because she couldn't eat her last one.  When it comes to an additional taco, don't have to tell me twice...ate that sucka in 10 seconds flat!\n\nI could see myself coming back.  This was the closest thing yet to reminding me of Tacos El Gordo or Tacos El Poblano in SD.  The guys working there were friendly and personable.  Nice little spot!
