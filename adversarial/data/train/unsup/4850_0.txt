Ok I'm updating this because we had a large party (40+) here and shockingly and against all the previous reviews....the service was fantastic. Originally they had us on the patio but it was like 90 degrees out there so they adjusted and put us inside very quickly. Lots of beers and drinks flowing, and they came out and presented our group with some sliders, appetizer combo, and chips and queso. I was actually impressed with the service, and the food. Well done Twin Peaks!
