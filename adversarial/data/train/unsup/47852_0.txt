Dinner and drinks in the neighbourhood . Mark is always on the move yet he  always makes you feel welcomed when you enter . Very busy night with locals and Jay's' fans in abundance . Service was good considering the crowd. As always, an excellent mint basil\nMojito to begin. We had some of our favourites including spicy shrimp tacos-so good and hard to share; lamb sliders and a new fav calamari puttanesca. Friends also had samosas, huge smoked meat sandwiches -not my thing but the guys loved them, and the tuna special ( very very spicy)! The last ones there but no one hurried us out . Ended the night with Sambuca and Limincello shots with Mark. A consistently great evening for all of us !
