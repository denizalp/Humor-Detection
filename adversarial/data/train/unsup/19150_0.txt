I need a Snow Room in my house, there's no question.  And even though it's probably a big gimmicky to be in a room where snow is coming down from the ceiling, I had to stand under it the whole time, I was too tickled pink to think of myself standing under this in the middle of the desert.\n\nSo, don't tell anyone, but my wife is a bit (very) snobbish when it comes to her spa rituals, and found the level of service here compared to the spa at Mandarin Oriental not the same.    But really. you just have to go.  Especially for guys.  Go for the pools, go for the shaving steam room, go for the fricking snow room and just take it all in.  They also have a great waiting room with chairs and a TV, where I was watching football for an hour that Sunday afternoon.  What this place lacks in services, it more than makes up for it with its pools and saunas.\n\nBesides the baths and saunas, I got an 80 min massage, and quite honestly didn't even know where I was after that.  The whole place was just terrific, as well as the staff members working there.\n\nWill definitely hit this spot up next time I visit unless I loose my ass off at the casino.
