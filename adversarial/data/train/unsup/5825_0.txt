Came here for a Friday night for a birthday party for one of my friends.  We were allowed to make a reservation for 10.  The server was very slow and service. And we had wanted to order 4 orders of the yellowtail collar but they only had one order left. I ordered the tofu soup with the bulgogi combo.  The bulgogi wasn't even sizzling on the hot plate.  When most of us opened our rice bowls it look like it was eating into only two of them look like they were new.  It took us a while to grab the server's attention to let her know about the rice bowls.
