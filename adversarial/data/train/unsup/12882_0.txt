Alrighty Yeeps! This is the first time that I have tried The Habit Burger Grill, and I must say that this is gonna be a Good Habit for me!\n\nLocated in the Crossroads Town Center, its not hard to find it. Just look for the little white flag that says Now Open! Parking is in a shared parking lot, so you may not find a close parking spot! \n\nThe first thing you notice before you enter is the Open Seating area towards the left of the Entrance. The second thing I noticed is that when you open the door, you are automatically in line to order your meal. That is one flaw that I have noticed....So be prepared to stand outside if the lines are long. \n\nOther than that, It was a pleasant trip! The Order Takers were Pleasant, and Quick. My Meal came out in less than 10 minutes, and the food was pretty good, onion rings were hot, and my burger was neat, and tasty! Lettuce was shredded, not like some other places where they just place a big fat piece of lettuce on the burger. \n\nThe Strawberry Limeade with Cucumber Slices was awesome! Although it does take a bit like Country Time Strawberry Lemonade...lol! \n\nHmmm, What else can I say? Go try it for yourself!\nSYOY
