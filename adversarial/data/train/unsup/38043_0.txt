I'm really a fan of Za's ordering system because it allows you to customize dishes or just go with what's on the menu. I came here for lunch with a friend and it was an interesting experience. Overall, the quality of food matches the prices very well and it's generally inexpensive,\n\nMy friend decided to experiment with a peculiar combination of ingrediants on her pizza at the risk of being disappointed. Her face slowly went from \"that's not bad\" to \"I'm dying a bit inside with each bite\" as she continued to eat. We branded the pizza, the GPS (garlic, pain, and sadness) pizza. So just a tip if you mix ingrediants; do not combine pineapple with garlic, basil, and tomatoes. They tend to go a little heavy on the garlic if you order it so anything sweet is going to taste like tears and disappointment when added. Otherwise, everything was very good. They have a pretty large selection of food and give pretty decent portions for the price. I would recommend this place for anyone who just wants to drop in and get a quick bite to eat. It's also not a bad place to hang out for a bit and converse with friends; they even have a lounge area with couches.
