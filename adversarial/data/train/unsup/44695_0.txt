My sno-cone was pretty good. But we waited 40 minutes for 2 baby sno-cone and one smoothie. Let Jen know that we were still waiting on the smoothie after 30 minutes and she says \"probably..\" Waited another 10 minutes before getting up again and asking for it. We were waiting on a drink that was just sitting in the blender. She gave us the drink and didn't even apologize.  In the end, the smoothie wasn't even good.
