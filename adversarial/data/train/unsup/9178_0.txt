If this place wasn't 10miles from my house I would frequent it all the time!! I went on the road trip here seeking Pomegranate Molasses...yes it is a thing.  They had 4 kinds to choose from!  Mind you I had been to Fry's Marketplace, Whole Foods and Trader Joes trying to find the stuff!  As a side note the Trader Joes 'guy' told me to come here after doing a bit of googling!  FYI Pomegranate Molasses is $27 on Walmart's website!!! At Baiz they have four kinds ranging from $2.49-3.99!  So they are extremely reasonable.  The vegetables section is very fresh with a great variety of vegetation.  If you are making anything from scratch Baiz has amazing ingredients and obscure items to make exotic dishes!  The customer service was very friendly; there were only two cashiers open and decent lines.  But really no big deal, I was tantalized by the yummy looking foreign chocolate bars surrounding the register, but somehow managed to resist!  \n\nJust being in Baiz Market inspires me to want to cook more!!  I will be back.
