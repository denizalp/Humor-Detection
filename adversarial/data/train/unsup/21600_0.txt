This laundromat needs updating severely!  The machines don't wash well and are not as cost effective as your $1.25 building machines.  The \"double\" loaders are single loads and you end up using twice the amount of detergent you would with a \"normal\" machine.  You have to take a 5 minute read time to understand the machines.  You can either pay $2 or a \"double load\", $4 for a \"triple load\" or $5 for the \"giant\".  I believe those are the increments.  The dryers are 8 minutes a quarter, some dryers dry better than others.  This location is open 24 hours and offers a pop machine but NO air conditioning and 4 hard wooden benches to sit on, not comfy at all!  No reading material and the bathroom is from the W.25Th and Clark area.  It has a wash basin and a toilet with toilet paper and NO soap to wash your hands!  The owner is good about refunds when she's there and a machine takes your money though.  No forms to fill out just cash on hand.  There are several fans that circulate the air and CCTV for security.  \n  There are plenty of NEW laundromats out there that have TVs with cable and an attendant on duty ALL the time.  You can find more for your quarter too if you just look around.  I found Leo's Laundromat in Fairview, they are new and get 4 stars.  I'll be reviewing them also.
