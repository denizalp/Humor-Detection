Server Gabby was on point.  Service 5.\n \nGreat retro feel. 5 \n\nHUGE menu.  \nFood quality 2+. \n\nBeen eating here for 18 yrs on and off.  Big portions, smaller now than yrs ago.  Food quality has gone down.  Sent back the raw soggy fries and limp cold onion rings had to wait way too long for replacement but Manager handled it excellent.  \n\nRecommended for tourists.
