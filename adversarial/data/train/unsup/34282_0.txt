I've been here a few times in the last couple of months and I have to say that their service here is amazing.  From the friendly hostess to the wonderful wait staff. Food is always brought out in a timely manner. Your drinks will be refilled without you asking for it. Even if you do the AYCE option, your server is there before you even finish your dish to make sure your next dish comes out as soon as you are done! Love coming to this location. It is ALWAYS busy so if you do come try to make it there a bit earlier.
