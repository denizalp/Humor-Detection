So I was so excited to try this place out.. \n\nThe music was great . Theres one star \nThe corn snack was also good, another star \nAnd the baked udon was AMAZING , loved it, DO ORDER \n\nHowever . \nThe hot sake was nasty. \nThe raw octopus, never again \nThe service :\/ they never came to the table to check up, but they would check on every other table that had asians sitting . Thats not cool \n& definitely not appreciated, so we left only a 5% tip & a lady came right away to ask if everything was okay as soon as we only tipped 5%. No. \n& to top things off, someone ripped a big one near us, worst fart ive smelt in my life, immediately got up and ran out, as i gagged 5 times. What in the world... \n\nNot going back. Thank you for the udon though
