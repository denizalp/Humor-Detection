A dive donut shop? Sweet! Too bad this place is so meh. \n\nI was so excited about Raibow Donut but the donuts are kind of sucky. I was also excited about the BOBA tea (yes they have it here) but it was also kind of not good. And the bubble tea was made kind of like a frappachino with whip cream and shit. What's up with that? \n\nSo I guess it's still kind of cool due to diveyness and whatnot, but not really awesome or anything.
