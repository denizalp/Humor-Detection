I love how friendly the staff is here.  They're just generally good natured, it seems.  There is humming, singing under their breath - the occasional volume-raising of a favorite song (this time it was Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeroes - Home) - & ...oh.  The drinks.  Their mocha?  Is decadent.  & of course, topped with a fancy swirly design.\n\nFree wifi, outdoor seating if its nice enough outside, & binoculars near the window seating to spy...err...casually watch park goers across the street.
