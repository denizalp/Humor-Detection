This place is somewhat discreet; I would never have noticed it passing by if it weren't for Yelp. The inside is quite small as well, but it wasn't too crowded during lunchtime on a Saturday. I was surprised by how many different combinations of deli sandwiches and pierogies they had. We didn't end up trying the pierogie items this time; instead we ended up with a Szmidt and a Hoya (pastrami and corned beef). Both were certainly worth their value--the sandwiches were both overflowing with meat and slaw\/kraut. Both were extremely juicy and flavorful, if not a bit messy. Overall, I think the sandwiches here are a bit better than something like Smallman Deli, especially the rye bread. Next time we'll try their famed pierogies, perhaps the rages.
