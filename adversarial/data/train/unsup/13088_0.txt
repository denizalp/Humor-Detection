Desert Breeze Aquatic is one of my homes away from home during tri season.  It's on my side of town and a great pool to train at when you need to swim lots of laps.  Even though I have a gym membership, I'd rather swim at this pool because 24 Hour's pools are shallow, have short lanes, and are usually crowded with either teenagers who are hanging out or the older set walking the lanes, which is just fine, but just too cramped for me to get in a real workout.  Desert Breeze is an Olympic size pool, so there are dedicated lap lanes throughout the day and I rarely have to share at the times I go.  There's a Masters swim team that takes up half the pool in the early mornings, as well as high school swim teams at different times throughout the year, but there's at least two lap lanes available during those times (5:30am-7:00am), but that's when you may have to share with other lap swimmers.  After 7:00am during the week, the pool usually clears out of all the team activity, so that's a good time to go if you want to be sure you get your own lane.  The young people who work the front desk are always nice and polite when I pay my $3 entry fee.  They offer many classes such as water aerobics, Mommy and Me, private lessons, as well as an outdoor water park when summer comes along.  There are always family swim hours if you just want to use the pool to have fun and not grind out the yardage.  If you need to get your swim on, go here.
