I use to go to this place a lot as a 21 year old chap.\n\nAbout a year ago, me and an amigo of mine decided to take a journey back to \"the office\" or whatever its called now. \n\nWalked in on a Friday night and there were aboouuutttttt 2 people there. I heard some story about a huge stabbing that happened here a little while back so I had to go back.\n\nI talked to the bridge troll bar tender for about 15 seconds and then decided that if I want to be alive tomorrow, I should leave this building as soon as possible. \n\nThat is exactly what we did. \n\nI feel like if you're not sleeping behind the domino's dumpster every night out back or if you own a PAIR of shoes, not just 1, you should never step foot in this place.\n\nThank me later.
