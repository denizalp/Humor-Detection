Came with the parents.  I just started my cleanse and was looking for healthier options.  Guess what?  They have a whole section for that.  YES!!!  And it tasted good too!  PLUS!  The chicken was crusted in corn flakes which I can have and the steamed veggies were pretty tasty too.  Service was pretty good too.
