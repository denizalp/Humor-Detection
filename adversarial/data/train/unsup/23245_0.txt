This might be a bit confusing because I actually love Rito's. The only reason for this negative review is because they can't get the program together as far as deciding when to operate. Honestly, who isn't open for like 2 weeks at a time, has all the wrong operating hours listed on multiple sites, even the front window has the wrong hours of operation? Yo I don't mind that after a burrito it feels like I'm hosting a destruction derby in my gut. I don't mind that you have to buy the extra tortilla to avoid a potential heartbreaking blowout. I don't even mind that their for of customer service is quite the opposite of customer service. What I do mind is that whenever I get my hopes up to be treated like a peasant whilst waiting on a sloppy burrito and then I show up to a closed restaurant with a sign on the door that says they should be open. \n\nWait, I have a brilliant idea! I'm gonna start a business by riding the wave of my more successful relatives, then I'll trash their legacy by passing off a subpar product as the equivalent, then I'll treat all my customers as if I'm doing them a favor by taking their money for my subpar product, then I'll never be open and just post the wrong operating hours everywhere.\n\nAwwww darn! Rito's on 51st already beat me to it.\n\nUnforgivable. . .
