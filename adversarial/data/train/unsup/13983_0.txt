I have no idea how this place averages four stars.  \n\nWe walked in around midnight and our party of five was seated at a four top, despite the restaurant having plenty of room.  Apparently nobody is allowed to Think, so we had to be seated where they wanted us to.  \n\nWe asked to be switched and caught attitude for asking if we could have a table we.could ALL sit at.  Evidently requesting that a dirty six top be cleaned off was very inconvenient for the staff.  \n\nFifteen minutes to order drinks.  Fifteen more to get them.  Never asked if we wanted refills.   Had to ration my soda because apparently being given water doesn't happen here. Fifteen more minutes to order food.   Our meal of appetizers took over an hour and consisted of two orders of undercooked chicken fingers, an order of burnt to shit wings, fries that could not be bitten through, hummus straight from the container, and meatball sliders that were okay.  Oh and we got a drink dumped on a party member - waitress responded with \"ooh that's filled high\".  \n\nSo to be clear.  Shit service.  Shit food. Rude people.  Would have been better off with vending machine gummi bears.  I wrote this in less time than it took to get a second freakin drink.
