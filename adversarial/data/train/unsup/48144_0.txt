Nouveau small plates. Nice cocktails. Engaged staff who listened and gave thoughtful responses and suggestions. Menu not extensive, but deep; innovative, not obnoxious. Seriously yummy. \n\nDon't expect the plates described elsewhere in these reviews. My guess is they buy what's fresh and set the menu accordingly. \n\nUtilitarian atmosphere was only a slight drawback. Tables were spartan and extremely close together. Think \"tapas joint.\" Go for great food and great service. Not for romance. Unless you're romancing a Foodie.
