Waited more than 2 hours for this on Monday, Memorial Day at around noon! We were more than prepared for this wait. Here's a pro-tip, bring those small portable camping chairs, external Battery chargers, .and 99 margaritas! It will make your wait less painful. Albert S. and I had a lot of fun waiting in line... lol \n\nOnce we got seated, we ordered the gumbo combo (3.75\/5) and the Bull's roast which is a mix of pans roast and boullet roast. I really really liked this.. and give it a 5!!! Yummmmm! \n\nI will definitely be back once im in vegas but I'll probably go at like 4 in the morning or something when there's no wait.. lol
