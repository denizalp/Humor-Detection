Love this place!! Its so fresh, organic and affordable! They have the best frozen chicken tenders and I like their salas. Also the pot stickers are good and they have cheap almonds. Lots of organic items.Parkings a little cramped but its worth going cause  you can fill your whole basket up for like $80 when the fresh market and whole foods is double\/triple the price.
