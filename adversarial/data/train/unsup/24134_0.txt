This place boasts itself as being the absolute best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. As a matter of fact, as you walk in, there are a number of awards, accolades and write ups about this place.\n\nI came with a friend so we ordered three dishes to split between us, two entres and one appetizer.\n\nTo start with, we ordered the stuffed chicken wings. These were my least favorite out of what we ordered. They lacked seasoning in my opinion.\n\nNext, we ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken and the beef Pad Thai. Both of these dishes were terrific. The Pad Thai came with thinner style noodles than I normall expect with Pad Thai, but still, very good!\n\nI wasn't particularly crazy about the service, as we didn't have a clear cut server, they kept changing, so we weren't sure who to ask for what. Also, their prices are sort of high for Thai food, but maybe it's because I'm comparing it to LA?\n\nOverall, not bad, I'd actually go again, but who knows, with so many incredible dining options in Vegas, it just may be a while before I do.\n\nFood: 3.5\nAmbience: 2.5\nService: 3\nValue: 3
