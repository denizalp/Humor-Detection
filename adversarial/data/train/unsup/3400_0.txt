Paint me with tasty grease* and marinara...\nI'm  f#cking A impressed!\n\nI strolled in the the first time the other day, the little joint was packed, I barely got a parking spot in back. It was around lunch time and as you can imagine between 2 Hippies and this place, it's tough to get in.\n\nAnyway I wasn't sure what to get so the nice folk behind the counter suggested I just try their lunch special.\nHis idea was a stellar one.\n\nThe special was two one topping slices and a can of soda for 4 bucks. That can't really be beat. The slices were huge, two slices basically equaled a quarter pie (felt like about 4 lbs!). Tasty fresh pepperoni, no shortage of mozzarella and good quality mozz I might add as well.\n\nThe little dinning room (and I mean micro) was seatless, all were taken except one 4 top with three suit and tie lawyers noshing at it. They eyed me\/sized me with my giant slices and can of Mountain Dew and immediately invited me into their circle. There they offered me a piece of their fine sausage pie. Killer as well. Nice patrons (probably made friendly  by the fine flavorful pie!)\n\nThis is probably the best NYC style slices I have had west of the Mississippi. I shit ya not.\n\nI'll definitely be back and I hope to see you there.\nCiao!\n\n\n\n*pizza is suppose to be greasy!
