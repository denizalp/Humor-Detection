As as straight guy who went to Charlie's to support his gay buddies, I have to say, this place really blows, and not in the fun way.\n\nI took my girlfriend with me, because well, I am straight. As soon as we hit the door the door guy throws a fit about her having a tiny purse with her. Maybe big enough for her phone, two credit cards and a stick of gum. \n\nAnd really, the reason behind this is pretty simple, Charile's doesn't want women there. As one of my gay friends said that night \"girlfriend, equality goes both ways.\" If you want someone to be nice to you, or to stand up for you when they need you to, maybe you want to be nice to them from the onset. Just a thought...\n\nWas having a good time until some guy on the floor told my girlfriend she \"better drag her tits off the dance floor before he made her leave it.' About then and there I lost my cool. I've never been so well treated by a drag queen trying to keep me from killing someone. Thankfully my girlfriend was smart enough not to point out who it was that said it, otherwise it would have been another sort of ending to that story.\n\nOn the upside, the bartender Tony there is a master of the bar. Great drinks, funny as hell, and a great guy. I wish I could like this place, as a lot of my friends love to hang out there, but I don't think I will be going back any time soon.
