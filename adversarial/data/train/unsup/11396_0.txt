In spite of its obvious chain affiliation, the food is better than average.\n\nFirst, there is the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet.  Just so you know, the CFS has a crispy crust, cut into bite sized pieces and placed on top of their mini crispy potato cubes.  Topped with a good tasting, creamy gravy, this dish is really good.  I had to restrain myself from ripping it away from my son.\n\nThe Hanks Scramble contains fresh spinach, mushroom, tomato, and cheese.  I don't know where they went wrong, but I have had much better tasting vegetable scrambles.  It was a disappointment mainly because it tasted way to bland. Dumping their house salsa on it redeemed it considerably.\n\nThen there were the pancakes and bacon. Decent pancakes, but nothing that stands out.  The bacon was salty but not smoky tasting and rather flaccid.  I like crisp.  Good, not great.\n\nThe Waffle and Bacon combo was similar, neither the waffle nor the bacon were crispy.\n\nI really liked the serve yourself carafe of coffee left at our table. Got it hot.  Got it exactly when we needed it.\n\nThe service was excellent. Maybe part of that was because they did not need to run around filling coffee cups instead of taking care of more important matters like getting food out of the kitchen fast. Smart.\n\nThis was ok, but we shall continue to search for the ultimate Mom and Pop places in Vegas.
