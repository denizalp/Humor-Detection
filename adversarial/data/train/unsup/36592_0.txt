Right in the middle of public square, this is a neat little gem if you are looking to have a quick bit of history.  The volunteers are extremely knowledgeable about the monument, the architect, and everything in it. I would say, it seems to be an eclectic museum, filled with things from all different wars and time periods, but if you have a military lover in your family, they won't be disappointed!
