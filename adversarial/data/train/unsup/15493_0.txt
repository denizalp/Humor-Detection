Kupfert and Kim offers a great healthy lunch alternative in the PATH.\nI've had both the 1st Canadian and Season 1 bowls - both excellent and make a very filling lunch. That being said, there are a few cons.\n\n1. I find it absolutely ridiculous that there are 6-8 people behind one counter and yet they are not more efficient at passing people through. At K&K there seems to be some inefficiencies that could they be sorted out, would make the experience much quicker and less confusing.\n\n2. I love Kale smoothies for breakfast,  K&K makes a great one, but the first time I got it there was something 'off' about it.  I realized it would be much better (to my tastes) without mint.  So I ordered it without the 2nd time around and prefer it this way. This was NEVER a problem. The staff is 90% very friendly.  \n\nHowever, one morning (way before lunch rush, I was the only customer) one borderline-homeless looking male-staff member gave me a whole lot of grief for ordering without mint citing \"We don't really 'do' substitutions. If this was lunch hour, I would say no.\"  Not even a \"Sorry, hope you understand, is this an allergy?\"\n\nFirst of all, I am paying $6.50 for smoothie.  Second of all, I am the only customer, paying $6.50 for a smoothie!! \n\nYou managed to accomplish nothing besides making me tell everyone in my office that the smoothie is much better without mint, and therefore they should order it this way, from you.  Hope being offensive and rude was worth it. Now PLEASE make me my damn smoothie.
