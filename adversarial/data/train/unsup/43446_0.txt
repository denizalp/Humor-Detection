Just your typical box store, located in DT and convenient, no need to drive out to the burbs.\n\nAlways a great selection of products.  Just for me, going cross border shopping 2-3 times a month, BBB doesn't faze me as much lol.\n\nDidn't find the service as generous, usually they walk you over.  Needed to get another water bottle as I left mine at the hotel, and was just about to head to a workout upstairs.  Decent selection
