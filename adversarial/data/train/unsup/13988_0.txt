I think I looked ok for my wedding. If you really want to look fantastic, I recommend preparing photos in advance from magazines and perhaps doing a trial run with someone else. It took 2 hours for hair and makeup, but my hair didn't turn out quite right and there was no time left to fix it. My makeup seemed too heavy in the photographs later on and it was sort of rushed. We only had 10 minutes before the limo showed up. I thought I had been quoted one price from the website for hair and makeup, but we then ended up paying more. She added more for the fake eyelashes even though that appeared to be included in the website package. Oddly, we were told the additional amount was for tax and gratuity even though they only want to be paid in cash and gratuity is a tip. I also asked the artist to contour my face, but she just broadly brushed my cheeks with bronzer and didn't really cut the cheekbone the way I've seen other makeup artists do it. Oh well.
