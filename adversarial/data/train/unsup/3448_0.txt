Admittingly anxious stumbling across non-Chinatown restaurants, it is with welcomed arms that Pho Vegas fits a well-needed niche, better-than-average Viet, different from the well established. \n\nServing sizes leaning towards large for all things seemingly served, one is not to go hungry it seems with any choice from the menu.  Prices mirror a Chinatown setting.\n\nStarting with the VERY large portioned Banh Mi Thit Nuong, almost twice as large as the norm, announcing fresh bread at first bite.  Charbroiled pork is well seasoned, a bit sweet (almost Tocino like).  A steal at the asking price....Subway, eat your heart out!\n\nPho Tai is moderately oily, served with delicate noodles, slightly thinner than the average.  Too bad my Rare Beef was already well done when presented, the only note mentionable from a surprisingly satisfying non-Chinatown bowl.  \n\nLastly, the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio is also large portioned, with more egg rolls I've yet seen served.\n\nPlaced in a setting that screams Mom & Pop Hole, I hope for a swift start to their open here on West Sahara. \n\nRecommended!!
