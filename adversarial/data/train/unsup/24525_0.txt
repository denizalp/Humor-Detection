I'm not a big fan of LVAC, as I think that they are rude and uncaring to their customers.  \n\nThat being said, I signed up for a gym membership with them because I was desperate to lose weight after having surgery 2 years ago.\n\nI tend to go to this location around 5:30\/6:00am.  Parking is never an issue, although I'm not one of those people who stalk others for a spot right by the door.  You're at the GYM.  You're going to EXERCISE. \nWalk an extra 50 feet.  It won't kill you, I promise.\n\nI usually go to the women's only gym, simply because at that time of the morning, its not packed, and I feel more comfortable without people leering at me.  \n\nBathrooms and locker rooms are spotless.  \n\nI work an unusual schedule, so I don't get to go to classes as often as I'd like, however, Marissa H's yoga classes (the Friday morning at 6 is AWESOME) are my favorite.  I've studied yoga off and on for years, but again, was inactive for about 2 years after my surgery.  Marissa is attentive, and provides alternatives and modifications for those of us who aren't quite up to some of the harder poses.  She is always available to give tips and pointers, and is a great person.  Love her.\n\nI've also taken the CXWorks class, which is a 30 minute ab class.  I died.  It was amazing.\n\nI'm giving this location 4 stars, because the employees HERE and the facility are good.   I am not a fan of their Corporate workers, as they are extremely insensitive and rude.  But this facility, I would recommend.  \nI pay $22 a month and can work out whenever I want, holidays included.
