While traveling around spring road near Las Vegas, I stumbled upon this pho vietnamese restaurant that was recommended to me from a local. He said this place was the best he tried and he went to most of the places on this road. Let me tell you, there are plenty of other choices for Vietnamese restaurants around. I definitely took his word for it because he's a crazy foodie who loves to eat. \n\nInside, it is ambient. The waiters and waitresses are Vietnamese and the service quality is excellent. The inside is decorated with Vietnamese culture and is clean. The pictures on the menu look better than the food themselves, but the fresh taste of ingredients is definitely there. \n\n The food is very cheap, I would wager based on the pictures I've posted, everything is about 10$ ish and lower. The appetizer I ordered is the spring roll and it was immaculate. \n\nThe parking outside is full and hard to fill probably because this place is so good!!!! The outside is hot and surrounded by other small restaurants on a large open road. \n\n If you are wondering if it is noisy inside, it is peaceful. The desserts here are very cheap, 3$ and below. The smell of the food is just mind blowing, and the service is about 10 minutes of waiting. The drinks come out fast, less than a minute and refills are also quick. \n\nIn the end, if you love Vietnamese food, this place is top of the line in quality, service and price. The meal I had was a tofu and vermicelli combo. The other ordered item was a grilled shrimp and vermicelli. The only Con is nothing. I highly recommend this place if you are hungry and want to give Vietnamese food a chance. One of the best Vietnamese food I have ever eaten. Cheers!
