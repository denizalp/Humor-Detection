After recently moving to the Fort Mill area, I decided to find a dentist for my children and obvious I checked Yelp first. The reviews were outstanding and me trusting my fellow Yelpers, I made an appointment. From the first call I could tell it would be a wonderful experience, the receptionist was very helpful, professional and polite. When we arrived to the dentist, everyone from the receptionist, dental assistant and dentist were friendly and made the visit as easy as possible for my children. I noticed in the dental room there is a tv for the patients to watch as dental procedures are taking place and well it distracts the kids also.\n\nAfter my children had their visit Dr. Jalali went over all the pertinent information in a knowledge but down to earth explanation. He also recommended a good orthodontist for my children because Premier Dentistry deals exclusively with Invisalign. Overall, it was a great experience and the bottom line is my children had a wonderful at the dentist. Thank you fellow Yelpers for your recommendations. We will definitely be going back for all our dental needs.
