We made reservations for 6pm on a Friday, but it wasn't necessary because the place didn't start to crowd up yet. Nome Izkaya is located in an extremely busy but beautiful neighbourhood with tons of shops and restaurants all around. \n\nFirst Impressions:\nWith such an oriental name, I expected walking into the store with an oriental menu and oriental vybe. JOKES - this place is pretty Westernized. You know when a place isn't oriental by:\n1) looking at the menu (there's no Asian words in it), \n2) the servers (only one Asian server that day), and \n3) the bathrooms (nicely decorated with Westernized Asian Thai mixture). \nIn no intention of being stereotypical, (although oriental places sometimes have no Asian words in it and maybe their bathrooms are decorated similarly), it's pretty rare. \n\nSeating:\nI don't know how skinny they expect their guests to be, but I felt like I was on the verge of knocking over the drink of the table beside me with my gluteus maximus. You're so close to the other table that you can hear the conversation they're having. For instance, the couple in the table next to mine just happened to be on their first Tinder date. Sorry guys, I really didn't want to eavesdrop, but I couldn't try to talk over you because I was too busy stuffing myself with this delicious food.\n\nFood:\nFive stars. Good quality, loved the East Coast oysters and the huge selection of sauces. I didn't taste any sand in the oysters, meaning they were well washed and shucked! The unagi rice was in a small portion, but the rice was cooked well, well as in it wasn't just plain rice. The Jappa burgers. So small and cute, but beware of these devils, they fill you up more than you expect, or at least, they filled my petite stomach up real fast. Last but no least, I love the way they serve the rolls, the long plates are amazing because I no longer have to reach all the way across the table to grab my food.
