Proclamation to all of the strip: Hear ye, hear ye...if Vegas is the city that never sleeps, why pay so much for a hotel that you do not intend to be in and that you only go to so that you can change clothes?\n\nCome spring break (slash economic recession) some friends and I decided to venture out to Sin City. Now, trying to spread our budget thin amongst clubs\/drinking, we were not looking to spend much on lodging. \n\nBadabing, Badaboom. $35 a night to be 20 stories high on the strip...doesn't really get much better than that. Free drinks included? Why thank you.\n\nHonestly, if you do not intend to be in your hotel room pretty much ever (therefore overly aesthetic touches are not necessary), the only reason I could think you would want to stay at a more expensive hotel would be the pool. Granted this pool is no Mandalay Bay, it actually is spacious\/sunny\/large and perfect for your next-morning hangover rehabilitation station. \n\nOh and it has been deemed the \"softest tables\" in Vegas, so you actually have a chance at winning here...not to mention the 24-hour food court near the casino which is always a nice saving grace coming back from clubs!\n\nThe rooms were comfortable enough...Big enough bathroom for a few girls to share a room...on the strip...a steal considering the price...Yeah, it fit our needs quite well.
