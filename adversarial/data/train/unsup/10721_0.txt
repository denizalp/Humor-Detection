Food was good \/ ok over all but one thing I have to say and the only reaspn why Im posting is to talk about the serving cart.  Whats up with the cart!!  Only 2 of us and anything we prdered, our server brought it over on a cart. Wheels on the cart were loid and obnoxious. Very disruptive having to listen to the raquet of the cart all night.  Was also used when clearing off tables.  Hard to enjoy the meal or the music when having this cart with loud noise from the  wheels.  Its too bad because its a great little place.  GET RID OF THE CART
