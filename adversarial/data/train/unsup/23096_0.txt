This is a review based on being a customer for 8+ years, and watching the steady decline of this once fun place to shop.  \n\nIt has become increasingly hostile.  The people who come here day after day to specifically resell the items have completely ruined this store.  They stalk workers to the point where security has to block people out of areas being restocked, they intimidate the average shopper browsing for their own items, and create an air of anxiety and panic in an otherwise very cool store.\n\nThese frantic \"guerrilla shoppers\" will demolish areas like a tornado, take items from carts or out of your hands, and in general wreak havoc on the entire store.  \n\nThank them for higher prices and a dwindling selection of good deals.  Please be nice to the people that work there, they are most likely as frustrated as you, and they are working in an impossible retail situation.\n\nMy tips are:\n\nDon't go with anything super specific in mind.  The only thing you are guaranteed to find in abundance are gowns and cocktail dresses (amazing place to shop for a wedding or event)\n\nGive yourself time to look, it's impractical to expect the employees to keep the store organized under the circumstances.  There are diamonds in the rough, but it has gotten pretty rough as of late.\n\nBreathe, smile, and try to not get sucked into the insanity.  It is not a relaxing shopping experience, but the deals can be worth it\n\nNordstrom: the employees here should have access to free counseling, this is undoubtedly a traumatizing work environment
