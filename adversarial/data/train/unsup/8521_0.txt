Heinz Hall is a fantastic venue in Pittsburgh and the home of the Pittsburgh Symphony.  As there is a separate listing for the Symphony, I will strictly review the Hall here.\n\nThe venue has fantastic acoustics, although, if you get too far to the edges or under the balcony the sound gets quite muffled.  The seating is sloped fairly well that you can usually see the stage regardless of your seat, unless someone really tall gets in front of you.  The floor level has significantly more leg room than the balcony.\n\nFrom an aesthetic perspective, the hall is classically beautiful.\n\nTwo Complaints:\n-The ushers at Heinz Hall, unlike the Benedum Center, are paid employees.  Yet, they cannot be bothered to stop people from videotaping performances or texting with phones on the brightest setting.  Most of them just want to sit and watch the show but don't do their jobs.  The Symphony rarely, if ever, sells out.  The ushers should be doing a better job.\n\n-If the Symphony has a crowded performance, the lines get bad for the bathrooms.
