Sorry folks, but, I've got to keep it real. This was our very first stop in Las Vegas and we were very excited to be here. The pictures on Instagram look amazing, unfortunately, the excitement ended after we walked up to the counter to place our order. I greeted the lady behind the register with, \"Hafa Adai\" and she looked at me like I was crazy. No smile, no love, NO Chamorro hospitality (equivalent to the spirit of Aloha). But, whatevas, we wanted to eat. We ordered the plates with red rice, barbecued chicken and ribs, chicken kelaquen (Fiesta Platter?) and a side order of Empanadas. ALL of the food was very BLAND. The finidene and the pickled papaya was also terrible. Wish  I could have offered a better review,  but, I have to call it as I see it. I can not recommended this place.
