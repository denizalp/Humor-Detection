This is a great spot for grabbing a tea, coffee, milkshake, fruit smoothie, or a whole meal! Today's rave review, the creamy spinach soup du jour. \nThey really have everything - salads, sandwiches, soup, burgers, waffles (huh?), alcohol, tea\/coffee, fruit smoothies, milkshakes...the list goes on. Things are reasonably priced, and the meals all come with decent sides\/things included. \n\nThe atmosphere is good for chatting with friends or writing a few lyrics for the next big single to appear on Ryan Seacrest's top 40 (totally saw someone doing that tonight). Lots of small groups, but also a few people with laptops or quiet work to do on their own. \n\nThe staff is lovely and food and drinks are served promptly. They are also open late, which is great if you're looking for a low-key hangout to drink rooibos or a sencha green tea. As Michelle A. and I discussed, us coffee 'nighthawks' like to dine late too!\n\nAll in all, most satisfactory indeed.
