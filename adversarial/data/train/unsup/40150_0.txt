Cool hole in the wall spot near downtown vegas . \n\nSeems like the owner took our order and brought food to us . There was Rock and roll playing on the speakers (obviously ) which is cool . The service was good . You order at the front counter and they bring food to you. \n\nThe fried mushrooms were really good and  came with an aioli. We added a a side of marinara which was a better option . We also  had the Mac and cheese pasta which was a good dish \n\n\nThe problem is there are so many restaurants in Vegas . We had just happened to be driving and dropped into this place . Would we be back? Not sure because of other options . Maybe if we lived closer we would stop in again . The food was good but not great . I like to support places like this though . \n.
