I have been renting from Desert Realty for over a year now. They have responded very quickly to every maintenance request that has been called in and everyone in the office has always been great! I read some of the reviews on here and cant help but think people may not have portrayed their experience completely truthfully. I myself work in property management, and you cant bash a company because you didn't get your way or didn't get all of your deposit back for not leaving the property in rent ready condition. In short, Desert Realty is wonderful 5 stars!
