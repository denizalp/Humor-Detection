Stacy is so talented, it's amazing. She has been cutting my husband's hair forever so I decided to give her a try. (He always comes home looking sexy as hell after seeing her.)\n\nI've seen her a couple times and I always leave happy. She listens to what you want and executes it perfectly! Not to mention, she is freaking hilarious and will make you wish she was your best friend. \n\nLast month I decided to do something crazy and wanted this red\/pink ombre. It turned out SO BEAUTIFUL! The color was perfect and somehow I left with my hair feeling way healthier than when I came in. She used olaplex and elumen and it's soooo soft. \n\nOh and make sure you book in advance! She is crazy busy.
