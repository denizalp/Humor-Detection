When I think of Denny's I think of a nice, quiet night with an amazing selection of food, drinks, and dessert. You come to Denny's because it's convenient, the food is good, and it's all well-priced. So obviously, this is one of my favorite places. One time, after an all-nighter, I came here with my GF at 5 a.m. and it was the best. It's never too full, which means the service is always fast.\n\nThe breakfast food is my favorite - I could eat breakfast day and night and I'd get it from here. I'm not a huge fan of the dinner items (fish, burgers, etc.), but it's because of my personal preference on the type of cuisine, not the establishment's food itself. Yesterday we came here because we were too lazy to cook at home LOL and we wanted pancakes. Our server was Michael - he was amazing! He got all our stuff to us very quickly, and I'm pretty sure he was the only waiter waiting on about five or six tables. I'm hoping next time we go to Denny's we'll get him again. :)\n\nI'm giving Denny's three stars because it's Denny's...I mean, can you get better food elsewhere? Sure. Can you get better service somewhere else? Yeah, maybe. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still good and it's....cozy. It's not \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" and it shouldn't be (in my opinion) because then that means it's so hyped up that it would always be crowded. And yes, I'm a fan - but I say A-OK because it's a term my grandpa uses to describe something that's pleasant and familiar. It's the old, married couple enjoying dinner after 65 years together; it's the mom and her child coloring outside the lines. Pleasant and familiar :)
