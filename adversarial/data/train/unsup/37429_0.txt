I can't say anything that has not been said already, as I rub my full belly and reflect on the best meal I have had in forever. These guys do not disappoint. We felt like family. Everyone was amazing. Tony walks around to all the tables, chatting up the guests and delivering fresh free garlic knots. All I can think about is what I want to try next. Tonight, it was white pizza, to die for! Spaghetti with homemade meatballs, salad with homemade Italian dressing, crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside fat crinkle fries, and enough garlic knots to level a small village. This is our new place. I can't remember the last time I've felt so satisfied.
