If I could give them a 0 stars i would do so. So annoyed with this credit union; I was hoping to open a savings account here but I was told you must open a checking account also. When I told the front desk lady she said that I couldn't because \"it's not worth it\" to have a savings account. Yes it is if you are trying to save money!!!!!!! No wonder they only have 2 stars!!! Bye- going elsewhere with my money....
