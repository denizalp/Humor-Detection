I have dined here 3-4 times now, the decor is so nice but each time my experience has been average to awful. The first time or two I went, I was hoping it was just a \"bad day\" for them.  But its official now, they really don't want me there. The waitstaff seems to feel customers are an inconvenience. Honestly, you can get average-tasting Chinese food anywhere, why go somewhere that oozes disdain at your mere presence?
