Wow! Just WOW!! You need to try this place. If you love breakfast at all, you need Vovomeena in your life. For your first trip I HIGHLY recommend trying the B.M.O.C. It sounds weird (I mean a pork chop on a waffle with an egg?) but it will change your life. For the better. And their infused coffee, delish. Or if plain ole joe is more up your alley, they have bottomless cups of freshly brewed local beans. Also, they use Schrieners sausage. Nuff said. Oh and the people there are awesome! Super nice, welcoming, make you feel like a regular even if it's your first time! \n\nIn summation, go to Vovomeena. You will thank me.
