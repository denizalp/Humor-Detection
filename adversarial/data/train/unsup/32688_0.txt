We were in the NW area and decided to stop here for a quick late lunch.  I have passed by this restaurant which is located in a strip mall in the crowfoot area but have never tried, so was eager to check it out.  I am always excited for some satisfying and filling Vietnamese bowls!\n\nAtmosphere: 4\/5  This is a small restaurant, which is clean, quiet, and modern.  Even though it was starting to get late, there were still a few tables with some other guests trickling in.  Ample parking and conveniently located in a mall.\n\nFood: 3\/5  There were a number of menu options, including wraps which are a little different, appetizers, and a selection of bbt, in addition to the usual soup bowls, vermicelli bowls, and rice dishes.  Since it was getting hot outside, I decided on the grilled shrimp vermicelli bowl to keep it refreshing.  There were a number of vermicelli bowl options.  Unfortunately all of them have spring rolls; it would have been nice to have an option without.  However, the staff were accommodating in just substituting more shrimp for me.  Initially the bowl didn't look too big but it ended up being quite filling.  I wish there were more fresh veggies though since that is my favorite part of a vermicelli bowl!  The grilled shrimp was ok; a little oily but still good.  \n\nService: 4\/5  Overall efficient; as I mentioned they were accommodating in substituting the spring rolls for something else in my vermicelli bowl.  It did take a while to get the bill though as we were in a bit of a hurry - then we discovered we had to pay up front.\n\nPrice: 3.5\/5  Reasonable for amount and quality\n\nOverall: 3.5\/5  Overall a reasonable and convenient choice for Vietnamese - good for a quick lunch in a small quiet setting;  I would like to try their wrap, which I've seen less of in other restaurants
