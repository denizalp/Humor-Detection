went to Neal for the first time this week and can't rave enough about how skilled a stylist he is!  The previous weekend in Pittsburgh I'd impulsively gotten my long hair cut chin-length by a stylist who was unknown to me or my sister, who was there to have her nails done.  The result was a style I was not happy with.  The minute we left the salon I called Studio CEO and made an appointment with Neal because a friend of mine had been to him and I liked what he'd done with her hair.  I was hoping he could sculpt what was left of my hair into something more to my liking.  The minute I sat in his chair and we began talking I knew we were speaking the same language and I was in the hands of a skilled surgeon!  In the 40+ years I've been going to salons I've never had the pleasure of working with a stylist who put so much thought and planning into every snip of the scissors.  Neal examined the shape of my skull, and took that into account while planning how to shift the weight of the cut,  he took into account the cowlick at the front of my hairline, he explained to me every step of the way, why he was holding the hair at this angle and that angle and the result he would get. When he was finished, he showed me all kinds of variations in how I can now style it.  Who knew a short hair cut could be adapted to so many different looks.  OK, I could go on, but after all this is Facebook.  I got on a positive rant. I've gotten so many compliments on the cut and  I WILL recommend Neal to everyone I know!
