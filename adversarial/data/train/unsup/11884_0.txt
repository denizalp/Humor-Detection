Happy hour 5-6pm Weds-Sunday is a great deal here, and the place was packed! My friend and I were in the casino and decided to go in right at 5pm when they opened. Drinks at half off plus plenty of tapa style choices. We ordered\n\nCrispy Rock Shrimp - These were delicious, slightly sweet and a hint of pepper.\nBacon Wrapped Shrimp - Wrapped with applewood bacon, but maybe too much BBQ sauce which overpowered the shrimp and bacon flavors\nCrab and Goat Cheese Fondue - creamy, delicious, excellent\nLamb Chops - regularly $20 on special 1\/2 off. In a demi-glaze sauce. Cooked perfectly. \n\nService was great from our bartender, Kay. She informed us that staffing and management had recently been overhauled, and I believe things are going forward. Menu still has your classic steak restaurant offerings...I noticed the Ribeye at $39 which is a great price. \n\nStop by and try it. They have a special Sunday prime rib for $50 that includes salads, entree, dessert and more.
