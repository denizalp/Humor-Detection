Drove up to use a Google Offer for a 7 course tasting menu they were offering - apparently just about everyone there that night were doing the same thing.  It looked a lot scarier than I was envisioning but the food put me at ease.  The husband seems to know his thing when it comes to wine pairings and food.  The wife was quite when we were there..  I guess she can be brusque according to some of these reviews.\n\nI think just about all the courses were pretty impressive.  If you can get over the restaurant's appearance, you'd be in for a culinary treat.  I will say the risotto for one of the dishes were a bit undercooked, but overall impressive.\n\nI definitely would like to return to try a regular offering and would jump at the chance for another tasting offered.
