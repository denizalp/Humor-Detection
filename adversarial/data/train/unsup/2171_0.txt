Next time, I'm choosing my other timeshare down the street.  This place was just OK, but nothing new or special.  It served it's purpose.  \n\nSo, we stayed in Room #4204, a room facing the little quad area facing the elevator, dirty towel dumping ground, and a piece of the MGM and Hooters if you look up from the small balcony.  \n\nYou enter with the kitchen on the left, dining table and shoe closet to the right, living room straight ahead.  The kitchen had a deep sink which was nice.  Stovetop, clean fridge, blender, and a coffee maker.  FYI, the 'Save the Rainforest' coffee provided was simply Nasty with a capital \"N\".  The living room on the other hand provided a 42in LED monitor and a huge sofa bed that we didn't use.  Extra sheets stored in the closet, as well as an iron, ironing board, and a broken safe.  Two thumbs down!\n\nThe main master bedroom had a walk in closet, a king bed with clean sheets, and another LED monitor.  The bathroom was clean, only the shower water pressure was kinda weak.  As were the towels.  I over-stretched one as I was toweling off and ripped it like the hulk by accident.  I also didn't like blackout curtains;  I mean, they did their job, but I wish there was at least a white privacy curtain during the day time.  \n\nOther than that, the place was definitely roomy!  The hotel staff were helpful every time; Call them ahead and they'll call you a cab.  The coffee station in the lobby was golden!  \n\nWould I be back?  Maybe, but it wouldn't be a first choice.
