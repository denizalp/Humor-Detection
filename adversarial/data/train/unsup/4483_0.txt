It's a beautiful hotel and a beautiful restaurant. Definitely impressive visually. \nI had the 3-course tasting menu here. Some of it was wonderful, some of it was ehhh. The dessert was essentially a dessert sampler, some of which were winners and some of them were quite the opposite. My friend got the 4-course truffle tasting menu  which was yummy but I suspect he was pretty significantly truffled out by the end of it. \nIt was all very visually stunning but I'd be willing to give up some of the visual effect for a better taste-bud effect.
