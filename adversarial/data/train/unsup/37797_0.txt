Loved the bratwurst and sauerkraut on pretzel bun. The homemade pickles and stone ground mustard topped it off . Hey husband had 6 BBQ wings. We shared the fries. I had a spicy Bloody Mary which was really flavorful and had an olive a pepper and a chunk of sausage . My husband had a beer sampler which was really good. Thanks for great lunch
