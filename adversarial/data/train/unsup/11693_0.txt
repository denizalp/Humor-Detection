A visit to Graze is never a bad decision.\n\nThe locale on the square is spot on, service is always friendly, floor to ceiling windows make it feel bright and open, and the Sassy Cow cheese curds...best in Madison. Hands down. Get in my mouth. And don't bother arguing with me that the Old Fashioned does 'em better, I've already tuned you out. The batter is light, the cheese abundant and the house ranch that comes with compliments in the best of ways. I'd also highly recommend the Pork Buns, Fried Chicken and Waffle and\/or the Bibimbap.
