I took 4 baths in my 3 day stay here....  I put 1 small bottle of the grapefruit body wash they had and it makes a shit load of bubbles in this jacuzzi tub!   My hubby and I stayed here on my FIRST trip to Vegas; yeah and I'm 25!!!  \n\nWe stayed in Tower 3; and reserved the hotel at VRBO.com. That, was a really good deal!  When you check in there is the $500 security deposit for incidentals, and the $15 a day hotel charge.   The balcony view wasn't the prettiest due to construction for a new hotel, BUT I was only able to open the door because I'm a dirty cissy that is afraid of heights...so it didn't really matter what the view looked like I wasn't going out there!\n\nIt's about a 5 minute walk to MGM, and I think Tower 3 is the farthest one to get there...so it's not bad at all in comparison to all the walking you'll be doing and no reason to shed a star.\n\nFriendly, Smiley Staff too!!
