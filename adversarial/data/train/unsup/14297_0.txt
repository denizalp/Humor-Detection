Well well well, what a bold claim to make. \n\nI have heard about this place, but had never been until recently and while the cake is pretty damn good, it doesn't quite live up to its name. \n\nMy friend and I had lunch in their cafe and I chose the grilled vegetable sandwich.  They also have pizza, salad and soup on the menu.\n\nThe real attraction though, is the cake. I chose the classico (chocolate, caramel and whipped cream) and it was delish.  My friend had the cake that had pineapple and peanut brittle in it and she absolutely loved it, but she still thinks sex is better.
