If you're going to open a brewpub you need three absolutes. Good beer, fish and chips, and a decent handmade pub burger. This place has nasty beer, no fish, and horrible hamburgers!! Nice place with shiny beer equipment, HOWEVER, this place just sucks!! Service was great, management was clueless. If you order a Hop Dog IPA, it damn sure better have some hops in it!! Make YOUR OWN hamburger patties!! Preformed frozen patties are an embarrassment to your location. \n\nEither get it right or get out of the way and make room for somebody who can do it better.\n\nAll in all, skip it and go get a slice at Vimcents!!
