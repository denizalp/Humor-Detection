If you love soul food, you'll love this!! My personal fave is the Betty Boop. It comes with a waffle and a breast. The portions are big, so bring your appetite! The chicken is out of this world good! The seasonings used are amazing. The sweet tea is to die for as well. You really can't go wrong here. Try the chicken tenders as well. Don't forget to try their grape draaannnk. Will always be coming back here!
