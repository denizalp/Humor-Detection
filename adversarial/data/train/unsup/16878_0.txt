The Better Half wanted to stop by this place on the way to California.....so, we spent a little while browsing the mall looking for unique stuff.\n\nThis place is so interesting, you can find all kinds of stuff.  There aren't too many places in Vegas like this.  I think there is only one other Antique Mall.  We didn't find anything on this particular visit, but saw a lot of interesting items....(see pics).\n\nWill we return?  Wifey will several times this year and I'm sure I'll tag along on a few visits.
