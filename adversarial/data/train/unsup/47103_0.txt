Ordered on ubereats around 920 pm, they close at 10 so just after i put in my ord it showed they were closed. Sweet! \nMade it in the nick of time :)\nThat being said, it was like they were trying to punish me for making a last order before they closed at 10 or something because the amount of onions in my poke bowl was unbelievable! I started laughing! Either the person who made it LOOOVVVVESSSS onions or they were seriously pissed at me. Raw onions are s garnish ppl. NOT a damn meal! So gross
