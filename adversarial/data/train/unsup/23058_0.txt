Wow, just left this place. Heard great things however the lady (Debbie)  was the rudest person I have come across in a long time. It was as if she was mad at me as I walked through the door. She needs a new job because she looks and acts miserably to customers. If I managed this place, I would fire her immediately.\n\nI will go back to the long lines of the DMV. At least there I know what I am getting. Long lines and bureaucratic indifference. I do not expect that from a private business.\n\nYou suck Debbie...
