This is a make-your-own pizza spot located in Latta Arcade. Great location and tasty pizza. What makes it unique is the various toppings you can choose from: various types of meat, cheeses, tomato based sauces, oils, glaze and veggies. The staff was very friendly. The shop itself is small, but there is outdoor seating. There is an interactive monitor you can take and post pictures with while you're there as well. If you are ever in the Romare Bearden Park area and don't feel like packing a picnic , I recommend this reasonably priced spot.
