I have been living in Mississauga over 20+ years and I have seen Square One evolved from being an ok mall to the chic urban suburb mall it is now. It is almost like seeing a whee little caterpillar blossom into a beautiful butterfly. \n\nThe past few years there has been a big push for better brands in the mall. Opening soon is Zara, they got Sephora a few years back and there is a Lululemon. \n\nToe-to-toe, Square One is becoming to be at the same level as Eaton Centre and Yorkdale for the suburbs. \n\nFood wise you can get the standard food court fare. There are quite a few restaurants such as Earls and Moxies in the located in the mall. \n\nThe parking lot is massive, still hard to find a close parking spot on weekends. \n\nMake Square One you pit stop for your shopping needs if you are ever in Mississauga.
