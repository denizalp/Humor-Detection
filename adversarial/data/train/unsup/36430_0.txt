Super helpful! I don't live in Arizona but did go to college there and couldn't haul all my dorm stuff back home with me in my car. Snap is great because they made it easy for me, I just had to pack up my stuff and they handled the rest, then I picked it back up when summer was over and I was all set. I will definitely be using them again when school ends this year!
