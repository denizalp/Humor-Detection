I was glad to find out that there was a sushi burrito place near me!  My boyfriend and I went by and tried it!\nWhen we walked in it smelled like fish, which immediately put me off. I went out of my way to make sure I chose fish that was cooked to out on my burrito. One of my choices of protein was the crab. I thought it was tossed in some kind of cream sauce when it was scooped up. \nIt was mayonnaise. The mayo was so strong I couldn't taste anything else in my burrito. It over powered everything and was just gross!!  \nI'm so disappointed!  I don't recommend.
