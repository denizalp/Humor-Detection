This is probably, by far, the best feature Aria has had. This is also right next to the guest elevators, why HELLO THERE! \n\nI don't know too much of their candy and pastries, and although this place does not boast the awe-inspiring chocolate fountains like the one in Bellagio does, it certainly has a large lounge area with interesting and bizarre but very attractive designs and architecture inlays. \n\nI need not speak more for their crepes but they're so. good. I can't stress this enough. Yes you're probably over paying by a few bucks but you probably shouldn't have this all the time anyway for your cholesterol sake and ... it's Vegas!\n\nDelicious crepes, friendly staffers, lots of room to chill. Perfect in the vastly improvement needed Aria.
