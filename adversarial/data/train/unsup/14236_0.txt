We rolled in for lunch on a Sunday hoping for smoked meat, but they didn't have any ready.  There were a few things on the menu where they have smoked meat in them, but it must be yesterday's since those were available to order (smoked meat hash, smoked meat and eggs, etc.).  I think they had offloaded all fresh meat to their food truck, which was ferociously packing up buckets of meat and left while we were there; meanwhile their actual customers who went out of their way to go there for the same thing were left without it.\n\nFrom afar another customer had the BBQ brisket sandwich and it looked decent, so I ordered that.   It came and was half cold, half warm, and soaked in a bbq sauce that tasted more like spaghetti sauce than any BBQ sauce I've ever consumed.  It was edible enough to eat 1\/3 of but that's about it.\n\nMy SO had the smoked meat and eggs, nothing special.\n\nThe fries were the only thing on our table that could be construed as good.\n\nI see absolutely no reason to go back.
