Have stayed here many times.\n\nMost recent was on 1\/23\/16....strip view, two queen beds, 20th floor.\n\nCheck in took almost 30 minutes, after a walk from basically the roof for self-parking.\n\nRoom was as-requested, with \"resort access fee\" cost was about $200.00....which is really stupid.  The only reason I booked this room was an event at Caesar's which cost over $300.00 a night and is easily reached after a 10 minute walk.\n\nCarpets are stained, worn and torn in spots.\n\nElevator(1 of 6) was out of order and stuck open.\n\nShort of the Gordon Ramsey Burger restaurant, choices are played out and expensive or not very good.\n\nWhile I hate staying here, do enjoy the convenience.  That would be the only reason to chose PH, and probably why I'll stay here again...that said, it is an overblown, expensive and unpleasant accommodation.
