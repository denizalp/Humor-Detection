Mexican & Chinese sounds like a wired combo but you will be surprised that it actually works well. This place is great. The menu is a little confusing at first but the staff is eager to help. They have the best Jerk Chicken & Jerk Fried rice. If you like your food spicy you should definitely try their Jerk Chicken. They really have a good selection of stuff to order.
