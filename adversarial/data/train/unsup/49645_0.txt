We stopped in for an early afternoon bite to eat on New Year's eve and we were not disappointed.  My partner had tacos and I enjoyed the enchiladas.  The flavors were all very good.  Since it was a bit of an \"off time\" there was only one server working, but she was quite capable of handling the few occupied tables.  I will say that it was a very cold day, and the restaurant itself also felt quite cold.  I am guessing the older windows don't make it easy to keep heated.  \n\nCanteen seems like a bit of a step up from TTTP - which is also a favorite Food Fight spot of ours.  We'll definitely be back to Canteen.
