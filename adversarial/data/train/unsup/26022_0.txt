This place charged the room rate to my bank account before they even let me check-in. Check-in was at 3pm and at about 2pm the money was already taken out of my bank account. After My wife and I checked in, we settled into a room which appeared to be clean when we initially walked in. Upon further inspection, we found an old box of breadsticks and dipping sauces under the sink and we found old coffee still in the coffee pot that was provided; even though, for appearances, they had \"dressed up\" the coffee maker with new materials for making coffee. We brought the old pizza box to the front desk and told them about it. The staff member at the front desk was professional, although she never offered an apology for my family being inconvenienced. She offered us a room change and we accepted. Upon initial entry into the \"newer\" room, it smelled to like smoke and marijuana. We went back to the desk and told the staff member that we had changed our mind and we would just be staying in the first hotel room we were given. I thought the rough part of our stay was over and we went to bed for the night. When I went to take a shower the next morning, I opened the shower curtain only to find it covered in splashes of old shampoo or conditioner WITH hair in it! Not only that, but once we turned the shower on, there was a high pitched squeal noise that the shower made and it couldn't be stopped by any means. After my shower, we wife discovered that our dog had picked up tics from the room! I would put less than 1 star for the review, but the app won't let me post without putting at least 1 star. This stay was an absolute nightmare and we will not be returning!
