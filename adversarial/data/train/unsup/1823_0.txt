I can only describe Montreal as.... free spirited. It's a different kind of place. L'avenue pretty much embodies everything that is Montreal. It can be seen in the decor, the wait staff, and even translates to the food. \n\nIf It's 8am and it's feels like You haven't eaten in days, l'avenue is here for you. What should I order you might ask. Although there are numerous ways you can go, to you I say....the Benedict! This is absolute indulgence. The duck confit in particular is perfectly executed. \n\nPro's\n-portion size: very much deceiving. I almost requested a wheel barrel to wheel me out. \n-service: my food came out in 5 minutes flat. Beat that! \n-menu: sooooo many options\n\nCons\nhonestly I'm not sure I can think of any....
