I checked out a bunch of places for tint online and tried to use reviews as one of my basic factors.  I wanted to spend a reasonable amount and not let price be the ultimate factor when picking my tint mainly because my car is brand new (first owner).  I was thinking of going to Eco-Tint but their wait list is about a week and a half and thats just ridiculous unless Jesus himself is putting on your tint (and he better be doing it miracle style, none of this of this manual labor business).  Capital Tint was less than a mile from where I lived and I called them and Stefan (not sure how to spell it) was super nice and super friendly on the phone.  He explained everything in great detail and really seemed like he liked his job, which you don't see a lot of these days.  I made an appointment but had to change it up and come in on short notice.  They were nice enough to squeeze me in at the end of a busy day which was really nice of them because I saw how many cars they had and they were really nice about me coming on such short notice.  Stefan came to my car and explained everything he could about all the different types of tints and what they do and the costs.   They got it done a lot quicker than they said they'd have it done.  The whole staff is amazingly friendly and I left really feeling confident about my tint job.  I plan to even get some more work done there.  The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I still believe its a bit high in cost and I did have to go back for a little bit of a touch-up on the tint, but they handled me in minutes and had me on my way.  Thanks!
