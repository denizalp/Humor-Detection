I will never eat at another Mexican restaurant again because Maria's is the best. Chips and salsa are akin to my favorite Texas Mexican joint, cheese enchiladas with the best creamy cheese and rice and refined beans just like my childhood best friends mom used to make back in Texas. Everything g else in Charlotte is worthless, this is the place to be for casual and inexpensive Mexican fare. Stellar service and very clean. I cannot wait to return. \n\nMy Russian husband is not a fan of Mexican food, but he continues to dine here regularly, because he's never had anything as delicious as this!!!! Win win
