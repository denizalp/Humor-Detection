Wow - what a delicious deal!!  Yes, the line wrapped around and we were starving by the time we got in but there was just so much variety for brunch.  Brunch was very affordable for all that we got - only $23.95.\n\nI don't even know where to begin - they had prime rib, sooo many different types of fish (about 6 different types), lamb, omelette station, yummy salads, a whole Asian delights bar and sushi, too - spring rolls, pesto mashed potatoes - yum.  Breakfast stuff - cheese blintz, french toast, eggs, sausage, bacon, etc etc - everything was a true delight.\n\nAnd dessert - omg - they had sugar free desserts, not just one or two but SEVEN options for me to pick from and their regular desserts - amazing and just amazing.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas just to have the Bellagio Buffet again.
