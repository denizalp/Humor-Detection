Trendy, Current, and a young 20s crowd. You know its trendy when you see all the waitress' in black fish net tights and short black dresses. \n\nYou dine while they play a great music selection with lights all over! Its like eating at a lounge right before the place turns into a night club. Very city-like. \n\nCome for Happy hour!! I came here with 3 other classmates: Angela, Julie, and Natalie. When they said happy hour for sushi, I was thinking a low key place that was A-OK. I was completely wrong. This place is trendy and hip, which is unlike the suburbia of Mesa. \n\nDuring happy hour, my friend and I split the Calamari, Calamari Sushi Roll, chicken wings (6 pieces) and a Margarita, and it came out to $22. Not bad! I like the ambiance, and its definitely something I will be coming back to!
