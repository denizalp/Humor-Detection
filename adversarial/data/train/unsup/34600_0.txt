I'd give this place three stars just for the name. I also very much enjoy the veggie options and several of their salads. Everything is always fresh, service is fast, and it's just great to be in NoDa. \n\nI've never had to wait for more than 1 or 2 people in line in front of me, so it's a good spot to grab lunch when you're working. I like to eat-in, as the deli itself is pretty cute, combining kitsch with down-home in a way that seems peculiarly Charlottean to me.\n\nIt's cute and bright inside, and there's lots of seating. There are a couple of televisions in the little dining area up front, so it's nice to sit there and watch the news with the folks who work there.\n\nSometimes, there's an interesting lady out front selling jewelry. I'm not sure if she's a permanent fixture, but she's kind of fun.
