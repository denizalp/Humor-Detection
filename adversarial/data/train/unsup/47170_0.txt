Nice buffet for Vegas. Price not too bad at all. The variety is great. Only thing I wish I did was eat more than I did. I enjoyed every bite. Customer service was excellent. I truly enjoyed my experience. The wait in line was long but I went on a Saturday night so I expected that. Overall great experience.
