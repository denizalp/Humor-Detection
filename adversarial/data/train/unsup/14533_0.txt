Ok, so you bake the English Muffins..we get it, but are they really worth 10 bucks for 6 of them? This is the theme of this Arcadia joint. The prices for stuff at dinner are unreasonable. It is at least 14 bucks for a burger on a very limited menu after 5pm. The sandwiches at lunch seem tastier and are better priced, so why not serve them all day, plus you cannot find a parking spot during the day either. They also own the fancy pizza place and some joint across the street as well. I ended up with a $3.25 Gluten free Chocolate chip cookie and it was big and gooey and had a bunch of nuts. Not too bad for a cookie in that category. Break the bank at dinner and watch all the lovely Arcadia types wander into this family friendly domain.
