Just leaving this groovy little shop in Wexford. Nice selection of wacky flavored small donuts. Two levels are groovy, which is more basic glazed, sugared and powdered style for .95; Funkadelic level donuts are the many varieties of combos like reeses peanut butter cup, oreo, etc. for 1.50. Unfortunately,  the flavors just aren't there. These donuts don't make me want to spend the calories on them. Cute concept and a must experience one time, but not good enough to return.\n\nFlavores we ordered: Samoa, Oreo, Reeses, Boston Creme, Cinnamon Sugar, Honey Glazed. Also, good selection of cold drinks and hot coffee.
