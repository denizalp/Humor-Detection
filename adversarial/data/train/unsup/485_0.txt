I had a fantastic experience at Glenashton Daycare Center. My daughter is 3 years old and she's been going to this daycare since she was a year and half. \n\nMy daughter is lactose-intolerant and I had asked the staff to ensure that they took special care in handing my daughter's meals. Never had an issue since the first time we dropped my daughter off. The staff have always been courteous and handled my daughter's (and my) needs very professionally. \n\nThere's a very good reason that we've had our daughter at this center for the past (almost) 2 years. I see every reason to continue using this center: the staff, the quality of education, the facility itself! When my daughter comes home happy and tells me stories about how much she learned and all the games she played....there's no comparing that to anything.\n\nI would highly recommend this daycare center; I don't post many reviews, but I took the time out to post this. These people are a heaven-sent.\n\nTL;DR: 10\/10, would highly recommend.
