yes, yes, yes! thank you yelp. this is one place that i will keep coming back to. the caterpillar roll, garlic tuna roll, crunchy scallop roll were beautiful and the presentation was pretty. my dining partner is not so adventurous on the sushi front, as evidenced by our sushi order, but i tried enough to say everything was fresh and tasty. service was friendly, even when i spilled my water all over the table. i was really, really surprised how small this place is. i hope they'll be able to expand someday. if they keep the quality high there will definitely be a need. on the alcohol front, sake bombers ($5) are probably your best bet. the night i visited they had beer, sake and vodka only. i found that a bit strange, but since i'm a vodka kind of girl it didn't bother me a bit.
