Fun show but a little loud if you have younger kids. \nSearching for things to do with a 1yr old was a little bit of a challenge while in Vegas but found some great things to do including this show. \n\nIn the beginning and here and there and especially the end, there are cannons that go off. A little scary and wasn't prepared for the beginning ones. But my server came over and would let me know when a cannon would be going off and greatly appreciated that ! Thank you !!! \n\nShow was entertaining and I brought plastic ware for utensils (I know, I cheated ) but was easier to feed my son and cut the chicken. Food was good which I was surprised. \n\nOverall had a great time. Haven't been to this show in about 13yrs and glad it's still around ! Fun !
