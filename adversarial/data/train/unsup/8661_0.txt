I came here for dinner a week ago and for the price of 35 it wasn't bad you got two different kinds of crab, two different kinds of clams, alaskan crab legs, crawfish , shrimp, frog legs , salmon, tilapia and baby octopus, squid.  You also get a nice selection of veggies.  Dessert you had a choice of different fruits.  The service is horrendous now i see why they automatically charge 18percent for gratuity for parties of 6 or more you wouldn't tip them that much.  Fast forward to today and we went for lunch.  NO crabs of any kind, No fish, No crawfish, No clams, No frog legs.  The only thing they had was shrimp, baby octopus, imitation crab even then they wouldn't bring out more even though there was only 5 little pieces left.  Little bit of fish balls.  The waiter who was so bad that when we ordered 3 drinks he would only bring out 1 had to be told that there was more than 1.  When told need more soup for the pot he was to ignorant to understand to bring out more the girl had to tell him.  And the kicker for me is he kept on telling me that they were going to charge 18 percent for gratuity how many times do you need to remind me. So for the price of 22 it's definitely not worth it and to be charge for gratuity when there is no customer service isn't right.  Ownership should stop charging the guest for gratuity when your employees don't do anything to deserve it.  So if you don't mind automatically tipping for non service then it's not a bad place to go for dinner stay away for lunch and if you get the boy server ask for a different server.
