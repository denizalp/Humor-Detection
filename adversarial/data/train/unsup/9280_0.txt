My recent stay at the Four Seasons Toronto was overall OK but not what I have come to expect from this brand:\n\nThe Check in\n- Coming out of the cab the gentleman asked if he could help with my bag and opened\/closed all doors for me.  He was very plesant.  However, upon walking me into the hotel, he just kind of left me at the door with no direction on how to get to the check-in desk which was a little bit hidden.\n- The lobby was brand new and a beautiful, relaxing environment\n- I walked into my room and there were two standard beds - I had reserved a King.  When I called down to ask if I could change to a King I was told there were none.  They did however mention they put me in an upgraded room which was nice\n\nThe Stay\n- Despite 2 standard beds and not a King the room was beautiful and spacious at first glance.  \n- The bathroom was fantastic, and even had a TV embedded into the mirror.  However...\n- The sink did not drain properly so each time I used it I was left with a half sink full of dirty water\n- The carpet was torn and ripped around the edges near the bed\n\nRoom Service\n- I got in late at night and ordered room service.  I ordered the tofu\/vegetable stir fry and a side of Poutine.  Both were delicious.  I also ordered a glass of wine.  It never came.\n- They bring the food in on its own table which was very nice, but with the layout of the room there was no where to really put the table without blocking a walkway\n- In the morning I ordered breakfast - eggwhite fritatta and mixed berriers.  Both were decious.  However...\n- I was told the breakfast would arrive at 8:15, and it actually arrived just after 8:25 which left me almost no time to eat it.  Additionally, the jam they brought with the toast had already been opened and was half empty.  The whole time I was left thinking about whose knife had been in there already and what else the knife had touched.  It was gross and I couldn't eat it.\n\nOverall, a lot of small annoying things occured during my stay.  None of which were huge deals, but when you stay at the Four Seasons you expect an excellent experience and that is not what I got here.
