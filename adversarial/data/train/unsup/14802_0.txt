my friend told me about this place so i quickly did a yelp search and read Anita L. and sharon J's review.. since their reviews are the most current, therefore the deal must be still on going! \n\nI have just missed the breakfast special..but nonetheless the $6.99 steak  special was a total steal! \n\nfor $6.99 you get a 10oz sirloin, choice of potato (fries, baked, or mashed), sauteed green beans (yes, sauteed w\/ garlic..not those cheapy kinds where they just boil \/ steam it.), choice of soup or salad, and choice of root beer or beer (there were four different beers for u to choose from). \n\nsure the steak was not good quality steak.. but hey, i'm not complaining after all it is only for $6.99. This special deal is 24\/7. \n\nThe breakfast deal is good too.... $4.99 you get 2 eggs (however you want to cook) and a 6 oz steak...(no soup\/salad or beer\/root beer for this special)... supposedly the breakfast ends at 2pm on other days.. but when i went (Christmas day) breakfast ended at 11am). \n\nLook for server named Patty - she is AWESOME! \n\nEllis Island is off the strip, but it's only a block away from bally's... it's RIGHT behind bally's - easy to find and not far from the strip at all! for $6.99 24\/7 deal - it is definitely a \"WOOHOO! as good as it gets!\" unless someone tells me a better deal.
