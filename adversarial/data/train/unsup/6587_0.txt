Came here for lunch because we were in the area.  Saw good reviews but unfortunately the place isn't very good.  The only good thing is the relatively good service and the cheap prices.  \nWe ordered the Sashimi & Tempura lunch and the Combination Lunch, consisting of chicken teriyaki, California roll & tempura.  The sashimi was ok, nothing great but edible. For the price of $13.95, you can't really complain.  The chicken teriyaki was pretty bland and wasn't grilled, just looked boiled.  The California rolls were ok, like supermarket quality.  The worst part was the tempura.  The batter was hard and not at all crispy.  It wasn't enjoyable at all.  \nThe place was packed and people were waiting for tables, at various times.  Also, lots of people were ordering takeout.  The lunches came with salad, miso and congee. \nI doubt I'd ever return here again.  I've had much better food from an AYCE sushi place.  Only good factor is the cheap price.  The parking lot is very small and tight too, I'm glad that I wasn't driving today!
