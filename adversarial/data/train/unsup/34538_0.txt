I skeptically became a board member for our HOA,  mainly because of past experiences with previous organizations.  What a breath of fresh air.  AMCOR surprised the heck out of me, with their attention to detail and responsiveness unlike anything I've seen before.  Our assigned property manager Robert K. is not only on top of things, but is a consummate professional in every aspect of our association.  I couldn't be happier for our residents and for my family.  Best decision ever!
