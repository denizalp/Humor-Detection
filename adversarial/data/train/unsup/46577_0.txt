Here's a convenient location to satisfy your cupcake craving! (Pun intended.) This Crave is located in the Crowfoot plaza so you can drop by for a movie, grab a meal, get your dessert, and shop for some sports apparel to work off those calories all in one go.\n\nThe cupcakes do sell out so try to go earlier. I went around 3pm on a Tuesday and everything was available but just an hour and a half later, only red velvet and the more expensive thanksgiving specials were left. \n\nThey have pumpkin pie, apple spice, and pumpkin spice cupcakes right now. Grab one before they're gone until next year!\n\nMmm, cinnamon nutmeg buttercream...
