A cool nifty cafe right in the lobby area of the Vdara hotel; a great convenient location when in need of prepared food items or bottled and frozen items.  Very cute and a great place to meet!  I would say the best part of this location is the convenience to one staying at the Vdara.\n\nI love the whole look of the cafe; contemporary and modern appeal but not a location for comfort and definitely not a location when on a budget.  You can decide to eat in or order take out.  When you order anything at the counter,  they automatically assume you're taking out your order.  I ordered my food at the counter and they handed me a pager.  I was carrying my baby son and so I didn't want to stand or walk to the other end of the lobby.  So I decided to sit in the dining area and wait.  Their waiter asked me nicely to basically move because they wanted to keep tables available for their dine in customers.  A little disturbed because, 1) There were available tables and 2) No customers waiting for a table.  I decided to move quietly across the lobby to another restaurant couch and waited for my page just to walk across the lobby again to pick up my order.  The waiter knew that I was a paying customer because he saw my pager on the table.\n\nMy service at the Vdara was great so therefore my expectation at this Market cafe should be the same?  I've came to visit this cafe a few times and the service is just mediocre.  The prices are too steep and for mediocre service, I would recommend others to visit the restaurant across the hall, or visit Bellagio or Starbucks for drinks.  You'll receive phenomenal service and spend half the cost.
