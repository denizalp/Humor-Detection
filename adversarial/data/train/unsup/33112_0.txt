Hands down best pizza around. I love the small town feel. As a local you are sure to recognize more than a few diners or staff members when you pick your order up. Everyone who works there is extremely helpful and you are always in and out quickly. \n\nThe pizza is one of a kind and with their unique ranch dressing it is absolutely the best! No room for improvement needed.
