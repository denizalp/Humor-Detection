Was in town again and picked up another plethora of food. We got the bbq chicken pizza and the garlic butter with additional chicken topping. Again I was not disappointed. I loved that the chicken topping on the garlic butter was breaded and deep fried. Like having fried chicken on my pizza. Haha go 'murica. \n\nMy friends and I devoured the cheese garlic bread and it was as if we never even had it. That will always be a part of my meal from here!
