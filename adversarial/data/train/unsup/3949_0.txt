Kinjo has always been sushi for the masses, fast, cheap and decent.  But my last visit was like dollar store sushi.  The restaurant was dirty and it really looks tired.  The service was ok at best.  The food was the worst.  Ginger chicken was fatty, chewy, over breaded and Luke warm.  The sushi was sloppy and tasted fishy. I would have rather gone next door to Wendy's.
