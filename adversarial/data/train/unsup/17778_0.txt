This is a good place for a quick meal. We've eaten breakfast here a few times. The food is always decent, the service always prompt. \nHere's the thing - I always feel RUSHED, totally rushed. \nI'm not the type of person that nurses a drink,  takes up a table for hours or sips coffee all morning. I don't even read the paper while I'm there, although I might like to if I didn't feel so rushed.\n\nThis morning I noticed a sign that says \"During our busy times, please do not conduct your business meetings, studying..\" I can't remember the rest but I found it offensive.\n\nI can understand that they don't want people taking up a table when paying customers are waiting. I totally get that. \nHowever, the place is huge and I've never waited for a table. \n\nPerhaps if the wording was different. If people are hanging out, aren't they spending money? Even if they're drinking coffee? \nMaybe the patio could be self service so waiters don't have to miss out on customers. \n\nIt totally rubbed me the wrong way and it's plastered as soon as you walk in the door. It's like saying \"Don't enjoy your time here, get in and get out!\"\nIn this economy you think they'd be happy to have any business.
