This is definitely a 'Dive' casino...the machines are also very tight so I won't recommend coming here to win money but the food and drinks are good and they host a cheap home game type poker tournament Friday and Saturday were we have had a lot of fun...nice vibe overall in here...staff are friendly and helpful...
