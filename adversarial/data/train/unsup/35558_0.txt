I legitimately search for this truck's next location. My go to to dish would be the pork rice bowl.\n\nOh and to my surprise the gentleman that took my first order was kind enough to actually deliver my food to the brewery patio shortly after I ordered and came back to ask how we enjoyed it! \n\n10\/10 would eat veggie dumplings again.
