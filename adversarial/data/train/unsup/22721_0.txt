The food was sub par, some dishes even inedible. Salt is used in abundance, along with other spices, to the extent that they completely overpowered the dish. In addition, some of the appetizers didn't taste as if they had just been prepared.\n\nThe staff is abundant but not very polished or sophisticated (sub 20s), which is what one would expect at the \"premiere\" restaurant at The Venetian hotel.\n\nI will not return to this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone. I've had better overpriced food in Vegas.
