There are lots of options at the Village by the Grange food court, but Manpuku and Gallery Sushi are the only two sit-down restaurants of which I am aware.  From the outside it looks like the seating area in Manpuku is tiny, but when we entered we discovered an upper level with more tables.  \n\nThe menu is mostly in Japanese, or English renditions of Japanese, and not very descriptive.  Luckily, they provide pictures of the food, so you can take an educated guess at what you're ordering.  The waitress was also very happy to answer our 457 questions about the food options so that we could decide what to order.\n\nMy rice with beef was larger and more filling than expected, especially for the low low price (around $5).  For slightly more you can make your meal a combo and add a couple of appetizers.  A few people at my table ordered the Takosen - something I had never heard of before my experience at Manpuku - with their meals.  (As described in other reviews, Takosen is Takoyaki served between two shrimp rice crackers.)  The waitress warned us that it would take a while (this just means it wouldn't be served instantly) because it was made fresh once ordered.  It was well worth the wait!  I dare you to try it!\n\nIf you're adventurous and like good value for your dollar, Manpuku is a great place to dine.
