I'm surprised by the low ratings, but then the reviews are either people complaining that it took a while or that it's expensive.\n\nHey, guess what?  If you want fast food at cheap prices, there are PLENTY of options in Vegas.\n\nAlas, this is one of the fanciest, most exquisite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Beautiful from top to bottom, truly a sexy restaurant.  The service is 5-Star.  Attentive.  Multiple waiters, assistants, and other staff.  They are the epitome of professional and know their stuff.  \n\nOur party of 6 ordered two whole fish (branzino and john dory) and sure, we added some fresh truffle.  Why not?  We had than langoustine (AMAZING!), pasta, cured meats, pecorino - most things flown in fresh from Italy that day.\n\nThe wine list was extensive, the cocktails were delicious.  The desserts were nice and pretty and tasty.\n\nDinner for 6 with a good amount of wine and several courses and the fresh truffles ran us $2,000.00... and was worth every penny of it.  I'm not going to lie, though - I'm glad we were treated :)\n\nAn EXCELLENT restaurant for a special occasion or celebration.
