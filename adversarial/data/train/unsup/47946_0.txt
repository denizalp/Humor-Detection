My first fifteen minutes in the door was bizarre.  Our group had a reservation and the hostess failed to notice that two of our party had already arrived and was seated.  Instead, we were told to wait while our table was being set up.  What the...?\nWhen this was finally sorted out and we sat down, we all came to realize how loud it was on the second floor (and likely everywhere).  I went home with a hoarse voice.  AND, it was extremely noticeable that many young ladies were there for dinner, but their girly bits were out for some air as well.  Our entire party was stunned at how many outlandishly short skirts and dresses were in the room.  We even noticed that the male servers were totally distracted.  I'm sure we looked like a bunch of old fogies harshly judging these ladies, but it was ridiculous.  Good eye candy for men who appreciate that kind of look, that's for sure.\n\nNow down to business.  Ordering may difficult for people with decision making disorder.  I know because my spouse is one of them and it took him forever to figure out what to do.  \n\nWe tried the Buffalo Mozzarella.  Not worth it.  Now, the spaghetti \"Lille e Il Vagabondo\" is total insanity and you must order it for the sheer size.  It's got some heat and is absolutely delicious.  It also makes for great leftovers.  I ate the entire Pan-Seared Wild White Shrimp dish myself.  It was fabulous.  The pistachios and golden raisins give it some great flavor.  I tried a slice of my friend's pizza and I think it was the Wild Boar Bacon.  That was very flavorful too.  I ordered the Bellini and it was disappointing, unfortunately.  It didn't taste like much of anything.\n\nOverall, the food I ate was delicious but the loud, crazy atmosphere and weird confusion early in the evening threw me off and I wouldn't go back by choice.  Definitely not a place for a romantic dinner or a group larger than six if you actually want to visit.
