I enjoyed this place but not enough to give it more than 3 stars.. the service was good it was very clean and huge inside but it was dark inside.. \nI don't expect it to be bright like outside but I mean it is really really dark inside.. \nnow the food.. I ordered spring rolls and shrimp pho.. the spring rolls were good the pho however was just okay it lacked flavor like other pho restaurants I been to.. \nThat's why I say it's just a 3 Star spot...
