I lived in Surprise and have been taking my two sons to Dr. Nicholas Pham for over 9 years.  We recently moved to Phoenix and I still drive the hour to see him because he is a one of a kind pediatrician.\n\nHe has helped my oldest son through many transitions in his life and through many medical and sometimes emotional issues.  My youngest son is still a patient of his and he has helped with both routine and non-routine issues.  His insights, compassion and concern have helpled treat his ADHD and have allowed him to go from remedial classes to working above his grade level.\n\nDr. Pham is a caring, caring man and I would drive from Tucson to have him see my kids.  THAT IS THE HONEST TRUTH!!!!
