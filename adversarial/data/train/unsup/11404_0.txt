So glad this is here.  Not that it is far, but unless you want to walk to Mount Pleasant, there aren't many (any?) decent independent cafes in the Yonge-Eglinton area.\n\nHad a Croque Monsieur, cappuccino, and a pain au chocolate.  All were good.  A bit of an expensive lunch at $14, considering I'll probably need a snack in a couple hours, but this is the kind of place you go to for a treat.  I'm not sure why but they don't have a menu posted, other than for their coffee beverages, so if you are not a regular there, you have to look in the display case and try to figure out what everything is, and order my pointing.  Prices are also not posted.  \n\nAs a side note, and this has nothing to do with the business itself, but why do people have to go to these otherwise peaceful places and carry on their BS conversation at a decibel level that ensures it is broadcast to the entire establishment?  It is pretty bad when the 10 year old sitting next to me looks at his mom and says \"Those men are soooo loud!\"  Good for him - he is well on his way to learning the true meaning of douche-bag.
