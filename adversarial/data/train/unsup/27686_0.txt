Great new restaurant in Boca Park. Wonderful atmosphere, great service, and a good value. Both of our fresh market creations were excellent. It is a nice twist on the old Mongolian BBQ concept. The sauces they have to choose from were very tasty. Try combining the spicy sweat chili sauce with the peanut sauce. Gives the dish a Thai like flavor. The ginger soy sauce was also very good. Plenty of fresh ingredients to choose from. The staff was very helpful in creating a unique dish for you. Will definitely go back.
