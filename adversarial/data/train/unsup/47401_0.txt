Love THE Hotel because I feel like I'm in NYC.  It really does feel like a \"W\" except the room was so much bigger!  I love the design and ambiance of the rooms.  The only minus is the lighting, it's quite dim.  The room makes up for it however and I loved watching tv while I was in the shower.  Overall it's a really nice hotel.
