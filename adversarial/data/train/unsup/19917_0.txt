This is my 4th or 5th attempt to find a dermatologist in Las Vegas. I cannot always just go to the one I see in San Diego. \nThe staff is very nice. The office is clean and quiet. \nThe problem was I waited 2 hours for 5 minutes of a PA's time. He was nice. However he spoke so fast, and it appeared he could not wait to move on to the next patient. They did not know my history nor really cared when I told them. \nHe suggested a small procedure, then went into how much it would cost due to my deductible. Between talking about money and the speed of the exam I am not comfortable having a procedure done here. Would that be 5 minutes as well.  \nI am not going to a dermatologist for cosmetic procedures. I go due to a serious condition. Regardless of the reason for the visits all patients deserve more than 5 minutes. \nI will stick to seeing my dr. in San Diego.
