I wasn't expecting a pub-crawl on my visit to Montreal, haven't  done that in years but somehow that is what naturally occurred on my Memorial weekend excursion to the city. McKibbins is not located in the trendy Crescent St area but on the somewhat quieter Rue Bishop. The warmth of the wood paneled interior is inviting and immediately you feel comfortable in this well appointed, pub decorated space. I noticed 1664 Whit on tap, a French wheat beer seldom seen in many pubs. I ordered it post haste and thoroughly enjoyed my rare find, you certainly don't see it in the States that often for sure. My beer was followed by a Bison burger, Pub \"Chip Fries\" and salad, I was more than satisfied with the over all quality and flavor, it arrived quickly even though it was busy due to a soccer match that evening. The food, service and overall experience was above average, translation, I will no doubt revisit McKibbin's on future Montreal pup-crawls!
