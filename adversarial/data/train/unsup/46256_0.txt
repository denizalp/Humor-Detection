So I am sure this is a great place to get waxed based on how many return customers they have. However, this review is based on my first experience at any European wax and the person that did my wax. I have been waxed numerous times all over the US and I have given myself Brazilians at home therefore, I am not a wax newbie. The woman that did my wax was in a rush, my hair might have been a little longer than 3 weeks, however, this was one of the worst waxing experiences EVER! I remember laying there several times thinking that if I do my own wax it would be less painful! I was mortified when I saw how much I was bleeding after the wax and it only got worse when I woke the next day and determined that she had BURNED AND RIPPED my skin!! (I had a lot of burning pain the next day and took pictures to send to my friend who is a gynecologist who confirmed that yep, this is definitely a burn and a rip to the skin from waxing and not something else.) She did not hold my skin taught at all before she pulled! In addition, when she was plucking the stray hairs, she pinched my skin so many times instead of getting the hair, this also caused me to bleed and have small marks from the tweezers literally pinching my skin. AND even with all of that, she didn't even get all of the hair!! Seriously, I hope others do not have to deal with this waxer esp those who are going in for an initial wax.
