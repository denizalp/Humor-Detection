So, I'm always wary of beef noodle stew at Chinese\/Taiwanese restaurants because a lot of them have started to use really low quality beef that is really chewy and gross. I am happy to report that this location had nice delicious tender beef chunks in the beef noodle stew. The dish was great, they made it not spicy for me and it wasn't spicy at all. The broth and noodles were very tasty. I am really happy to have found a place that makes a good beef noodle soup and I will surely be back again for more. Also, their rice is great.
