Went into the store looking a specific item, Had my little man in tow (18 months) so we were moving slow through the store. \n\nSaturday morning (10:30 ish) one other customer was working with a gentleman behind the counter. A young lady was wandering around behind the counter looked at me several times.\n\nI was never approached once\nI was not asked if I could be helped\nI was not asked if I had any questions\n\nAs far I could tell, by the number of times she checked her cell phone, she was more interested in seeing her results to her last race (she still had the decals of her number stuck on her arms).\n\nAny way I took my business down the road as I didn't want to interrupt her texting or social media updates as they were clearly more important that any purchase a customer was going to make.\n\nSorry unlikely I will be back
