The food is awesome.  The service is lacking.  Let me explain.\nWhen your waitress takes your order, and you order appetizers, there is a good chance your main course will arrive with, or even before, your appetizer.  It's not the fault of the waitress, she always asks if we wanted the appetizer first, then the main course.  The problem is the process in which your food is delivered to your table.  Your waitress doesn't deliver, your food is delivered by other staff.  I'm quite sure the waitress and the cooks are on the same page, but the food delivery people don't seem to be in on the communication chain.  \nAll that said, just order appetizers first, and order your main dish AFTER you receive your appetizer or when you're ready.  \nGreat tip: Wednesday is .25 cent wing night, and Thursday is $6 steak night.  Great value!
