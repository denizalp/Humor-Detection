I was just in their store in West vancouver.  I had called yesterday to see if they had a vest in my size that I liked.  They did and I had two in different sizes put on hold.  I was told they would be on hold at the customer service department.  I arrived this morning at 11:00 am.  I saw a jacket I liked on my way to find the customer service department.  I took it with me to try on. The woman at customer service had my items on hold and she escorted me to a changing room that was to the left of the customer service counter.  I entered with the jacket in my hand.  I came out two minutes later and the woman who was serving me was now on the phone to security.  She tells me that the \"eye in the sky\" has spotted me as a potential shop lifter and they were now calling to make sure.  Now, remember, I am in a change room with three items and I had been escorted there BY the customer service representative.  I am sure that shop lifters come in all shapes and sizes and If I was walking towards the door with my unpaid for item, I MIGHT understand their actions.  But what i don't understand is why this STUPID woman at customer service would tell me that security was calling and telling me I am being spotted as a shop lifter!  So, I put down my $750.00 worth of items I was going to buy and left.  ARE YOU EVEN READING THIS SIMONS?  Because you SUCK!
