I went here because one of the other reviewers said there were fat people there.  However, I was sorely disappointed.  There were no fat people, just typical midwesterners and yes they were wearing khakis!  OMG!  \n\nBut I was longin' for the ill-proportioned sights of morbidly obese peeps spilling out of over-worked dining chairs and bar stools that were screaming for mercy.   So I went to Olive Garden instead.  SCORE!
