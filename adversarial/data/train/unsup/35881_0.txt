Gates opened at 11 so we arrived at 10:30 and checked in to get our wrist bands with the pre-loaded $'s I had taken care of last week.   I had also looked at the taco teams listed on the web site and made note of the ones I wanted to try based on what they were serving.  This helped us work through the festival more efficiently.   In most cases there were no lines (helps to get there early).  There are not a lot of places to sit.  When we left around 12:30 the line to get in was very, very long and in the sun.  We are glad we went but once was enough.  Some of the tacos were very good, others were not. - a mix.  But for $2 a taco it was an inexpensive way to try a lot of them.
