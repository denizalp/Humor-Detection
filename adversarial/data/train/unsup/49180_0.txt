This is fabulous place for happy hour.  The mussels were so fresh, cooked well and sitting in the best gravy, Italian speaking.  They were so good we ordered them again.  The cocktails during happy hour were far better than we thought they would be for a happy hour.  Grotto's didn't use cheap, nasty tasting well liquor for their drinks.  We sat there for several  hours enjoying the mussels, drinks and each other.  The wait staff was prompt, anticipated our needs and was very friendly.  We will definitely go there again.\n\nThe 4 stars was because of the smoke coming up from the slot banks where there were many people playing where it seemed everyone smoked.  If it were not for that, I would  easily give a 5 star.  Just note there are tables not next to slots banks...get one of those $8 pizzas a meal in and of itself.  Everything we saw on other tables looked fantastic.\n\nMANGA!
