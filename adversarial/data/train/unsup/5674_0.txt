So Five Guys is finally here in Canada at the tail end of T.O.'s burger craze. My advice is to park your expectations of what a T.O. burger should be at the door because the only thing they serve here is an all-American burger.\n\nYou don't get to pick your cheese from a silly selection of 10 different cheeses. They only have American cheese (ie. processed yellow cheese). The bun is a white bread, sesame burger bun. There are no ciabattas or whole wheat buns to be found here. Your choice of veggies stop at lettuce and tomatoes. There is no arugala or portabello on this menu. And you can forget about getting to pick your choice of lamb, chicken, or Kobe beef. It's 100% ground beef only here!\n\nFive Guys only serves a proper artery clogging, all-American burger and makes no apologies for it. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and it was everything you would expect from a burger conceived in the USA. The burger is thick and heavy, the cheese is processed in two layers of bright yellow goop, the bread is a soggy mess, and the bacon is piled high and greasy. And their small fries is ridiculous. I couldn't even find my burger under all the fries in the paper bag they gave me! If your name is Fat Albert you might call it a small order, but for the rest of us mortals, we call it a shovelful.\n\nThe great thing about Five Guys is that they don't charge you $1-$2 for each topping, like most T.O. gourmet burger joints. All of their toppings are free and applied liberally. When I got my burger, it was a mess because of all the stuff they tried to cram in there, but it was oh so good! I think the next time I come back I'll just have the burger with mustard and ketchup because the rest of the burger's elements can hold up on their own. This beast is a sinful heart attack inducing mess and you gotta try it!\n\nOne word of advice for those with peanut allergies though... everything is cooked in peanut oil here so don't come here!
