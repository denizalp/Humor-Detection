I don't know if it's just luck but I always find good stuff when I go to this location. You have to dig and hunt but I usually walk out with something. It's not very organized, always insanely busy, and a bit understaffed but if you have the time and the patience it's worth it. Every Ross I've ever been in is always unorganized...it just makes me feel more accomplished when I do find some treasures. To me it's a fair trade off for the great deals.
