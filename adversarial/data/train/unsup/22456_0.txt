Rein, the guitarist, was AMAZING! What a surprisingly awesome start to our night! He took requests and sang everything and anything.  The service was very sweet and accommodating.  The ambience was fantastic. \nThe food was just ok. I ordered plain cheeseburger sliders with lettuce only and no sauce.  I was very specific and repeated. I bit into pickles on the plain cheeseburgers...ugh, so disappointing.  If you hate pickles, you can relate.  But honestly, the music was so good that I just ate fries only and skipped it.  It wasn't\/didn't ruin my night. :)
