Located in the second story of Stock & Stable in the Colony sits this adorable little lounge. It's dark, trendy and serves up an eclectic mix of cocktails (think from your traditional Old Fashioned to a Martini made with cotton candy!). \nService was super friendly and they made a mean Whisky Sour and I was totally digging the vibe of this place. Can't wait to head back here for another girls night out soon!
