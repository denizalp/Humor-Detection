Nacho Daddy is exactly what I expected from the name and location: Overpriced pseudo-Mexican food. \n\nI dined here with 3 other adults and one baby on a Sunday evening. The dining area was pretty busy, we were told to seat ourselves at the only available table and a server came over fairly quickly to inquire if a highchair was needed (it was). \n\nWe started out by ordering drinks, I had a moscow mule which was served in a silver mug (I should dock Nacho Daddy one star just for that BS). For an appetizer, we got the triple dip which is queso dip, guacamole and salsa. The guacamole was chunky and looked great but lacked seasoning, and queso dip came with sliced jalapenos in it however no heat could be detected by anyone in our group, which became the standard for our evening. \n\nMy husband got a combo which was a 1\/2 a sandwich and a bowl of the ghost pepper chili. My brother in law had the ghost pepper chili nachos. Both commented on the lack of heat in their meals. The shrimp bowl I had was fine, as was the quesadilla that my sister in law had. Nothing was exceptional though. \n\nFor me there are too many good places to dine downtown for me to go back to a place that was 'just okay' anytime soon. Sorry Nacho Daddy, you just didn't do it for me.
