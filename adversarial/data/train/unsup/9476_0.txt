Tacos El Gordo is good.  And popular...possibly too popular for its own good.  Not unlike their other locations, showing up here means waiting in line since every one also wants to get their gordo on.  I came by before 12 noon on a weekday, and it was still 25 minutes before I had my food.  Can't blame them for being successful, but it is something to be aware of if you're in a hurry.\n\nOther than the long wait, the food here is consistent with their other locations.  I still enjoy their al pastor, lengua, and cabeza tacos a lot.  I'm sure that whatever your favorites are at their other locations, you'll be just as happy with them here.  This location is super clean, but also small.  From memory there may only be 12 tables, so you may have to eat outside or in your car.  Other than that, if you've been to Tacos El Gordo before, this location will not disappoint.
