a gyro and greek salad for $5?! it may not be the best gyro (but quite respectable) that you've ever had (spices in chandler is better) but for $5 and delivered to your table in less than 5 minutes? outstanding. service was great. also tried the day's special burger...a green chile burger. great flavor with roasted green chiles, tomato and chipotle sauce (though they, like other restaurants like to spell it chipolte). oh, and must get the greek fries...a gooey hot mess of feta and lemon and deliciousness.
