Met my girlfriend here for lunch yesterday.  She ordered a lunch special that consisted of a cheese enchilada, beans & rice and a chicken taco.  I ordered the asado de peurco.  \nMy girlfriend stated that the chicken was mushy and bland.  After one bite I knew we would not return because of the look on her face.  My dish was a bit salty for my taste.  1 star because the place was too dark for the lunch hour (what are you hiding???) and there was a leak on the floor coming from the bar area...AND I don't like to see my girlfriend frown when she eats...next...
