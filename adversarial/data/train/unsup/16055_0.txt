Review is based on brunch during Restaurant Week 2016:\n\nI made a reservation for our group on Opentable for 11 on a Sunday. When we arrived there was no wait and we were given the choice of dining on the patio or inside. Summers in Vegas are no joke, so I was slightly apprehensive about dining al fresco in June, but the patio was nicely shaded and quite comfortable. \n\nService by our waiter Richard was good, he was friendly and did not seem put off by the fact that we were ordering from the RW menu or that we would be sharing our meals. We decided to go with the Classic Benedict for $20 and the Steak Frites for $30, both 3 course meals.\n\nAll of the food we had was well made and tasted great. The fruit was fresh and the greek salad has a delightfully light vinaigrette dressing. Our steak was tender and cooked exactly as we had requested. The benedict was a great portion size for sharing, with yummy smoked ham on brioche. Our third course was desserts; a creamy and decadent crème brûlée as well as a crepe served with chocolate sauce, strawberries, bananas and whipped cream. \n \nThe only issues I had with our meal were minor service related snafus: \n-I would have ordered a Bloody Mary from the cart however at no point was it offered.  \n-The breakfast we selected came with french press coffee, which we had to ask for.\n-Third course came out as we were still very clearly working on the second. \n\nEven with these minor issues, our time at Morels was very enjoyable. I left happy and full, and would gladly return to dine there again.
