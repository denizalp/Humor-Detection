Excellent lunch!  \n\nWe were in the area and based on the reviews, I figured it's worth a try.  \n\nThe club sandwich, and the asparagus & havarti panini were both excellent.  And the delicious cookie was a nice touch.\n\nIts a small cafe with like 10 or 15 tables.  You order at the counter and they bring your food.  The coffee is self serve.  There's a nice sandwich selection, along with salads, soup, and some breakfast sandwiches.  Not to mention all the bakery items.\n\nThe food is fresh and tasty.  And a good value... the sandwiches are under $7.\n\nIt was definately worth the try.  We don't get to this area much, but Bertha's just might be worth a special trip!
