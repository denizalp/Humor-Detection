I recently purchased a new stove, microwave & refrigerator and I could not be happier. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and not pushed Clifton our salesman was great. The refrigerator I bought was bigger than what I previously owned and did not realize how big it was until it was delivered. I called the store to see if I could get a different one but after I looked at them at the store I decided to keep the one I bought and remodel the kitchen around the refrigerator. The only compliant I have is the stove was not leveled properly and I had to readjust the legs but that only took a few min to do.
