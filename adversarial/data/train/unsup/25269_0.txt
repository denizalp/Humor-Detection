We had just returned from vacation and found out that our upstairs air conditioning unit was blowing nothing but hot air. I called another air conditioning company, but their first available appointment wasn't until 2 days from when I called. Normally this would not have been an issue because our upstairs isn't used much, but I have the in-laws coming into town tomorrow and needed same day or next day service. I looked up some more companies and found Mojave. They were able to schedule an appointment later in the afternoon and were very thorough in getting the information needed to schedule the appointment. \n\nSean called about 20-30 minutes before he was scheduled to arrive. He was quiet and courteous while servicing our air conditioning unit. My 2 year old son was taking a nap and he didn't wake up while Sean was fixing the unit. He explained our costs for the repairs and showed me the part that was broken on the unit before fixing it. Their costs are very reasonable and I would definitely use them again.
