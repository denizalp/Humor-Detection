Sign this was going to be my first and only trip to Mon Ami: Having made reservations far in advance for our party of 8, the hostess refused to seat us because one single member of our party was missing in the restroom. So, rather than sit and begin to order appetizers, we were relegated to the \"time out\" corner until our bladder-busting buddy could join us. Sure, it was crowded, but not packed, and it appeared that we were one of the few groups who either a) made reservations or b) dressed as if we were going to a nice dinner and not an auto auction.\n\nEach of my friends ordered versions of the filet, some with a peppercorn sauce and others without. I went different with a hamburger (having eaten prior and also intrigued at what France would do to one of my favorite American inventions). I asked the burger be cooked \"medium\" and what I got was a blood-red mess that needed to be sent back. The meals are all served with traditional steak fries, which to me tasted like fried bits of batter and were too much like broken potato chips to eat with your fingers or a fork. Either way, it was a pretty unsatisfying meal for the $13 bucks it cost. I can't speak for the rest of the group who thoroughly enjoyed their meals. However, they had been drinking various mixed drinks for hours previous so they could have eaten fried roadkill cooked in a used gym sock and would have probably savored it with no complaints.\n\nThe only positive about the place was Frangria (which I imagine implies France's take on the traditional Spanish concoction). I now believe that it was called such based on the fact that it was Franzia boxed wine and fruit. either way, it was served in a large, chilled pitcher with delicious fruit and packed a pretty mean buzz between two adults. Definitely worth a try with dinner.
