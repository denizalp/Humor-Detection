(This review is based on an informal walking tour of the property.  I did not spend the night or rent a hotel room.)\n\nIf you are a fan of the 50's, Frank Sinatra or George Jetson, Scottsdale has a hidden jewel for you.  While visiting the region a friend told me that he wanted to visit a hotel he had heard of.  Soon we were pulling up to valet and leaving the 21st century to venture back to a bygone era.\n\nHotel Valley Ho is a boutique hotel that made me remember my childhood.  From the furniture to the brick sided walls (with no windows on the entry side) it was a nostalgic walking tour that is sure to bring a smile to your face if you're over 40.  Located within walking distance of the myriad of Scottsdale shops it's a great location if you're looking for a hotel in the area. \n\nThe property is pristine, clean and well taken care of.  What makes it different is the 1950's architecture that starts with the actual buildings and pervades every aspect of the hotel from the pool furniture, fireplaces, light fixtures to the art work and landscaping.  However, it's incorrect to get the impression that the property smells of forty year old cigars.  Everything is new and clean with modern tech and proper lighting.  I have included over 15 photos from my visit.\n\nIf you're tired of the Holiday Inn Express experience and looking for something different, definitely give the Valley Ho a shot.  I plan on staying here in the future and will update my review to reflect the actual accommodations.
