Criss Angel, you are wasting everyone's time with your catastrophic show. The show consisted of bad magic, with twisted bunnies hopping around and gyrating unimpressive dancers. It was so horrendous I wish I could explain my dissatisfaction, but sadly, I don't know how I can say anything else.\n\nChris Angel starts off by trying to amp up the crowd. When he asked if we were ready for a great show, all you could hear were crickets. He asked a again and a small part of the audience chirped in out of pity. Sad, sad indeed. \n\nHis magic was atrocious and so predictable. It is so obvious how all the magic tricks are done and that to me was a disappointment. I was expecting some crazy stuff but all I got was a bunch of bunnies and parlor magic. \n\nI just happened to have comp tickets and couldn't refuse a free show in Vegas. I would have never paid any sort of money to support this arse. I think people are going to see just how bad this show really is. Well I suppose he has a nice niche of idiots, including myself, to go see his gloriously crappy show. Guy (Cirque owner) must be supremely disappointed with his Cirque name to be attached to Criss Angel. Business people make mistakes, and this is definitely one of them.
