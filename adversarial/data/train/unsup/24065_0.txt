Oh Frankie's, how I love thee? Let me count the ways...\n\n1) You're open all the time - doesn't matter if I'm craving a Zombie at 4 a.m. or 4 p.m., you're ready to roll.\n\n2) The decor can't be beat. You just have to go there and see for yourself folks.\n\n3) Great vintage Hawaiian movies playing in the background.\n\n4) A jukebox with enough surf rock to keep a girl occupied for hours.\n\n5) Drinks that will literally knock your socks off. And put a little hair on your chest, too.\n\nYeah, people might complain that it's a little dingy or smoky inside, but I. Don't. Care. You can't find a Frankie's just anywhere, so let 'em do whatever they want.
