This location is super hidden; if you're not paying attention you'll definitely miss it! It's actually inside of Party USA to the far back on the right - in the Target Boca Park shopping center, right in the middle of McDonald's and Lee's discount liquor.\n\nAlthough super hidden, this USPS still had a small but quick line. There is a huge sign that's visible from the line that states: \"All packages must be ready to be mailed\" - for liability concerns they will not pack or finish packing items for you, however there is a self service box and envelope area to the right where you can package up your own items. The lady working tonight was extremely helpful and even let us use her packing tape and scissors.\n\nKeep in mind that they are a contracted parcel union so they offer less services than your standard location: \n\nNo money orders\nNo passport photos \nNo shredding services
