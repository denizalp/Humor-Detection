So I have a love-hate relationship with places like these. I mean the types where 'everything is vegetarian friendly even the meat sauce.' That is because I was a vegetarian for years and I *hated* fake meat. I like vegetables and legumes and all of the wonderful things you can do with both. I am not just trying to eat fake bacon and 'chicken' nuggets. I do like tofu and seitan but because of their own flavor or diversity, not because I think they are meat substitutes. \n\nAnyway, I love places where I don't have to wonder what's on the menu, it's obvious. However, this is also the sort of place that does vegetables and the such well. The dishes have tons of flavor that isn't just based in salt and sugar. Things are made well and there are a variety of dishes, not just fake meat. They have truly vegetable-based plates and they have things like ginger 'beef.' \n\nThe prices are a little steep, I must say. The entrees were between $13-$17 and the appetizers ranged from $6 - $10 ( if it wasn't the veggie platter). There were also quite a few desserts and some beer\/wine on the menu.\n\nSomething to be noted: there are two menus, vegetarian and meat-friendly. There are also notes about gluten free options, which means this is a great place for a mixed group. I would definitely recommend the double-fried tofu. It's about $8 but it's definitely the sort of appetizer you can split with a group of about four.
