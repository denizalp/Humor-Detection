We were visiting from out of town and love the concept but the owner and one staff member were pretty short with us and needlessly so.  The owner talked to me like I am an idiot and like she already assumed my kids would be monsters.  She made my friend & I purchase socks for ourselves but none of the other parents were wearing socks (though, at $.50\/pair, it was only the principle that irritated me).  The young girl who worked there had scooped some ice cream for my sister and she was behind the counter walking around and then said to my sister, \"Can I just give this to you? I need my arm back!\" Really? How about you give her the ice cream and keep your rude comments to yourself?  The last thing thy annoyed me was when my kids, my nephews and a number of other kids were playing, the owner came huffing out of the back and telling the kids to keep all the mats in place and then she started putting all the toys away. If the mats can't be moved (not the floor mats, some other play stuff), then why put Velcro all over? We enjoyed this place but I think the owner could do with a chill pill.
