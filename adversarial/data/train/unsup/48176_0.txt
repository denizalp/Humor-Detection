Finally made it out here after hearing about it a year ago. A Lucullus where there's room to sit and enjoy food and drink? Sign me up! We went first thing on a Sunday morning and there was only one other couple there. Some baos were out, but not everything. You can definitely smell them all baking though. One door up front was propped open to help let off some warm air. \n\nThe interior is gorgeous! From the colourful mosaic floor tiles to the interior decor, you feel like you're in some wonderful place. Very welcoming and inviting. \n\nI ordered a milk tea (a must!) and a bolo bao with a slab of butter. It was unfortunate that my bolo bao was not hot and fresh from the oven - that would have made the butter taste so much better! Instead, they sliced the bao and put in a lukewarm slab of butter. Good, but not the way I've had it in HK (hot bun with cold slab of butter). I saw that they do half slabs of butter if you do not want a full slice - I will try that next time!
