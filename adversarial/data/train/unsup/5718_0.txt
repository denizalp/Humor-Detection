Ok, I'm confused. I'm new to your salon, and decide to try you out & redeem the Value Pack coupon for a free cut. Upon arriving and patiently giving you my first name, last name, zip code, phone number and email, you inform me that you must see my ID to verify my \"new client\" status. \nID verification was not listed on the coupon. I understand your challenge in enforcing the spirit of this coupon, which is bringing in new business. But can you see how this is a slimy way to begin relationship with a new customer? \nTo the manager who l rudely told me that although not listed on he coupon you are required to see ID... again, no, you will never see my ID. It's a haircut. I'll take my business back to Great Clips.
