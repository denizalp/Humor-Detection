Basically, everything is great. I loved eating sichuan baked fish in China so I was super thrilled to see a restaurant serving it here in Canada for the first time.\n\nFood 5\/5\nJust like China. Flavors are rich and powerful. I love spicy food, especially when its ACTUALLY as spicy as advertised. The food here doesn't disappoint. (They also have non-spicy options.)\n\nService 5\/5\nThe service is terrific. I don't usually expect much service at Chinese restaurants in the west but this place definitely sets the bar high. One of the girls that works here (full time I assume since she's always here when I come to eat) is super nice and accommodating.\n\nCleanliness 5\/5\nNo complaints.\n\nThey also take WeChat pay and Alipay.
