Dollarama has found a way to break out from the name constraint. They just price things at $1.25+ I'm not complaining. Dollarama provides many great things at a rock bottom price. That most Dollaramas are packed with people is indicative people are still getting good value. Most, however, are victims of their own success. Lines are long, Aisle are narrow and filled with people. Dollarama consistently provides one of the most depressing shopping experiences since the Dickensian's Childhood Factory Workwear Superstore chain closed up in the late 1980s by order in council. \n\nThis store, however, offers a really pleasant experience. It might be location and newness but aisles are blessedly free of humanity and lines are short. I'm a big fan of their wet naps. They're great for your daily TTC commute (\"what IS that on my hand and how do I get it off?\") and great for throwing in your carry on for a plane flight.
