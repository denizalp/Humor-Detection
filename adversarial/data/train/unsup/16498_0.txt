If you get your ass all the way to Vegas and DON'T get at least one Fat Tuesday, you're a fool. \n\nBeing the alcoholic that I am, one of the best parts of Vegas for me is the open container rule. I can do everything I usually do on vacation, but drunk! And I don't even have to be sneaky about it! This slushy-from-heaven is, in my humble opinion, the best way to achieve inebriated nirvana whilst doing whatever you do in Sin City.\n\nI must recommend the \"Pimp Juice\" flavor (Hurricane and...Strawberry?), with the extra shot of course. I asked the very nice lady how many shots the yard was equivalent to and she said 6.5 (including the extra shot). For $11 (if you already have the cup and are just refilling). Cheaptastic.\n\nFat Tuesday, never change, I love you just the way you are.
