Bowling is one of those activities that I will never willingly take part in.  Yet, every time I end up doing it, I have fun.  Just be careful not to get cocky about your game, or Via Linda Lanes will strike you down, just as they did to me.\n\nI have never considered myself a good bowler, but the last time I went, for some strange reason, I got four strikes in a row.  I took this to mean that I was an innately exceptional bowler.  I was very wrong.\n\nBut before I realized just how wrong I was, I taunted everyone else who wasn't bowling anywhere near as well as I was.  And then after I had finished mocking all my friends, my turn came up again, and I got a gutter ball, much to their glee.  And then another gutter ball.  And another, and another, and another. \n\nI pretty much never hit any pins again after my little crap talking session.  Instant karma, huh?\n\nOther than my big mouth, I had a lot of fun.  They have a bar, so you can drink and bowl, and of course they have tons of snacks for you to munch on.  \n\nPlus, bowling is pretty cheap, so it makes for a fun night out with friends or fam that won't break the bank.
