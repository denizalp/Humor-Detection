I'm a little biased...this place is one of our customers, so I typically spend a lot of time here. \n\nI love the sights and sounds when you are at LVMS. Tons of stock cars doing laps on the tracks, top fuel cars taking shots at the straight away and the jets flying over head are modern marvels of the engineering sector! \n\nAs an engineer, it's extremely entertaining to watch. \n\nThere are a couple restaurants on site...one is The Iron Skillet...which is not that good. \n\nEnjoy.
