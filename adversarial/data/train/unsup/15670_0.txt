LOKI ALERT!\nWent to Furco one night after failing to find my friends during Jazz Fest and ended up with something better. There was a bartender here who looked like the blond version of Tom Hiddleston. Now if he would only speak with a British accent, that would be perfect. My friends and I were too focused on comparing his facial features with pictures of Tom Hiddleston that we forgot to ask for his name. \n\nI was surprised this place was actually so busy at night, on a Sunday. Don't know if Montreal-ers are just hardcore drinkers or Furco was just really good. This place is tucked away in a quiet small street. and looked quite charming. I wanted a raspberry white chocolate cake but their kitchen was closed. I ended up ordering a cosmopolitan.\n\nI'm definitely coming back here again to try out their food and the cake that got away. For those of you who want to check out a celebrity look alike, you should probably check out Furco too!
