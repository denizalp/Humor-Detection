This is the first time I've been to a loan place like this. I was completely uncomfortable the entire time. The young lady that helped me never made eye contact or explained anything. Answers to my questions were once sentence answers. She didn't even face me while in her office. She was turned away facing the opposite side of her desk towards the wall the entire time. Unless she looked over at her computer monitor. I left with a small loan but totally confused. I still don't understand the process and believe me,  I tried getting her to explain it. I'm not sure she even understood it herself. Calling my phone, saying it was so I'd have their number. Ummmm, it's on all the paperwork. Just say you're checking to make sure it's a valid number. It's a legit reason. No reason to lie about it. Having me call my references saying you need to hear them say that it's ok to use them as a reference.... but when they didn't answer you checked the box saying \"valid number\". I'm still uncomfortable with the situation and will be paying this off asap.
