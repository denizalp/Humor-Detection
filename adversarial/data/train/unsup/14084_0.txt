I love this buffet. I do get to eat here for free since I rack up points on my Wynn card. It can get crowded, but worth the wait. The service for the drinks is very quick and they are also quick to clean your table. \n\nThere's all types entrees to choose from. Seafood, pastas, prime rib, salads, soups, ice cream, cupcakes, pies, sushi, dumplings, and many many more. Try to have a big appetite before you go because there is so much to try. Expect to be full.
