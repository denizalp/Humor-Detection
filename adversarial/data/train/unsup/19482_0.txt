After browsing at the Art's Fest, we decided to walk over and have a drink and appetizer at Eddie Merlot's. We were so excited to sit at the bar and experience this new restaurant in Pittsburgh. We sat at the bar while three bartenders stood around conversing amongst themselves, looked over at us and then looked away! We sat there for at least another minute or so while continuing to be ignored when we finally called a bartender over to take our drink order. She never asked if we wanted menus so another bartender gave them to us after we asked. We ordered the calamari, which was tempura battered, fried and greasy. Needless to say it was not good. I ordered a moscow mule and it wasn't served in a copper mug...disappointing. The whole experience didn't end quickly enough and suffice it to say, we will not be going back. I have owned a business for 10 years and I would never think to treat my clients like we were treated. The whole atmosphere left a lot to be desired. With the many wonderful restaurants to choose from in Pittsburgh, one would think the \"new kid on the block\" would be trying a little harder to attract a clientele, not turn them off.
