My group and I really enjoyed staying at the DoubleTree! The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. The room was clean, large, and comfortable. The location was convenient to the highway and very well-lit late at night. Coffee, tea, and other concessions available were all great. I would definitely stay here again.
