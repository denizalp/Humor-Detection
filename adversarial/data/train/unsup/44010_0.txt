Let me start by telling you that I have had the same woman do my hair for over 20 years. My stylist had been going through some tough times and it was time for me to find someone new. After MANY attemps and failures, I was worried I would never find someone I could trust with my personal style. I had worked with Tonia years ago and had heard she was doing hair. Let's just say that she is AMAZING! She truly is talented in anything she does. I never thought I could trust someone like I trusted my old stylist. I have found my girl. THANKS TONIA!
