Now this is my place! The ladies here are super dyke friendly lol Susan cut my hair today, the last time I came in....gosh I wish I could remember her name, she's a spunky hispanic woman in her late thirties that has another dyke client. Anyways I digress, the point is even if your regular girl isnt theyre anyone of them know how to use the clippers and give you a great fade. Susan was hella quick, bing bang boom and knew to strech the skin when using the full open 3 zero so you dont get horrible shadows. They are quick to usher you in, friendly, they remember you. When you walk in EVERYONE acknowledges you and theres not much of a wait if it all (now that I post this dont flood my shop on Saturday!!! lol)  When its computer time in and out. No dilly dallying flirting with other clients (asI have seen at other sports not just in Vegas) or any airhead manuevers on the computer with a blank stare like earlier today. Right next door is a Jersey Mikes and a Sonic. So if your family needs to be entertained they can go grab a sundai. Also, this one has lolli pops for the kids and they are totally chill when your a dad like me and gotta have baby in tow strapped into the stroller.
