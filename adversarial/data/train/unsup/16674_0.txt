We had dinner here (part of a large wedding rehearsal group) and it was OK.  \n\nThe starter was salad, warm bread and butter...nothing wrong with that!  They also had a decent selection of beers, I went with a great lakes dortmunder gold lager (very tasty).\n\nThe stars begin to drop off with the main course.  We were the last to get the culinary STAR that evening Chicken Parmesan...that came with a side of pasta covered in a marinara sauce.  Now, being the last in a large group to get dinner initially scared me but we waited for a good 15-20 minutes while others ate, so I assumed we'd get fresh, perfectly done Italian goodness.\n\nNon tanto il mio amico italiano mangiare!\n\nMine was hot, fresh but the breading was...kinda soggy.  Also, a few bites had a texture that could best be described as sand.  Not cool.  I've eaten at Papa Joe's many times before and HAVE LOVED THEM, so if you're a first timer I would stop in and enjoy a great meal...just be careful with big groups.\n\nOverall the service was wonderful just lost 1 star for the below average chicken parm (an exception to the rule at this joint)!\n\nI give Papa Joe 6.5 \"Soft and sandy are two words that should be nowhere near the description of food that does not come from the ocean\" out of 10.
