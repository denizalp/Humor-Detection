What a great experience! You can tell the animals are all well taken care of and the staff enjoys what they do. Cliff was very knowledgeable and personable at the giraffe feeding station -- which it was amazing to see the new baby giraffe, Austin! Thank you for the train and tram because it took us 8 hours to get through everything today with so many  new exhibits. They have come a long ways with their expansion!
