I have not had anything else on their regular menu, but anytime my friends are visiting Vegas and it is a Sunday, I bring them to brunch here.  The small tapas are all absolutely perfect. Great portions, the flavors are all there.  My favorite dishes are the Yucatan eggs Benedict, and the shrimp and grits.  All for a a 30 dollar per person.  Also if you are a local 15% is awesome.  when I have the money and time this is there i go for brunch.
