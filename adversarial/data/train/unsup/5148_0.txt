My husband and I stayed here recently on our trip to Montreal.  We booked directly with the hotel and paid with taxes and fees $165\/night.  This price included free WiFi, but did not include breakfast nor parking.  We did not have a car, so I don't know how much parking is.  Overall, our stay was good.  The hotel was clean and we didn't run into any problems.  \n\nThe lobby is prettier than most Best Westerns I've been to.  The hotel is attached to not one, but two restaurants: Zawedeh and Caf√© Castel.  In downtown Montreal, where dining establishments are plenty, this is not too much of a draw, but if the weather is terrible and you're tired, at least you can dine without having to set foot outdoors.\n\nThe hallways are standard and not as nice as you would expect from the lobby.  Rooms are also a bit on the small side, but clean. I liked that there is a good-sized mini fridge in the room.  There are no full-length mirrors though, which I found odd.  At least there was a makeup mirror which was mounted at a good height for me.  The hair dryer is mounted to the wall and is attached to the plug via an extension cord that is wrapped around the pipes under the sink (see picture).  Not all that aesthetically pleasing, but made me chuckle as it reminded me of my childhood house where my dad regularly did things like this, lol.  \n\nFront desk staff and housekeeping staff were all nice.  When I stay at hotels, I always leave a tip for housekeeping with a note thanking them for their work (these people work hard and I have the feeling that it's a bit of a thankless job for them).  Usually staff just take the tip and go about their job, but once in a while I will get a note back, which I think it really nice.  I got a note back here at this Best Western (see picture).  \n\nLocation is excellent.  It's just steps away from Peel Metro and lots of shops and restaurants.  I would come back.
