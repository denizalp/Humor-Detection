One of my favourite noodle soup restaurants in town!\n\nTo order you choose your soup base, noodles, ingredients and a drink.  You also have the option to add side dishes, but the large bowl of noodles is usually enough for me.  The combo comes with a hot drink, but I typically add $1 for the cold milk tea.  If you add a bit more money, you can get the specialty drinks, such as bubble tea.  But I find that their specialty drinks aren't very good, so I prefer the regular milk tea.  \n\nMy favourite soup base is the century egg fish soup!  But I also really like the tomatoes & pumpkin fish soup.  Both pair great with the thick rice noodles.\n\nThe environment is modern and really interesting if you pay attention.  Did you know you are actually sitting inside a fish?  Look up next time you visit!
