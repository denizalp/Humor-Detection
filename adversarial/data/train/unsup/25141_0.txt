Me and my girl had a great time, the party bus was cool, they only had mixed drinks though, but we were already feeling good anyway so wasn't tripping and out of the three clubs we were supposed to get in we only got in two, the third we were unable to go in, not sure why thats why only 4stars but  we had a blast on the first two without any waiting in line and we're able to go back to the last club and continue our night, we will do it again on our next Vegas trip.
