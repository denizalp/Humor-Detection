We were staying at the Cosmo Hotel during our Vegas trip. So of course we had to find the secret pizza place that everyone was talking about~! \n\nYou guys can find it on your own next time your in Vegas ;) \n\nPersonally I thought the pizza was alright. I mean its great when your drunk. But sober, mehhhhh. If you go at night after the club, they don't have a lot of variety of different pizzas to choose from, so that was a little disappointing. I went here twice after going out and each time they only had 2 choices of pizza =\/ \n\nI kind of wish I made time to check this place out earlier in the evenings so I could have more varieties of pizza to choose from. I mean looking at other yelpers, it seems like they serve more then just the two choices.
