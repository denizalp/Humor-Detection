I love the ambiance of this place. Colorful, artsy and southwestern. Lots to look at and nice noisy vibe. The hostess was prompt with finding us a table but if you could make reservations, I would because there aren't too many tables. The house margarita is really delicious...packs a nice punch too. Guacamole and green salsa stand out as fresh with great seasonings. I got the fajita bowl with carnitas, others at the table got the steak burrito ( not recommended) and steak salad. The house roasted Mexican street corn was delicious. What stands out as a real bummer is the service. The waitress really could have cared less if we were there, offered no recommendations (she doesn't eat here), and her attitude seemed kind of \"college bar annoyed.\" If they could step up the service game, this place would be four stars.
