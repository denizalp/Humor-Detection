The shop: always immaculate and brightly decorated. There is, without fail, a sample tray featuring one flavor, typically the seasonal or holiday selection. If there was any room for improvement, though, it is here. My kingdom for a table and a cup of coffee by which to sit and enjoy a cake in-house. But alas, the whole operation is grab-and-go. Grab and go home to snack in private (which is probably safest, anyway).\n\nThe service: Starbucks used to be the gold standard, but now it's Nothing Bundt Cakes. Without exception, I have always been greeted with warmth and an offer to help select--not the moment I walk in the door, that would be too forward, but the moment after I finish the aforementioned sample. \n\nThe business model: community oriented. They did a mega fundraiser after the horrific tragedy here in Vegas, and when not aiding healing, they can be found at other events and charities around town. \n\nThe cakes: a friend of mine who is not gluten-intolerant will ONLY get the GF cakes, she loves them that much. Me, I have everything but the GF because I love maximum gluten. The bundtlet is the perfect single-serving size for the possessive, territorial type. The summation, though? Everything is excellent, and that is due to the following equation:\nPerfectCake = moist + delicate crumb + healthy ratio of cake to frosting + sweet-but-not-saccharine frosting + right complimentary flavor combination between cake&frosting\n\nNBC nails it, every time. This place is gold. Every. Time.
