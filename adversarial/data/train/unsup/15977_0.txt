\"AYUDAME! AYUDAME POR FAVOR!\" I bet that's what's going on in the mind of the Gringos that come here.  \n\nI love coming here, the selection is fantastic, the produce quality is on par with Whole Foods, and the service is....well the service is how you make of it. Cardenas is not a place for the timid. Like at a club. Girls are more likely to ignore you than ask you to dance.  So with a bit of liquid courage, walk up to them, tell them what you want, grab a seat and wait for your bottle service to happen and they will come. Your experience can be quite dazzling.\n\nBut if you're timid like Arvin T.'s first time there,  you can be quite a spectacle. Running around like a chicken with his head cut off. Are the ladies going to come to me? How should I do this? \"AYUDAME!!!\"
