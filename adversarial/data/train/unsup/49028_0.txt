This place was surprisingly really delicious. It's a little place, maybe 30 or less seats. The menu isn't massive but has the basic pad Thai, curries and tom yum soup. But there's some other dishes that aren't typical in Thai restaurants outside of Thailand. Like pork jowl and spicy pork bone soup. It is better described as Thai Street Food. Their spicy dishes are amazing, I can handle it but my friends cannot. One friend ordered the Spicy Pork Bone Soup, it turned out to be too spicy but she downed it anyways because it was still super flavorful. I ordered the pork jowl and added some of the chilies from the pork bone soup since I love spicy.  Other dishes friends ordered were very delicious as well. Although this isn't a typical Thai restaurant, they don't even have meat satay ::shocked face::  They keep it simple and the dishes are extremely well done.
