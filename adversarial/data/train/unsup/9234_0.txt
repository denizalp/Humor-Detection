Who doesn't love Chick-fil-A? Well.....actually vegetarians haha. This location is ALWAYS packed but the staff are always keeping the line moving, so you're never having to wait over 10 minutes. Some days the food is cold and soggy while other days the food is fresh and hot, but it's fast food so what do you expect? I love that the staff are always efficient and quick while  also being friendly and helpful! I also really like the fact that Chick-fil-a restaurants don't open on Sunday's (even though that's when I mostly crave it).
