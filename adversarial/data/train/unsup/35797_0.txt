My wife and stayed on Friday night before St Patricks Day as a romantic getaway.  This mansion was built in 1921 and part of it actually was brought over from England!  The old world charm of this place is amazing! We stayed in the Burke Suite which was terrific. It is very large and and comfy. It also has a very nice and updated bathroom.\n    \n      We enjoyed dinner in their quaint dinning room. I had the Scallops and my wife had the Penne Pasta which we both felt were very good, but . . . . The bread selection they serve was GREAT !!!\n     \n      The staff throughout our stay were friendly and helpful. After dinner we took the 6 minute drive to town to see the falls and their neat shops!\n\n       Great time, Awesome place, and a Neat area !!! \n     \n      And that's coming from a Pittsburgher !!!\n\n   PS:  Their phone # is 440-247-4940
