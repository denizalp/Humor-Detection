I'm bumping my former review up to 4 stars because of the owner comment below. \n\nIt shows a great deal of class, something my reviews often lack, (though I make no apologies for that...I don't pull punches and I value honesty over false refinement or 'charm') to address the aforementioned issues I had with Sleepy Dog that kept my original review from being 4 stars in the first place. \n\nI will definitely be back. I look forward to learning a bit more and enjoying a positive experience.\n\n*just found out they offer some AZ wines as well.....I'm officially reformed
