Freshest tasting coffee and coffee drinks that I have ever had.  The store is funky and fun, They offer cool new, specialty flavors on a regular basis. The staff is super friendly, and I have never been disappointed in visiting this little gem.  My son says they have the best iced Chai Tea latte that he's ever had and after tasting it--I would agree! Can't wait to go back!
