I had a friend in town this week, and we went a little overboard on the brats and schnitzels at a German restaurant the previous evening. Hoping for something healthy and light I decided to try NCounter. It was just what we were looking for. Good simple sandwiches (I had a tuna melt, she had a portabella sandwich) with a nice fresh side salad. The bloody mary was spot on, and the Americano was pretty solid as well. Other customers were tearing into some good looking French toast and eggs Benedict, so now I'm super psyched to come back for breakfast.
