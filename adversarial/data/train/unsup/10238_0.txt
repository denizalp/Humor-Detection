It was the day after Xmas - on our way to Cozumel so we were looking for a nice bfast spot in CHarlotte airport. \n\nMy bf originally wanted some fake bagel place, but I schooled him on the ways....listen up...\nAnything that says \"famous\" and \"biscuits\" and sounds like jazz - u eat that no matter what. \n\nAnd we did...it was glorious. The biscuit was so buttered up, it was heaven. Of course it was 10am, so we're not crazy..instead of chicken...we ordered the biscuit and sausage sandwiches. Hit the spot, put me to bed on my connecting flight.\n\nWe're so glad we experienced this treasure of Charlotte. We wanted to get this on the way back as well, but alas - customs took too long.\nso - NOJANGLES!
