I honestly have not had the same problems as everyone else at the Maryland location. I've bought two sectionals from them and my oldest one (had for two years now) is still in the best shape. The price was a great deal considering my boyfriend and I have gone all over to get a large sectional that wasn't $4,000. The only reason why I put four stars because the salesmen are super aggressive--it's really annoying. It got to the point where we told them to let us look on our own. The shipping and set up fee can be avoided by asking another friend for help! We rented a uhaul for a couple hours a did the moving in our own. What's $50? V the $100+ they charge.
