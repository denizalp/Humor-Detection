First, my disclaimers...  I have a pretty negative stance on tobaco smoke; especially cigars. I'm here on business from Oregon and not only don't smoke cigars, but it wouldn't dawn on me that a hotel would support a cigar bar.  But then, this is the South, and we're in tobacco country (sadly).  I'm a public health professional, and am pretty mortified that the National Association of Public Health Institutes would choose to hold a conference in a hotel that not only had a cigar bar, but reeked of stale cigar smoke.  But, to give them the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure they never thought to ask.\n\nSo, you get where this is going, right?  Walking into the hotel, it smelled stale.  They sent me to a room (on the 8th floor) that smelled totally moldy - I kept wondering if they had been involved in a flood - did Hurricane Sandy hit here?  I thought another room might help.  The second room they sent me to was either occupied, or someone had decided to have their dinner there.  I asked for a third.\n\nRoom three doesn't smell much better.  Again, stale and moldy.  But I finally got it - it's the entire hotel.  The elevators reek from old cigar smoke, and the entire building is permiated by this acrid odor.  I can't wait to hear what the public health people have to say about this tomorrow.  Meanwhile, I have to tolerate being in this building for the next two days.  And I already have a headache.  The things I put up with for my job...
