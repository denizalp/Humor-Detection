As much as I love In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shack is better all around. The fries, the hamburger meat, the cheese, the frozen custard shake are made of quality ingredients and deserve recognition. Price point is higher for that very reason. I'm so addicted to the perfect fries! Cheese lovers can order a side of cheese dip to keep the fries crisp. The shackburger left me wanting more. The shroomburger and the chicken sandwich are also amazing!
