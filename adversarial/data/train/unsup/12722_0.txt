It's a shame our experience has caused me to NEVER want to come back.\n\nThe food was great. I had the gyoza and the tonkotsu ramen. The ramen wasn't the best I'd ever had but pretty damn close. The broth was very flavorful and rich. \n\nWe ordered appetizers and ramen. The server brought both at the same time. My better half sent his ramen back because he wanted to enjoy his octupus (which was delicious) first without the ramen getting cold. I wasn't in the mood to squabble with the server, so I just took everything. By the time my husband finished his octopus, I was done with my ramen. Since I was finished eating, he did not want to eat on his own. The server told him since he ordered the ramen, he would have to pay for it. The server offered to let him take it home, but ramen noodles sitting in the broth? How gross and mushy would that have been later? We told him we were not going to pay for it since we did not eat it. Their failure to pace the meal properly was not our fault. The owner\/manager didn't even have the nerve to come tell us herself or even apologize.\n\nNeedless to say, we will never be back. It's a shame they lost a customer over $8.
