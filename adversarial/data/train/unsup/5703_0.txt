Tacos Huevos was recommended by Stefany V as a meetup spot for the first Yelp Book Club of the year.  While I was the only member in attendance on Saturday, I was far from disappointed.  \n\nI don't come downtown too often...parking worries me.  I can never seem to find a spot to park that doesn't involve paying to park.  \n\nImagine my delight, then, when I arrived at Tacos Huevos, and found ample FREE parking!!!  \n\nTH was super easy to find, and there is plenty of seating, both inside and out.\n\nI walked in, and was greeted by Chris, who I found out is the owner.  He went over the menu with me, after discovering that it was my first time in.   \n\nThe set up is kind of a Chipotle\/Subway style \"build your own\" spot, with a la carte options as well.  \n\nSaturday, I opted for: \na   slow cooked and smoked pork bowl, and 1 street taco:  steak.\n\nThe bowl comes with rice, beans, meat, and whatever toppings you want. \nI got mine with a scrambled egg, a ton of salsas and veggies, and a little sour cream.  \n\nLet me say:  this was HUGE.  Like...I should have only ordered the bowl, because I was stuffed after eating the taco and a few bites of the bowl.  But I pushed through.   \nThe pork was super tender, flavorful, and amazing.  If you know me, you know I'm not usually a fan of pork, but for some reason, I just had to try this.  I'm really glad I did.  \n\nI also had a steak taco, with onions, cilantro, and some melted cheese.  The cheese is totally worth the 35 cents extra.  SO delicious!!  The steak was good, nice and tender.  \n\nI also had a margarita.  Because tequila.  It was also delicious!  \n\nChris showed me the selection of organic sodas they offer, and let me know that you can get a spiked soda with organic tequila, vodka, or...something else.  I tuned out at tequila.  Next time I go, I'm totally getting a spiked blood orange soda.  \n\nService was extremely friendly.  The food was phenomenal.  The place is clean, bright, and open.  Prices are totally reasonable, especially given the downtown location.  You most definitely get your money's worth here. \nThey also offer vegan options, and desserts!   \n\nI definitely not only recommend Tacos Huevos, but plan to return VERY soon to try more of the food!
