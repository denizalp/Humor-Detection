Fantastic food cooked with care and served by wonderful people.\n\nThe chicken schnitzel cordon-bleu is perfection. Close behind are the Swedish meatballs, and any salmon dish. All the sauces and gravies and dressings are beautifully crafted. There are a multitude of veggie sides to choose from, and you can swap a starch for two sides. The only dish I've tried I didn't absolutely love was the laxpudding, but only because it was a little too salty.
