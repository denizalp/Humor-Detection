I've had a few colleagues swear by this chicken. \nWell, I've tried it 2x now so I can write about it and let you know - you're not missing anything AND ESPECIALLY AT THESE PRICES. \n\nSides are limited. \nThey offer breakfast. \nChicken before 11am is worthwhile as most fastfood places don't open until 11am and it's nice not to have to have breakfast items. \n\nThey serve breakfast items; chicken wings that are larger for the wing combo's; potato wedges and of course, you can use your Shell gas card here. \n\nATM on site. \nHarder than most places to get in and out but pretty ok for the location as South Blvd can get ridiculous with the traffic flow. \n\nStaff at the gas station service counter always friendly and personable. \nNever bought gas here - go figure.
