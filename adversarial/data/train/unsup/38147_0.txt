I used to go to Maya for haircuts, then I switched to another hair salon because my hair stylist is not longer there. Last week I went to Maya again for a simply trim (I thought it would be hard to screw up a trim, but I was wrong). \n\nI asked for a Japanese hair stylist, and told her I want to keep the same shape but just 1\"-2\" shorter, I even showed her pictures of how I want it.  The cut was fine after she blowed dry it, but I think the real way to see how is the cut is after you wash your hair and blow dry yourself. The cut was BAD, I don't like it at all! Bad layers, most of the layers are almost end at the same level, asymmetrical too. I'm going on a vacation next week and I'm hating my hair, now I have to pay for another hair cut to get it fix on Friday....darn! I won't go backto Maya ever!
