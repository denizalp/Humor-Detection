This was an amazing dining experience. The fried chicken is a staple for Yardbird and it did not disappoint. If you happen to eat dinner at Yardbird in the next few months, ask to sit in Andy's section. Andy is one of the best servers I have ever had. He is knowledgeable, attentive and is definitely passionate about his job and the company he works for. Thank you Andy for making it a memorable evening.
