Giving this place a 2 star review is like pouring a glass of water into a house fire. Whatever. Here's my 2 star review:\n\nI really wanted to like this place. I really did. I enjoy crepes a ton and I LOVE JoBot in downtown Phoenix, but this place... it just left so much to be desired.\n\nI ordered a Papa K and my girlfriend ordered the veggie stack. Her crepe, no joke, was the size of a business card. I still remember how heartbroken she looked when the server (who was very friendly) placed it in front of her. She spent all morning trying to find a new crepe place on Yelp and was really stoked when she came across Crepe Bar. It would've been nice to have been able to add egg to her's, but I can see how for her particular crepe, it would interfere with other tastes. My crepe was larger than her's--more of a standard crepe size, but still pretty small compared the other crepes I've enjoyed in Arizona, Chicago, and parts of California (haven't had crepes overseas yet). Coffee was decent.\n\nNow, we're not big fat gun totin' 'Merican eaters--we don't do all-you-can-eat type of stuff, we never \"biggie-size\" anything. But c'mon. We never, ever say that a meal was \"too small\". This meal was measly, even for a 105 pound girl.\n\nSize aside, the crepes were gourmet. Both were. You can tell that time was taken when writing this menu and the chef delivers in all avenues of taste. All two bites were satisfying, but you don't have to make your dish the size of a Gameboy pocket to make it seem more like \"fine dining\" or to make it look like it is out of a magazine. I know that the world of fine dining and culinary arts pushes for quality over quantity (rightfully so), but even quality food should be sized and plated appropriately. You wouldn't serve someone a 1oz Kobe beef steak just because you spent so much time and energy perfecting it.\n\nThe search for a new crepe place continues...
