Really good food, but beware the portions are huge!!!  Was full off of the truffle fries alone with brisket and French dip to follow, didn't even finish half of the later 2 and ended up having to throw away leftovers due to hotel not having a refrigerator...only complaint was the long wait almost an hour just to find out they hadn't put our name down on the list or failed to call us when we were waiting right outside the entrance, luckily they got us a table immediately upon discovering the error
