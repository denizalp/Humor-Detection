BEWARE!! This apartment will nickel and dime you... It was the first place I lived when I moved to Vegas. Got a good deal to move in with my now ex husband and 2 yorkies. The carpet wasn't in the best condition, but the only real maintenance issue I had was that the dishwasher wasn't screwed in, it was just sitting in the cabinet. Maintenance fixed it the next day.\n\nWhen my 14 month lease was up they sent me a letter asking my intent to stay and resign at $40 extra\/month, stay and pay month to month at an additional $100\/month (per the lease agreement), or vacate. I first attempted to resign my lease because it seemed cheaper than moving, but they REFUSED. Both my ex and I were on the lease and since he was obviously no longer living with me he wouldn't be there to resign. I asked if we could just resign with just me, they said it \"wasn't possible\", at least not without paying all the fees again even though I'd been a resident for over a year. So I decided to stay month to month, but I quickly changed my mind... My lease was up Feb. 28th and I had been paying $744\/month for a 1 bdrm. So when March rent was due they said it was $844\/month - $100 extra per month for being on the month to month. Fine with me, I knew it would be extra... Until April rent when they decided to charge me $1,080! I called and told one of the ladies in the office there was a mistake, she said \"we're charging you current market value plus $100 per month now.\" No warning, nothing in the lease agreement that said they can charge \"market value\" if you decide to stay month to month (only an extra $100\/month), they just up and changed their policy. I put in my 30 day notice immediately...\n\nWhen I moved out I knew the carpet would need to be replaced, it wasn't in good condition when I moved in anyway, plus I had 2 yorkies in there and my ex was very messy. I assumed the $500 non refundable pet deposit would be plenty to cover it. I also paid $300 for the regular deposit. Everything else was left in good condition, I felt confident any repairs would be covered just fine.\n\nOver 2 months pass since I moved out and I get absolutely NOTHING in the mail from them regarding a return of any deposits, no itemized list of things that needed repairs, not a single thing. So I called. I called for an entire day and couldn't get anyone on the phone. Finally I sent them an email where I was told I now owe $828 for replacing the carpet and cleaning! I asked if my $500 pet deposit had been used toward that and the apt manager stated \"that's just a pet FEE, not a deposit.\" So I paid $500 plus $30\/month for dogs and that wasn't even a DEPOSIT?! It literally went to NOTHING but their pockets! I was livid! I asked for the itemized list of repairs be mailed to me and he refused... A few hours later I received a call from the company now in charge of my account and she also refused to sent me anything, she very rudely demanded I show up in person to review it with her. She got defensive and started yelling at me when I simply told her I'd rather look over the charges myself.\n\nThey steadily raised my rent while I lived there as well. My original rent when I moved in was only $675\/month, but by the time I moved out it was $744. They also have a \"drug free\" policy, but I saw countless drug deals happen on property right in front of me, sometimes in the middle of the day with children playing next to them...\n\nI definitely don't recommend Turtle Creek. There are plenty of other overpriced apartments in much better areas of town!
