I'm disappointed with The Saint today. Have had great experiences there before but today went for brunch with bunch of girlfriends. In the first 5 minutes at our booth, the waiter dumped two full mimosas on my friends lap. She was soaked!! After mumbling a sort of apology and getting towels the waiter proceeded on like nothing happened. No offer of free drink, nothing. We then proceeded to wait well over an hour for our food. In all we were there over 2 hours, my friend now dryish with sticky clothes. Got the bill full price, with not a \"thanks for being a good sport\" or nothing from the waiter to my friend who really was very good about the whole thing. Not much of a Saint today I'm afraid.
