This Sam Woo is a bit more pricey then the others in California... Maybe because it's one of the few good chinese places to eat in Las Vegas. Having eaten in chinatown's in Vancouver, San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Toronto, Boston, New York and Chicago. I have to say this place isn't too bad!! make sure you order the beef chow fun with Gai lan and extra hot sauce (peppers or chili paste).... it's tasty!
