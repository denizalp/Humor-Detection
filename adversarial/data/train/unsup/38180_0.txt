Olive & Ivy is quick, easy, and reliable.  We enjoy their breakfast\/brunch options, bruschetta, flatbreads, and pasts the most.  The sandwiches have been less impressive--not as flavorful or as satisfying.  \n\nTake note, they typically offer fresh foccacia at the beginning of the meal, and it's easy to fill-up on it if you've already ordered bruschetta, too!  Lots of love for the butternut squash, fungi, and prosciutto and fig bruschetta.  We really like the funghi trifolato flatbread.\n\nThe sweet potato cannelloni is sweet and savory, and it's a rich dish but very good.  I've also had the bone-in ribeye, which is good and was cooked medium rare.
