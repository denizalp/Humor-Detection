First time dining there today and I was not very impressed. The only good thing about this joint is how amazingly cheap their dishes are. The food itself was fairly good especially for the price. But the staff was very unwelcoming (disregarding one waitress who served myself and my friend 100x better than our assigned waiter) the manager, I'm assuming, was extremely rude and wouldn't even crack a smile, yet he was chatting up a storm with the guests behind our table which made myself and my friend feel extremely unimportant. (Not to mention very unprofessional to not maintain that energy with the rest of the guests.) It took 20 minutes for us to get our bill after asking both our assigned waiter AND the manager - and the waitress I spoke of earlier ended up being the one who brought it to us. You have to walk past the kitchen to get to the washroom and the kitchen looked extremely unkept. It made me uneasy eating my meal afterwards. I definitely recommend this joint for a quick(our food was brought out within 15 min, give or take) and cheap food but do not go there expecting to be served well. We weren't even acknowledged with a simple \"thank you\" when leaving.  And I advise not going to their washroom.
