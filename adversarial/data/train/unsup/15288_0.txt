I've been going to this THEEE-YAY-TER since it opened years ago! Sadly the glam and wow that it had then (Tutankahmen laser shows are a rarity these days) are long gone. Now the theatre is just packed with sweaty greasy people and rambunctious teens that I am sure will someday lead a life of crime. Not to mention an escalator that always tries to kill me on the way up and down.\n\nStill Chinook theaters is the place to go for movies, especially if I feel like catching something in 3d. Alternative theatres are either way too far or more sketchy.\n\nBeing a kid at heart, I always liked to hit up the arcade. In confession, I sometimes wait until we are seated in the theatre and kindly excuse myself to \"go to the bathroom\". While my companions assumed that I'm taking a numero 2, I'm actually blasting away at Time Crisis, hardcore AZN style!\n\nNot a big fan of their food items because it's expensive, but I like the plentiful and convenient vending machines, which ensures that I am adequately hydrated throughout the movie. They also have dipping dots!.\n\nFYI: Dont' even think about trying to part with one of their IMAX 3D glasses, their security system will make sure you don't walk out of the building with it.
