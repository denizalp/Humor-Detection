Pittsburgh Bound!  Part VII\n\nI moved to Atlanta in December of last year from Pittsburgh and had yet to be back.  Virtually every Labor Day weekend of my entire life was spent in Pittsburgh with my parents, as my birthday falls within the window.  I promised my folks that I would make a long weekend out of it, and head on home.  The following reviews are a step-by-step account of the long weekend.  Enjoy!\n\n(For part VI, go to: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/review_share\/afRmUb4fRAis4pj4la81pg\/review\/37RV-CLTN_VtfuDV0aFwXQ?fsid=Z8qxRyyV5MsVe8lEfPWIYg)\n\nWholey's is the best fish market I've ever been to.  When you enter, Andy of Andy's Sushi greets you at the door.  To the left is the kitchen area that's been there for as long as I can remember, and to the right a room filled with fresh fish being scaled and filleted by experts.  \n\nThe kitchen is what I love the most about Wholey's.  When I was young, my parents would do their shopping, and before we left, they would pick up some fried shrimp for us.  We would then go back to the car and eat the shrimp on the tailgate of the car while watching all of the people go by.  If you buy fish from the market side of the building, you can then take it to the kitchen where they will cook it for you in whatever fashion you'd like.  Places like this are few and far between.\n\nInstead of fried shrimp at the end of our shopping, I now make it a point to go to the kitchen first and get a cup of incredible lobster bisque to carry around while I shop.  The soup is so flavorful and creamy and is the perfect comfort food on a cold day.\n\nIn a very normal Strip moment for not only me, but just about everyone that I know, I didn't \"need\" anything, but I can't help myself when I'm here.  I picked up some pepper smoked salmon to have as a snack later in the day, and my mom went to town, buying what appeared to be nearly 400 lbs. of bacon, and a few bags of frozen calamari in her typical early preparation for Christmas Eve dinner (keep in mind that it's currently September).  \n\nThanks to Wholey's, I'm pretty sure that the majority of my inheritance has been frittered away by my parents.  My guess is that the folks have single-handedly kept Wholey's in business all of these years on impulse buys alone.  \n\nEven if you don't have the need or travel means to buy a whole salmon or live crabs, Wholey's is at least worth checking out.\n\n(For Part VIII, go to: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/review_share\/1uvcySLWM75MzlLM12F8dA\/review\/6ht1cyxYCAKExjg_Tc_HwQ?fsid=s1rEBoNOZ5ycTbDCtvJrzA)
