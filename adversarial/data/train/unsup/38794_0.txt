I met a friend for lunch and the atmosphere was very nice.  The staff was great and very accommodating.  They were patient, because we kept talking, but we finally did order.  I had a taco salad with chicken.  The size was just right as it came in a taco shell.  I am used to having lots of beans, and there weren't really that much, the chicken was a little sparse too, what chicken I had, was just on top of the salad.  The salad was good, but I wish there would have been more chicken.  It came with sour cream and salsa, which I used as a dressing. I would go back again, but would try something else
