Not impressed. Went on Friday and purchased four desserts to bring home. They were lackluster.  They all tasted the same. Nothing special. It's as if you bought them from the Vons Bakery.  Mass market food with no passion. No flavor. \n\nJust went to buy a nice crusty loaf of bread. Same result. \n\nI pass and will not go there again. Food is much better at CRAFTkitchen, just down the street.
