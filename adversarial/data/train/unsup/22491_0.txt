So it seems that the owner of this business is just as unprofessional as her employees!\nAfter my conversation with them on Wednesday, today I received a call from Jennifer and a voicemail that was largely sarcastic in tone, as well as unapologetic for her employee's behavior. Also in the voicemail was her distaste for my yelp review that she called \"harsh\". She does say \"I apologize\" at one point in a tone and verbiage that is clearly an \"I'm sorry, I'm not sorry\".\n\n\"Hi Rae, this is Jennifer with Jennifer's catering... I would love to chat with you. I know that you chatted with Amanda yesterday and I see you had a \"very large problem with that\", so I'd like to talk to you about that. I apologize if she came across...um... harsh? But... uh, yeah... this yelp review is awfully harsh too. BUT, I think she was just going by the guidelines but, uh... obviously that was very (inaudible) to you so I'd like to discuss.\"\n\nJennifer ends the message by leaving her number and an extremely curt \"Thank you\". \n\nHow inappropriate can you get?!? \nThe only reason you have my information is because I gave it your staff member before I realized what kind of a company I was dealing with. The information was given under the pretense that I wanted to hire you to cater an event, not call and complain about my very accurate, well deserved yelp review and subsequent review update. \n\nA tip: Don't call and leave voicemails complaining about yelp to the yelper who left it for you in the first place. How in the world do you have a successful business when you don't know the basics of customer service, hospitality and appropriate business behavior? \n\nI'd also like to add, if you had called and were actually professional, apologetic and genuinely concerned about \"very large problem\" & the poor experience I had in the first place, instead of your yelp reviews, I would have gladly changed\/amended it to say that you called and cared. Instead, you shot yourself in the foot and now this is here... \n\nTo anyone who is thinking of hiring this company, you've been warned! As for me, I've moved on and booked someone else.
