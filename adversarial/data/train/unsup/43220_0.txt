I Love Pop, the staff is always very friendly. Very clean space and they have the best brand of gel-Presto- that I haven't seen used anywhere else.  Tons of colors and glitter to select from.\nMiley is the best, she is SUPER precise and does the best acrylic nails I've ever had! Love love love Miley! I've been to tons of other nail salons as I grew up in Vegas, and Miley is hands down the best at Acrylic.  I've been going to her at Pop for well over a year now and won't let anyone else do my nails.
