I am a Floridian and have been to Orlando more then I would like to admit. Get rid of all the characters, useless shows, and add rides that make you pray to the gods and you have Canada Wonderland!! \n\nThis park is amazing and went well above all my and my families expectations. From the food ,staff and of course the rides..   \n\nThis park does not disappoint !
