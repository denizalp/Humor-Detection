The drink menu is solid, and the food is actually pretty great, but the service is garbage. \n\nTry to place an order and the waitress\/bartender will completely disappear for 10-15 mins at a time. \n\nOnce you somehow place an order, you will wait 45mins to an hour for your food. Even though it's classic bar food. \n\nI honestly only come here because I work nearby.
