We got the medium green tea mousse with coconut jelly, little honey, less ice and medium rose milk tea with tapioca pears, little honey, less ice. Drinks come in medium or large with their medium size being comparable to other store's \"small\" or \"regular.\"  The two drinks were just under $11. The inside of the store is nice and there are numerous tables, making it a better place to sit down and relax than the cramped Chatime (Dundas).  \n\nI usually ask for no sugar when getting bubble teas, but with Kung Fu Tea using honey, I decided to try some. I found the sweetness was just right. You can taste a hint of honey, but it doesn't overpower the rose milk tea flavour. The tapioca pearls are smaller than the ones at Chatime, but larger than the \"small tapioca\" at Bubble Republic. They're perfectly chewy and probably the best I've tasted.\n\nHowever, the green tea mousse was underwhelming. The drink didn't really taste like green tea at all and the coconut jelly had a strong mango taste. The mousse didn't have a distinctive flavour compared to places like Chatime or Chachago.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of bubble tea, Kung Fu Tea is worth a visit. The rose milk tea is amazing, the menu has a lot of unique drinks and toppings, and the service is quick.
