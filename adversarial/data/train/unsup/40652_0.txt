WHY we liked this place so much remains a mystery...it doesn't really fit into our typical dining template with the noise, and the beer, and the noise. However, we loved our experience here. \n\nI had pretzel-crusted chicken and boyfriend had the meatloaf, and we were very happy not only with the food, but with the **value**. That is, you get a lot of bang for your buck here. Lots of food, delicious mashed taters, and I received TWO tasty slabs o' chicken, such that I had to take one of the breasts home. \n\nThe atmosphere is actually really beautiful too; gleaming wood everywhere, a three-tiered dining area, lots of windows, a huge, old timey bar, and interior windows so you could see their little beer silo situation. \n\nThe only lackluster part of the experience were the lackluster teenagers manning the Host booth. They seemed very confused about life. It's also very loud in here but if you come early enough, people aren't quite drunk yet.\n\nAll said, we'll definitely be back either for dine-in or take-out!
