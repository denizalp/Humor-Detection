Tomatoes on caprese salad were past their prime ... wrinkly skin and mealy.  The flavors and texture of my husband's chicken parmesan reminded him of the veal parmesan he had at \"hojos\" (howard johnsons's) when he was a child -- not a good thing.  And, my veal pacino - milanese style - lacked seasoning and had greasy breading (tasted like the frying oil was past it's prime by a couple of weeks - the oil was the primary flavor) ... the veal was quite fatty in places ... and the salad greens (even before application of dressing) were wilted.\n\nAmbiance needs refreshing.\n\nDisappointing.
