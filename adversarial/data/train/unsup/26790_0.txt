Top to bottom the best eyeglasses shopping experience. Eric the owner has a selection of several dozen frames - from funky fashion to basic - to choose from. Once you have your prescription diagnosed making the glasses took less than 20 minutes. Eric also took the time to show us how the glasses were made - which was a treat. And price wise you can't beat it. Sure, you pay out of pocket, but you'll get better glasses for cheaper than what insurance would charge you and the confidence that your glasses were made right and fast.
