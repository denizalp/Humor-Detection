Kind of disappointed because this is one of my favorite TV shows on.\nYa I give it 3 stars just because I got to see it. Nothing exciting. No one from the tv show was there, and it was a tourist trap lol. I came from Hawaii to see the old man dammit. Just kidding Haha. Was ok though gf bought a Chumlee t shirt and we took a few pics. \nWe didn't have to wait long to go in, maybe. 10 mins at 12 noon. Thank god because it was over a 100 degrees out. \nI forgot the name but we shared my first Chicago dog at a stand right out of the pawn shop. 5 stars to them. :P\nVisited Aug 2011
