I think many can agree with me that shaving is just dreadful! Razor burns, cuts, bumps, then I feel like the hair is growing back within hours after just shaving! Lol! It's been years since I've tried waxing but I had a good experience here!\n\nServices done were - full arms and full legs, $90! Not too bad since I've gone to places more expensive in town. The Body Waxing Studio is located off of Windmill and Eastern. Small but clean place!\n\nThe estheticians\/staff were friendly and great to converse with at check in and especially during the whole process! Was very comfortable, even though it was just my arms and legs being done. A major plus to my esthetician because she was fast, careful and double checked her work! \n\nCouple things I may not be a fan of :\nFirst, and I believe it's just my skin type and certain spots being more sensitive than others, I had little red marks looking like a piece of my skin came of, WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE, it did not hurt, sting, or burn. It was just a reaction and I didn't like how it looked - went away after a couple days.\nSecond, the wax is sooo messy! It is so sticky and it would get everywhere if she didn't pull the right way or if the wax didn't attach to the cloth strip.\n\nOther than that results were good!\nWhole skin will be red because waxing is an exfoliating process but redness goes away after 24 hours or less!\nLet's see how long it takes now for the hairs to grow back!
