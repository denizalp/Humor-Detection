Excited to be the first review. I just found out about Delicious Raw the other day & was anxious to try them. You can never have too many juice\/smoothie cafes around town. At first when I heard they were owned by Eat'n Park I was a little hesitant to try them. I don't exactly think of healthy food when I think of Eat'n Park. I would say their food is down right awful, you couldn't pay me to eat there (but that's a whole other review). But in spite of that I wanted to give Delicious Raw a fair shot. Looking at their menu they have a lot of juice & smoothie choices & most of the drink combinations they have come up with I have not seen at other juice bars. Which is a plus in my book, I always love trying something new. I ordered the Pink Pleasure & my husband ordered the Florida Glow. Both drinks were delicious! All the different flavors of all the different fruits & veggies combined perfectly together. You could taste everything equally, not one flavor over powered the whole drink. They also sell fruit bowls which I'll try next time & raw granola bars. I did try one of the granola bars & it was very good. \nThe prices are pretty much the same that you'll find at any other juice bar, about $7-8 per drink. \nI'm not crazy about the location being downtown b\/c it's always a pain to find parking & plus the fact that you have to pay so much to park downtown. But maybe if this location goes over well they will open more around the city. \nDelicious Raw is a must try! I can't wait to go back to try some more juices.
