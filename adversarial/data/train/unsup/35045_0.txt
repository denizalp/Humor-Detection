Just had a disappointing experience hoping that the good reviews were enough to overshadow the bad ones.  We ordered the mu-shu pork which is one of my personal faves, fried dumplings, fried pork rolls, thai panang curry with beef and the chicken and broccoli with some won ton soup.  Here's the low-down:\nMu-Shu Pork: Very disappointed.  The flavor was slightly fake in nature and had a strange\/not good aftertaste.  It was also missing the sweet sauce it usually comes with that makes it delectable.\nFried Dumplings: Were very tasty, but the dough was VERY thick.  I felt my arteries closing while eating them.\nFried Pork Roll: Also very tasty, but VERY greasy.  You can tell you're eating something fried.\nThai Panang Curry with beef: Very tasty, BF gobbled it up without much communication.  It wasn't exactly the flavor he was looking for, wanting more of the curry flavor, but it was good enough for him to finish it in record time.\nChicken and broccoli: The chicken tastes fake with that chewy consistency that most chinese places boast in their \"chicken\" dishes making me wonder whether I'm eating chicken...or some other white meat...the broccoli was fresh and crisp even if it was doused in too much sauce.\nWon Ton Soup: Had plenty in my time and this was just wrong. It tasted as if they made it with butter, which turned me off instantly.\nOtherwise a pretty uninspiring meal.  Ended up throwing most of it away.  2 stars for the 2 dishes that were ok.
