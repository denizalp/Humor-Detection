Nice view of the golf course. I think I might want to come back and eat outside on the patio. The food is not great but not bad either. The prime rib was overcooked and the meatloaf was bland. I can't say more than it was just average and a bit meh on the food in a nice environment. The bar looks fun with all the activities and karaoke. I might go back because it is near where I live. However, I would not seek it out either.
