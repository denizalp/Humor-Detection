I've been to Gray's many times as Verona is lacking good restaurants to take business associates to when visiting and our office is located in Verona.  When they first opened we tried them and found them to be severely lacking in service, very slow.  But over the last couple of years they have revised their menu and must have better management because now the service is good.  \n\nI really like their food, I think they have interesting burgers, quite large and really needing a fork and knife.  I think they have a nice selection of entree's and those are well done in general however I would avoid the pizza's, they are too greasy for me.  The beer is only OK, but their soda is good.\n\nThey have come a long way and have gotten to be a place we can take people to without having to apologize.
