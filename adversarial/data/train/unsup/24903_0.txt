I telephoned the country club to inquire about the Goldwater Women's Tennis Classic.  This telephone call occurred on November 12, 2010 at approximately 6:00 PM.\n\nA woman named CHARMION BILLINGTON answered the phone.  \n\nNever in my life have I experienced a more curt, rude, inconsiderate \"ambassador\" of a country club.\n\nThis woman embodies everything that is stereotypical, negative, and distasteful in private country clubs.\n\nI called to inquire about the start times of the tennis matches of the tournament.  Charmion proceeded to inform me, rather dismissively, that she didn't know the times of the matches and nobody was around who did.  \n\nI told her I came in from out of town to see the matches.  Did she know of a website that might have the informaiton I wanted?  She said she didn't know of any website and flatly told me to call back \"tomorrow morning'.\n\nSHE THEN HUNG UP ON ME.\n\nNo kidding.  While I was mid-sentence (to thank her, ironically), she hung up.\n\nI went to the tennis matches, in spite of Charmion's classless and rude behavior.  \n\nEveryone else at the club was friendly, helpful, and welcoming.\n\nPerhaps I caught Charmion on a bad day.  But this in no way excuses her complete lack of professionalism.  \n\nPhoenix Country Club ought to re-evaluate this woman.  She is a discredit to their business.
