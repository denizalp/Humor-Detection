Decor is quaint.  We had a bad experience here though .  As we where being seated, we passed 5 open booths.  hostess sat us down at a wobbly table, so we asked to move to a booth.  she pointed at a row of 4 occupied booths, told us to sit here and wait for one of them to open up.  Waitress showed up twice.  once to take order, and once to give check.   food delivered by other staff.  as for the food.\n\nTasteless for the Asian \/ middle eastern pallet.  no rich flavors\n\nTea -  from a tea bag.  \nbottled water -  smaller than usual bottles.  can fill up 3 guest glasses\nchicken tangine - served skin on, very tender but no taste.\nlamb shwarma -  street vendors in london do better job  \n\nroast lamb.  get 5 pieces of tenderloin sliced -  no taste, very gamey taste that comes  from it being of a certain quality.  high quality lamb does not have that much game taste\n\noverall, not going back.  better middle east options in town for fraction of cost.
