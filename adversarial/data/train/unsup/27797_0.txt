I loved everything about my experience - I mean for real - all we did was the VR experience and loved fighting some zombies - this is some serious next level fun - \n\nI took my 62 year old father to experience VR for the first time and having never played video games really - he was able to figure things out easily and had a blast with me.\n\nThe only reason I am giving. A 4 star instead of five is for our limited service on getting locked in - we had to online to register - they couldn't lock us in over the phone for a schedule time. On arrival we got set up - and instead of starting early since hey we're slow we sat around waiting forever so we started right on time. \n\nOther than the pre service it was awesome - as soon as our techs came out to get us locked in and set up with vests and Guns it was non stop fun.\n\nI suggest a max 6 person party - 4 would be ideal for some of the experiences
