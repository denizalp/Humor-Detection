I got my tragus re-pierced here and took advantage of their $17 walk in special on Saturdays. Although the price is good, you really get what you pay for. There's long line up to get piercings and the wait time wasn't that long but the girl who did my piercing did it totally slanted, and since it's my 2nd tragus piercing because my first one was off, now I am contemplating to have it repierced again- THIRD TIME? What a waste of money. However, the staff there were really nice, just when you are hurried down a line to get piercings the quality definitely goes down.
