This place is fantastic \n\nI had read a many a review of this joint and wanted to check it out myself. Susan C's review just snagged it for me and I was on a mission: The Stockyards or bust. \n\nWith meat on my mind, I of course called out to my fellow meat lover, Christine C. We both decided fried chicken was a must. When we saw biscuits on the menu, I was thinking - hook me up - I needs me some biscuits. I haven't had a good biscuit since I was at Virgil's BBQ in NYC. \n\nThe fried chicken dinner is huge. Absolutely huge. I would say it could easily feed 2. The meat is so tender. So juicy. At first I was thinking I wanted a bit more flavour. I think that is due to the fact that I grew up on very commercialized fried chicken. But, the freshness and tenderness of this chicken is a winner for me. Still, days later, I am thinking about this meal and want to return - soon. For me, that is rare. \n\nI can absolutely see why the fries from The Stockyards have been voted some of the best in the city. They are crispy and skinny. The best ways for a plate of fries to be. I loved that with the chicken and fries, it wasn't very greasy. I was expecting to go home dripping in grease, but it wasn't that bad. \n\nI also had the limeade. Ahhh...this is such a fresh summer drink. With a mint leaf inside, it was so good. \n\nBack to the biscuit. It was huge. One of the biggest biscuits I have ever seen. It was perfectly done, didn't need any gravy or butter. Just a thing of beauty. \n\nBut the thing that sets this place apart from other BBQ joints is the laid back atmosphere and staff. Christine and I were served by the coolest gal and she just made us feel like we were at home. \n\nI can't recommend this place enough. My mission is to try everything on the menu!!!
