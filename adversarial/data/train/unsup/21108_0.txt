I tired this business few years ago and hated it. I went a few times to have a full set of nails put on by Megan. Awful job, my nails were thick and sloppy. Since I live around the corner, I decided to try them again but try someone else. I also tried the gel polish instead, seemed simple. So I thought, I had gel polish put on by Tri. That same evening the color on my pinky nail popped right off! then another the next day. Ok, so I said to myself, things happen. So with no issues Tri reapplied polish to those nails. The next day more began to pop right off! Ok so I go back, feeling like a pain but I thought, Hey this is not my fault. I asked them to just redo the entire set since there was obviously something wrong with the first applicaton. He refused. So to make this story short, My gel nail color continued to fall off. So I returned 2 weeks later and asked them to just take it off. The kicker for me was that I was charged! I expressed I didnt think I should have been charged since I had paid $30.00 for a bad gel polish. After going back and forth I ended up paying. Needless to say, I will NOT be going back, nor will I be referring anyone to that business.
