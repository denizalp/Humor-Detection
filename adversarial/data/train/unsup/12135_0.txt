I was going into a string of night shifts and decided to finally use a gift certificate that my husband had given me for a massage at Desert Song.  I've had two massages in the past, so I'm not entirely an expert, but the one I had with this center was the best I've had.  Kelly, my massage therapist, did a quick screen at the beginning to see if there were any areas in particular that I needed to work on, which was super helpful - I've had an area behind my right scapula that acts up from time to time.  I have no clue what she did, but she was able to get all the kinks out, and I wandered out of the building in a bit of a haze, with every muscle in my body loose.  The 50 minute commute during rush-hour traffic down to the hospital that night didn't faze me one bit, and I was super relaxed throughout the entire shift.  Can't wait to go back!
