Peru meets Brazil meets Japan is the brilliance of SUSHISAMBA!\n\nThree different cuisines all beautifully merged to make an incredibly diverse menu, including sushi, tempura, ceviches, soups and noodles, robata meats, churrasco meats and more.\n\nWe sat down, looked at the menu and couldn't decide where to start...there's soo many options. So when the waiter came by and offered to create a custom menu with a few dishes from each cuisine for about 50 bucks a head we were SOLD!\n\nWe had the:\nCrispy Yellowtail Taquitos: served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime \nNeo Tokyo: bigeye tuna, tempura flake, aji panca \nSashimi: Salmon and Tuna\nBerkshire Pork Gyoza kabocha pumpkin purée and su-shoyu dipping sauce\nRib Eye Antichuchos: aji panca with Peruvian corn\nSea Bass Antichuchos: miso with Peruvian corn\nEl Topo: salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion\n\nAll the dishes were absolutely delicious! But if I had to pick, the Yellowtail Taquitos and the two antichuchos would be at the top of my list, hands down...the beef antichucho was melt in your mouth, like buttahhh....and the sweet miso glaze on the sea bass was perfection! The El Topo is one of their signature rolls and it's pretty good but a bit on the heavy side from all the mozarella, in my opinion...\n\nThe service was extraordinary. The waiters and busboys were hanging on us hand and foot, promptly clearing dishes, constantly replacing utensils, plates, and refilling drinks. For me, the service takes this place from a 4 to a solid 5!\n\nSUSHISAMBA, you did me proud!
