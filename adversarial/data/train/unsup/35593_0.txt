Worst Meal in Las Vegas!  Tried this much hyped place for brunch while on a weekend getaway with the hubby.  This was truly our worst meal of the trip...including the airport.  Hubby ordered bacon and eggs and declared the bacon on the same quality level as Denny's.  I ordered ham and eggs and grits.  My ham slice had gristle running all through it.  The grits weren't bad and the biscuits were okay, but nothing special.  We enjoyed the rest of the Venetian's offerings very much, but Yardbird was really disappointing.
