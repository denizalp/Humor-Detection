Recently my husband and I moved to Mt. Lebanon, and I was excited to establish a relationship with a nearby nail spa. Unfortunately, Envy Nail Spa is NOT that spa! For my first visit, I was 38 weeks pregnant and ready to be pampered! I called ahead to schedule my first visit; I scheduled a deluxe pedicure ($45) and a gel (shellac) manicure ($35). The entire experience at Envy Nail Spa, including both services, left me disappointed. \n\nI thought it a good sign that the salon was very busy when I arrived. I was taken to a spa pedicure chair; the chair was broken - no massage, no recline, nothing. I was not happy about this, but there were no other available chairs (except for one that a man was sitting in, not receiving services - he appeared to be an employee but was not working when I was there). Although I encouraged the girl (I believe her name was 'Tammy') to \"really scrub\" and \"really massage\" my feet, she did not do this with any tenacity or for any length of time. The entire \"deluxe\" pedicure - costing $45 - was over in less than 30 minutes!!! I was then moved to a nail station and I asked for the French-style gel (shellac) manicure. At this time, a bridal party was brought in to the Spa (a table of hors d'oeuvres and wine was set up for them). Tammy  rushed terribly through my manicure (it lasted only 15 minutes!), as the staff appeared to be short-handed in providing services to the bridal party. NOTE: I have had a gel (shellac) manicure monthly for at least four (4) years, therefore I know what the service entails and how the result should appear. The gel manicure that I received at Envy Nail Spa was completely sub-standard. The base coat was not carefully applied (in many spots and on all fingers it covered my cuticles), therefore the entire manicure peeled at the edges within three days of receiving the manicure. Typically, on my nails, a gel manicure lasts for one month. (NOTE: These two sub-standard services cost me $80 AND I tipped Tammy $16 cash [20%]! I always tip people well for services provided, and I am happy to pay for good services! This was not the case at Envy Nail Spa, yet I still paid and tipped well!) \n\nI called the Spa and asked if I could come in to have the manicure fixed. The young lady on the phone (Asian accent) was very friendly and said \"Yes\" that I could come back to have the manicure repaired. She also SPECIFICALLY said \"No charge, no charge!\" I scheduled a repair appointment for two days later (the first availability for my schedule and the Spa's schedule). Upon arrival for my second visit to Envy Nail Spa, the receptionist (a young,  Caucasian girl) confirmed that I was there for a \"fix.\" After a bit of time, she removed the existing gel manicure and I continued to wait for a nail technician. I waited for ONE HOUR and FIVE MINUTES - despite having an appointment! I was again put with Tammy, and the second manicure lasted 25 minutes (as opposed to the first manicure duration of 15 minutes). The result of the manicure was the same - peeling within days! I still took out $5 cash for yet another tip for Tammy. The worst part of my second experience was that at the conclusion of the manicure Tammy said \"$35.\" I reminded her that this was a \"fix\" because the manicure that I received from her a few days earlier peeled so badly. She began to argue with me and demanded \"$35.\" I told her that on the phone I was repeatedly told \"No charge!\" and in the appointment book it was marked \"fix.\" I asked to speak with the owner or the manager; Tammy told me, \"Owner on vacation.\" I asked to speak to someone with more authority in decision making for the Spa, and Tammy repeated, \"Owner on vacation\" and she demanded \"$35!!\" At this point I was again disappointed, thoroughly astounded, and angry! I handed Tammy my bank card and paid $35 AGAIN for another terrible manicure - a manicure for which I was told I would not have to pay! Tammy also kept the $5 tip!!! \n\nI was absolutely ripped off by this nail salon, and specifically by Tammy. \n\nI WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS NAIL SPA and I suggest that anyone considering receiving services at this Spa look in to going to another venue!
