This is our local fish & chip joint. Eat in if you want but we always get take out. I'm not a fish eater but I do love their chips, a small order will fill you up. My wife, who is a fish eater, likes the fish, not too oily or greasy or whatever. The owners have changed a couple of times over the years, but the quality hasn't dropped.
