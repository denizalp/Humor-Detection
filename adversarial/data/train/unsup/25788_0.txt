My fiancé and I have searching high and low for a good Mexican place all year (we moved here last August) and I must say we had all but given up finding good Mexican food until we stumbled upon this gem. This place is totally awesome. Celina is so very sweet. It was our first time eating there and she carefully explained their \"NO FREEZER\" policy coupled with their philosophy of fresh food and ingredients. My fiancé is from northern Europe and has never really liked Guacamole so when she offered it to us we turned it down. However, she was so convinced we would love it she gave it to us anyway and my fiancé is now a total fan of Guacamole! \n\nThe food is fresh, favorable and made made just for you and the service is impeccable. If you have not been here, I highly suggest you go. I wish I had found it sooner and saved myself the trouble of eating Mexican anywhere else.
