one word...GROSS!! We tried this buffet as it was highly recommended by a friend in Hawaii. I was not impressed at all. The food was displayed in a very unappetizing manner, and things seemed unsanitary. The food wasn't great either. You are better off at Panda Express. I left there feeling sick like I just had a meal in China. The workers don't all speak english, I asked someone what something was as not all the food was labeled. He looked at me and didn't utter a word and just shrugged his shoulders. Not good if you have food allergies, don't expect them to help you.
