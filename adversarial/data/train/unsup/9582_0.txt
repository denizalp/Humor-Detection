Cheap, unassuming, unhyped, and ridiculously tasty. I can't believe this was my first visit to a place I pass on a daily basis. Took my out of town yelp pal to have something more exotic than the pizza and pub food  we had the previous days. The giant bowl(a medium) of London broil pho was just about the most fragrant and complex food I've had in a long, long time. It was so down home comforting in it's soupiness, yet deliriously foreign with it's Mekong melange of herbs and spices. \n\nOnce you are served, you are not constantly pestered. You can just eat in peace and have conversation with your dining partners about all the weird places you've been, the way you cook foreign dishes at home, and the people you know who hate to try anything new. You lose yourself in that cauldron of truth serum sitting before you. Some reviewers and tv hosts speak of these transformative moments they have while dining. It's happened to me very rarely. But it definitely happened to me here. Forget take out. You do yourself a disservice if you don't just shut out the world and spend a quiet, contemplative hour or so staring into that sea of basil and lime. I might not ever go back to some of the places I hit this past week, but this one is definitely on the list of return business.
