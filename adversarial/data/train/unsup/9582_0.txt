My car broke down the other day and I called Anthony's towing. The towing guys name was Arthur. He came in literally 15 minutes minutes and quickly towed my car to All City Auto Body. This was hands down the best towing experience. I will definitely call him again if I ever need a tow and I highly suggest Anthony's towing to everyone who needs a fast tow.
