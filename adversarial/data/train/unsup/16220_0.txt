Dr. Villa and Dr. Reyes-Hailey are absolutely wonderful and I wouldn't think of going to anyone else! They were there every step of the way for a complicated pregnancy I had and I'm happy to say that my daughter and I are healthy! \nDr. Villa is thorough and hilarious. Very knowledgeable and does what is best for YOU.\nDr. Reyes-Hailey gets the same accolades from me and she will sit and talk with you about anything you need to discuss until you feel better.\n\nLove this office and I love all of the administrative staff and nurses. Amazing amazing.\nDid I mention they play HGTV 24\/7? :)
