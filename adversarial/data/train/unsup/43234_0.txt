Was looking for a great place for tacos and decided to try Diego's since the reviews were really good.  It was exactly what I was looking for. \nReminded me of La Lupitas in Old Town San Jose.  Open air.  Good service and amazing flavors.  We had the green chili chicken, grilled shrimp, skirt steak and grilled salmon tacos.  Yum.  Heading back soon for the Poke......you won't be disappointed.
