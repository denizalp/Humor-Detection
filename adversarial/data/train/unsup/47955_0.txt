I used to tell people to come here if they wanted decent chinese on the wear side.  Last weekend ordered some takeout for my band and I and it was terrible.  Mongolian beef was a joke , the kung pao chicken was bland and the potstickers were frozen.  What happened you used to have good potstickers.  These were frozen, its easy to spot when the edges of the dumpling turn super dry and rubbery.  Never again!
