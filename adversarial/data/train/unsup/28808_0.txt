Yum Status!\n\nI just moved to the area so I thought I would check this place out. I was greeted by a lady that explained the whole ordering process since it way my first time and she was very nice and helpful.\n\nBut skip to the food...\nOMG YUM!!! I was a huge fan of Taco El Gordo and when they shut down the location on the strip I was very sad. BUT, this place to me, is better! It's more fresh and the home made tortillas are delicious. \n\nExpect me to be a regular. Best tacos EVER!!!
