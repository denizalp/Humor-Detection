I've never really been a fan of Hanny's. I tried. I wanted to be. Every time I've walked in the door I've felt extreme discomfort. There is a vein of pretentiousness that feels like it's suffocating me. The food and drinks are good though. That's 3.5 stars.\n\nHanny's cut own beautiful shade trees that they claimed were damaged in a storm. There is no proof of this. Experts and organizations had checked on the trees and determined they were not damaged. Hanny's has previously asked the city to remove the trees and were denied. Something doesn't sit right about their story.\n\nI will not be visiting Hanny's and will emphatically discourage others until new shade trees are replanted. And no, the weed-like plants Hanny's has put in is not good enough. Get it together and get new trees.
