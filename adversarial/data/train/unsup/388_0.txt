Well this place is definitely aptly named as I was left wondering where all my money had gone. I was outraged that I had to pay $67 for admission to the park this past Sunday.  My sister went to a different ticket booth and only had to pay $48 and my brother bought his ticket online and paid $33! What the hell is up with these arbitrary admission prices? It's appalling that I had to spend double what my brother paid and $20 more than my sister and didn't receive anything more than they did!  When I complained to the ticket booth employee who helped my sister, he said that he had given her a special deal and could not refund my money. That's completely absurd and horrible customer service.\n\nI am giving them two stars only because we did have a fun day with my 2 year old niece (she especially enjoyed the dinosaur park), but they really need to stop ripping people off.
