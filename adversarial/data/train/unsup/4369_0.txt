This place has a terrible selection--they don't stock a variety of sizes for the majority of their items (clothing, shoes, etc.).  In fact, the most commonly overheard statement you will hear from the employees is, \"We can order it for you.\"  What a pain in the ass.  It's totally late 70s\/early 80s to me to hear that a store can order something for me.  Skip this place and head to Fleet Feet in Northfield instead.  They have a great selection and keep many items in stock.  Plus, their employees are very knowledgeable.
