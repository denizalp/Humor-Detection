I love the selection of food.  Almost everything was fresh.  I still can't belive they had pan fried noodles. My fav! My kids also loved the food.  You can tell because they all will be quiet.  Bout the only peace and quite my wife and I get.  Over all a really good buffet.  Pricey, but you get what you pay for.
