Went to one of our FAV restaurants again last night..but I have a bone to pick with the CHEF. We had a party of 3.Our Bill ws over 100.00  My daughter is 9 months pregnant...due tomorrow...She ordered the New  South  Burger for her Entree - asking to hold the bacon because of Nitrates!!  We asked if there was any way she could have some Fried Pickles on the Burger. We were willing to pay extra for them....The Waitress was hesistant..but The CHEF SAID..ABSOLUTELY  NOT!  Explain This one....He has Fried Pickles back there...they have a Frickle Burger which is a Burger with Fried Pickles...but he would not..Not even for a Pregnant woman who offered to pay for the extra ingredient add the fried pickles....Did I say Pickles..and She is Pregnant...WTH?????
