Customizable pizzas in minimal time is not a novel concept: several chains with this style have sprung up recently and I kind of had higher hopes for Pieology. Their featured pies list is small, but the emphasis is obviously on designing your own dinner. \n\nLast time I did this, at another chain, I designed something less than delightful, so I decided to play it safe with the Smokin' Buffalo Chicken. \"Blazin' Buffalo\" has a better ring to it, but I digress.\nPie was topped with olive oil (seemed unnecessary), mozzarella and a scant sprinkle of (flavorless) gorgonzola, plain chicken (spicy was also available but not offered?), a ton of red onion slices (a second glance verifies they aren't in the menu description), sub mushrooms instead of cilantro, and add on a buffalo-sauce drizzle after a trip to the oven. As far as taste: the cheese was sort of flavorless, buffalo sauce flavor was dominant, the crust was almost cracker-like with it's crispness. Kind of \"meh.\"\n\nStaff is in need of training. Didn't see a manager around, the assembly-line seemed confused about whether I wanted the buffalo or barbecue pizza (hence the inclusion of the obnoxious amount of red onion), and the guy I interacted with most was extremely soft-spoken: I had to ask him to repeat everything because I couldn't hear him over the music. \nMildly annoyed that no one offered to remake my pie when they realized they were adding the barbecue ingredients instead of the buffalo ones- the giant slices of red onion were a turn off and not supposed to be on the pie at all, but I pointed this out and it was not corrected.\n\nA good, cheap option in the Downtown Summerlin area- $8\/meal is not bad, especially considering you should have leftovers. If I come back, I'll try a pesto-pepperoni creation.
