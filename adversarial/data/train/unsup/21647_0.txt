The owner was very nice, greeted my friend and I upon arrival. Showed up 10 min early for a 3pm appointment. Finally met with massage therapist at 3:14. She was good for the short amount of time she was with me. did a good job on my shoulder I had problems with but I also said I wanted full body. I feel like she basically just put lotion on the rest of my body ( Jergens lotion was on the counter when I got up to leave the massage room, I would think for $50 I would have gotten a better quality lotion.) Maybe had I actually gotten an hour I would have gotten a better massage.\n\nThe room temperature water they gave me after my massage was disgusting (faucet water) \n\nWas NOT pleased with my facial. One of the creams she put on my face smelled good but the rest of the products felt like drug store products. Especially there was one wipe she would use between cleanings it felt like those little clean and clear wipes you get at CVS. I feel like my 8 year old could have done a better job with my skincare that I have at home (I use high quality products so I mostly was doing the facial for the relaxation and massage) My face broke out immediately which can be normal I understand. My scalp massage was not enjoyable my kids give a better scalp massage. I have gotten a few facials before so I went in expecting what they usually do in my other facials the neck shoulder, arm and leg massage while the mask is settling. After she basically played with my earlobes and hair for a minute she got up and washed her supplies while the mask finished settling which was very distracting. \nMy facial & massage both only lasted 35-40 min each including changing and consult time. \nThe reason I gave two stars instead of one is because the massage was not awful & I liked the owner.
