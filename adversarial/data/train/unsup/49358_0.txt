i received no less than 2 texts, a phone call, & 2 letters reminding me about my appointment, and the consequences of not having my paperwork filled out & make certain i arrived at least 30 minutes prior to my appointment so they could review my paperwork and get me registered.  \n\nafter waiting an hour and 20 minutes past my appointment time, someone comes out and announces dr sharif is at least an hour behind.  i asked why he was so far behind and am told he likes to take time with each patient; each appointment is for 5 minutes.  that is great that he wants to spend time & listen to each person, but what IDIOT schedules people 5 minutes apart knowing he likes to take time with each person. then she says he sees 60-80 patients a day.\n\ni do not think this is smart business; and i hesitate to have surgery with an organization that plans so poorly.
