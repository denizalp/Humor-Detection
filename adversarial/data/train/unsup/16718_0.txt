It's apparent there is some secret password for great food or something. People that had good food here, what's the secret? Is there a secret menu? It's really odd that all the reviews are either really good or really bad, with none that are mediocre.\n\nI gave this place another shot and ordered crispy pork with chinese broccoli. When I saw it on the menu I was doing the happy dance. I usually order this at the local thai  places in LA, it's so good. A dish that is pretty simple but amazing when cooked right. When I ordered this, the owner was surprised and asked if I was Thai (which I am not, but I am asian and grew up in LA so I've had more than my fair share of thai food).. I was thinking oh yeah, he got intrigued by my order... this is going to be legit. \n\nWhat the hell! The pork was not crispy at all! The hugest let down ever. There is nothing worst than chewy, rubbery pork belly especially when it is meant to be crispy.  \n\nI know all you loyal customers are thinking... whatever she does not know thai food and is not ordering the right stuff. Blah, blah... but I'm sorry, any Thai restaurant should have Pad Thai down, at the very least. \n\nFooled me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!\n\nP.S. I'm really convinced that there is a secret menu because the Pad Thai I described in my previous post did not look the very least like the one in the photo that someone posted here!
