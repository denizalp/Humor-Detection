Horrible customer service. I went in for the first visit for alterations and they were very standoffish. When picking up the pants, I noticed the zipper had been broken. I brought this to their attention and they refused to fix the zipper or reimburse me for a repair. It was obvious that the damage was done at their shop because the pants were brand new. Also, I would NOT have walked out of the dressing room and proceed to be fitted with a zipper down. \nThe owner proceeded to argue with me when I asked him to at least reimburse me for the tailoring, and kept this up for about 10 minutes. He said he could fix the zipper, but out of principle he would not do anything to the pants. He said that he had many high end clients and did not need one patron's business.  \nVery disappointed, will never return.
