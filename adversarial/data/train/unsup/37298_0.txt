Dr. Angel and her staff are not only competent and caring, but they really listen to their patients. I have been to many dentists who tell me what I need and what they plan to do to my mouth without asking about my goals. With this practice I am given options and the out of pocket cost after insurance is clearly explained to me. The office is clean and pleasant, the staff is friendly and they run on time. \n\nBest.Dentist.Ever.
