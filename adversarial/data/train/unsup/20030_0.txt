The only place in the area to go for REAL Italian imports. There are plenty of Italian delis claiming to be real...nah. Check the shelves, those places are full of \"Made in USA.\" \n\nYou scan the shelves of Ferrara's, and you'll see things you've never seen before. Gassosas and chinottos, plenty of anise-flavored everything, all proudly made in Italy. \n\nI've never grabbed something from the deli, but it's on the list. I've noticed that they have real Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese, and it certainly isn't cheap, but if you're a cheese freak, you owe yourself the experience.\n\nThe front counter has an assortment of candy. I'd recommend anything with sesame seeds, trust me on this, as well as a small selection of common American cigarettes, and an assortment of what are Italian-style cigars. They're USA-made, but have you ever seen an anise-flavored cigar before? (They're decent, too; these aren't Swishers.)\n\nThe employees are super friendly, especially the older man and woman whom I assume are the owners.\n\nMy only complaint is that the store has extremely weird hours. At this point, I call ahead before stopping in.\n\nOverall, the store reminds me of a down-home general store like I grew up with in rural southern Ohio, but with a real Italian twist.\n\nTo top it off, every time I get home after visiting Ferrara's, I find an adorable little Italian candy in an ornate box in my bag. It's like yogurt-covered wafer with a lemon center. Yum.
