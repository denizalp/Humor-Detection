So I am not sure what to make of the brewery experience. I've had some of their beers on tap at other bars\/restaurants, and I've bought some cans and bottles at Total Wine and whatnot, but I didn't have a great time at the actual restaurant.\n\nService was kind of slow. Seating was super close to other tables, and the chairs are not comfortable. Several of the beers we wanted were out, so we ended up settling on some that were just OK.\n\nPub food is usually underwhelming, and that's what happened here. We started with chicken nachos, santan slingers, and the pretzels. The chicken nachos were fine. It was a good portion and nice and greasy. Slingers were very rich and heavy. The table was kind of divided on them - half love, half hate. Pretzels were nice, soft, and the mustard and cheese sauces were good.\n\nThe entrees were not a hit all the way round. Devil's chicken fingers were plain and fine if you like fried food. Southwest friend chicken was plain. Chandler club was kind of boring. Southwest chicken sandwich was also quite boring. Texas beef dip sandwich was fine.\n\nAgain, I know pub food is never amazing, but this was pricey for being so bland. I wouldn't mind stopping in again for a beer, but I would pass on food. Overall, just an OK experience.
