Sooooo yum! \n\nTried this place out when they were parked Downtown behind Park on Fremont for the AIDS walk\/March Against Monsanto day.\n\nI very picky about my veggie dogs (not a fan period) so when I told my friend to surprise me with a vegan style choice she picked a spicy Wise Guy Vegan Style and I was pleased! \n\nDisclosure: I never ate hot dogs nor those icky sausage brats? prior to a plant based lifestyle so I'm not sure what to compare the flavor to.\n\nI'm not a fan of Tofurky anything lol. I can't stand the faux meats that company makes and I avoid them (and almost all faux) like the plague. I was told this was a Tofurky beer brat? The fennel flavor hiding inside is not a big turn on for me but luckily the fennel was not strong so the dog stayed on my plate and not tossed in the garbage can :) The sheer smell of breakfast sausage? (have never tried) makes me gag due to fennel smell :) \n\nI really loved the bread, all the yummy peppers and onions PILED HIGH and the spicy kick that it had!\n\nWe shared a side of fries and the couple of fries I had were super good! Not over not under cooked and like a nice fluffy baked potato inside. Not salty. I hate salt.\n\nFor about $8 a dog and a side of fries is waaaaay too much food for me. I was stuffed on half of the dog and a few fries.\n\nMy friend said the service was super nice and was proud to serve a compassionate food choice. \n\nTwo thumbs up and I def want to try them again soon.
