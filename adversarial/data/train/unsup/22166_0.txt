Would have had a better rating if it weren't for the following:  I ordered a cocktail (called the Paloma) at the Passenger on June 13 2015. Halfway through my drink, I found I had sucked up a small piece of sharp glass. Fortunately I had felt something hard on my tongue and decided to check what it was. When I took it out of my mouth, it was a diamond shaped shard of glass with 2 very sharp points and sharp edges. I immediately spoke with our server and showed her the piece of glass. She did not seem fazed and barely apologized before telling me she would alert the manager. I was not given much of an apology or any explanation as to how a piece of glass ended up in my drink. If I had swallowed the piece of glass, it may have resulted in a medical emergency. I feel that the restaurant did not think it was a big deal and essentially shrugged off the situation, and this made it even more concerning. I would have expected them to a much bigger deal of this situation, and for the manager to personally come out and apologize. Also, I still had to pay for my meal, which is something that other restaurants may have comp'd for the terrible and scary experience. Wouldn't come back here ever again. In fact, I have reported this establishment to DineSafe Toronto to have investigated.
