I went to this place for a Foot Reflexology massage, but they also offer full body reflexology, aromatherapy massage, accupressure, mani\/pedis, and facial massages.\n\nI stopped in this place after walking around all day in the Chinatown\/Kensington area, and my feet and legs and back were pretty sore. Raymond administered mine. He was nice and young and friendly, but the place wasn't as \"health department\" clean as I would have preferred. I stayed anyway, and had a very relaxing massage after a nice and hot foot soak in special herbs. $25 for the best foot massage I have ever had. When I left, I felt like I could walk another 5 miles.
