If you're having Peruvian, you have to have the corn juice.  It's non-carbonated, sugary goodness with a hint of cloves and cinnamon.  For me, it's like an appetizer and a drink.\n\nThe chaufa is excellent here.  It's fried rice, and is very salty, but I assume if you're ordering it, you'll like that.  Get the one with chicken and beef (and shrimp if you like it).\n\nI don't think it's better than the places in NYC, but it's certainly better than the crap they serve in California.  And for Vegas, it's worth four stars.  Definitely should be tried, especially if you haven't had delicious Peruvian food.
