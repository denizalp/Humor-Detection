This is such a cute little place. I haven't been going out for desserts as much as but I wanted to try this out with my cousin. \n\nI like how they have all your favorite desserts in one place. There's ice cream with all sorts of flavors from strawberry to green tea. You can get it in a cup or cone or the coolest choice, a puff waffle! They have the standard drinks like smoothies, frappes, and etc. They also have a good selection of honey toast. Cookie ice cream sandwiches and even macarons! \n\nI ordered the fruity pebble puff and it was yummy! You can order the puff waffle soft or crispy. I prefer crispy! It's crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside. \n\nService is a big part of my reviews and the guy in the front is very accommodating and super nice. My cousin can't have milk so he suggested the matcha frappe. The matcha frappe was still creamy and tasty without the milk. When he gave me the puff waffle, he asked if it was good crispy. It was! \n\nI highly recommend it!
