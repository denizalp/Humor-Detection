I attended my first Vegas Streets Festival on March the 10th with a very good friend of mine and fellow Yelper Christie L. She was awesome at showing me around and introducing me at the yelp tent. While at the tent they had this awesome \"beer pong\" like game where you had to get the ball in the cup. Christie went first and had little luck. When it was my turn I was ready and quickly stepped up to the plate to show off my 3 point shooter lmao lol ok I suck at basketball so I have no clue how I managed to sink 2 balls in back to back. I walked away with these very awesome yelp balls and offered one up to my good friend as a token of appreciation for showing me the ropes. While at the street festival I absolutely needed to visit the funnel cake cafe as my pregnant wife had sent me on a mission to get her some funnel cake. We walked around a bit to check out the other trucks and to be completely honest I thought they all seemed a bit over priced. A food truck to me has always been a humbling place to pick up some \"homey\" food at a decent price. I always saw the food trucks more as roach coaches coming from the LA area and all but I would always get the best food there. Nowadays I felt as if the food trucks are moving to a gourmet type feel which is great an all but there also tagging along those gourmet prices. I finally got the funnel cake and my wife thought it was delicious and she appreciated that this festival was put together as it allowed her to satisfy her funnel cake craving!!!!
