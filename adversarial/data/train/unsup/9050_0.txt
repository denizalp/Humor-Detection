i had a great time seeing tiesto play here! i was literally up in front and even with a big crowd i did not feel cluster phobic  at all! the guards\/ bouncers were so funny! one of them said to me that he wished that we switched places! he wanted to join in on the fun too! the venue was pretty cool. nothing really special. \n\ni bought a souvenir cup drink and it was $37! OMG it was soo expensive! but it gave me a really good buzz throughout the whole time i was there. the reason for the 3 stars because there wasn't much seating space just to hang around and chill. venue was just okay. it wasn't as nice architecturally. just 2 big pools and some tables and a space to dance by the DJ.\n\nunlike encore beach club they have stripper poles in the middle of the pool which was really fun! they also have a lot of places to sit and the pools are much nicer!
