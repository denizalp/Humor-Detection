I have tried the pad thai both for delivery and at the restaurant. It had a very dry texture to it. Also, the hot and sour soup had a very distinct taste. Too many clashing ingredients were used which ruined the balance.\nAlthough it was a filling portion, I was not satisfied with the taste and texture that I had had else where. \nThis is my personal rating of the food there.\nIn conclusion, I would not recommend eating at this thai restaurant.
