The meal kicked off with a few of my favorite things:\n\n-Jar of pickles\n-Crusty french bread \n-Dijon mustard \n-Bottle of Malbec\n\nThings could only go uphill from there. And that they did. My fianc√© and I split a goat cheese salad to start. Crispy mesclun lettuce in a tangy vinaigrette, topped with four large slabs of creamy goat cheese. Let's GO. Next up were entrees - a perfectly cooked medium rare steak topped with garlic butter and served with a side of crispy fries and aioli for dipping. Let's keep going, shall we?  After that we enjoyed a bowl of meat, cheese and spinach filled ravioli topped in a rich and hearty mushroom sauce. Everything that we ate was beautifully presented and looked almost too perfect to eat. But, we did eat and finished every last drop of food on our plates.\n\nWant authentic French food while visiting Montreal? Want to feel like you are dining in Paris? Visit L'Express immediately. Just be sure to call ahead. We did not and were lucky to snag two of the last seats in the house (at the bar). The service is a little bit snooty, but the food was so good that they literally could have scowled at me all night and I wouldn't have cared. 5 stars and then some for L'Express.
