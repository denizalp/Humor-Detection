The front office woman was nice and seemed quite competent. I was seen quite quickly, but by a woman I never would have thought was a doctor. She was dressed in street clothes, with no white coat or even a name badge. I came in with animal bites, and she barely even looked at my hands. She observed me from a distance with her arms folded. Really?!? What the hell? She prescribed me an antibiotic and told me to look out for swelling and fever. Good thing 48 hours later I was able to have another doctor assess my injuries during a regularly scheduled appointment. If her bedside manner is typical for this location, find somewhere else to go.
