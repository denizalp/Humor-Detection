We travel a lot and have stayed at many hotels but none like this. We travel to Vegas every year for CES and normally stay in one of the larger casinos and hotels. Never again! Every aspect of Rumor was perfect. From the valet to check in staff to the room. The restaurant and bar staff were excellent even though there was a wedding in the grounds as well. I will absolutely stay here again and again and I absolutely would recommend this to everyone I know.
