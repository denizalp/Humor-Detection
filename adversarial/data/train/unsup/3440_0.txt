Too bad the minimum is one star. I would give this place none. The old country buffet is better than this place. There are no words to explain the poor quality of the food, the selection, the taste, the lay out, the setting.. everything is Lousy at best. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the server threw away my drink and my dessert because he decided that I was done when I was not even there for a long time.\n\nGuys really, if you are there abd you want to eat mc Donalds is better. If you want a buffet, go next door or walk a little..whatever you do love yourself enough not to eat this food.
