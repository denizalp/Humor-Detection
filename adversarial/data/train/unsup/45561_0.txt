I must admit I have not heard the best things about this place. Many people have advised I STAY AWAY! however my Mother has been DYING to try it since we live literally two minutes away and she loves breakfast food. We came on a Saturday night and it was not super slammed but it also wasn't empty. It was a nice mix of people. I immediately noticed their front case that has all these yummy desserts especially the tiny coconut\/banana and chocolate cr√®me pies.  Our waitress was prompt and friendly! she even gave me recommendations for what was good. I went with the Prime Rib Sandwich which I expected to be much thinner pieces of meat but it was basically Prime Rib on a roll with French fries and dipping sauce. I was not a huge fan of the roll and the meat was difficult to get in that fashion as it was such a thick piece of meat. I didn't care for it but the fries were good. I would definitely try something else next time around. The rest of my family all went with breakfast. The eggs seemed to be cooked really well but the other items were pretty burnt and the waffle was bland nothing special. Overall we got good service and for the price I enjoyed this place on level of like a Ihop or Dennys just much better Quality of service. Don't go here expecting to be Amazed but over all it is a acceptable place to try out they have good portion sizes and everyone seemed very friendly!
