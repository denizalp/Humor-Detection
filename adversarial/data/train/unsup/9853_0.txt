2.5 star (rounded up to 3 due to this place is relatively new)\n\nLiwan Kitchen is another Rice Roll, Congee and Casserole Rice Point joint that opens in the area.\n\nInterior is quite spacious as it used to be Congee King and Liwan just took over with minimum remodeling.\n\nCasserole Rice comes with a side soup and it takes 20 minutes prep time. Calling ahead is an option to minimize wait time.\n\nMushroom and Chicken Rice ($8.59) served in this cute one person portion hoyt pot. I hope you like rice as meat vs rice ratio is low. The pot did heat up quite well as there was a layer of crispy rice at the bottom. The soy sauce served on the side was room temperature. Chicken tasted bland and the rice lacked the infused flavours from the meat\/mushrooms. The soup that came complimentary though was not the double boiled soup that usually comes with competitors. \n\nRice Rolls at around $4 and up was so so. The wrapping itself was decent but the stuffed meat quality was poor. I might opt for the plain ones.\n\nBreakfast Specials till 11 am for $6.99 with a choice of rice roll\/noodle + Congee sounds like a decent deal.\n\nService is homey and welcoming. Might not be my first choice in the neighborhood but if you have the rice roll cravings, Liwan is not too bad.\n\n** MSG level Alert: HIGH **\nI did get extremely thirsty and dry mouth a hour or so after my dinner. Please be aware if you are allergic to MSG.
