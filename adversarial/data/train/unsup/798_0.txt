A small bar, if you're used to them...like me from DC and San Antonio.  Believe me, the gay bars in San Antonio are small!  So, I wasn't like WTF...kinda like a \"second home\" if you will.\n\nFor those of you who have read my reviews...know that I drink Long Island Tea and use that as a test if they do it well.  Well, I was disappointed.  I'm supposed to have a buzz before I even finish my first LIT.  After 2 LIT, no buzz.  Just give me water, honey.\n\nHowever, I didn't go there to get drunk.  Hung out with a couple of friends.  Checked out the guys that were eyeing us and of course, we were gossiping like the hens we are.  Checked out the dancers.  Am I getting old or are the dancers getting younger?  B-itch!   Maybe I should've had a third LIT.\n\nBTW, if you're a smoker and you've run out of cigarettes, just go to the bar and buy a pack.  I'm not sure if it applies to the entire state, but Phoenix and Scottsdale are smoke-free so you'll have to smoke outside.  BS has an enclosed patio for you to hang out.\n\nDecent little place.
