The food here is delicious!!!! Their service is fast when ordering take out and you can grab as much hot sauce as you would like. Roberto's is open 24 hours every day of the week so it's perfect after a night of partying or just to fulfill those late night cravings. I love their carne asada nachos, fries, and plates. The food at Roberto's is cheap and they give a generous portion of food so you'll definitely have leftovers.
