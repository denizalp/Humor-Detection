Out of town friends were staying at Red Rock Casino and we decided to have dinner here to avoid the buffet line, to try something different, and to pay with points which makes the cost of the meal half points on Senior Wednesdays in June.\n\nThere was no line when we arrived but there was a short wait while the hostess wrote up a take out order.  We were shown to a table along the back wall.  This was the beginning of very pleasant and good service!\n\nI ordered an iced tea, mochiko chicken for an appetizer, and the spicy shrimp noodle bowl for my main course.  The portion size for both dishes was large.  It would have been good to share the chicken with someone.  My only problem here was the sticky garlic chicken sauce they put on the fried chicken oysters.  The menu had it right there but I didn't think it would be almost like sweet and sour chicken rather than mochiko. Putting aside the sweetness of the sauce, the chicken and the dish was good.  The sauce just detracted a bit.  Another time, I'd ask for the sauce on the side.\n\nThe spicy shrimp noodles were good.  There was a good number of shrimp.  The thing with this dish was it didn't live up to its name.  The shrimp were not spicy. There were three containers of spice on the table and I use them, plus some soy and chili oil to give the dish some zing.  Spicy should be spicy.\n\nMy iced tea was refilled without having to ask and our server stopped by a few times to see how things were.  \n\nI will return for the 1\/2 price point days.  Other than that, except for the convenience of being so close to home, it would be better to go to Chinatown and get noodle dishes there.
