This company has THE worst customer service I have ever experienced, hands down, in over 45 years.  I ordered a system on 11\/3, they sent the wrong unit.  It has been OVER a month and I still do not have the correct unit.  I have spent over 6 hours on hold over the past month trying to get this resolved with NO luck.  These people are idiots, their customer service sucks, and I can't review their product BECAUSE I STILL DON'T HAVE IT.  They took my money, have my equipment, and I have nothing but hours and hours and hours on hold.  After reading the other endless reviews, I have a feeling the product is as horrible as their customer service.  I would love to return everything and get a refund, but I can't get a person on the phone.  Don't EVER buy from this company.
