RIP, Mr. Wax.\nI read in New Times that Dennis, the long time owner of Tracks in Wax, recently passed.\nFor now, the plan is the store will go on without him.\nI'm quietly optimistic - but will miss his sense of humor and encyclopaedic music knowledge.\n\nLast time I was in with a girlfriend, we ended up wrestling over Sisters Of Mercy's \"First and Last and Always.\"  She won, but promised me visitation rights.  (Bitch doesn't even have a record player!!)  Sorry, I digress.\n\nI walked out with (get your collective geek squeals in unison) the original 2 record set of the radio broadcast of Orson Welles' \"War of the Worlds.\"\nGranted, it's not music - but SQUEE!  I can't wait to play it on a dark and stormy night!  It was a geektacular moment in my life, to be sure!\n\nSelection is solid - but keeping in mind it's used music - what's hard to find is still hard to find.  Dennis told me he coulnd't keep Leonard Cohen or Tom Waits in stock no matter how much he brought in.\nDamn other record collectors that get there wanting the same things I do!\n\nI really hope Tracks in Wax continues - it's a special and magical place.
