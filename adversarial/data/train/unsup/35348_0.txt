South Asia Malaysian Cuisine is middle of the road.  Literally.  When you go to the plaza, it's smack dab in the middle. \n\nTheir location is incredibly apropos to the food, mostly starring sambal and curry dishes.  The lunch sets are very reasonably priced, and ~$9 will get you a curry and rice.  The hubs and I always go for the beef brisket curry, which is a thick dark yellow curry with stewed beef brisket and potato chunks, plus a dish of sambal shrimp with some onion slices mixed together.  Tom yum gong soup is on the watery side, spiked with a few mushroom slices and tomato cubes.  A set dinner for two (your choice of two entrees from a list, two carb servings of choice - you'll need to pay extra for chicken oil rice, coconut rice, or roti - plus two desserts, usually of the Chinese warm sweets variety) is priced at $30.\n\nI think I'm mostly just disappointed because they used really generous with their spices and coconut milk at their old location years ago, but having changed chefs together with inflation of ingredient costs has hit them hard.  Roti is rather expensive at $3 for a small serving the size of an tea plate.\n\nAll in all, I'd come here to grab a simple and quick meal, but not to particularly savour the cuisine.\n\nImportant to note: This place is cash only!
