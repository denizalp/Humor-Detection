Great food! Not too busy yet, but am sure once more people discover it, that won't be the case. Oh, and make sure you aren't in a hurry. There is only father and son running the entire place, so be patient!\nKahlua pig was perfect (not too salty like most places) and Mac salad is the best I've ever had. Put this place on your to-do list! :)
