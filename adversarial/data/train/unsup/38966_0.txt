The chicken and waffles are fantastic!  The shrimp cocktail is a lovely amalgam of flavours, including pickled cucumber and a louie sauce in addition to cocktail sauce.  The service is phenomenal, especially Autumn (she is the best!).  The pomegranate iced tea is delightful and refreshing on a warm summer's day, and the bottomless mimosas are a great addition.\n\n\nIn an effort to keep an open internet I've decided to sign my name to all my reviews.\n\nBest,\n\nAdam Koppekin
