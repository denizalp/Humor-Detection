I have rented pa systems in the past from these guys in the past and my biggest issue had been the extra long process it takes to actually get your equipment once you are at Empirical. Today I called to inquire regarding rent a pa system again. I called and told the person on the phone that I was interested in renting a pa system. To which I was returned a barrage of rude replies. This guy acted as if he was doing me a favor and letting me spend my hard earned money. I would not recommend using any of their services. The prices to buy equipment is sky high, they  take  months to complete simple repairs. Instead of renting from them I am going to buy a pa system. Do not spend your money at an establishment that doesn't respect and value their customers!
