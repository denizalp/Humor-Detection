Dr. Richard Lieber is fantastic and my review has nothing to do with him. As was mentioned by a few other people, his office staff is a disaster, totally incompetent and ridiculously unreliable. I had an appointment scheduled for several days ago which I had made 6 months in advance. When I showed up and signed in, the woman at the front desk said she was sorry but Dr Lieber was not in and that he was out on some kind of emergency leave. She said I should have been called and told about this but I assured her that I had not been called. She was actually very nice and tried to be helpful, but it was obvious that she was frustrated by their incompetent office management. She tried to get me another appointment but the soonest they had available was about 3 months from then. The normal wait is usually about 2 months and yet UMC is still allowing new patients to sign up with Dr Lieber. Why ? He clearly has too many patients already. Next we discussed whether I had any prescriptions that were expiring and needed to be re-written. I had one and she took all that info and said they would submit it to Dr Lieber and then call me when he had re-written it. A few days passed and I had heard nothing so I went back to the office and talked to the same woman about my prescription. She had no real answer so she got Dr Lieber's nurse to talk to me. They said they would take care of it and call me when it had been re-written. A few more days have now passed and I am still waiting for that phone call. Fortunately this medication is not absolutely essential to my continued existence, but if it were, I would be in big trouble ! Despite Dr Lieber being a great doc and a great guy, DO NOT make the mistake of choosing anyone in this office as your primary care doctor !
