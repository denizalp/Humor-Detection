I really like this einsteins. The people don't act like they're pained to work here. I live at Gilbert and baseline but I'm done going to that location. They're messed up my sandwich the last two times, and all seem miserable. At this location, Moses is wonderful. He's made my sandwich both times I've been here, it's been right, and he has some personality and a smile-even at 5:45 am. Nice guy.
