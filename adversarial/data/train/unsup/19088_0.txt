Never again! My promoter assured me and my friend, another female that we would be able to get into the club with no problems if we arrived around ten. We did and the guest list bitches gave us general admission passes instead of the slip of paper needed to gain access to this club for free. The line did not seem long so we decided to wait, no one was moving from our line for an hour and the host walking the line assured us he was going to get us in. Scores of girls in their \"Vegas Whore\"  dresses walked by us with slips of paper. We were wearing said dresses as well,but obviously we were in the wrong line. 12:00 a.m. came and went so we decided to just jump the line while the bouncers were not looking and went up to the cashier, they wanted money even though we had passes, conveniently they expire at midnight.. We went back up to the guest list bitches and host asshole, who promptly told us it was too late to get that little white slip of paper so we could get in free, to which I promptly screamed at the top of my lungs that this club sucked anyway and I would never come back and spend my money here. The music I heard while waiting sucked and the crowd was full of Jersey Whoreish douchbags both male and female. The bouncers had tremendous attitude for being short and ugly and probably have small pee pee's too. Fuck this place, I would never spend a dime here or recommend that anyone go here ever...
