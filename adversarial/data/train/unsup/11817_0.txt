This place is my on my must visit list, when I am in the Yorkville area. \n\nI especially love the fact that desserts are soo good. It's located in Yorkville just behind Cumberland Terrace. \n\nThe store offers a selection cookies, chocolates, ice cream, and other baked goods. If you ever get a chance, do try try the mousse and her ice cream.\n\nMy favourite:\nStrawberry & White chocolate mousse\nCinnamon cappucino cookies\nher red velvet cupcake \nApple pie\n\nMandy (the owner) usually switches the stuff in the freezer, to whatever she feels like, which more or less makes any visit a treat and i never get the same thing twice. Except for her mousse cups... I can't get enough of them
