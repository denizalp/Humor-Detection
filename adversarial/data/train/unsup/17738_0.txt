A very very different take on burgers and bar food!\n\nI heard a lot about this place, but being from the bay area back in CA, I don't visit Vegas often to check out most of these places. Asking my local friends about where to eat, they all recommended this one. Theres another location in LV, but this was closer to our destination. I think it was a weekend, so we had to wait about 45~ minutes. I wished there was a bigger waiting area, its only a little nook near the entrance.\n\nOnce seated, we were assisted right away, which is a plus in my book. We decided to check out some of the fries as appetizers. Specifically, we got an order of Ox Tail Fries and Truffle Parmesan. The Truffle Parm fries were good, but if you needed to try something, you gotta go for the Ox Tail ones. Imagine chili cheese fries, but super duper upscaled. The meat is super tender. I'd probably get an order to myself when I go again!\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Miyagi Sans Burger. Its like an upscaled version of a western cheeseburger. Grassfed Beef, onion rings, and an egg! It was sooooooo good. They have a lengthy menu, that I would love to try more and more.\n\nDefinitely check them out! Theres a burger for anyone!
