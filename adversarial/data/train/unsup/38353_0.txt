Don't go after dark if you have trouble reading in low light.  The place is as dim as a dive bar.  I asked to have the lights turned up & was told the lighting is corporate controlled.   She brought me two \"candles\" to read by. \n\nThe food was good but more expensive than it was worth.  I went home & made a plate of food.  \n\nI might go back some day, but only during the day.
