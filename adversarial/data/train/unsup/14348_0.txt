A Christmas dinner is not like any other meal. So when my friends suggested Orange Sky I was beyond excited! The ride up to the restaurant was fun in itself. The elevator with an open view to the mountains was breathtaking, but alas, too short.\n\nWe arrived a early for our reservations, so we made friends with a Richard at the bar. Although already helping a number of guests he was eager to attend to our needs. A visit to Orange Sky really could be complete with someone like Richard. Such a gem! Well versed in his product line and so, so polite! \n\nNote: There are *two* bar areas at Orange Sky. There is the large area when you step off the elevator. There is also an indoor bar, which is in the main dining area. The interior bar seems suited for eating a quick nibble too.\n\nOnce seated in our deluxe VIP western facing booths, our party was in heaven. The booths are incredibly high and offer the utmost privacy. You could seat three average sized adults in the booth. Additionally, a seat could be placed at each end of the table. I'd stick with three\/four adults however. (Two for romance, Four for fun, Five for late night.)\n\nFood wise?\nEr. Ma. Gawd. \nThat's pretty much it. I stuck with the Holiday Menu and ate so much it hurt (later). Yes, that's what happened. I admit it! My eyeballs were filled to the rims with what was on the plate and I ate. Four courses later I wheeled myself out on my knee scooter. A much happier, fuller, person.\n\nI highly recommend trying the Lobster Bisque soup. Not only for the exquisite presentation, the lobster was beautifully laid at the bottom of the plate prior to the bisque being poured, but for the richness of what my palate discovered. YUM! (Ate it all.)\n\nThe Bib & Point Reyes Blue Salad, with walnuts, pears, pancetta and dried cranberries was an enormous presentation. Light as air dressing included blue cheese (that was a surprise!). (Ate it all.)\n\nBy the time my main entree arrived I was stuffed. But, have no fear, I welcomed Mediterranean Bass like there was no tomorrow. When something is stuffed with crab meat and the hollandaise is so light, well, you make do. (Ate it all.)\n\nDessert was a blur. Eggnog was involved. (Ate it all.)\n\nOur seats afforded the most wonderful views of Phoenix I've had to date. The food was amazing. Exploring the outdoor patio was fun. I can't wait to come back to enjoy drinks another time!\n\nFour Stars: Only per a hiccup noted with the downstairs check-in. I've reached out to the restaurant. \n\nThis place is stellar!\n\nUpdated: Oops! Forgot to mention our bomb diggity server Nicole S. She reached out to me. She's super chipper and really knows the menu well! You'll love her too!
