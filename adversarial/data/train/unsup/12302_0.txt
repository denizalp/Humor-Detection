New ownership prompted a revisit to Rolling in Dough, now marketed as a cafe rather than a bakery! The lunch specials seem to be their forte these days, with a decadent burger and a warming grilled cheese-tomato bisque combo. \n\nThey still have a case full of baked goods and most are done fairly well but I'd stick to the dessert items over pastries such as croissants and danishes that have seemed less than fresh on a couple of visits. I've also been underwhelmed by lattes here- staff have seemed confused about how to make their specialty drinks, so that's an area to improve upon. Stick to actual food items here for best experience. \n\nExterior signage states that they now offer a wine bar menu- may revisit to check that out with friends, but for now I'll stick to lunches. Next on my list is the BLT with pimiento cheese!
