So nice to have a good Italian restaurant in the area.  Staff is friendly and the Chef was helping out in the restaurant to make sure things were going well and helping to serve and clear tables at times when he left the kitchen.  We were able to talk with him for a few seconds and he really wants to know what you think.  We found out the everything but the bread is made in house.  Coming soon, Bar LeoGreat in the space next door after renovations that will be connected to the restaurant.\nWe started with the Greens and Beans which were very tasty and cooked perfectly.  Really enjoyed the sausage.  My Linguini Carbonara was very good and a good sized portion.  We split a couple of the homemade deserts, a flourless chocolate cake was superb and the coconut pie was good but the crust was probably a bit to thick for the delicate pie.
