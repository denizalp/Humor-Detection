Unique spin on Mexico flavors and some evil good jerk wigs.  Now that their new location is open, they've had some typical growing pains learning to service a full dinning room (they previously only had 4-5 tables and a patio), but I expect it to pick up.\n\nThe expanded menu at the new location is a great blend of cheap eats (taco's etc.) and unique finds (goat curry).  Be sure to make a reservation as it gets packed and BYOB, so bring along a few of your favorite brews.
