Best Breakfast in Pittsburgh!  I am not generally a fan of breakfast sandwiches\/bagels\/croissants, but I just had the most perfectly done bacon, egg and cheese bagelwich!  I wish I could do it justice in my description, but I'll just say the bacon was crisp, the eggs were perfect and the taste was delightful.  Oh, and the 2nd best part?  My bagelwich plus 2 diet coke cans was $5.51!!!  Where in the world can you find a bargain like that for breakfast without it tasting like river swill?  (That was rhetorical, good reader)\n\nSticking around for the Burger Special for Lunch whilst I type away on my laptop getting through a Friday \"office day\" of work.
