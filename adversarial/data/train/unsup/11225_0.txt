I came here on a Tuesday night with a few other Yelpers.  The place wasn't very busy but there was a decent amount of people there.  We sat at the bar, the bartender asked for our order. I asked if they had any amber beers and was told no and was handed a beer menu.  For being an Irish pub, I was very disappointed with the selection of beers, with most of them being domestic.  I choose a Stella and it was not very cold. It looked as though they were having issues with their beer cooler, foam everywhere being dumped into buckets. \n\nNot sure what happened after we ordered but trying to get a bartenders attention after this point was nearly impossible. They asked everyone around us if they were good or needed something else. I actually had to wave my hand in the bartenders face to get his attention and he was standing right in front of us making a drink. \n\nAt this point I do not plan on returning here.  There are plenty of other places I can get a cold beer and much better service.
