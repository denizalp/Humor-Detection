We had an awesome rate because MGM was a Yelp Spring Break partner.  From the moment we pulled up to the moment we pulled away, we were treated like VIPs the entire time.  First off, updated rooms.  LOVE!  Flat screen TV, lovely decor, comfortable beds, and most importantly QUIET.  For whatever reason, the MGM rooms were quieter than those I've stayed in at the Bellagio.  \n\nSecondly, we were treated to complimentary Veuve Clicquot champagne and sweets.  Yes, please!  Thirdly, every time we contacted the concierge, bell or front desks, we were treated with respect and the utmost hospitality.  Any questions or problems we had were addressed immediately.  We were even able to procure some photos for the Yelp Goose Chase Scavenger Hunt just by asking.  We had a few days to relax and even venture to the pool which was excellent.  I was sad that I didn't get to go to Wet Republic though.  I did hear from someone that the admission is waived for hotel guests but I don't know if that's true or not since it's normally $25.  Thanks so much to the staff at the MGM Grand for treating us so well.  I'll be sure to stay there again next time I'm looking for a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.
