If you bring your walking shoes and have 2-3 hours to spend you can get a complete look at just about everything. I can't do it without a stop in the cafe for a rest and a bite to eat, usually the Swedish meatballs, that won't break the bank. Then I'm good to go to make it through the rest of the place.\n\nOne of my favorite things is the small apartment they have set up that doesn't feel anything like the size they say it is. It's so well organized that it feels much bigger than it is. If only someone could come to my house and give it an Ikea makeover! Hmm, I think I see a side business for them to get into!\n\nNow if only they'd build one in the Triangle area so I wouldn't have to truck all the way from Durham! Yep, I'd be in heaven then for sure!
