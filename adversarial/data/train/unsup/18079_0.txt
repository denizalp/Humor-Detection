Jeez- why did this place have to move from the older location?  The quality of the food has gone south big time! The tortilla chips with the chips and salsa were all broken into small pieces. The margarita on the rocks was ALL sweet mixer and very little tequila. The red chili beef is now very greasy- total let down. My wife had the pork carnitas burro- the pork was SO dry and bland. What happened??? Seems like they became too popular too quickly at the new location and the quality control is gone. Extremely disappointed and sad. Doubt we will return.
