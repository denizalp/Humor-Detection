A view of the strip, rivaled by none, awaits all who enter Mix. Forget the Stratosphere, forget all the other towering hotels, the view is breathtaking. \n\n1\/27\/11, My sister was turning 21 and ready to go to a club. I hadn't been to Mix, so we, along with two friends, decided to go there. Fast forward to 11 PM. After waiting absolutely no time, we got into the elevator, after I almost face planted my way in. Watch your step, the elevator is not flush with the floor, so be cautioned so you don't end up stubbing your toe then propelling into the elevator. \n\nUp, up, up we went. A bunch of guys from Kitchener, probably in their mid to late 30's were chatting. I said, \"So you guys from Ontario?\" They said yes and asked if I was as well, especially since I knew about Kitchener. Nope. I just know famous cities.\n\nAfter getting out of the elevator... crickets... and old people. I'm talking a table of 80-somethings on the balcony. WHAT WAS THIS? A small round dance floor in the corner with not a single soul gracing it. A long row of tables. A KITCHEN? What else? Oh yeah, Warren G. was blasting.  We stayed maybe 15-20 minutes.\n\nThe music was great, the view was great, but the crowd was a bust. I had no idea this place was a restaurant. It's very misleading that they advertise this as a dance club - it's not. The music was so good that it got 2 stars and an extra star for the view. \n\nWill I be back - probably not, especially if I'm looking to dance or see somebody under the age of 40.
