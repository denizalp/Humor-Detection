Small cozy joint.... great coffee... friendly servers....simple menu. \nAnother Triple D find worth going to...... I am finding Guy F. loves Arizona... after spending a week here I can see why.. tons of good eats super little time! Got here after the business people but before the slacker crowd (back home that means somewhere between 8:30 and 9 AM). So we had no wait....\n\nI got the five spot which totally kept me full for hours...that and the three cups of local coffee... The peppery bacon this joint uses is to die for...My five spot: The sweet onions, the bun, the bacon and the perfectly cooked eggs.... solid breakfast. I had a taste of Julie K's griddlecakes and they were yummy. \n\nI appreciate simplicity and this place has some basics on the menu but do them well. Reasonably priced menu... I highly recommend :-).\n\nFew things\n1. BRING QUARTERS ....  lots of places to park but it is metered parking\n2. come early and make sure EVERYONE in your party is there\n3. Bathroom is next door (TALK TO MIKEY.. he is a very wise and amazing person)
