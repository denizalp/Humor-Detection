This is my favorite chain of breakfast restaurants in the city.  Fair pricing, friendly staff, super yummy fare w\/side options generally given of fruit or seasoned fries.  You may also ask for their delicious banana bread, served warm..add butter and dive in.  My personal favorite is the Spinach Benny followed by the Fender Bender (Sahara location). Each location, however has a slightly varied menu. I love a glass of grapefruit juice on the side as well. ($3.25.)  Open 'till 3pm.
