I'm definitely queen of the mom and pops and hole-on-the-walls and well let's be honest, pretty much food in general. This place may get lost in sight and not too easy on the eyes but is what I look forward to after a long day at work. The food is terrible for my heart and arteries, but just oh so comforting. I've loved everything I've gotten here from the Seafood Platters to the Fried Chicken and even a simple, Cheeseburger with Fries. I do try to stay away as much as possible for purpose of attempting to be healthy, but that just leads to withdrawal and grumpiness. Also, this place is within minutes of my place....
