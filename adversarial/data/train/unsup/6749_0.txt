Because it's a 1 star rate, it's actual a Big FAT ZERO Star.\n\nWhy?\n\nI decide to bring my client I thought it was a nice place. it looked nice to have lunch around noon. \n\nIt being my first time visiting for both of us, and the outside was nice and such.\n\nI place my order and waiting on my order. I was enjoying my salad and having a good conversation.\n\nI saw my order coming. i ate my small side. the discussions part was, I took a bite out of my sandwich. I noticed human hair in my food, it was gross and I immediately lost my apatite. The sight that kind of questions your decision on coming back and my thought ran through my mind. I felt I shouldn't invited my friends and family to this place if they can't manage the clean food.\n\nFound human hair in my food.
