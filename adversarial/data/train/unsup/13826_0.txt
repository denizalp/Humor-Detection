Lunch yesterday was a stop at Taco Tijuana.  The service is great.  The chef offered Eric R. a sample of the adobada.  He explained what everything was.  Eric R. ordered a mula with flour tortillas and suadero, and a cabeza taco.  The mula is like a tortilla sandwich with cheese and meat, so a deconstructed quesadilla of sorts, and comes with choice or corn or flour tortillas.\n\nI ordered a lengua taco and a lengua sope.  The sope is like a corn cake that is stuffed with the meat, and here topped with a crispy corn chip.  The chef insisted we take an adobado taco con pina on the house, which was very nice but he did that only after I told him I do not eat pork.  Eric R. ate it.\n\nThere are radishes and limes but no salsa bar.  The lengua was delicious.  I have a hard time disliking any lengua taco in general, and this was very tasty.  The sope was great too - for me it was a fork-and-knife situation because it was very thick but too wide to lift up and bite.  Eric R. enjoyed his cabeza (\"tastes like suadero\" he said) and his mula.  He was so full but ate the adobada too.\n\nWe were only there for like 15 minutes but we smelled like burnt meat the rest of the day.  It was in my hair and my clothes, and same with my hubs - it was like we went to a local casino and smelled like smoke in a way.  Because of this affliction and the lack of a salsa bar, I knocked off a star.  Good food and great service, so enjoy!
