The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars is because if the help that I did finally receive when all was said and done.. I asked a question around 6 pm to the shorter gentleman ( under 5'11) with the beard (not the cashier).. I asked him where the toe warmers were and he rudely informed me he could not help me because he was waiting on someone else he was helping. Mind you I did not see any one near him. \n\nInstead of him being polite about the situation he was very rude.. I couldn't even say anything I just had to walk away.. It's not what he said, it's how he said it.. And on top of that he could have either pointed me to the right direction or have me to another associate.. I'm done.. Smh
