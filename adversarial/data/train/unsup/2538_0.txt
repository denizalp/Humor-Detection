Just got back from a Magenta Photo shoot with my niece. Oh boy it was expensive.\n\nHere's what I think. If you're doing with a loved one, you would enjoy it. It certainly is a bonding experience - the photographer asked us to laugh, touch our noses, tickle each other, play with the bubbles and all other poses. You get to be a celebrity for a day. \n\nIt was fun. But it put a hole i your pocket. I paid almost $400 for 9 photos of 8x10. My niece screamed when she learned how much those pictures worth and wanted me to return them in exchange for an iPod. \n\nWell too late. \n\nBut the entire experience was pleasant. I am giving this store a rating of four for giving us an excellent customer experience. The facility was clean. And the photographer was suuuper nice. \n\nSo I paid almost $400 for three reasons; \n1.) The entire experience was pleasant - I wanted to preserve them\n2.) The photos were great \n3.) The photographer was super nice \n\nWas it worth it? No. Some photographers may do a better job for the price that we paid. \n\nBUT, you can just purchase 5 photos (poses) and pay over $200. It'll give you the same experience, the same level of service and 5 preserved memories. \n\nThen it's worth it.
