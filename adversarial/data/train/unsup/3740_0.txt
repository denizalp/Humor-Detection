Simple, yet to the point kind of gym!! \nGreat front desk, staff is always there and ready for check-in.\nThis place is always clean and well stocked, it also has a good selection of work-out equipment, inexpensive membership and its open twenty-four-seven, for those late night gym junkies!! :) Not much more I can say, only four stars for lack of pool!! :)
