We were seated at the worst table in the restaurant (up next to the glass partition to the kitchen and next to the waiters' service area) even though we had reservations and there were many unoccupied tables when we got there.  I guess my husband didn't tip the Maitre d' enough.  The prime rib was OK - somewhat flavorless and chewy.  The scalloped potatoes were delicious. We decided to share the creme brulee for dessert.  It was beautifully presented with a sugar dome and berries but light on creme brulee.  I would suggest ordering one for each person.  The service was awesome!  All in all, a mixed bag.
