This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas having stayed here four times previously . The new Venezia tower suites are excellent though it can be confusing getting to the tower since you have to take an elevator to the 15th floor to enter the Venezia and it can get perplexing  especially if you have been playing all night long and your brain is malfunctioning. The outdoor courtyard and the pool at the Venezia exude a certain feeling of tranquility helping absolve your mind of the huge losses you sustained at the tables. Venetian is the worst casino to gamble at because,apparently I win money everywhere else and lose it all at  the Venetian. I swear they have those roulette tables fixed.
