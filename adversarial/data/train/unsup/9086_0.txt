Even after making an appointment, they left me waiting for TWO HOURS before I was attended to by my stylist.  Instead of being honest and apologetic about the ridiculous wait, everyone averted eye contact and ignored me which of course made me all the more annoyed.  \n\nI was finally seen by some stylist (can't remember his  name) who did a mediocre job.   While paying I requested to see the manager and asked what he was planning on doing to address the poor service.  He begrudgingly gave a whopping 10% discount and acted as if he was doing me a favour.  Pretty brutal.
