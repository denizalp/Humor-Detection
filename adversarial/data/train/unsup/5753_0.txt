Yay for a fun southern menu! and a really good one as well!\nI had the Catfish po-boy and that is what I would get again if I went back. Our service was great and they mentioned wed nights are the best time to go.....deals on their fried chicken I guess. Our table ordered shrimp and grits, fried chicken, and the ribeye....everyone's plates were cleared. I really liked this place! We did get the pimento cheese dip which we thought was just OK----but as for everything else, 4 stars!
