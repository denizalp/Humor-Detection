I am extremely lactose intolerant and completely cut dairy out of my diet over a year ago. I was excited to try this place out because a friend told me it was delicious and beforehand, I looked their menu up online and saw they had \"soy\" ice cream. I was stoked to try it because I have a very hard time finding ice cream that is good and also dairy-free.   When I got to the counter to order I double checked with the guy that it FOR SURE does not have any dairy in it, he reassured me saying it is soy based. If it had dairy in it, I would have not gotten anything!!!  \nNo wonder it tasted so good!!! This ice cream definitely had dairy in it , I got extremely sick from this place!!!  Beware to all my vegan friends out there and lactose intolerant brothers and sister! DONT DO IT
