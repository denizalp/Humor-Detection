I have been to many hakka places in Scarborough and this is one of my favourite hakka places. We usually get the Hakka Chicken or The House special chicken, simply yummy, chicken is nice and moist and very tasty. We get the chili chicken and tandoori chicken both have perfect flavours and very delicious. The Chicken manchurian soup is one the best I have ever had. The owner is very friendly and nice, small family run business. They are always open to feedback and accept it very positively. It is a simple hakka place not too fancy in looks, but the food is amazing.It is quite busy on weekdays during lunch time.
