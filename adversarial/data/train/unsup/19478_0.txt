LOVE LOVE LOVE. Campechano is a hip Mexican sit down restaurant that serves a selection of tacos. I got the Carnitas and Tinga de Pollo for $5 each and we also shared guacamole ($7) with the complimentary chips appetizer.\n\nCampechano Taqueria appears very modest from the outside, and it's fairly easy to miss it, but definitely a place to try for locals. I came here during lunch and although there's not many spots to sit, I didn't see anyone needing to wait at the doors. Sometimes, you may be seated at large picnic tables, of which, you may have the chance to share this with another party. The environment is hip, with fiesta music, casual and lively. If you don't have space to put your coats, they have coat hangers located next to your seats, so you won't have to worry about needing to hold your stuff while you're enjoying your tacos. \n\nThe chips came in a cute blue mug and there was a ton of non-salty but seasoned guac on the side. The tacos are slightly spicy, but down-diggity delicious. A soft shelled taco wrapped with meat, veggies and drizzled in delicious sauce. The sauce is rather viscous, so for the most part, this was one of the cleanest tacos I've ever had. I highly recommend the Carnitas. The Tina de Pollo wasn't a favourite of mine, but it was still delicious! I recommend ordering two tacos without the guac, or just one taco with the guac because it can get super filling!!
