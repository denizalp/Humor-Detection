It's probably unfair for me to rate a restaurant based on a simple breakfast,  but I was really into this meal. My body was needing eggs and toast to soak up the previous evening's whiskey consumption.\n\nMy boyfriend and I woke up in the morning and  worked up an appetite.  I was really in the mood for a breakfast sausage, and he made that happen. \n\nWe both had eggs over medium with chicken sausage, hash browns,  and toast.  The eggs were more over easy, but oh well. The potatoes were crispy and the sausage was the second best sausage i'd had that day...how can a girl complain?
