A quick note to start: Within one week of Bill Hicks opening, I was a regular. The energy in this place is similar to the hold that crack had on our former mayor (and in the best way possible)! \n\nCheap booze. Sandwiches from Rashers a couple doors down. Free poured mixed drinks and the occasional welcome shot poured out by the owner Teddy. They even have a doorman with the greatest handlebar moustache of all time. If that isn't enough to get you in the door, I don't know what is. \n\nAs great as all of that sounds (it does, right?!?!) it is actually the people that keep bringing me back. This is one of the only bars that I can stop in at lone-ranger style and GUARANTEED I will leave with a new friend (or occasionally more, if ya know what I mean). It's just a friendly group, curated and fostered by Teddy. It feels like a family party night every time I step foot into this candle-lit treat. \n\nMy closing line: Do yourself a favour and experience this. No matter whether you are a married couple in the area with a couple knuckleheads who have a sitter, an industry worker looking to blow off steam, or just looking for a night out with a great group of guys\/girls... Bill Hicks WILL deliver one helluva night.
