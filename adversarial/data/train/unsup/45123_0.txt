My originall review was about 4 years ago. Since then this location has a new crew, updated look, and everyone i deal with at this location is extremely pleasant. im not being served fries that have been thrown back into a fryer to reheat them. all my food is fresh, especially the burgers. Been going here the past year and half, what huge changes this location has seen.
