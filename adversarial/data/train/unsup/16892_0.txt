Our most excellent neighbors, Music Saves is a great little record store run by stellar people!\n\nMy first trip in was total disappointment. I was looking for Murder City Devils (it was just that kind of day) and they had none. I was bummed. But they have since turned me on to a few bands that I can't imagine I ever lived without (Parts & Labor!!!) and become great friends. \n\nMusic Saves: Just like that record store in \"High Fidelity\", only with more beard and boobs.
