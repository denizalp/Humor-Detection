First off.. I had originally got a quote from Konami Moving & Storage, but all the paperwork says Executive Moving & Storage. Read contract very carefully. They have 30 days(business days)to deliver your stuff. The guy who picked up my stuff advised me to go 10 days before the date you actually want your stuff. So I listed my first available day for delivery on 4\/9\/18, as I wanted my stuff on 4\/19\/18. However, I didn't receive my stuff until 5\/10\/18. So I slept on an air mattress for 3 weeks. The customer service NEVER calls you back. And when the driver left 2 days later than I was told no one ever communicated that to me. I called to get status on the driver's delivery date and that's when I was told. The reason why so late was because they will wait until they have many, many deliveries to the same area to save themselves money.(they had 11 deliveries to Texas on the same truck) I paid over $4,800.00 dollars. Then when my stuff was finally delivered they had broken my TV Stand, broke my floor lamp, scratched all 6 of my dining room chairs, bent my patio table & poked a hole in my couch. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY!!!
