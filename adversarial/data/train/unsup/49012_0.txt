A definite must. Great bibimbap and even better atmosphere. We showed up 30 min before close and they didn't even bat an eye, just rolled out the cart and got to cooking right in front of us. We did the bulgogi table side, which did not disappoint. The kimchi was great, and the pickled beans and tofu were a tasty surprise. We will definitely be back!
