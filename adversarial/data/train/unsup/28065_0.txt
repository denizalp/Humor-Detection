While staying in downtown Pittsburgh we saw No 1 Sushi across the Marketplace.  It is a little hole in the wall and seems to do mostly takeout.  My wife and I were looking for vegetarian cut rolls and there are more choices here than any of the restaurants we regularly visit back in Southern California.  They are fast and the prices are extremely reasonable.  The Kampyo was very good.  The Avocado was just right.  One of the vegetable combination rolls comes with seaweed salad wrapped around it.  A must have if you are a vegetarian.  They even have Oshinko though it was not as outstanding as the rest.  We ordered lunch for 2 (with almost all the vegetarian choices) for under $30 and had enough left to take to the airport and eat as our dinner for our flight home.  In California it would have been $50 and nowhere near as tasty.  My goal is now to get our favorite Sushi place in California to add the Seaweed outer option to their vegetable combo roll.
