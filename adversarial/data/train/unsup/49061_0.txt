When it was time to buy a new dishwasher, I first checked out the discounters, Lowe's and Home Depot, and did not think their prices were that great.  I then went to Sears & found the same model for quite a bit less.  Sears had no problem getting it in the color I wanted, and was able to schedule delivery and installation the very same week.  The installer they sent out was great--he was on-time and then in & out in 30 minutes flat, cleaning up after himself, taking the old machine with him.
