State Street Brats was a fun stop last weekend, but the food was just mediocre. When I went to Madison many years ago & it was \"The Brat Haus,\" the food & brats were way better! I do have to admit the new version has some pluses, but the old place rocked.\n\nAs for service, it was just o.k. this weekend. I saw many lines this weekend, but none at this place & I definitely would not wait in a line to get in there.
