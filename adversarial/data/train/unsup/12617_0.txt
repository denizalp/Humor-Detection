I'm not vegan, so when I was about to put the Mocha Latte cupcake from Treehouse Bakery into my mouth the first time, I didn't know what to expect. To my delight, I loved it! The cake was moist and the frosting was just the right texture. Together they made a great combination of flavors.\n\nI decided to try a few other things and they were all great. Out of the cookies, I think the peanut butter cookies are my favorite.\n\nTreehouse Bakery = Scrumtrulescently delicious cupcakes, cookies, muffins, and cheesecake that will leave your mouth happy!
