I visited this location for about an hour on 2 different days - once for frame selection and once to see if they worked thru my insurance issues: both instances I received and witness exceptional customer service by Clara. She went above and beyond calling my insurance company a couple times to get things straight. They also have a HUGE selection of frames - many very reasonably priced. I will be back!
