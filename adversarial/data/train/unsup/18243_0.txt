The 2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge:     6\/100 \n\nRecently went to this pizza joint just before shopping at Belz, the South Premium Outlets. When I walked in, I didn't feel like I was in Vegas. It felt like a mom and pop pizza joint on the east coast. I liked the homey vibe and decor.\n\nFew things about this place: \n- walk up and order at the counter.\n- they have pizzas already made, order by slice -- they heat it up in the oven before serving it to you.\n- option to order a whole pie, but it would be a bit of a wait. \n- all you can eat option, $9.99 \n- punch card for single slices \n\nOrdered the Meat Pie by the slice, filled with toppings top to bottom. Layered with pepperoni, sausage, ham, meatball, topped w\/ mozzarella & bacon. It's a thick & hearty slice, could easily get full off one slice. I liked it. Some slices were filled w\/ spaghetti, which made it more filling yet not satisfying. I didn't like it. Prefer it without spaghetti. Don't rely on my photo, it looked bigger in person. \n\nIt's an okay place. Try it for yourself. It's not pizza I would go out of my way to get or crave, so I'm not sure if I would be back again.
