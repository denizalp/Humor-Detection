New buffet in the area and tried it out with my wife. Price is $9.99 and includes access to a Mongolian type grill, sushi, and the regular selection of Asian buffet items like Mongolian beef, sweet & sour chicken etc. \n\nSince the place is new its in good condition and customer service is decent. The regular Asian food was ok with some of the dishes being warm, but most were cold. The sushi selection was good for a place like this including the standard nigiri but rolls were a bit scarce when you wanted  something that wasn't stuffed with raw fish. \n\nThey had plenty of desserts but they did not taste very good but looked nice in the presentation. They also had ice cream albeit not self serve. Had to wait for someone to come by to scoop some for me. After several minutes of the sever trying to scoop the hard ice cream, I ended up getting what looked like half a scoop and a sorry that he couldn't scoop more. I also noticed he did not wear gloves and his fingernails were dirty *shiver. \n\nThe Mongolian grill had a good selection of items to grill but their sauces were lacking in choice. I was only asked spiciness level and that was it. The sauce was lacking in flavor but the items were cooked ok. \n\nAll in all a good place to try out once but I wouldn't be returning for the price.
