Came here for the MJ business expo this week. Our company had a booth here. First thing is, this place is huge!!!! The expo halls are all the way in the back. Walking through the casino is so damn smoky!!! I was sick to my stomach. I did go to the gift shop, and two of the restaurants, while I was there(see separate reviews)\nEmployees were decent, found parking in the front of the hotel both days, no problem. My co worker got a room here, it was nothing special to me, especially for 150.00 a night! Very crowded during late afternoon\/evening hours, and noise level high. Bathrooms were kept clean throughout the entire place. I havent been to Vegas since 2005, but glad I chose a hotel that was non smoking, and more of a resort feel.
