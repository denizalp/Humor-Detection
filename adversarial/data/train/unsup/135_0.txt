Holy Crap. I was in Las Vegas last week and the rodeo was freakin in town, literally. The National Rodeo Finals and NASCAR Banquet were going on in Vegas.\n\nThis was the very first time in Las Vegas where I felt like I had to help build a railroad with a stick of dynamite or something. \n\nHow bout dem Cowboys?
