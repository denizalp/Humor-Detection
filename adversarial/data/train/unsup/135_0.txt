Looking for good BBQ? \nGot a hankering for some tasty meats, slow roasted to perfection?\nHop a flight to Austin Texas and head straight for 'The County Line' BBQ. \n\nIf you can't do that, the next best thing in Phoenix is Honey Bears. A long time establishment dedicated to satiating the appetites of carnivores everywhere. \nTheir motto is quaint and to the point;  \"You don't need no teeths to eat our meat.\"\nIsn't that just precious?\nAnd so it goes, their motto has managed to attract the dentifrice-challenged from all over the valley, their smiles resembling jack-'o-lanterns.\n\nWell I have all my 'teeths', which is precisely why I come here. \nBeing older, looks beginning to wane, I still have a nice set of choppers which excludes me from the dentifrice challenged category. It also makes me revered by other diners my age as a demi-god of sorts. \n \nSo whenever i'm feeling down, a little blue over how I never get the once-over from hot babes anymore, I come here,  where I'm worshipped by  toothless fucks from all over Phoenix, and all for little more than a lifetime of dental care! Go figure.\n\nTheir brisket. pork shoulder and chicken, all tasty, better than most BBQ joints in Phoenix. \nBeans and coleslaw, nothing spectacular. \nService, friendly.\nTruly a good BBQ joint. Sauce is decent.\n\nIt's like eating at a homeless shelter, except the bbq is really good, and some half-assed preacher isn't in the dining area requiring you say a bunch of prayers in order to get a free meal.
