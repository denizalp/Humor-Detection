Ok, despite all of the negative reviews I actually got my order and it was on time. For the price the the quality was not bad either. Mind you my order was small (two pieces) but still I got it a few days before the estimated date. My only issue was the customer service. After seeing the negative reviews I decided to give them a call and check on my order. A woman answered and told me that they were no accepting calls, nice. I would have given them five stars if their customer service was better.\n\nP.S. I hope others get their orders\n\n~ S ~
