Do not eat here! The staff clearly doesn't want to do any work, or serve your food. The hostess had us wait for about 3 minutes while she flirted with the busboy. Once we were seated, our table was dirty, the floor was filthy, and the waitress took seven minutes to acknowledge us. And they weren't that busy. The food takes about thirty minutes to come out and it was cold and gross. Any place is better than this Buffalo Wild Wings...terrible staff, bad service, gross food. Zero stars.
