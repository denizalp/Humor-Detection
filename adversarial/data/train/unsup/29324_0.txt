Super happy with my haircut! I made an appointment and was running about 10 minutes late. I only ended up waiting 5 minutes and had a male hair dresser. He asked me for any photos (for inspiration) and was quiet for most of my hair cut (which I don't mind). It was $30 for a hair cut (CASH ONLY) and $35 if you wanted a cut and wash. Was there for about 45 minutes and loved the results! Will definitely go again! :)
