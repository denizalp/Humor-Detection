Three stars because Happy hour offered some great deals. \n\nThe waitress was still learning the menu and deals because she had to go double check before answering some of our questions.  \n\nI don't know how to explain it but the ambience of this place is off.  Maybe because it's still new and trying to figure things out.  The place is huge.  Almost two huge.  It doesn't have a cozy cabin feel.  They need to fix that.  \n\nRandom but two of the restrooms were out of toilet seat liners and it was only 630pm.  So gross!\n\nThe appetizers were tasty but I just wasn't really impressed.  I will try it again in a few months after they work out the kinks of being a new restaurant.
