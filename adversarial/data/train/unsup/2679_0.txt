I love Spirit. They nail the \"no frills\" concept.\n\nI was a big fan of EasyJet and RyanAir when I lived in Europe, and Spirit reminds me of them.\n\nSure, your seats won't recline, you probably won't feel your butt after 30 minutes, and you'd have to be on your knees begging to get half a pretzel, but they get you from A-to-B cheaply, if you're low maintenance yourself. Match made in heaven, if you ask me.
