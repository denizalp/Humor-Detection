Impressed!!!!\n\nHave been in Herbally Grounded three times the past few days...and decided to run into here based off the cutie succulents outside.\n\nGame changer!\n\nAs I walked in there is a whole (Smiths size) organic section!!!!!! Heaven!\n\nYes this place carries a hot mess of dairy, meat, and GMO boxed food but since I eat fruits, vegetables and whole starches only...This place is a winner on prices for the stuff I buy!!!!!!! Wowza!\n\nHeirloom organics (can hardly get those at WF's), navel oranges organics, organic peaches, organic potatoes, organic roma, organic strawberries, organic blueberries....WOW! They even carry the organic baby rainbow carrots for snacks!\nA pound bag of large organic carrots is 69 cents?!?! I see carrot dogs in our future!\n\nI also took some photos of some vegan junk food to help others. This being soooo close to home and the cashier was ecstatic to tell me that if I juice they have a bulk bin of discount fruit and veggies that are a juicers dream!!!\n\nNote taken! I shall be back.\n\nNow if people other than Whole Foods would start carrying Japanese white sweet potatoes......I could almost cut my umbilical cord to that place......
