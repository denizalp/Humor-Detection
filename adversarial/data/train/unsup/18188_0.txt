Oyster Bar has been around for over 20 years.  The business is now opened 24 hours.   Oyster Bar is quite popular even though it's a hidden gym in Palace Station.  The restaurant is located in an open area in the casino.  There are about 15 seats at the bar.  The food is made fresh to the order.  So, the lines are usually at least 1-1.5 hour wait.  I would come when it's off hours.    But it just depends on your luck.  I was lucky once and only waited 30 mins.  I also wouldn't come with a large group because it will be hard to all seat together and you won't be able to enjoy an intimate conversation since you're still at the bar.  \n\nThe food hands down is worth the wait.  Everything on the menu are good size where you can share.  They do give you a scoop of rice for each gumbo or pan roast entrees.  If you want another scoop of rice, it will be another $2.99,  My favorite is the crab salad, combo pan roast, and Alaskan Chower.  The oysters are a $1 a piece too.  All the entrees are super fresh and very rich with flavor.   \n\nCombo Pan Roast ($23.99) is a thick and tomato cream base soup.  You can also choose the degree of spiciness in the soup base.  They will cook it right in front of you and it usually takes at least 10 mins.  The combo comes with fresh lobster, shrimp, and crab meat and they give you a lot of seafood too  I usually share this since this entire is very rich and heavy.  I am always craving for this entry and will consider this one of my favorite seafood dish.   \n\nThe server is very friendly and are fast with their service.  They do accept credit card too.  If you have never been here before, you gotta come and check it out at least once.  It's a hidden gym worth coming for since you will never find another restaurant similar to this.
