This is my go-to Dim Sum place because it's authentic with carts and has a variety of dim sum items for $2.60 a dish. The reason for my average score is because of price but other than that I love the food here!\n\nOn weekends it gets very busy and I highly recommend making reservations (yes they take them and you by pass the line!) When you make reservations and arrive at the restaurant, you won't have a table right away but have priority. (It's a trick I always use)\n\nIn addition, I suggest coming before 2PM if you like the cart concept because after that it is a Ã  la carte.
