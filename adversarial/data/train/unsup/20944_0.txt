Zumanity was one of the shows I had binged watched one evening as I booked three Cirque du Soleil shows back to back on a long weekend in Las Vegas. \n\nIt's a pretty provocative scene overall and the performers, costumes and music just work. I sat ground floor, midway back and center so the action was right in front of me. \n\nThis is a fun show to watch and recommend it for couples. Very cool performance for sure!
