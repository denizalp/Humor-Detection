The atmosphere was cool.De La Soul rap mellow music playing over Bose indoor system. I enjoyed the small house transformed into a restaurant reminded me of my house I grew up in. Staff was friendly and attentive and good selection of beers. I picked a Liquid Amber and thoroughly enjoyed it. I expected more of a menu but I realized this place is more for hanging out then sit down dinner. We started with the artichoke dip and it was hot, fresh and delicious. We ordered two jive turkeys and they were very hot and tasty. Good location and good place to chillax. Next time I go ill drink more beer from their selection.
