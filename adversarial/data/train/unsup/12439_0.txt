I AM APPALLED!!! \n\nI was 100% robbed! \n\nFirst off, NOTHING on the wall is available in the morning. No smoothies. No rice dishes. No egg noodles. NOTHING. The only thing that is available is pho... this didn't really bother me much because the place is name pho anyways... so I wasn't going to order something else. It's just the false advertising that got me heated...\n\nTHIS is really the part that pushed me over the cliff... We were charged for egg noodles and various other dishes that WEREN'T EVEN AVAILABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE! FUCKING UNREAL! At least try to make it believable! The menu also clearly said there are TWO sizes... one at 7.99 and the other at 8.99 AND YET we were charged $10 per bowl PLUS an extra $1.50 for fish balls which wasn't even stated!!! WHAT THE FUCKERY!! \n\nWe obviously brought it up to their attention. At which point the guy at the register said that everything is the same price so he can charge us with anything as long as it equals the same amount of dishes ordered... We ended up arguing with them for like 15 mins.... nothing got resolved. So I just paid the fee and left because I'm on vacation and I'm not going to be bothered over this fuckery... \n\nBest believe I will NEVER be back again!
