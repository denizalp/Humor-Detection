My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time tonight and we loved it! We live in the area so it's nice to know there's a great Thai place right around the corner (though I never got the chance to try Green Mango).\n\nWe got to sit outside because it was beautiful out (what's up winter?), and were immediately greeted with two waters. We ordered the fresh rolls to start--enticed by the basil and mint leaves and the peanut dipping sauce--and they arrived not 2 minutes later (and were delicious!)\n\nNext we split an entree, (also out in mere minutes) and it was plenty of food for both of us. We had the pork pad gra prao and it was very tasty (though spicy so watch out! we asked for medium spice and I'm glad we did because it definitely had a kick). \n\nOur total came to $17 for both of us, and we left feeling comfortably full--not overstuffed. The servers here are so friendly and the food was great. I foresee us becoming regulars! :)
