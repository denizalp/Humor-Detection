When it comes to shawarma...i think that Osmow's has it down.  One of the things that I base a lot of middle eastern or Mediterranean cuisine is on a few choice dishes that are common to each.  In my case, its \"Chicken on Rocks\" or chicken shawarma on a bed of rice or fries with garlic sauce and hot sauce.  \nWhen it comes to this particular dish...Osmow's is my baseline.  You can't beat the price of $7.99 for such a filling and tasty dish. \n\nThis location is my go to for when I get a shawarma hankering.  Located near the Chrysler Plant in Brampton in an industrial strip mall, this place is always busy from lunch to late night.  I have been to a couple of Osmow's locations (8 in total) and the majority of them look all the same.  There is limited seating and the order counter takes up most of the restaurant, but they can move a line of people pretty fast here.  The smell of the shawarma cooking on the flat top, after being carved from the rotisserie permeates the restaurant.  Everything here is homemade.  I would warn you, if you like hot sauce...this place makes their own..and its eye bleeding hot.   If you like a little spice..make sure you get..a little spice level..not mild. \n\nThe portion size of the \"Chicken on Rocks\" is huge and the garlic sauce that smothers it is creamy and oh so tasty.  They also add a bit of paprika to the top for flavor and then your level of hot sauce.  I have yet to try some of the other dishes but if my usual order is indicative of the other dishes..then I am sure it is all really good.  \n\nLooking for a filling and flavorful lunch, dinner or late night munchies...grab Osmow's...you will be full and your hunger fufilled...5 stars
