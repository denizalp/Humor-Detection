Sorry to do this but!!!! I brought my wife here for the first time after we caught a movie. It was on Sunday, during football games. Now this place was half empty, not good when you depend on the football crowd. Service was great, and very nice. We order their double pepperoni pizza, and their burger sliders. Pizza, was awful! Tasted like it was a frozen pizza!!! HOLD ON, I can find frozen pizza that taste better!!! It was even worse, when we reheated at home!! Their burger sliders were good, nothing special. Seems like the food just not that great! Now when we where there watching a game, there was a table of four playing dominoes!!! Seriously! They were loud, slamming their so called bones on the table!! Just stay home and play your game! I'm surprised they let them treat their tables like that?? But then again, when your business is slow, you start being desperate! I hate giving out 1-Star reviews, and almost gave one!!! Just put out better food, and stop allowing customers to do what they want to!!!
