An update to my 05-29 review, the manager did give me a card for a free oil change as a gesture of goodwill ( so I thought ), my daughter went in today to redeem the oil change offer and he quizzes her as to where she got it, when she told him then he remembered I give him a bad review and he gave her a hard time and hassled her about honoring the card that he issued. I would think if you got a bad review you would try to make things right, instead he made things worse. Then he brags about how the company brought him to improve things. Hope they are happy, because this loyal long time customer is not!!!!
