Such a fun lounge\/bar in downtown Las Vegas! Usually when I come to Vegas I stick to the strip and go to clubs there, however, this place was amazing and so much fun! It is HUGE also. \n\nThey have a huge indoor area with a Dj, bar, games and pool tables. Outside they also have a Dj with a huge dance area and games like tether ball, 4 square, jumbo jenga, and jumbo beer pong. Such a good environment and the bartenders and workers are all super friendly! Lots of space to sit as well\n\nThe ambiance is casual and you don't have to worry about wearing heals or anything fancy. People were pleasant and the crowd was great! Definitely recommend going here if you are in Vegas!
