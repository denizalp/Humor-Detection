We went here to see our friend's band play, and I was totally stoked. It's a classic punk dive bar, much like Ferns in long beach was in the early 90's. They have a random but great selection on their juke box that actually had the untouchables and the angry samoans to name a few. There was a great mix of people, nobody had attitude, and the bartender seemed like a nice dude. The decor is super cool, is relatively hipster free, and a it's great place to have a beer. If there's ever a scavenger hunt where you have to find an over the hill exotic dancer, a giant plastic cockroach, a homeless guy with pretty hair, a surf guitar band, a douchey guy with a flat top from Minnesota, and a toilet covered in stickers, I'll head here first.
