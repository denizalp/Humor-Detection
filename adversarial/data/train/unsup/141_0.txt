There was a lot of potential when Jet first opened, the ambiance was posh, the crowd is beautiful, the music is kickin, and the decor was great.  The one thing that kept Jet going in the direction that they were going (at one point - UP), is the crappy service and nothing more.\n\nThe bouncers, cocktail waitress, and bartenders here have all been uber lame.  Promoters try hard to sell this place out on the weekend, but most folks are flocking to other clubs as of late because JET often tries too hard to be a better club than it is.  This results in a huge line, which VIPs even have trouble getting through and folks on the list are likely to have to pay \"extra\" to be able to set foot into the club.\n\nPrices of course are ridiculous.  My $16 grey goose tonic had more ice than alcohol and a bottle for the group of Johnny Walker Black was a cool $700.  That was even on a \"discount.\"\n\nI've had good times here before and often times knowing the right people can really make or break a club experience.  I can only hope that JET doesn't go on my Vegas black list for clubs.  Do like the rest of the folks and Jet off to some place with a little more class.
