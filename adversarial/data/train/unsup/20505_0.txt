Sad to report I had my first bad experience here. I've always returned since they are typically so careful and not rough but that completely changed. Had a mani\/pedi and the first girl doing my toes cut one of them pretty badly. It is still sore. The girl doing my fingers also cut my thumb. This has never happened to me here before and I may not come back based on this experience. Also, the girl doing the pedicure was pulled part way through to help someone else. \n\nHeading home to nurse my sore toe & hope for no infections!!!
