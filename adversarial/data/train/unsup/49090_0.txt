Did not like the Boba here. It was too mushy, my iced almond milk tea was warm even with the ice. The tofu snack was bland and the sauce was ketchup and sweet. The tofu snack was also very soft. The blueberry snow also sucked, according to my fiance. The best thing about this place was that it was cheaper than any boba place I've been to in California.
