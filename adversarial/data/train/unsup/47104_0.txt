Great location--we stopped here on our drive to Charlottetown and scored a great rate for a last-minute booking.  We'd been on the road all day and felt like we deserved a splurge, so we ordered a bunch of room service and lounged around in the classic Westin bathrobes all night long.  It is super fun pretending to be a rich person here!  Plus, the fruit plate came with so much fruit that I packed the rest up for the drive--hooray for road trip snacks that aren't Cheetos and beef jerky!
