I've been to Senza Pelo Med Spa twice so far for laser hair removal treatments. I have to say that the entire staff has been very friendly and extremely professional both times I've been. Maria has performed the treatment, and has been so good about making me feel comfortable during the appointment. I go to the Bethany Home office. It's a little far from my home, but well worth it. I highly recommend  Senza Pelo Med Spa. :)
