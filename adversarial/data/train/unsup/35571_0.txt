Awesome girls night!  We went on a Saturday night- I've never painted before in my life and Anthony made it so fun and easy- step by step instructions perfect for the beginner but they also allow you to be creative so that everyone's paintings have their own look.  Really great atmosphere, everyone there was friendly and encouraging and all four of us had a great time and bought tickets to go back at the end of class.  Cannot wait to do it again!
