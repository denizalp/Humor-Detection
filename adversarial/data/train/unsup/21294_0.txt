We stopped here a few weeks after they opened and came back on a return visit a few weeks later because we liked it so much.  We really like Cinderlands beer.  When we first came here the bartender gave us some samples to introduce us to their type of beer.  I'm not a big Ipa fan but I love their Ipas here and my wife does too.  When I taste their beer it's very good and refreshing.  Beer doesn't always make you feel that way but their beer does.  We tasted a lot of their different beers and we liked most of them.  My wife loves their Ipa called Stack and they just came out with their Littlefoot which I enjoyed on our last visit.  I probably liked the other beers they had on our previous visit but this was still a very good Ipa.  \n\n     On our first visit it wasn't too busy at first but it started to get busy later in the day.  It was the day after Christmas.  On our second visit it was busy because it was a Saturday evening and playoff football was on.  They have a lot of seating in the back but in the very front is the bar.  They have seats along the wall, about a 13 seat bar, and a bar right in front of their open kitchen which is neat. The heat from the kitchen kept us warm on a bitterly cold Pittsburgh Saturday night!\n\n     The workers that we have encountered here all seem pretty nice.  They work good together and it is a good environment.  It has to be because if you sit at the bar there is a lot going on in front of you.  That is probably the only thing that I don't like about Cinderlands if you sit at the bar.  Since the kitchen is open and right next to you there is a lot of movement but it still doesn't take away from their beer and it's still a really good atmosphere.  We watched football on the second night and had a great time.  They have a food menu that I think is a little expensive but it is different.  There are a lot of interesting items on their food menu.   I don't know if we will ever eat here but we will be back for their great beer.
