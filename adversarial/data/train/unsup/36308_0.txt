This was my first experience with Thai and it wasn't that great. Nothing really jumped out at you on of the only things that kind of drew my attention was the chicken dumplings, but that's just cause I love dumplings. Other than that it was okay at best. The pad soup was pretty bland, and the pad Thai(beat) was kinda just brown salted mush. The yellow general curry (breaded chicken) was good, if you like cooked pineapple.
