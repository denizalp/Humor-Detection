I don't think it was that bad.  I think some yelp reviewers over exaggerates their reviews and make it worst than it is. My colleague and I ate here for lunch because she recommended it. I didn't feel like eating Chinese food, but decided what the heck. I'll try this hole in the wall Chinese joint since they offer vegetarian options.\nI ordered the lunch special \"Sa Cha Tofu\" and a sweet tea. The total? $6.00. Straight up cheap! \nMy dish was hot! I didn't know what Sa Cha Tofu was, but I was feeling adventurous, so I ordered it. \nIt was good vegetarian dish that came with a complimentary egg roll. \"Sa Cha Tofu\" is basically a stir fry with Siracha. It's hella hot!  I didn't care for the egg roll though. I prefer the Philippine lumpia version 'cause the wrapper is thinner. \nThey have a variety of vegetarian dishes here that range from $4.75 to $7.75. This is a great option if you are on a budget. \nThey also deliver which is nice. I usually stay at uptown Crowne Plaza, so the next time I come to Charlotte I will order something here for delivery.
