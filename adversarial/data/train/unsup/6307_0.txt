Walkin are treated like second class citizens.  I called to set an appointment and no on answered.  Turns out each barber has their own phone so you have to meet them first.  After waiting 1 and half hours, I was shuffled to the the barber with no customers and she cut my hair terribly.  She had no customers because she was new!! People made.fun of my fade for days.
