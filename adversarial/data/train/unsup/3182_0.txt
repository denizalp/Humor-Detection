Is giving zero stars even possible? That's what this store deserves. \n\nI had shopped around for a particular Tissot watch($700) that I already knew I was getting.  Being 19, and casually dressed, not a single sales associate would acknowledge my presence. When I asked a sales associate to look at the watch, she told me she was busy with another customer, and I would have to wait. Fair enough. When another associate returned from break, I grabbed her attention and she was showed the watch to me. When we had finished negotiating the price, I took a little extra time in deciding if I wanted the metal strap or a bracelet. Well, at this point in time, I guess she was fed up with me, and when another well-dressed customer came in, she left to go help him, taking the watches with her. \n\nThis is ridiculous, I am never coming back again.
