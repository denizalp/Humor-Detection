Better than Taco Taco and Tacos El Gordo? I don't think so!\n\nTaco Taco has much better Al Pastor and tortillas. Taco Tijuana is extremely generous with their meat unlike TEG where they are a little stingy. But quality counts more than quantity and I feel that Taco Tijuana is one rung down from the top two places. Probably deserves a solid 3.5 star rating. Taco Taco is still #1.\n\nBTW, MUCHAS GRACIAS to whomever wrote these two magic words here on Yelp; \"bien doradito\" has changed my life so much for the better.
