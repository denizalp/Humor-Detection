I purchased a Groupon for 3 rooms for $34. My initial phone call was great, the guy was nice and accommidating. However, the gentleman that showed up at my house was very rude and condescending to my husband. The man had no idea what he was doing and and got upset when we did not want any upgrades and started talking about a fuel surcharge. I called the guy who texted me in the morning to say they would be there (same guy I scheduled with, who was now not very nice at all) and he started in about did I not read the fine print about the fuel surcharge blah blah. I said I would pay it no problem, but his guy was super rude. He tried to flip the table on me and tell me it was us who was rude and he was not going to have his guy clean our rooms. I think once his guys got there and saw it was a 2 story home and the rooms I wanted cleaned were upstairs and that we didn't want any \"deep cleaning\", they were really not going to make any money and didn't want our business any longer. I even contacted Groupon and told them they should not even be associated with these people! AWFUL!!!!!
