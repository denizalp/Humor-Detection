They are busy on a Saturday at 7:300 pm. Lots of folks having a late dinner. This place cooks really good steaks and I ordered a rib eye 12oz cooked rare. Soup of the day was clam chowder. No oyster crackers were available. For my sides I ordered baked potato and side salad with Thousand Island dressing. Will probably be to full for desert. I am drinking a small pint of Blue Moon Ale to wash it down with.
