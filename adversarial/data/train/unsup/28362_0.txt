Just returned from a fabulous dinner to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. Manager Todd and server Nils and the entire staff went out of their way to make our evening special and surprise us, including working with our relatives back East. The short ribs were succulent and tasty while the scallops were the best we have had in town.  Try the chocolate cake and creme brûlée for dessert. It was made to share. Waverlys never disappoints and always surprises with their attention to detail. It is one of our regular haunts and we will be back. Thank you.  Ask for a booth with Frederick or Nils.
