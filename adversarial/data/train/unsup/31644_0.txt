I wanted SO BAD to love it here, and I assumed I would! The good news is, the trucks are great and that's why we're all here, right? The bad news is the venue itself leaves much to be desired, IMHO. The space is pretty small (at least compared with what I had in my head), it's on cement which isn't ideal in the summer, and the porta potties are really close to the food action. I'm no germaphobe, but it was a little weird. If none of that matters to you, I think you'll have a great time. The beer truck flows and the vendors the night I visited were very pleasant. Best of luck to all on this new venture!
