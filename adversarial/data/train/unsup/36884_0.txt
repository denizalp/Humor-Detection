Sunguard recently painted my house down in Chandler after I bought a coupon from Angie's List. My house was over the allowed size for the coupon, but Walt worked with me on the pricing and I really feel like I got a great price.\n\nWalt came out and did and estimate on my house right away, and then I waited to get approval to paint from my HOA. Once I did, I called Sunguard and they came out that same week to paint my house. Once they started, the whole prep and painting process took two days, which was a lot less time than I was expecting.\n\nThe painters who came were all very friendly and professional, and the work they did was excellent. They patched and repaired all the stucco and some trim pieces that the previous owner's dog had chewed to a pulp. They removed the light fixtures out front (at my request) since I was planning to replace them after they were done painting. They taped off all the windows and doors, and were very careful not to slop paint everywhere. The color scheme I chose had three different colors, and the lines between the colors are clean and crisp.\n\nI am really impressed with the quality of the work, especially at the price. When it comes time to paint the interior of my house, I'll be calling them again.
