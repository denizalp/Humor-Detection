Peppermill is a Las Vegas must-do.\n\nIf you go on the weekends in the morning, you're waiting an hour. It's just how it is. During the week, you can pretty much be seated right away.\n\nThey happen to have some of the best country gravy I've ever had. Portions are big and the price is quite fair.\n\nMy girlfriend loves the corned beef hash.\n\nWear stretchy pants, or have some self control...so wear stretchy pants.
