The worst customer service\/experience ever!!! First of all, I called to reserve a chapel. I was put on hold for 35 minutes. When I finally spoke to someone and was inquiring about the different packages, I got a frustrated \"you know we are really busy. You need to call back in 2 hours when we are better staffed..\" Ok... So I called the next day and spoke to someone a little more pleasant. I booked an appointment and paid for a photographer, video and Elvis. They asked me if this was a marriage or vow renewal. I said marriage. \"Great! Show up 15 minutes before your reservation.\" We arrived with our 30 guests and were told we needed a marriage license. We had to go to the courthouse first. WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL US THIS?!?! We ran to the courthouse and back to the chapel. \n\nAfter we checked in (again) we were being escorted to the chapel. A couple pulled up in the drive thru. The woman up front told our minister to do their wedding first and kept all of our guests waiting outside in the 106 degree Vegas heat for 20 minutes while the drive up wedding was being conducted. They refused to open the chapel doors without the minister so we stood outside melting in the heat. I asked if we could have water or something since it was so got and we were waiting outside. We would have gladly paid for it. They said there is a vending machine down the street we could try... \n\nThen, they refused to let our guests take photos of the ceremony but they didn't have a photographer!!!!!! The photographer only takes photos after the wedding. It was seriously the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. No pictures of the ceremony!!!! Ugh. I'm so glad my guests are rule breakers and snapped a few anyway even though the staff was seriously yelling at my guests during the ceremony. \n\nPlease save yourself the headache and go somewhere else. This place is the absolute worst. ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!!!
