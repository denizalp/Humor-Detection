Just went here yesterday with a friend for dinner! I like going here when I'm not sure what I want to eat since it is AYCE, nearby, and they have salads which makes me feel healthier since I'm eating my veggies haha. \n\nThey usually have 3 different types of premade salads (Caesar Asiago, Wonton Happiness, and some seasonal salad that changes often). You can also build your own salad with various ingredients if you don't like any of the premade options. After getting your salad you pay and pick a table to eat at. You can get muffins, cookies, soups, pasta, and ice cream as well! As for drinks, I highly recommend trying a blend of sprite and the strawberry lemonade over ice for a refreshing, fizzy drink. \n\nI'd recommend checking this place out if you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes (aka Souplantation) and are in the mood for salads, soups, and various baked goods. Be sure to sign up for their newsletter for the seasonal themes for the food and for coupons! I've never been here without a coupon xD.
