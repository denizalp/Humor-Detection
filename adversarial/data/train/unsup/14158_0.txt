We went to koi lounge on a saturday night. got hooked up from a promoter off the strip.\n\n- 1st people to get in. nice welcome. one circle around and done. \n- free drinks for the ladies. definitely bonus!\n- dance floor was small but music was good. nice mix of hip hop and top40. \n- enough seating to just sit, relax and talk amongst each other. \n- friendly folks that night. real chill. no flashy. no douchebaggery. huge plus especially in vegas.
