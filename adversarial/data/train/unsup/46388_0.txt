Although the empanadas I had were cold on the inside the owner did reach out and apologize for it plus, I also did not speak up about it. So I am re-writing my review. My mother had the Milanesa and she loved it, the fries were great, they had Materva soda to drink which I love, reminds me of home, Miami. You don't see them too much anywhere else. The empanada with the blue cheese was different and cool but was a bit too much for me, the cheese. I wish the empanadas were a bit more Argentinean style like Im used to but overall still good and the price is great as well! I will be back :)
