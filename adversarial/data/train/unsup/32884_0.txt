We went to the village at Lake Las Vegas just to check it out. We had planned on having lunch at the lake and picked this place for something different. We were so delighted we did. It was a Saturday afternoon, weather was clear and in the low 70's. There was several people seated there and we were a party of six. We were seated right away with no waiting. The service was excellent! Our waiter seemed to enjoy his job, as if he owned the place. No waiting for refills. French bread was fresh. The meals arrived in a timely manner and very well presented. The taste was so unbelievably GOOD, from the chicken salad to a burger. Prepared by a real chef not just some minimum wage so called cook. Not over or under cooked and everything was  fresh.  The Creme brulee and New York cheese cake was perfect. So GOOOOOD!!!! I can't believe some of the bad reviews here. Maybe they read the reviews and have done better. As for us, this will be a definite return on our next visit. Ghost town? Maybe, but it was nice to escape the crowds of the strip and was just a short drive. We will highly recommend this place to anyone going to Vegas, as a must for a quite lunch.
