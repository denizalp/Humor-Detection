With close to 400 reviews I will spare you the repeated details about the Venetian. \n\nI loved it. It was a little hard getting used to the rosey smell of the lobby and casino but you grow to enjoy the fragrance.  I recently stayed at the Palazzo and I can say that the rooms here are in better shape. Weird since the Palazzo is new but ok, whatever.  \n\nHousekeeping comes by twice a day. They kept our towels stocked and our ice bucket filled and insisted on giving me handfuls of chocolate.  The front desk was accommodating as I called on the last morning of our stay and requested a late check out and they happily gave us an additional 2 hours to sleep. If we wanted to extend until 2 pm, they charge half their nightly rate. No thank you. \n\nThis is a great place to rest your head, gamble, party, see a show and eat. \n\nTIP: Do sign up for a player's card and use it.  Since the economy blows, you can find yourself a decent rate through their email promotions. Check it.
