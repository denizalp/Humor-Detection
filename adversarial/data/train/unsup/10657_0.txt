(Lyrics - Dire Straits - Money for Nothing)\n\nNow look at them golfing that's the way you do it\nYou eat your sushi at the Downside Risk\n\nThat ain't workin' that's the way you do it\nSushi and drinking at The Downside Risk\nNow that ain't workin' that's the way you do it\n\nLet me Yelp it them rolls ain't dumb\nMaybe get a goblet with your Stella Artois\nMaybe get a goblet with your beer\n\nI like this place!  I didn't expect much as I sat down.  It was like a golfers haven and cowboys wannabes!  \n\nMy bartender was a good guy attentive and on the ball about what I needed and what I wanted.  They don't come like that anymore!  So I ordered me a Stella and he offered my a super chill goblet.  Boy was it chilled because it created ice in my beer, which in my opinion was awesome and tasty!  My partner and I ordered their sushi; yeah they had sushi!  We ordered the Tuna sashimi & Eel Dragon Roll - I didn't care much for the Eel roll, but the Tuna Sashimi was well plated and tasted perfect!  Who knew a golfing cowboy joint would have such good sashimi; not a downside to this risk at all - wink!  \n\nOverall, I would totally recommend this place for a quick bite and definitely a nice cold beer! - Enjoy!
