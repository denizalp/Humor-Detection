OK, maybe its just me.  Or perhaps its just the way things are in Vegas.  \n\nThis place sucked from Jump Street.  I realize Vegas is all about taking your money and making you feel good about it, but I expect, and so should you all, some value for the money I am laying down on the table - no, not the Black Jack table or any other such devise where I really don't expect anything, save the idea of becoming rich very quickly. \n\n If I am laying down sixty to one hundred and eighty dollars a night for a room, I EXPECT quality service.\n\nIssues: As you drive up, the appearance is you can ONLY valet park. (not so).  Even though there valet service is \"Free\" you pay in time waiting and tipping.  I prefer options.  \nThere is no 10 minute check in area.  I parked way down the way in order to go in, check in, and then move may car, to be told, by the receptionist that my car was \"blocking\" the valet area.  It was not but if I was observed parking in an area I was not allowed to, why not stop me before I walk a mile to enter the hotel?\nSecond, the hotel charges $5.00\/day for incidentals, like making local phone call less than 30 minutes duration, \"priority\" queuing for the buffet line. Local faxing documents, and other business type things.  Excuse me, who is faxing documents and who is making local phone calls.??  This charge was not a option.\nThird, My room key card locked me out twice, in the span of 10 minutes, leaving me in the hallway with luggage.  I could go on, but this would serve no useful purpose.  I had to call, twice and wait for security to come with a new card.   Bottom line, don't except poor serve just because you are in a place people want to be.  Service is everything.  That's what America is about.  Don't sale yourselves short on that rule.  \n\nI will never go back to the Santa Fe Station.  I'd sooner stay in a Motel six.\n\n(I'd give ZERO stars, but that is not an option in \"Yelp.\"\n\nJB
