I don't understand how so many people think this is such a great place to eat.  I guess they just don't know better.  The food is greasy and the place is filthy.  They may have large portions but the food is grotesque.  I promise you if you try Catawba Fish Camp in Fort Lawn, SC just once - you will never go back to Long Creek again.
