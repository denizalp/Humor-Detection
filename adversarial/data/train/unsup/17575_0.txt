Yuckie. Las Vegas has been piss-poor this trip in general.  \n\nI think the only reason that this place gets business is because it is right by the elevators where the rooms are because the food is gross. \n\n1. The cuts of meats are poor \n2. The sides are disgusting...I had a taste of the creamed spinach and the beans and rice....gross they were flavoured\/spiced really badly. The salad that they give you is overdressed\n3. The service is poor at best. \n\nIt reminds me of the Walmart of steak places...unless you like Walmart...then I feel sorry for your taste level. \n\nAVOID, AVOID, AVOID...
