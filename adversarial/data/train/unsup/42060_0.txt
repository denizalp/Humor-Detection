Its definitely seen better days, and its sort of an acquired taste, but as far as blue-collar watering holes go, this is is probably one of the best near ASU. Happy hour is when people start showing up (the smoking patio is in the shade) and it is easy to get stuck here way past sundown. Its also great for various sporting events and St Pattys. I probably wouldnt take a date here, but the drink prices are just ridiculous, and as long as you have a strategy to get out of there before eleven (or before it rains) I think you will do OK.
