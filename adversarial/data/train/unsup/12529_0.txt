There are few left but Market Street Cafe at the California Hotel in DTLV is one of the value coffee shops still left.  I met a good friend from Toronto and he chose this place because the buffet to which we had planned to go at the Fremont was closed for renovation.\n\nThey still have a $9.99 prime rib special and that's what we both ordered.  It comes with soup or salad bar, baked, mashed, fries or other options for starch, and cherries jubilee for dessert.  I asked for the rarest piece of prime rib they had and I was off to the salad bar.  My friend got the soup of the day, a corn chowder.\n\nThe meals came quickly and my prime rib was a nice reddish pink color.  We both ordered baked potatoes and Sandra--our very 'Aloha' server--brought small containers of butter, sour cream, and horseradish before the dinners were ready.\n\nThis is not prime rib from some fancy, high priced restaurant.  It's a basic slice of prime rib, thin, but it had good flavor and it's quite a bargain for what you get.  The baked potato could have used a bit more cooking but it was otherwise OK.\n\nThe dessert, cherries jubilee, is simply a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of some cherries in a sweet sauce.  While not the real thing, it was an enjoyable ending to the meal.  Since my friend uses insulin and can't have the ice cream, I fell on my sword and had both.\n\nWith Boyd owning this casino and picking up other properties around the valley, I'll go farther afield with my dining offers than just the Suncoast.  I enjoyed my dinner here.\n\nOur server, Sandra, was a gem!  What a great attitude and very friendly and welcoming!  There should be more like her.\n\nAloha!
