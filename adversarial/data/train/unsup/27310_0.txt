So this was our first visit to any panda express, ordered online through yelp found the order site relatively easy to navigate. Upon arriving at the store\/restaurant went in the front door and headed to the online pick up area. I arrive roughly 3 minutes prior to the ready time provided to me at order placement. Due to the large crowd the eggrolls were not ready, but only took a few extra minutes. Staff was extremely helpful and very kind and apologized up-and-down for any kind of additional wait. Overall I would say for timing online ordering and ease-of-use, we would go back. The best part about panda express is the ability to try different dishes all within a meal plan. $22 gave my wife and I and two kids a perfect meal. Just my two cents thank you
