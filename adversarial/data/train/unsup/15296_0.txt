We were so excited to come here because the one in LA is really good and had pretty good reviews on here. But we were sorely disappointed in the customer service and AYCE policy.  The food tasted okay for the most part though. \n\nIt is located in a plaza in Chinatown, not on the LV Strip.  \n\nWe got here about 8 pm and there was no wait.  When we got to our table, we noticed this huge domed grill, it looked like a lid or an overturned wok.  It was cool.  \n\nWe ended up with AYCE for our group of 6 at $19.99 each.  When we proceeded to order our favorites, we were told we can only order 2 items at a time.  We are used to limited items, but usually 4-5, which was fine.  After we cooked the first batch, they told us we had to finish everything before they would take our order for the next round.  Our grill was sitting there empty while we were starving & waiting for our food to be brought out by the wait staff.  Other tables had full grills most of the time, while we sat there with nothing on ours.  \n\nWe ordered different items on the menu including:\n\nbeef tongue - good, thin sliced meat\n\nspicy octopus - quarter sized when cooked, was okay\n\nkalbi (short ribs) - marinated fatty meat, not great :(\n\nsides - not so fresh, marinated cucumbers had a weird flavor\n\ndipping sauces - did not look appetizing either\n\nspicy \"bulgogi\" (brisket) - kinda weird looking...  this did not look like our usual bulgogi, so we asked about it.  \n\nUs:  What is that? (as we pointed to it cooking on the grill)\nWaiter:  It's spicy bulgogi\nUs:  It doesn't look like bulgogi\nWaiter:  It's brisket with other meats all clumped together\nUs:  Huh?\nWaiter:  It has other meats and brisket mixed together\nUs:  (We still had quote bubbles with question marks)  I just looks like pork, didn't we order brisket?\n\nWe would have tried other meats, but we were only \"allowed\" to eat so much due to being micro-managed by the waiter\/waitress not giving us our food.\n\nAfter we got on our car and started pulling away, the 2 servers ran up to our car saying they charged the wrong amount.  Even though they charged the wrong amount, we totaled it correctly and made sure to tip.  I asked, did you even look at what we gave total?  He didn't and said, \"oh, you paid the correct amount and tipped too?\"  It made is feel like we were trying to not pay. Then complained we only gave $20 tip.\n\nI will give 3 stars for the flavors of the meats & sides, but need to take 2 stars off for service.\n\nI would suggest to order from the menu a la carte instead of AYCE, you'll probably be more satisfied.  We probably would have been charged half the price considering how much we ate, actually it was more like how much they wanted to give us.\n\nIf you want to be micromanaged when eating, having someone tell you how much to eat at an AYCE place and getting a smirk for \"only\" giving $20 tip, then come here.  Otherwise, there are so many other buffets in Vegas that are so much more worth it.  The AYCE Korean BBQs in Los Angeles are SO MUCH BETTER, food-wise and service wise.  The waitstaff need to go to Customer Service 101 classes.\n\nNote:  This is my 1st less than 3 star review out of 80 that I've written.  Definitely not worth it for the service as others have said.  Disappointed!  :(
