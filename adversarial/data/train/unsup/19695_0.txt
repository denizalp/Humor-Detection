This is an oasis or hidden gem in the Las Vegas area. The Avanti Apartments is located in the Centennial Hills area miles away from the bustle and noise of the Casinos of the Las Vegas strip nightlife. It's a very peaceful and quiet location and area. It's surrounded by the beautiful Red Rock Mountains....and it's breathtaking sunrise\/sunets views. Now the property is very well maintained and clean...the outside pool area is gorgeous as well as the swanky outside lounge areas. The gym is equipped pretty well with free weights, elipticals, tread mills and open 24\/7 to residents. \n\nThe area feels very safe and welcoming...but you will need a car to get to the nearest restaurant, stores, etc...but it's only about a quick 10 minute drive...as well as only a 25 minute drive into downtown Las Vegas. The staff is very friendly and attentive to the residents. (Put in a work order for some light bulbs and before I could get back to my apartment someone was already there to fix the problem.)\n\n *Marisella did an excellent job getting everything set up for my move in...I did everything online since I was coming all the way from the other side of the country Atlanta, Ga...when I got there with my Uhaul from a 3 day journey....she made everything go through smoothly and even though they were closing in 1\/2 hour she took her time to make sure I had taken a tour of the property and was comfortable before she left for the day.\nYou would think this would be an unaffordable place to stay being the area and location...but it is actually quite affordable. I think it is a bargain considering the inside of the apartments are very roomy and spacious. So again if you are looking for a great apartment...I would highly recommend coming to the Avanti Apartments.
