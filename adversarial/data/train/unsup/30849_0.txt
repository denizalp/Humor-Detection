We stopped by on Friday with our adult children.  The place was woefully understaffed and the food ( perch dinner) was awful.  I ordered a Guinness...really, learn how to pour a Guinness or don't serve it.\n I've been coming to the Eastland Inn for at least 50 years and I don't think I'll be going back.  Is it the new ownership?  Not sure but it really isn't the same as it's been in the past. Sad.
