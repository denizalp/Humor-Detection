About the caliber you'd expect from a deep discount motel. Absolutely zero frills, not even shampoo, iron, or hair dryer in the room. Our single queen room was quite small but comfortable enough for what we paid for it. Biggest annoyances were that the tiles in our bath were all loose and no one did anything about the obvious rowdy party on our floor one night. Basically you get what you pay for here.
