I eat here often enough that I should update my review. Actually, it's mainly that I should update it from 3 stars to 4 stars. Most everything I've had here, I've like. I finally tried their pizza a few weeks back and found that I really liked it. I also really like the Funghi pasta. It doesn't have any meat in it. For those times when I just don't want any meat, this is a delight. OK, I'm a little biased, anything with mushrooms in it, I tend to like, and the Funghi has lots of mushrooms in it. Actually, I would say most of the dishes here have lots of stuff in it. They don't skim on the ingredients or the portions. \n\nI think the first time I was here, I felt like the carbonara could have been better. I haven't had that again, but I've had just about everything else. I don't know if the quality of the food has gotten better? Or if I was being particularly picky before. But I've found that everything tastes OK here. I've liked the food enough to continue to come back. \n\nThe service (which is mainly at the counter, because you will put away your tray and clear the table yourselves) is very friendly and nice as well.
