I waltzed in here one day when I learned that there was indeed a place in Montreal where I could find practically anything I needed for my artwork.  I was a budding stencil artist and this place was the gold mine I'd been wishing for at the time.  The staff was pretty nice, but I was always followed everywhere around the store (to prevent theft, I'm guessing - well, that or they thought I was ridiculously good looking) for the first dozen or so times I bought stuff here, which got to be pretty annoying considering all the business I was giving them.  However, I don't hold it against them, as this particular store is very intimate and a little cramped, and I can see shoplifters trying to have a field day here.\n\nAfter a while the staff more or less recognized me upon my entering this establishment - or at least, the manager did.  The manager here is one of the nicest people on the planet.  He is in love with art (surprise!) and wants to engage with the customers about art.  He's given me advice on how to start up one's own art show and how certain crafting techniques work.  He also is extremely patient when I spend 15 minutes picking a bunch of spray paint colours.\n\nThe selection varies.  Sometimes there is a lot of what I want, and sometimes nothing at all.  I need to emphasize that when this happens the staff always offers to order some.  The manager even offered me his email and told me to email him in advance if I need a specific type of canvas or something.  So in terms of customer service, nothing beats this place.\n\nSo yeah, basically I love this store.
