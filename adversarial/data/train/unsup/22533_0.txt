I know nothing about wine. Well, I take that back. I do know that when you get home from the bar at 2am and your bestie Andrea asks do we need to open a bottle of wine, your head is going to hurt the next day.\n\nWhether you pick out bottles based on the pretty label\/clever name (*raises hand in shame*) or you're a connoisseur, here's your place. Josh and the staff are so knowledgeable and nice. Seriously, I went yesterday to pick out a ros√© and was blown away by the girl who helped me. I then sat and drank said bottle with a friend. Mondays are hard. Don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions. They have a great selection and it covers all prices points. \n\nCheck their website for upcoming wine events and happenings. Assorted Table also has craft beers, sake, vermouth, bitters, and gift baskets. They will even make you a custom basket to your liking. \n\nParking: 7th Street Public Market validates parking up to 90 minutes for the 7th Street Station deck. Clock starts running when you print your ticket. The validation machines are at Local Loaf and Greeneman Farms. A purchase of some sort from the market is required.
