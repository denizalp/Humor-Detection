I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY wished the service here could be better! Because the food is absolutely delicious. \n\nBut coming here every time is always an internal debate for me because it takes soooo long to get seated, to get your order taken, to receive food and eventually to receive a check and pay. It seems like they only staff one service during peak hours and doesn't adequately train their staff the importance of sense of urgency, which in turn turning the service into a vicious cycle of eternal waiting.\n\nLast time when my friend and I went there, it took them one hour-60 minutes!! To bring out the dessert we ordered. It was a fruit fondue- about four strawberries, half a banana and 5-6 pieces of cubes of pre-made cake. It escaped us HOW could cutting of such minimal food take an entire hour?! And we asked for the progress 3 times during that hour and every time we told the server that we might just cancel the dessert, she assured us that it would come out within 2 minutes. The promise was never kept. \n\nAll in all, good food. But too frustrating to dine in, unless you have at least 2 hours to spare for sitting in a restaurant, searching for your waiter.
