A tip to Dave: Double check your delivery orders before they get sent out. Lunch for seven of us involved three trips from the delivery man as drinks were incorrect, desserts were forgotten, and one poor girl (not me!) had her lunch omitted entirely. \n\nI went with the Summer Breeze Salad - a mixture of romaine, chicken, oranges, apples, cranberries, and walnuts - bleu cheese vinaigrette on the side. It was quite good and just the perfect size for lunch. The chicken was fresh and shredded, the vinaigrette perfectly tasty. I'd definitely order it again if I lived in the area. \n\nHowever, I seemed to fare better than those who ordered sandwiches (which, I would like to point out, was everyone else, so congrats to me for my psychic lunch-picking abilities). Most appeared to be 80% shredded iceberg lettuce. One girl stuck hers in the microwave in an effort to zest it up a bit (Yeah, odd, I know. As I said, I got a salad). \n\nThe final nail-in-the-coffin for the sandwich-eaters was that most of them ordered the Ooey Gooey Brownie for dessert. Apparently it was neither ooey nor gooey. Alas.
