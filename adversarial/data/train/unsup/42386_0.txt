This company was sent out by my home warranty to repair my dryer which was not heating due to a bad thermostat.  Well, the gem of a tech (Mark), caused a fire in my dryer, and then told me I couldn't use it and he'd get all info to the warranty so they would replace or pay us out for the dryer.  Just a nice guy, and then stabbed us in the back.  Warranty calls and says they won't cover it because the tech said we caused a fire in our dryer because of lint.  BS since we clean our vent out every year, and I was there when HE in fact caused the fire.  Be very very careful, ask your warranty to send someone else!
