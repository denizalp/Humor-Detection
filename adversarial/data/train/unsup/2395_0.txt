The $20 AYCE small plate brunch sounded like a pretty sweet deal, so I rounded up some friends for a Cinco de Mayo recovery brunch. We tried most of the dishes while listening to live music and a good time was had. Some dishes were better than others, but it's one of the better deals to be had downtown with a variety of fresh-made dishes to suit a group without resorting to a buffet. Drinkers can add on a bottomless option for $10 more.\n\nThe GOOD: Monkey Bread we were served upon seating was syrupy and sweet but not overwhelmingly so. Shrimp & Grits was surprisingly creamy and cheesy. Both the Crab Cake and Classic Benedicts were pretty good, with perfectly cooked, yolky eggs. Silver-Dollar Pancakes were better than expected, topped with a brown sugar topping. Eggs & potatoes were a surprise hit, with well-seasoned potatoes with a heavy hand of rosemary and a bit of chorizo mixed in for kick. \n\nThe rest: Texas French Toast was not received despite multiple requests. Chicken & Waffles had a dry protein. Biscuit & Gravy was flavorless in both components with an unpleasant, soggy texture. Jambalaya was bland and the chilaquiles were phoned in with a handful of stale chips and a scoop of salsa. Pastrami Skillet Hash was poorly received by others, so I didn't try it. Fish & Chips was overly breaded and not crispy. \"Pigs\" in a blanket was comically served with one tiny wrapped sausage dwarfed by the mini-skillet it was served in, and overly sweet with a maple sausage wrapped in a pancake and then further drizzled with maple syrup. \n\n Our server was nice and fairly attentive. There were no issues splitting the bill (always a risk with group dining) and server was okay with one in our party ordering from the a la carte menu. It wasn't til I actually wrote out this review that I realized how many more misses than hits there were regarding the food- having the right company clearly makes a difference with your experience. All in all, about what you'd expect for $20.
