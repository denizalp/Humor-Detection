This is a tough course!  Not for a Beginner.\n\nLocation: Seven Hills... set amidst the rich and shameless mansions\n\nService: Top Notch\n\nLayout \/ Topography: elevation changes, dog legs and fairways that are along the canyon walls... a couple of water holes \n\nI'm by no means a good golfer, but I like a challenge.\n\nYes....this course can be frustrating if you are not a straight hitter off the tee.  Thankfully, I hit it straight 90% of the time so I can see my ball on the fairway or find it on the 1st cut.\n\nIt is immaculately cared for.\n\n#12 is my favorite.  Probably because (for some odd reason) I either par or birdie that hole... I don't know why... it should be a scary hole for me because you have to clear a waste area and hit the green otherwise you have a hell of chip onto the green.  Anyways... it's that hole that keeps me coming back for more.\n\n#17 and #18 are really LONG and wide ... so grip it and rip it!\n\nThe view from #18 is spectacular!!  The whole LV valley is right before you.\n\nThe Restaurant is good too... I like that the bar area is low and has regular chairs and not bar stools. There are several TVs and you can catch up on the golf channel or whatever you want to watch while you eat. (If there isn't a crowd they will change the channel to your choice.)\n\nMenu is varied and tasty.  I've tried their salads and sandwiches... all very good.
