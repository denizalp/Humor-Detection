For whatever reason, the buffet quality seems to have died down in recent years.  Each time I go back to this one, it seems like my first experience was best and then I find things to pick on when I come back.\n\nSushi?  Blech - avoid this stuff like the plague.  I had a hand roll that tasted like someone wiped their ass with it before giving it to me.\n\nCrab legs and shrimp?  If you can get some before the throngs of folks rape the display and leave nothing but sad broken husks, then by all means, go for it - but only if you like chilled crab.  The drawn butter is clean though so that was a plus but it still wasn't enough to offset the crab legs.\n\nPrime rib?  So-so.  Trying to get a thick slice from the carver requires the Rosetta Stone program and then on top of that - they have nothing below medium on most trips.  Man - I want that stuff bleeding on my plate!\n\nDessert?  Ok.  It's hard to screw up dessert.  Thankfully this was the one redeeming part that allowed me to walk out and think three stars when I was ready to give two.\n\nI hope it improves or the Encore's buffet is good (if it has one) when it opens.
