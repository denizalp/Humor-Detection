Heard about this place from my boyfriend and all his (foodie) roommates as they live really close to this new place. Funny thing is they, initially, came here for Rice Trax - the local Hawaiian spot that was previously there.\nThey raved about the chicken karaage and his instagram video of his DIY tonkatsu sauce intrigued me. \n\nLuckily, my brother and his family took me here for a belated birthday lunch. \nDecorated with those \"good luck\" bamboo plants\/trees, various Asian prints and curtains. What a difference interior design makes in a place...It's hard to believe that Rice Trax was here.\n \nOf course, the 1st thing I did when I sat was make my very own tonkatsu sauce. Kinda fun as I've never used a mortar before. My nephew (who doesn't like sauces of any sort) even had me make some for him.\n\nWe ordered the katsu curry, chicken karaage, beef tatake, edamame, and salmon katsu. \n- Beef tataki was the winner for me. Seared beef and ponzu sauce are always a win.\n- Chicken karaage had a nice breading on it, which also made for crispy \"fried chicken.\" But, the chicken wasn't burnt. Thin pieces of chicken which made for fairly juicy chicken.\n- Katsu curry was nice. Wish the curry was a little more spicy but nothing a few chili peppers (on the side) can't solve.\n- Salmon curry was breaded as nicely as the chicken karaage and katsu. Salmon was pretty thick and didn't fall apart when bitten. The best part of that salmon katsu was the salad that came with it. Standard Asian cabbage\/slaw but, the yuzo\/ponzu dressing was amazing! The owners came by to give us more dressing =)\n- Pickled onions, cucumbers on the side were delish. You can tell the freshness and that it was homemade. The owners were telling us that they get many requests for kim chee so, that may be a possibility.\n\nOverall great experience an the food was very good. Nice to have a tonkatsu spot in the area as tonkatsu this good is few and far between.\nService was great. You can tell it's a family run business and the owners take pride in the food they serve!
