This place is awesome, I got my new Kangertech mini and they even helped me set it up and show me how to use it. There house juices are great. 6mg is perfect for a pack a day smoker and I love the Vanilla Custard and Awesome Nanner banana flavor. Island breeze is a Strawberry Pina Colada thats good too. Very friendly staff, Joel is very knowledgeable.  I will be making all my purchases there in the future and I'm happy I found them. No more stinky unhealthy cigarettes for me. Plus vaping is so much more enjoyable.
