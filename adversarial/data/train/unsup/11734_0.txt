Fab chips and salsa, you can tell it is made fresh. The service is always so friendly. The beers are cheap and served with frozen mugs. \nThere is an amazing thing that happens here...Molcajete. This dish is ridiculous. It is filled with shrimp (you can get mixed seafood too), onions, mushrooms and tomatoes in this beautiful sauce that has just the right amount of spice. It is topped with a handful of cheese and served in a screaming hot lava rock bowl. It arrives at the table bubbling and sizzling. Get it with the super fresh corn tortillas and you have a meal made in heaven. I always share it with someone because it is so much food. \nThe seafood cocktails here are great too! \nCheck out the pics I posted to see what I'm talking about.\n\nDon't come here looking for average Mexican food. There isn't a single burrito to be found. \n\nGo get some!!!!
