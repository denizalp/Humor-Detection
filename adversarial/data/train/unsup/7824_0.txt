Aida was in a sour mood working the lunch counter a recent Dec weekend. She barked my order and didn't go into the details of the different sandwiches. But she did ask if I wanted a salad. When I inquired if it came with the sandwich, she only shook her head. If I am going to be upsold, make me feel special!\n\nWhile this was happening, an older gentleman pushed past me to see what else was available for lunch. When I turned to look at him and give him a WTF look, he said my purse was in the way. Of course it's my purse. Blame me while you push past me to make your way. Not a fan of old money men who have absolutely no manners.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's nice they have a cafe that you can stop for a sandwich\/coffee while you're shopping. But not worth the stop if you end up feeling uncomfortable \/regretting you stayed there. Maybe I need to dress up like a banker next time I go there.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was delicious though! I do recommend the food!
