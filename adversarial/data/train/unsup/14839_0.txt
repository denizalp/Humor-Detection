I'm often asked by friends and fellow yelpers, \"what's a place I should try?\" Or, \"what's your favorite restaurant?\"  The answer I always unflinchingly give is Soul Gastrolounge. With that, here's everything you need to know Soul...\n\n1. LOONG WAIT. The wait to get a table can be long. Very long.  I mean its pretty simple, do NOT go to Soul on Thursday or Friday night and expect to get in and out within 2hrs.  Therefore, I only go to Soul on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  Oh, and they don't accept reservations.\n\n2.  NO LUNCH.  That's right, Soul doesn't open until 5pm.  I usually try to get there a little later in the evening; usually after the main dinner rush, around 9pm or so.  \n\n3.  DJs & Tunes! I'm not 100% sure, but I believe they have a DJ on hand Thursday - Saturday nights starting around 9pm.  The DJ's are always on point with the music and really add to Soul's trendy vibe and reputation it has around Charlotte.  \n\n4. NO PARKING.  There's no parking lot, or area exclusively for Soul's patrons.  Your best bet is to park in the lot across the street near CVS (sometimes its $5), or anywhere else around the heart of Plaza Midwood (near Thomas Street Tavern\/Whiskey Warehouse) and walking over. \n\n5. The FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!  Although I've tried many items on the menu from the pork belly sliders, to the steak and eggs which both make my mouth water, my favorite item is the Sakana Roll.  Its a tuna, salmon, avocado, sushi roll lightly fried - simply the best sushi in Charlotte!  If sushi's not your thing, don't worry there's plenty of great menu items as I said the steak and eggs or any of the skewers are great.  The humus of the day and guac stack are both great tasting, lighter options.  The french fries w\/truffle oil are out of this world yummy!! \n\n6. HIP. COOL. VIBE.  I like Soul's ambiance so much because its the perfect representation of the people and culture of Plaza-Midwood and Charlotte as a whole.  Its young, hip, chill, and different.  Everything from the walk up the black steps, to the dark interior, to the tight bar, to the blue peacock hanging behind that same bar; create a happening, mellow vibe thats unmistakeable.  \n\nSoul perfectly in-captures everything I value in a dining experience. From the amazing and unique food, to the trendy ambiance, to the phenomenal service - everything pops at Soul.  Soul, what a great name for an establishment that truly represents the heart and soul of the Queen City.
