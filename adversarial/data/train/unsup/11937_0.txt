Over priced, over rated and (look out) over head. We had heard such great things about this restaurant that perhaps we set our hopes too high...\n\nWe went to Pizzeria Bianco a few months ago for lunch. It was a bit after the lunch rush, so we didn't have to wait but the restaurant was pretty full. \n\nThe menu is a bit sparse but we figured that it was so good, they were concentrating on quality vs. quantity of menu offerings. We ordered the handmade buffalo mozzarella and basil caprese salad and a \"sonny boy\" pizza that had salami and gaeta olives. Bianco claims that they use local tomatoes and I'm not disputing that they do. However, we went in the height of the tomato season when heirlooms are at their peak and plentiful at the farmers market, yet they served us tasteless, limp tomatoes with a schmear of balsamic. I never salt my food but the mozzarella should have been brined when they made it as it had no flavor.  For a $9 appetizer, it simply was not up to par.\n\nThe pizza was also underwhelming. The crust was ok but the toppings were minimal and the cheese on top was barely cooked. I was sitting in the table at the far corner near the front of the restaurant and I kept seeing speckles of dust in the air. I made the mistake of looking up and I saw that the wooden beams in this restaurant have about an inch of dust on them that flaked down on me and my pizza during the course of my meal. I was kind of too grossed out to continue eating and I was actually too embarrassed for the restaurant to tell the wait staff who probably couldn't do anything about it anyway. \n\nHopefully, they have done a deep cleaning of the restaurant in the last few months. Honestly, if you have ever looked at the dust that accumulates on your ceiling fan if you haven't cleaned it in awhile, it looked like that x 10. Our simple lunch was about $30.. Maybe they charged us an extra topping for the dust.
