I have only been to the painted lady a few times but I do enjoy each visit. They have some unique tasting drinks, their food while limited is quite delicious and the atmosphere is quite eclectic. \n\nMy only issue with this place is the service. While the staff if friendly, I feel like they are understaffed. There is an event that I attend once a month at this venue and although they are aware of it, they continue to make one guy handle us all! My suggestion would be for them to bring on one or two more people in cases where they know they will have a big crowd.\n\nDefinitely check it out though. Its another unique business on an already growing street in Toronto.
