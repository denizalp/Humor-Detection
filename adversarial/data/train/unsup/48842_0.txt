Great food truck experience. I stop by on Food truck Thursday's at ASU. The service was fast and friendly and the pizza was extremely good. I ordered the Spicy Sausage and it was done perfectly complete with the wood fired taste. BTW, they have a full blown wood burning oven within the food truck. They also offer reasonably priced waters and other beverages.
