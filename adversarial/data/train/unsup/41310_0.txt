Do not use AT&T. I was a 2nd line on my son's account. My son passed away. There were multiple calls to AT&T for help. Customer service was willing to work with me till they found out I was going to a different carrier. They were charging MY credit card each month but then their tune changed. They became very uncooperative. They refused to give me my son's account number. I did not need it to pay the bill. Just his password and access #, which I had. they would not provide me that needed information until I took a copy of his death certificate into a store. I took it in and they canceled the account without telling me and put a Port Protection Feature on the account to stop me from transferring to a new carrier. When I called them because Consumer Cellular (lower rates) could not transport my number over, the wanted me to pay $30 to have the account turned back on and they wanted to do a credit check because reactivating my son's account was like a new account. How do you do a credit check on a dead man? After arguing and requesting a supervisor over and over and over I finally got one. The customer service person assured me I would not have to pay the $30 and would get refunded the balance of the monthly payment. She assured me her supervisor was behind her to make sure it was done correctly. I gave her MY mailing address since I was paying the bill and my son's house was sold since he died. When I tried to verify this with her supervisor, none of it was done. She lied. I had to give him all the information over again. So much for him standing behind her to make sure it was done correctly.  He told me all the same stuff she did. Time will tell if I ever see a refund and I have a sneaky feeling I will be seeing a $30 charge pop up from AT&T. It will be well worth it to get rid of them. Thank you AT&T for making a very difficult time even worse.
