Burgers were great and we loved the pickle bar. French fries had good flavor (love the Rosemary as seasoning) but we hate the shoestring fries, would prefer something thicker. They were also a bit over priced at $4 for a small portion. We also got a chocolate, banana, marshmallow milkshake and that was great too. We will return.
