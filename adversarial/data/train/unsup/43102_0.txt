Don't be surprised when you walk in - its not your typical loud Scottsdale Sushi restaurant; although, the restaurant's d√©cor represents itself just as well as the food. That being said, everything from the Nigiri to the Yakiniku was was served beautifully, and chosen tastefully by the chef. Don't be alarmed by the fixed menu, small portions, and high prices, as its the restaurant's greatest attribute.
