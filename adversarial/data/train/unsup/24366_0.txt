This place looks very cool, but it's too pretentious to get passed the door.  Half the place was empty, so we grabbed a spot at the bar.  A hostess then told us \"we have an hour and a half wait\".  Look around, no one is waiting.  Other people at the bar say, \"Yeah, she did the same thing to us, wtf\".  So we said, \"can we just stand and have a drink?\" and she says \"No, we'll just have to see you another time\".  \n\nYou will not see us another time.  Your drinks can't be that good...
