Sucks. Very bland Americanized \"thai\". My food had HAIR in IT. Presentation is nice. Cocktails are ok. Food is ultra bland and nothing like real thai food ala thai town los angeles. Boring over priced. I had a \"ginger\" fish. That was ultra fried no flavor. Where's the ginger? Tasted like fast food fish. Literally topped and seasoned with nothing. Pad thai ultra bland even though we got spicy.  Wheres the fried egg and shallots that pad thai is supposed to have? And the shrimp tasted frozen and over done. Lack luster. Tasted like microwave frozen pad thai. But it was pretty. That was its selling pointing. Never again. 70+ for meal that tasted like 10. Ultra disappointed. Had i never had an authentic thai dish i might think this place was interested. Considering the low quality of food and the ultra wait.  Not worth your money. Find a thai place that actually caters to thai people. Lame. Bland. Ultra disappointing. Never again. My companion from the east coast was also ultra disappointed. He had never had such poor bland thai food. And both of us loooove thai food. So let down to say the least. :\/
