One of the biggest failings of our modern day society is a lack of arcades. Thank god for 16bit bar... I just relocated back to my hometown and this dulls the pain somewhat. The whole place is legit, the games are treated like the fine works of functional work that they are. \n\nThey have marvel vs capcom 2 which ensures their 5star review but they have so much more i get a little overwhelmed (in a good way) everytime i visit. Games are on freeplay which i cannot complain about except to state that the old 70s and 80s games depend on the tension and satisfaction of quarters. A 1up means so much more when there is a quarter riding on it.\n\nBooze is hella stocked, prices are cool. Beer selection is expansive and they have Bourbon distilled in ohio. I like to go during happy hour around 4ish when the draft crafts are 4 bucks and you kind of have the place to yourself. Uber hip and casual friendly staff, i want to work here! Bury me under the Street Fighter machine!
