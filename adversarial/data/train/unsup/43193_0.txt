This show was amazing.  I was a bit hesitant on whether I wanted to watch it because I'm not a fan of the beatles, although I did grow up listening to their music (thanks to my brother, who is a lot older than I am), so I knew most of the songs, but even if you've never heard their songs, I think you'd enjoy the music, of course I may be wrong about that. :P  Also, I didn't know what to expect, I knew that it wouldn't be like the other cirque shows, and I'm glad that it wasn't.  Wasn't really looking forward to watching one of their regula acrobatic shows.  The show is more artsy, concentrating more on the beatles songs.  There was not a boring moment.  The only thing I found annoying was the layout of the show.  We sat in the 3rd row in section 103 and I thought it wasn't centered enough and was a bit too close.  The theater is quite small, so you don't really need to sit up front.  Also, I was lucky enough to get some sort of a student discount and they also have other promotions going on.  It's best to call them and ask before reserving your tickets.
