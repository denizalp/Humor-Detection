Well.  Seems I'm not the only one who had an issue with this company.  I also purchased a Livingsocial deal, made an appointment and the appointment was called and rescheduled on the day they were supposed to show.  Got a call on the day of the second rescheduled appointment.  This time, I put in for a refund with Livingsocial.  Would you believe that I received a call the day after the company was supposed to show asking me how service went?  The deal was marked \"used\" BY THE COMPANY.  I'm going to file a BBB complaint against Advanced Air if I don't get my money back.
