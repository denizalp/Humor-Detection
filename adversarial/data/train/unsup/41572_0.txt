Food doesn't live up to Mary Sue Milliken's name. Heartbreakingly disappointing. Good ambience and service otherwise.\n\n* Note: there is a $0.50 donation for a foundation on your check if you got tap water. \n\nFood is okay but definitely not what we were hoping for from a Top Chef Masters chef. Chicken enchilada was good. Tacos were disappointing - no complexity of flavors, just salt and fat and carbs. Fish taco was highly recommended by the waiter but it was soggy and not flavorful.\n\nBloody Mary was surprisingly watery. It tasted like diluted tomato juice. Really missed a strong tang of tomato.\n\nComplimentary chips and salsa probably were the best part of the meal.
