Don't let the outside surrounding area deter you from visiting Vickie's. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted and immediately seated in a booth. I loved seeing the pink bar stools and decor. \n\nHeidi was our waitress and she was just the sweetest. She was personable, efficient, and made our experience a great one. \n\nWe were impressed with the cooks, too. Great team work! They were super clean, too. As they cooked they were cleaning their cooking area, too.\n\nWe got there around 9:30am and around 10:15am, a group of people came in. However, Heidi didn't rush us. Again, very pleasant, refilled our cups with more coffee and assured us to take our time.\n\nWe're only here a few more days, but we'll definitely be back. If we were living here, this would be a place we would regularly visit.\n\nWhether you live here or are just visiting- please support this local business! :)
