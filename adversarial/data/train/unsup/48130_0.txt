I was immediately greeted with friendly faces. Nicolas was our waiter and very patient since it was our first time. He also had great recommendations like the house rustic margarita and steak tacos. We went with the mixed taco platter and was impressed. The lettuce option was awesome. Wasn't a fan of the pork tacos but hey.. That is 4 out of 5 different tacos that we loved. Definitely a taco paradise! We will be back!
