This place used to be the Imperial Palace hotel & Casino. I am sad that it is gone.  The Center Strip area is in desperate need of a dive establishment to serve the regular working class crowd. I found it difficult to distinguish between The Quad and Planet Hollywood. I can't believe \"Hipsters\" are taking over Vegas. The rail station inside is a plus.
