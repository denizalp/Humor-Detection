Ich liebe Deutsch Wurst. This is the best Authentic German Sausage you can get in Arizona. Family owned and operated. Inside is always clean and tidy with everything meticulously displayed so you cannot resist getting more than you should.\n\nEveryone here also speaks German as well as most of the customers. Brings back memories of hearing my Grandma talking to her friends and family when I was a little kid.\n\nThe quality and consistency of their sausage, lunch meats, cheeses, and other fine German products is exceptionable. I have been here too many times to count and have not left yet without buying a little bit of everything and more. It is hard to stop. Yummy.\n\nToday I picked up some Bratwurst, Smoked Landj√§ger, Sliced Cervelat, Bierschinken, Head Cheese (the vinegary one), some Fine Ground Calve Liverwurst, and a little Stuff Pork. Had to also get some real Imported SWISS Cheese, some Spicy German Mustard and a loaf of Rye. Don't forget some Imported German Unsalted Butter to spread on your bread.\n\nToo many tasty things to mention them all. CASH ONLY. Wunderbar!
