Picture this: It's early, you're cranky, you haven't had any coffee yet. Somehow, before heading to work, you find yourself on a gurney with no pants on. That was my morning.\n\nI headed to Rio this morning to get a Brazilian. Not the most peaceful start to a day. Sara was my esthetician and she was beyond amazing. She was gentle, efficient and absolutely hysterical. She kept me laughing throughout my 45 minutes of genital torture. I almost forgot why I had no pants on and a woman between my legs...that's how much fun we were having!\n\nSara is a total pro and a perfectionist. She made the whole process feel natural and not-so-awkward. Which, believe me, is hard to do when you're face deep in...well, you know.\n\nI'll be back to Rio! Sara is a true gem!!
