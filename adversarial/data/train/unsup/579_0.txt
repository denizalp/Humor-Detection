The more I come to any Panera the more disgusted I get with it. I was under time constraints since I had an MD visit today so needed to grab a fast bite. Place wasn't overly crowded and I noticed they now serve these soup style bowls with either chicken, quinoa, or lentils in it.\n\nI didn't want to eat too much so I ordered a vegan lentil bowl with quinoa and asked for an apple as my side. I only wanted water to drink and was given a small cup which I knew I'd have to take to the machine numerous times to stay hydrated.\n\nI was also given the notification pad and with my thinking  go up when it lit up and I did so. It was then I learned they serve your meal when it is ready and come to you. I had my bowl a few minutes afterwards. Believe me the apple had some dark spots on it that I really didn't want to eat it. I started with my bowl and to my surprise it was not the bowl I had ordered. I crossed checked my receipt to make sure the order was taken correctly and saw that it was.  I took it back and then admitted their error and shortly after got my order. Needless to say it was fair. \n\nI do like the fact that they offer free WiFi here but the same concept. Once you have finished eating you take your tray to a station where you separate the china from the recycles and the trash.\n\nPanera bread is a chain and can be a hit or miss depending upon which one you visit. It is a bakery cafe and they do post calorie counts on all their items. The place is starting to get a bit more pricey these days which is why I avoid it. This place is clean and outdoor seating is available. It sits on the end of Char Valley mall near the driver's license center. There is a rewards program with a special card but I normally don't use it.
