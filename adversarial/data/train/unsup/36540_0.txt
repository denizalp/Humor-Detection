I was really excited to come to this dumpling place and it didn't disappoint! The juice of the bao was really delicious and the bun itself was really crispy and soft at the same time. However, besides the bun, the meat and juice itself were as regular chinese dumplings are from the grocery store - nothing too special. There is a lot of juice in the bun which I appreciated!\n\nOnly disappointment was the menu having only three items! You can get four of their pan-fried dumplings, wonton soup or their noodles. They also only accept cash for orders under $20. The store is also very small, only having room for less than 10 people.
