Good food. As close to authentic as you will get in this city. Decently priced. \n\nIt's been a grueling time trying to find a place with decent Mexican food. In California this would be considered \"eh\" but in Pittsburgh it will suffice to fix my Mexican food craving (sorry Pittsburgh but mad Mex shouldn't even be allowed to put itself in the Mexican category). \n\nThis place is a lot warmer and friendlier on the inside. I walked by this place all the time but never bothered going in until yesterday. \n\nI do not recommend ordering the guacamole (it doesn't even look like it's made out of avocados). The chips are store bought. The fruit put into the sangria tastes like one of those little fruit cups. \n\nI had the carnitas plate (rice and beans and meat were all delish). My girlfriend had the vegetarian burritos and said they were both delicious. If you're vegan or vegetarian I would def recommend this place since the menu explicitly states all their rice, beans, and tortillas are vegetarian. \n\nI'll def be going back when I get a little home sick for Mexican food.
