This is a dive bar people!\nIf you consider yourself a respectable human being, you may not enjoy this place.\nGet over it, its a dive bar.\nThe wings are great, they serve cheap shitty beer, and unless you want to wake up with a splitting headache, don't drink from the taps.\nIf you love wings, and are picky, order them to go, because you will not enjoy the 'ambiance'.\nITS A DIVE BAR!!!
