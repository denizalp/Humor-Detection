If you like a good laugh, and you're like me that loves stand up comedy, this place is not to be missed. They pretty much have everything from funny books, to \"how to\" $#@!!! Hahaha   :p The adult section with specialty lollipops is quite an eye opener. They come in different sizes and girth.  Hahaha!!  There are books how to \"FYL\" and how to lighten up someone's day!  Either way, this place was a laugh and made my day!! \n\nCheers!
