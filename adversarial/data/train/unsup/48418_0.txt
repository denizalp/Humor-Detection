Where do I begin? I found out about Jimmy Johns in my college town, open real late was perfect for those late night cravings but you wanted something a bit more healthy than McDonald's or Cookout. The price is good, you can get a sub for around 5 dollars. The main thing I like about JJ is that they make it super fast. One time I ordered and just finished paying and my sub was already ready! I always get the Beach Club, Vito, or the Club LULU. Wow, I think I might go get one now.
