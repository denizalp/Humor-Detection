How did I not know this fair and this place existed? I live a mile away!!\nThe food fair was a nice way to spend a Sunday morning. It was a great excuse to finally meet some great yelpers.\n\nMy husband was a little apprehensive at first. He made a few Hangover II jokes (you know which one) when I told him I wanted to go. But now, he's all about going next time (July 28th). I think it's because we overloaded on just a couple of items and since hindsight is 20\\20, I think next time we are going to make an effort to try a bunch of little things and take advantage of the variety.\n\nAfter you trade in cash for tokens, we walked up and down the line to scope out all the food. It proved a little difficult because not all food stations had signage. All you have to do is ask. What made this event for me was how friendly and helpful the ladies of the event were. They were all sweet and appreciative of everything you buy because it goes to their church.\n\nMy husband waited in line for the chicken skewers while I waited for some pad thai. The pad thai was pretty darn good for being just $5.  The chicken skewers ($10 for a box) were good too but we aren't going to get as much next time. My husband picked out these little fried cakes with dipping sauce. He really liked it....until a fellow yelper pointed out it consisted of pureed fish (he doesn't eat fish). I would pay money to see his reaction again.\n\nFrom start to finish, this was a great experience. I definitely want to go back not just to support the monastery, but to try more stuff: the thai teas, the spices, spinach cakes, the soup, the tea leaf salad, and the sausage.\n\nIf you enjoy great thai food, put this little monthly food fair on your to-do list!
