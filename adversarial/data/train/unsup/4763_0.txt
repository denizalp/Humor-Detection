I have a new favorite sushi spot.  This is the best sushi I have had in Arizona.  \n\nI went in around 1:30 on a Saturday and sat down at the sushi bar.  The place is very cozy.  Would be a good place to go with friends and relax.  Very laid back.\n\nInstead of ordering off the menu, I asked the chef to make whatever was good today.  He started me with the blue fin sashimi.  The fish was very fresh.  The tuna melted in my mouth.  \n\nI told the chef I was still hungry and asked him to make something else for me.  He made a delicious uramaki (rice on the outside) roll with salmon (I think), wasabe (the real stuff), and mayonnaise.  This was REALLY GOOD.  \n\nLike the Hungry Caterpillar, though, I was still hungry.  The chef then presented me with an interesting dish that was avocado and fish sitting on thin slices of lemon.  Not sure what the fish was, but the blend of lemon, soy sauce, and avocado was the perfect finish to this grand lunch.\n\nWhile I ate and watched the chef, I chatted with the staff.  Everyone was very friendly.  Mikado Sushi is what going out for sushi should be: great food in a casual, friendly atmosphere.\n\nIf you like sushi and are adventurous, don't order, just let the chef decide what to make you.  It is extremely flattering to the chef, and he will go out of his way to impress you.
