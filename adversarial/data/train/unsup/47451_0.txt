1000 sq ft, a full kitchen and whirlpool bath, terrace, and only 2 blocks from the strip for only $120? Wow. Also next to 7-11. Spa and cardio-only gym and pool.\n\nNow the negatives: pool spa and gym on diff floors, valet-only parking, walk to strip a little ugly at night, a bit boring, and not upscale like Aria or Wynn, more like Harrahs or Treasure Island, no casino (+?). Still the best deal in town.
