This is a rating for their saucy chicken wings only.\n\nTheir other dishes ($5.00 lunch specials) such as gamjatang and a tofu soy-based soup with rice, atmosphere, and service garner but 3 stars at best.\n\nBut man, oh man, dem' chicken wings got me dreaming crazy things about their succulent meat, crispy skin, and slathering of completely indescribable but delicious red sauce dripping off each juicy what-the-heck-is-this-for-its-tastiness-is-beyond-words morsel. Me want some. Now.
