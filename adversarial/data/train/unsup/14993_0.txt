It cost me $14.03 for a sandwich and bottle of water at this \"grab and go\" Kiosk in one Southwest section of McCarran Restaurant. The Airport does not require community pricing like PDX, and just like the rest of Las Vegas, a good bargain is increasingly hard to find. The food was OK, and at least better than the peanuts alternative for my SWA flight back to Oakland.
