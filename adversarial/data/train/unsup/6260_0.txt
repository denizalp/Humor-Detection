I'm usually not the person to talk to about chain restaurants. I don't hate chains, but I usually am out trying to find the next great hole-in-the-wall. But when offered the chance to try something new for free, I couldn't say no (I'm stubborn, not stupid). \n\nEnter Smashburger. The logo looks like they bought their logo design from the same designer that made Gamestop's, but they definitely don't play any games with their burgers. Surprisingly, all of the ingredients on my Arizona burger looked and tasted absolutely fresh! By fresh, I even mean that the jalape√±os looked sliced, in house, and were as green as you'd get them from the supermarket. Also, the patty looked (was not a perfect circle) and broke apart like real ground beef! Those kind of little touches makes me happy. With my AZ burger, I got the smash fries (fries tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic), and they hit the spot. They were full of flavor without being soggy or greasy.\n\nI gotta hand it to Smashburger, it's not bad. I would definitely come here on lunch breaks occasionally if I didn't work in North Scottsdale; I think it would be a perfect place for that. But I am sure I'll be back to dine here at some point. I think Fred M nailed it when he said, \"This place is to burgers what Chipotle is to burritos...\" It's a chain restaurant that wants to provide the type of fast food that is more appreciated nowadays - fresh (but not frozen), fast (but not microwaved) and filling (but not because you super-sized it).
