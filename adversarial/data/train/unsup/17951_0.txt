I couldn't even manage to schedule a consultation with the man that I just spoke with. \n\nHe was very rude, \nsounded impatient,\n as if he had better things to do..\nHe didn't even offer me his name.\n\nLooking on their website, there is a nice looking lady, smiling, sitting in front of a computer...... She must have been busy, or on vacation.\n\n I waited for him to get his calendar, which tells me that they must not have an up to date system... I have never called some place to schedule an appointment and had to wait for them to get something, or to wait for their computer to load..\n\n.Because they are READY to treat customers.!\n\nHe asked me when I would like to come in, \nand I asked him what was the soonest day he had available. \n\nHe then asked me, \"What day\"\n\nI JUST ASKED YOU. WHAT IS THE SOONEST DAY?\nWhy are you asking me what day?\n\n\nI asked him about tomorrow, (Friday) \n\nHe then asked me what time.\nI asked for what he had available, \nand he said he had something at 3pm.\n\nI told him that wouldn't work, and I asked him about Monday, in the morning.\n\n\"what time?\"\n\nIn the morning....................Like I just said. \n\nIn the morning on Monday, \nif you have something available in the morning, \nyou know, like before noon...?!?! \n\n**YOU** know what you have available, \nand what you don't, \nso WHY do I have to play Russian roulette with appointment times?\n\nI had enough, and I hung up.\n\n***Any other place that I have called to get a consultation from is ready, and willing with what they have available, on what days. I didn't have to pull teeth.\n\nHopefully, you will have better luck than I did.\n\n**\nComment from rebecca g. of Serenity Tattoo Removal\nBusiness Owner\n8\/18\/2014 Your review insinuates that We are a rude company, but you hung up on us, after asking what time you wanted. Who was being rude?\n**\n\nRebecca,\nbasic phone etiquette is for employees to IDENTIFY themselves. \nYour employee did NOT.\n\nWas I wrong for hanging up...? Yeah, I could have handled it better.\n\nIf I can say that I could have handled myself better, you, as a manager could probably understand that there is the possibility that the man who answered the phone was in a bad mood....instead of just calling me rude..\n\n....because that's  PROFESSIONAL. So, am I really \"insinuating\"..?\n\n\nMaybe teach your employees better phone etiquette. You can Google it, FYI.
