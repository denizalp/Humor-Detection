I'm bummed to see that Dish Functional All Chefs has closed! The punny name and juicy Lucy burgers brought me in, but this location just does not seem to be conducive to consistent business. Staff were friendly when I visited and it seemed they tried several promotions and specials to bring in traffic (rice bowl Wednesdays and Vegan Sundays!) but this is the second solid spot to utilize the kitchen and not be able to stay open.  I've heard rumor the staff are working on a different menu and planning to reopen, and I'm crossing my fingers it's true while simultaneously kicking myself for not revisiting when I had the chance.
