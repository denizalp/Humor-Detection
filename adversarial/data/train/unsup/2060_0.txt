This place is truly quite bad. I've been waiting anxiously for nearly 4 years for it to close so a new Asian restaurant can open up in it's space (just like all the other failed businesses on the Bloor-Annex strip) but people must be spending money here or maybe their lease isn't up for renewal yet.\n\nAnyway, it's very small, dingy, cramped and OUTDATED. It reminds me of the type of hardware store my dad would take me to back in the mid-80s, before the big chain stores like Home Depot opened up.\n\nI'm not sure what it's hours of operation are, but it seems to be operating on small town business hours from the 1980s as well. It's shut by 5pm on Saturdays, closed Sundays and closed early on weekday evenings. \n\nWieners is such a dud name too. Doh.
