Do NOT come here! My friends and I went here to eat on 2-3-2016 and we all got really bad food poisoning! One of my friends got it really bad and was vomiting with diarrhea after an hour of leaving this place! The next day our employee immediately had her emitted to urgent care where she was checked and had samples done showing that it was in fact food poisoning! She called this facility and the manager admitted to the meat not being up to proper health standard grade and told her that he would pay for medical bills as long as she does not post anything on social media about this establishment giving her hazardous food. We just left this establishment as we handed them the medical bills and they refused to pay $75 for the medical visit and $50 for the medicines...instead we were reimbursed for only $20 of the meal. We are having an attorney handle this case. But please be aware and avoid!
