Wolfgang Puck's dishes are tasty. \nMaine crabcakes, calamari, meatloaf, and salmon are fresh and flavorful. The calamari is very meaty and the salmon piece was very large. Topped with mushrooms, salad, and potatoes.\nThe crabcakes are small and comes in four. Costly for the price, but one of the best orders.\nService was alright. Only had someone check up on me once. The most responsive were the ones who took our plates away.
