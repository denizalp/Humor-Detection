A blogTO article under the title of \"Best Bubble Tea in Toronto\" led me to Coco Fresh Tea & Juice. It is a clean and spacious bubble tea joint that I never knew existed.  \n\nDefinitely comparable to other bubble tea places, but this one is somewhat limited in drink selections. Our first time visiting (thanks to Yelp reviews), I decided to try the 2 ladies drink. Mmmmm yum! Milk tea + pudding + tapioca ^_^\n\nSecond visit we decided to customize our drink. \nMilk tea + sago + pudding + herbal jelly.\nOHEMGEE it was deelish! Almost Godly. The sago instead of the usual tapioca made the drink so much better. \n\nEven with 30% sugar & more ice the drink was still quite sweet (the sago was sweet). But so unique & yummy. \n\nHighly recommend. I have yet to try their macchiato or latte but it looks very promising. Next week!
