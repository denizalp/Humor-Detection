Oh Sprouts! It's always nice to shop feeling like you're hobnobbing among the other elitist vegans and clean eaters when in reality I'm just trying to get the best ingredients for my curry! I love the huge selection of Asian inspired foods, from their different curry pastes, different types of noodles, and all of the accompanying sauces. The tofu is really great too! Of course- if possible I always shop at the Asian market closest to me but this is a good alternative.\n\nEverything is really organized and navigating through the aisles is a pleasant experience as everything you need is placed where it should be. Feeling Mexican food? BAM! Mexican aisle. Chinese? BAM! Asian food aisle.\n\nThe produce is always fresh and crisp! And there are always people available to help you. Their meat selection is also awesome. I get the lamb about once a week and it's so inexpensive compared to a lot of other places. \n\nI can't write a review about Sprouts without mentioning their olive bar. Oh my God it's to die for they have different types of olives, cheeses, and spices that you can put in a bowl and take on your merry way out! Can't beat it!
