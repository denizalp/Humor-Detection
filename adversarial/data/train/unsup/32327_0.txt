Just had their lunch sushi bento box today.  It included about 8 pieces of sushi, 6 roll pieces, noodles, miso soup and a salad.  Pretty typical for the sushi specials in markham.  For under $10, it's a decent deal.  As someone who likes prompt service, it's great to have a buzzer option to call the waitress. Even without this option, they are generally attentive.  \n\nI'd have to rate the quality as decent for the price- after all I keep eating and eating here (4-5 times in past 4 months)...
