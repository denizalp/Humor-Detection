We come here often and always leave so happy! Best sushi downtown- really blows anything else out of the water. They have the freshest fish, amazing service and a fabulous atmosphere. If they have specials, try them! This is the type of spot that makes the most recent deliveries the special- not the stuff that will need to be thrown out at the end of the night. And the oh my god roll is amazing- much more than its theatrical presentation! You will love Harumi and once you go, will not visit anything else in central Phoenix when you need to hit the spot.
