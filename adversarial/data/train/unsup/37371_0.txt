What a surprisingly affordable meal in a place that really doesn't offer cheaper alternatives.  They food was good, with some surprisingly great dumpling offerings.  In comparison the the alternate Asian offering in this hotel - go to Red 8.  Not a lot of difference in the menus (generic type Asian fusion) but this one is at least half the price.  Coming from an Asian dominated culture, this type of food shouldn't be ripping a hole in your pocket and Red 8 doesn't.
