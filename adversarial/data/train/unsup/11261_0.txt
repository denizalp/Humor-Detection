Mediocre food and wait staff. I ordered the special French toast.  Nothing special about it.   It was suppose to be stuffed with Marscapone cheese.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  And the cherry compote was very unappealing to look at as it was very dark brown. I would rather of had cherries in a jelly.   Probably wont be going back any time soon.
