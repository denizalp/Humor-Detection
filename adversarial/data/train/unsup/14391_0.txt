I was disappointed with this place.  The good:  Large spaces, nice amenities, 24 hour pool and gym hours, underground parking to keep my car cool.\n\nThe bad:  internet speed sucked, I could hear everyone around me through the thin walls.  One morning the neighbor next to me started the washing machine and left.  the machine was unbalanced and banged, and banged, and banged...  all morning long!  horrible!  the day after that my neighbor on the other side must have been on a honey moon, as the bed banged up against our wall al evening.  We did call security, and the issue continued all evening.  If your room faces the pool - expect to hear the music from the pool all day long, and if they have an event going on - you will hear two types of music, which will drive you crazy.  I did not appreciate all the cab drivers blocking the entrance to this place.  it seemed that every time I wanted to leave the hotel, a cab was blocking traffic to exit the facility - all the time!  frustrating...
