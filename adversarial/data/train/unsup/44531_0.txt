I will be the 1st one to tell you that Harrah's isn't one of the sexiest casinos on the Strip. The only reason I would even come here in the first place is the Oyster Bar. Well now I am going to add one more thing to check out at the Harrah's casino - the Mac King Show.\n\nThis is one of those shows that often get overlook pretty easily because Vegas has so many big name shows like Cirque du Soleil, Blue Man Group, Criss Angel \/ David Copperfield, etc. You want to watch any of those shows I just mentioned? Well the cheapest seats are typically AT LEAST $50+ per person (unless you have hotel comps ... but those aren't something everyone has access to).\n\nPrice: I visited the Tix 4 Tonight booth and got one general ticket for $29 (including tax and other fees). In hindsight, Yelp actually offers a pretty good deal ($24 for a voucher redeemable for $50). You can also visit the Harrah's Total Rewards for a discount voucher, but I didn't want to pay more (general admission price was about $40 ~ $45 per person) for two for one buffet, free upgrade to VIP seating, and free drink at the bar.\n\nShow time & location: This is one of the few shows in Vegas that starts at 1 PM & 3 PM. To find the theater, just locate the cashier cage in Harrah's and take escalator to the 3rd floor.\n\nContents: Lots of clean PG13 adult humor as well as kid humor. Expect rope tricks, card tricks, audience participation, the \"invisible\" trick, and the signature gold fish trick.\n\nFor what you are paying for, I think this is a pretty solid Vegas magic show.
