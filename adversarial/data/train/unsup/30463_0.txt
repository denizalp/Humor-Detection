I have been dying to try Fugo for quite some time! I actually saw a ton of people holding their massive ice cream cones on the streets, so of course I had to visit Fugo to get in on the trend. \n\nIt opens in the afternoon (3 pm), which is a really odd time in my opinion. There was a lot of people inside, and generally the interior was quite messy from ice cream droplets and crumbs from cones. It would be nice if it was a little cleaner. The decoration really only consisted of a gigantic wall chalk mural, and children can doodle all over if they wanted to. \n\nThe ice cream comes in very generous portions, but the entire time I was eating my cone, I felt immense fear that my ice cream scoop would fall off onto the ground. My Cookie Monster ice cream tasted quite milky, and it was adorned with crispy mini cookies. The ice cream was fun and creamy- I love how you can pick your cone (either s'mores or chocolate). Just an FYI, the Cookie Monster dyed my lips blue! I couldn't wash it off, and the color slowly transitioned to black. We also got the Cookies n' Dream, which is delicious and comes with cute oreos and hersheys bars. \n\nI'm really excited to try out the other flavors, and hopefully when I come back it'll be less crowded!
