Lot's of potential - if they get their act together!!\n\nFelt like having a Cuban sandwich so I went here. First off it is a nice rustic place to sit interestingly designed. Most people were not eating but having coffee. You feel like you are not really in a restaurant, and by the end of the visit you REALLY feel like you are not in a restaurant. The menu is small: \n\n4 different sandwiches\n1 empanadas\n2 type croquettes\nfries\n1 pita\n\n(Warning sign #1)\nWe ordered: 2 banana smoothies (only one came out immediately) and 2 sodas. The second banana smoothie came out 1\/2 hour later. No exaggeration.\n\nThe croquettes came quickly as well and were good, on the menu they were $.75 cents.\n\n(Warning sign #2) \nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE 3 Cuban sandwiches you ask? When you are the first people in the place?? Exactly 1 hour and 10 min!! NO JOKE - I timed it. The sandwiches are simple to make and of the 4 on the menu they are all pretty similar so there shouldn't be a long process to making them. Buns were hard, way too toasted on the top so you have to maneuver them as you eat, being careful not to damage any gum tissue from the sharp bread!\n\n(Warning sign #3)\nThe croquettes suddenly jumped from $.75 cents to $1.25 each on the bill.\nHuh??\n \n3 Cubans\n3 croquettes\n1 order of fries\n2 sodas\n2 smoothies\n\n= $55 = Too much to be annoyed.\n\nThis place won't be around in a year.
