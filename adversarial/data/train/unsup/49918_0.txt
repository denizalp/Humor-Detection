I marked a \"1\" rating mainly for the problem below but I would first like to comment on how wonderful Dr. Jeppesen is! He is a professional while still being approachable and open to the patient. I would recommend Dr Jeppesen to anyone with foot or ankle issues! \n\nThat being said, that has been the only highlight I have ever had at the CORE.  I was referred to Dr Ughwanogho (a spine ortho) because Dr Jeppesen believed that the problem I was having in my leg could have come from my back. I had an MRI and I had to wait 2 1\/2 months for an appointment and when I had my appointment yesterday, I waited 2 HOURS. When the Dr walked in, he was arrogant, unprofessional, and downright catty. The first piece of attitude I received was \"why would you be here to see me, your back doesn't hurt\" followed by the same type of comment against chiropractors. His entire dress speaks arrogance right down to no socks with his shoes? Please, that went out with Miami Vice. He had not prepared to see me, had not looked at my MRI until that point and after a few seconds, he told me he couldn't see anything and gave me a look like I was making up the pain. Told me he could not help me and that some pain just had to be endured. Baloney! Next he just tried to throw more medication towards me to treat for overall pain (which I refused). The man had me dismissed a few moments after he walked into the room. I was angry and upset because NO patient should be treated like I was! It was a very short meeting that I had the pleasure? of paying for what??? Extremely long wait combined with the sanctimonious and intolerant attitude towards any patient cannot be tolerated! I could not believe the treatment I received at the CORE by this person! I will certainly NOT go back to see this person. Hard to title him as a doctor!
