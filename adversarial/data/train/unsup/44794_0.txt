I'm a fan of NYPD coz i think they have really good pizzas. I have a NY bias and altho there's very few places that are able to come up with a true NY style pizza, NYPD is close enough. There are four pizzas that I order at NYPD and they are: Pizza Blanca, Da Works, Joey's Favorite and Cheese. I love their Pizza Blanca which is made with Olive oil, crushed garlic, ricotta, mozzarella with your choice of spinach or Roma tomatoes. *yum* I've always liked it with spinach but I have to admit it's exceptional with the tomatoes!! Da Works is their version of supreme, and their Cheese reminds me of pizza by the slice at any pizza place in Queens but not as good as the cheese at this pizza joint my family frequents in Whitestone, NY. \n\nTheir strengths are their pizzas. AVOID the calamari, it's yuck and if you've never had calamari this should not be the place to try it... it's GROSS! Their lasagna is not half bad, and their wings are good. Overall, this is one of my go to places if I'm craving pizza or buying takeout. It's true NYPD it's your pizza I trust!
