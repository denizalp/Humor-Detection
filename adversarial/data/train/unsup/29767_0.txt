This gym has been my gym for about 2 years. I love how friendly everyone is. But more importantly, the equipment is awesome! I love the turf field--great for sprints with the sleds, etc. Independence has great hours; the only problem is that it gets pretty busy from 5-7 pm...but that's to be expected.
