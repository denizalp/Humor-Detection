Kinda dumpy, and not entirely in an endearing, it's-an-almost-hundred-year-old-place kinda way.  Service was ok-ish, music terrible (live music Friday nights - not a fan myself).  This place gets 4 stars for the food.  Burger and fries.  Epic win.  Burger with bacon, dried apples (??? I know, right?!) and a huge gob of blue cheese on an english muffin.  Fries were awesome, too, served with a giant cuppa ketchup.  Burger was slightly overdone, unsure whether there was ordering confusion or what happened (I shared the burger w\/ a friend, we both agreed it was awesome despite unfortunate well-doneness).  I liked my drink, I paid 15.50 for two of em which is a pretty good deal.  \n\nAll-in-all, a surprisingly accessible yet highly unique place - offbeat.  Seems like it needs a look at the details - a fresh coat of paint, so to speak.  I'm totally coming back here when I need a place with character.  I'm psyched about getting the food here again, too.
