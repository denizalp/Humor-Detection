I came here for dinner one day after work with fellow Yelpers Darren R, Dan S, and a large group of our close friends.  Some of us got there a little early and were able to partake in their happy hour drink specials at the patio bar, while we waited for everyone to arrive.  Their beer specials are good, but they're only available at the patio bar...lame. \n\nWe had a reservation for a table on the patio and it was a great, pleasant dining experience.  Their patio is really a nice place to enjoy a good meal, especially with the gorgeous weather we had that evening.\nOur server was attentive and we didn't have to wait too long for our entr√©es to arrive after ordering.  I decided on the Beef Short Ribs with Ricotta Gnocchi after reading P W's review and holy toledo, he was right!  It was absolutely delicious!  The fresh gnocchi was pillowy soft and creamy, cooked just right and the short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth super tender!  I let Dan S and his wife each try a piece of gnocchi and they also enjoyed it. Darren R had a burger which looked really good and and Dan had a pizza, which he said was da bomb yo!  (yeah, he still talks like that in public...)\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their meals, even though I couldn't see what my friends down at the other end of the table had ordered.  \n\nIt was a great night for all and I'd definitely come back again to try some other tasty morsels! I heard their brunch is worth checking out. \nGreat food, cold drinks, and cool company! Come spend some bucks at Luxe! You'll love it! Cheers, Cleveland!
