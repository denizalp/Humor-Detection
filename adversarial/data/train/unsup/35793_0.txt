Convenient place to get breakfast and lunch.\n\nAte @ Steve's twice in one day.\n\nKitchen and servers were great with healthier breakfast substitutions - egg white omelet was delish.\n\nLunch was so-so, salad was a generous portion. Lunch plates seemed to be big volume - but I would have preferred a smaller portion with fresher & better quality veggies.\n\nMy morning waitress and afternoon waiter were both friendly and attentive. Steve's is convenient and flexible for people of all tastes.
