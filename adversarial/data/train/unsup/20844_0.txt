So the company I now work for is based out of Pittsburgh, and the execs surprised us with wonderful Christmas gifts, packaged and delivered to us all from Bella's.  Can you say Awesome!\n\n(Good thing when you shop local, ya know)\n\nThe box came wrapped as a present.   I rarely get presents these days, so your girl Valerie wasted no time and ripped into it...screw waiting for Christmas.  Inside were SERIOUSLY decadent desserts, some covered in thick layers of chocolate, some decorated into Christmas trees with thick layers of icing, some covered in powdered sugar, ALL of them fresh.  Cookies.  Brownies.  Mini pies.   You name it, we have it!\n\nWhew!  These desserts are not for the faint of heart.  Some of em a tad bit too sweet, but hey...it's Christmas.  Let your hair down. \n\nThank you to my company for such a thoughtful gift, and thank you to Bella's for the wonderful treats with lovely presentation.  I'm going to eat them all.\n\nBut Now off to my new gym.\n\nCowboys Nation!  2015!
