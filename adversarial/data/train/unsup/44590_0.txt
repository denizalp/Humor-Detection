Bungalow is a great place to be on Sunday morning.  They have really cheap mimosas that are actually made with some okay sparkling wine.  You won't get the cheap mimosa hangover.  \n\nThe food is decent.  Nothing to write home about but not bad in any way.  I always end up getting the Kamikaze burger.  It comes with crusted fried avocado and a really spicy mayo.  Yum.\n\nThey have tons of outdoor seating, an outdoor bar counter, and misters.  Important in Arizona.  They also have televisions all over the place and during football season you can always catch a game on a Sunday.  If you don't like the teams on the set in front of you, you simply need to turn your head to another screen or find another seat.  Perfect.  Burgers, football, beer, and you don't have to clean up.
