This buffet is very popular with tourists looking to save a buck. The best feature of this buffet is that you can help yourself with the fountain drinks, coffee, etc and not have to rely on waiting for a server for refills. The food is okay. The bussing service was slow but staff was courteous. The thing we had to watch out for was a lot of sick and sneezing  customers-----one of whom directed his spray onto the carving station (roast beef). The freshmade pasta station was pretty good though. I had the shrimp fettuccine with pesto. I would come back again if starving.
