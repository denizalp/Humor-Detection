American Fish offers a nice little happy hour from 5:00pm - 7:00pm, Sundays through Fridays.  Happy hour offerings include a selection of appetizers for $5.00 each, along with a handful of cocktails, beers and wines coming in at $7.00 each.  Note that the appetizers are small, though!  About two-three bites per appetizier kind of small.  Between two kinda-hungry people we ordered six appetizers and two desserts, so even with happy hour pricing expect each person to pitch in $15-$20 (before drinks).\n\nSo, you end up here during happy hour, and you're wondering what to order?  Well, whatever you order, be sure to save a tiny bit of room for dessert.  You have to try the cheesecake!  This cheesecake has the softest and creamiest consistency that I've had.  It'll melt in your mouth and make you want to eat the whole thing when no one else is looking.  But that would be mean, so you really should order one piece of cheesecake for each person.  Honestly, it's a hard dessert to willingly share.  As for the rest of the meal:\n\nFoie Gras Poppers - These are small.  Like, the diameter of a quarter small.  Tasty, but imagine if you got a cheeseburger the size of a quarter; small bun, small meat, small cheese, right?  How can you distinguish the flavors?  This is actually the first time I've tasted Foie Gras, so I couldn't really tell you how it tasted!  It was good, but I don't know why exactly.\n\nTuna Melt - This was another treat.  For some reason my tastebuds only like tuna if it is sashimi\/sushi.  Tuna sandwich, tuna melt...no thank you!  But this tuna melt had some very good white cheddar that mixed with the tuna to make for a delicious sandwich.\n\nShrimp & Grits - It's shrimp!  With grits!  \n\nTruffled Mac & Cheese - This was tasty since the truffle had a very pronounced flavor.  Not overbearing, but it had enough presence to give it a pleasant flavor.  None of that, \"This taste like regular mac & cheese!\" business here!\n\nFish & Chips - It's fish!  And chips!\n\nPrime Rib Sandwich - It's not really a sandwich...since the prime rib is sitting on top of a piece of ciabatta bread; not bread on top.  Still, the prime rib was quite tasty.  The horseradish didn't have much kick, if you're into that sort of thing.  I know I am.  \n\nOverall American Fish offers a pleasant happy hour.  The drink selection at happy hour pricing is rather limited when compared to their entire cocktail menu (three cocktails, three beers and three wines make up the happy hour selection).  Still, it makes for a nice alternative to a full meal on The Strip.
