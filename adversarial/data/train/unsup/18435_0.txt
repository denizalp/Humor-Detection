I am deeply saddened to hear Nature's Bin is closing. This has been a fixture in the community for years. They have helped raise the health consciousness of the citizens of Lakewood and was the polar opposite of the old McDonald's next door that pumped fat into the veins of the people on Sloane. \n\nDonald Trump wants to build a wall. I want to build a wall and keep the people of Rocky River out of Lakewood and keep people from Lakewood from going over there. It is a tale of two cities. One city sucks and that city is not Lakewood. Thanks Whole Foods! Stay down in Austin you stinking gold bricking idiots!
