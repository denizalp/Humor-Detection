Amazing!!! all their seafood is flown in from around the world within 24 hours. Super fresh, its all on display where you can go look at all the fish and pick what you want. the Charred octopus was my favorite, I love octopus but I'm very picky about it and this was the best I've ever had. Super clean and simple. I love that I could taste the fish and not just salt and seasoning which most places overdo on grilled fish. Service was fantastic, super friendly and very knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients of the food. I love to know how things are made. Fantastic drinks and they constantly give you new silverware, plates, and clean up crumbs. Two Thumbs up
