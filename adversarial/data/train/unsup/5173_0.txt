This is a fun experience just off the strip in Vegas. A six course pre-fix Moroccan feast and the food is delicious. Pace yourself as you will not leave hungry. Belly dancing is included as part of the fun. The restaurant is decorated so that you feel you are sitting in a Sultan's tent. Highly recommend this restaurant.
