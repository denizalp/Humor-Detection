pretty good noodles, affordable cantonese family that i never had.\n\nfamily owned. mom works the register, runs food, and cooks. thinking of hollering at her daughter. you know, help out the fam.\n\nthe son is actually the star of the restaurant, had a line of skinny boys out the door trying to get his number. i must admit, he's a hottie~~!
