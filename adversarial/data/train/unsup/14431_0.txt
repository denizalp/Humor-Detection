Once upon a time I couldn't tell my shawarma from my taouk but Montreal certainly does not lack for Lebanese food.  As it turns out, the whole hummus, falafel, tabbouleh thing squares up pretty good against a traditional north american diet.  I mean they've got potatoes, bread and meat that's being barbecued...vertically! Which is certainly good news since there's practically as many shish taouk places as there are Starbucks.\n\nShawarmaz caught my eye not only because it's close to the office, but it doesn't have that sketchy look about it that so many of the kebab places around the city seem to have.  That's not to say it isn't odd, because while they apparently have an advertising budget that afforded them a fancy sign, the restaurant is in the back of a Subway Sandwich shop. In a way, being in the back of a Subway can be spun as an advantage.  If the shawarma isn't looking too appealing, a 6\" or foot long is right at hand.\n\nPrices are in line with other lunch spots nearby at about $10 a head.  The plate of food is huge.  I'm not exactly an expert on the cuisine, but I've always enjoyed it.  The chicken wasn't dried out, the potatoes were well-seasoned and probably most telling is that the fresh salad actually seemed fresh.  Sure it's not 5-star cuisine, but it's falafels and kebabs, more or less the Lebanese hamburger.\n\nWhat cemented this spot in my arsenal of downtown lunchtime dives was the staff. Believe it or not they were actually friendly.  Not really the Lebanese McDonald's, maybe more like the Lebanese Wendy's. Anyways at the very least it beats the shopping mall food courts that saturate the area.
