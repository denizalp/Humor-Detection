Great service and lots of space. With so many Korean BBQ in the area, those two points really stand out. \n\nFood was good although it may be a bit higher than other Korean BBQs. Ordered two beefs and a pork belly. Pork belly wasn't as good as piggys and one of the beef was really tender while a second order wasn't as good. \n\nBut the fact that I didn't need to wait to be seated, had Lots of space so I didn't need to be crowded or lean in to listen to my guests, really made a difference. Nearby kobi was loud and crowded with limited parking. Seoul house was much better to access. And the servers were very friendly and prompt with their service. \n\nIt's an older restaurant but I will definitely be back. \n\n3.5 stars out of 5. \n\nJimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:\n[*] Disappointing. Just...no. \n[**] Not very good. Will not return. \n[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. \n[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. \n[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time.
