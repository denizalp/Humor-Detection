THREATENING BEHAVIOUR.\nI was threatened by one of the employees ( whose name rhymes with a popular children's toy) to meet him outside of work when he was out of uniform to give me a piece of his mind! When he realized he had threatened me, he ran into the manager's office to be able to word the story his way first. LADIES: PLEASE BE CAREFUL AT THIS GYM.  IF YOU CAN, GET OUTTTTT!!! there is much sexism and potentially violent behaviour at this gym!  I will have the 911 already dialed on my phone ready to hit send anytime i have to walk by this place. Supremely unprofessional staff members.
