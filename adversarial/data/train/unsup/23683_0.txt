I decided to try this restaurant today despite some poor reviews online. The reviews were fairly consistent: OK food, pricy, and restaurant is dirty. Had to try for myself and my experience was exactly the same. The food was OK. I enjoyed the Copper Burger but the oven baked fries were soggy and way too salty. $45 for 2 burgers and drinks and a shared side order of fries. \n\nThe problem is that every free table in the restaurant hadn't been wiped clean and crumbs and food residues from previous meals still covered them. You can't put your hands - let alone your food on a table without cleaning it yourself. Dirty dishes and uneaten food covered the counters. (I noticed a lot of leftover fries. Maybe too salty for others?)\n\nThe restaurant wasn't busy and there were two staff working so I find this pretty inexcusable. I'd love to eat their food again but the management needs to start taking these comments seriously to get my business again.
