Uhmazing house made icecreams! Personal fave is coffee milk tea and cardamom vanilla. Super nice staff, seriously they're really nice. Cute, clean interior with a calm atmosphere. It's on the smaller side, not too much seating.\n\nThey only have brewed coffee though if you're looking for a more extensive coffee\/espresso menu.
