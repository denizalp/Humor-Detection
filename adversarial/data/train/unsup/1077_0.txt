Foods decent but these fucktards charge a $1 for straight out of a bag, mixed in a bucket ranch. Huh? After charging premium summerlin rates for everything on the menu (including $2-$4 for toppings) they want to hit me with a $1 for ketchup's distant cousin??? I guess that keeps out the riff raff. That said, the meatballs are good. So there.
