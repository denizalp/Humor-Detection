My husband and I decided to switch over our accounts and meet with a banker to get some general advice on where to go next with our money.\n\nFrom the get-go the customer service was excellent.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in the bank, offered water and made quite comfortable.  Three separate bankers approached us to ensure we were being taken care of.\n\nKen, the gentleman we had the pleasure of working with took the time to get to know us a bit, and even had my husband and I take a test to see how our priorities aligned.  We discussed our immediate needs, our longer term goals and how we could explore additional savings in our day to day lives.\n\nWe opened an account and found the process to be quite easy, and for banking, surprisingly painless.  We have additional meetings set up to discuss some issues like refinancing our mortgage or perhaps even new vehicle.  \n\nThis experience was excellent, and mirrors all the previous experiences I had when they were servicing a different account.  I am very glad we made the decision to move our money to Wells Fargo.  \n\n(*Full disclosure, my spouse is an employee, but not at a branch, or in any way related to the services we received.)
