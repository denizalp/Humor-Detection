Really enjoyed this place. The service was great. Liked the atmosphere and that if I wanted to bring my dog with me we could both enjoy the patio. \nThe brunch drink specials were so worth it. My michelada  really hit the spot after the shopping. The tuna \"burger\" with a side of cucumber salad was perfectly rare and very flavorful. There are several items that beg to be tried on the menu, so a return visit is a must.
