Went to see Cake on our anniversary.\nIt's a pretty nice venue, not my favorite in town but nice none the less. \nPark at The Linq parking lot, it's a short walk away to The BB and  lots of shops and restaurants.\nWe didn't eat or bowl while inside but we did drink, nice selection of booze but the prices are steep. Our concert tickets were a bit pricey too, compared to other shows we've been to in town.\nThe sound was good, no complaints, it wasn't over crowded, even on the floor. I think the floor is a bit small but it's nice to be able to actually see who is singing. There are only a few tables with chairs, so expect to stand. The floor is flat, so you will have an obstructed view if you are short. \nIt's a cool place, lots of great shows are scheduled. I will definitely go back!
