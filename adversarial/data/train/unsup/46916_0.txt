I recently moved to Pittsburgh from Southern California, so, to be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting much in terms of options for asian restaurants here. But I have to say that I've been pleasantly surprised. Lately I've been ordering the pork chop over rice and black tea (half sugar) at various Taiwanese cafes in the area (e.g., Rose Tea Cafe, Cool Ice Taipei) to establish a baseline of sorts for what I consider to be pretty standard Taiwanese fare.\n\nHaving said that, the pork chop over rice ($7.50) here is quite good. Lately, my main concern has been the amount of vegetables served with the pork chop. At Rose Tea and Cool Ice for example, they skimp on the veggies, leaving me feeling bloated from the disproportionally large portion of fried pork chop. Lucky for me, I Tea Cafe provides bigger portions of veggies; the only downside is that their version excludes the marinated egg, which happens to be one of my favorite parts about the meal.\n\nWhat's more, I found the Sun Moon Lake Black Tea ($3.25 for 16 oz.), a dark auburn tea with a special sweet aroma and woodsy flavor, to be quite enjoyable and distinct from black teas at other Taiwanese cafes in the area. \n\nOverall, this is a solid Taiwanese cafe with food you'd expect to find at reasonable prices. I'll be back to try their hot pot, beef noodle soup, and other teas.\n\nNOTE: $15 minimum for credit cards.
