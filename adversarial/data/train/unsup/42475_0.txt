Alright, after a few more visits to the place, I am sold. The service is not always as bad as it was the one time, sometimes you do get stuck behind regulars but most of the time they are actually quite fast and helpful. Plus the cappuccinos are amazing. They also have these dense cinnamon buns that are to die for. They actually have chunks of cinnamon and brown sugar in them, they're amazing. They also have gluten-free muffins and cookies.
