There are certain truths in life that are simply infallible. One of those truths is: trust stoners to make your food. No one has doe-eyed love for consumptive gluttony like someone so stoned they can barely think. You want the proprietor of your chow to have such little outside awareness that your dumb meal becomes their world.\n\nFor that matter, there is a cynical sheen to the whole marketing effort of Cheba Hut. A pot-themed sandwich joint smack in the middle of the college shopping experience seems a little too cutesy to me. I am, of course, a frowny joyless grandpa though. So don't read too much into my grousing about the marketing. Down to brass tacks.\n\nThe food. Man, the food. All ingredients I've experienced (\"experienced,\" you guys) have been very fresh and tasty. Plenty of great combos from standard hams and turkeys to more exotic like Thai chicken. Lots of sauce choices and dessert options too. Everything has a ridiculous\/amusing name, so do some reading to figure out what is actually on the stupid thing.\n\nCheba Hut is like when your weird 14-year-old brother keeps bugging you about checking out his likely awful garage band. Just bad covers of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Weezer, you think as you step into the garage. And you know what? The band is pretty good. They're all dressed unfortunately and the whole affair is kinda sloppy but the band is pretty damn good. That's Cheba Hut.\n\nGet a sandwich from people who think that life is just an unending Scooby Doo cartoon. Do it.
