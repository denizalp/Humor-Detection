The crime rate is increasing within the apartment community, STAY AWAY! The stolen car and break-in incidents are becoming a trend and are happening almost on DAILY basis now. The lack of responsiveness from the apartment management indicates that they simply do not care. The only thing that has been offered as a solution so far is some 'safety meeting'. No solid short term as well as long term actions have been identified and taken to prevent and eliminate the incidents of crime. These are supposed to be high-end apartments and you are charged a premium rent, but by no means, they are proven to be so. I signed the lease based on the previous reviews when, once up on a time, the apartment community used to be crime-free and well-maintained. The quality of service is also deteriorating:\n1. The  maintenance\/service requests are taking longer and longer to close out. \n2. The valet waste service, which you pay $30+\/month for, is not provided on Fridays and Saturdays. No logic here. Keep in mind that you pay additional $30+ dollars on top of the valet waste charge for waste removal. So in short, you are paying a total of $60+ dollars in waste removal on top of your rent.\n3. The high apartment management turn over is a bad sign. There seems to be a new manager every month. This does not give the new-hires to build a working relationship with the tenants or vice versa.\n4. The grounds are not maintained very well. It's awesome to have pets in the community, but other side of that, is maintenance and cleanliness which seems to be lacking.\n5. On top of the rent, waste removal, pest control fees, service charges, you will pay $80+ dollars in water\/sewage fees. My friend owns a house and his charges are about that much. Just does not make sense. \n6. Recently, they have increased rent and added parking charges. No advance notice was provided neither these additional charges are justified given the critical crime issues in the apartment community.\n\n\nIt's pretty bad when you are happy to see your car with all of its parts intact in the garage when you are getting ready to go to work in the morning. It may not be the same the next morning. Please do your research and spend your money elsewhere.
