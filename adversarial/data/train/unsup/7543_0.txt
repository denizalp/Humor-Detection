Terrible Customer Service.\n\nAs I was driving past the store I saw a huge sign in the window advertising \"buy 1 get 1 free\" on wiper blades.  With my wipers falling to pieces and monsoon storms looming, I thought it would be a good idea to buy some.\n\nAfter I picked the specific brand up and declined on \"upgrading\" to the performance blades (that were not but 1 get 1, funny enough) I was informed that the buy 1 get 1 sale was not in effect until tomorrow.........\n\nHaving worked in retail before, it is common practice for a misrepresented sale (most often from a sale display being left up too long -- this case being displayed prematurely) to be overridden by the manager.  The \"computer not programmed for the sale\" is complete bullshit.  A manager can override anything.  His only solution was to come back tomorrow.  \n\nNo thanks, Wiper blades falling to pieces + Sudden monsoon storm = Danger \n\nI bought the blades at full price.  I will be back tomorrow to return and re-buy them just to mess with their daily merch return numbers.  But if a store doesn't take pride in taking care of their customers, I can't imagine they would take pride in much else.
