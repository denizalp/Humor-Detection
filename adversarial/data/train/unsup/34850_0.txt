Potato Corner is my absolute favorite spot in the Philippines. I was so excited to try out the Potato Corner in Vegas because I always have cravings for their barbecue flavored fries. Unfortunately I was disappointed. It just didn't taste the same. I don't know if the type of oil used is perhaps different? Whatever was used, it overpowered the taste of the barbecue powder. The fries itself were soggy even if they just came out of the fryer.
