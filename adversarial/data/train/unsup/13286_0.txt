Perhaps I'm biased from growing up near NYC or in a Jewish household (albeit conservative), but Montreal's version of pastrami \/ smoked meat has got nothing on the real deal in Brooklyn.  After hearing so many rave reviews from family members and friends, I was really expecting to be blown out of the water, but unfortunately I was instead left drowning in disappointment.\n\nThe price is probably OK for the buck for their smoked meat sandwich (since they give you so much meat!), but although it's soft and falling apart, it is absolutely fatty and flavorless.  It has nothing special going for it whatsoever with its pound of meat doused in yellow mustard on soggy white sandwich bread.   Even on the outside bark of the meat itself I was searching for some other flavor than some oppressive salt that they used, and found absolutely nothing worth savoring.\n\nHonestly, I don't get it.  Maybe it was better 50 years ago and the hype train keeps it going today, but there's nothing worth your time here.  Go elsewhere and find the actual good food in Montreal.
