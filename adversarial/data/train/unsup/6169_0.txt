I don't feel guilty about giving this place 1 star; if I could give it negative stars I would. I don't feel guilty because the types of people who frequent this place don't go onto yelp for advice. I am not worried that my one star is going to ruin the livelihood of the wait staff or owners. Instead, I mean the one star to be a warning to anyone reading this to stay away from Scorekeepers.  This place is dirty, disgusting, stinky, and filled with men who have Santa Claus beards. I am not sure if I can ever be the same after being inside. I am from Lakewood, which is by no means the pinnacle of class, and the crap was legitimately scared out of me. \n\nAny place where you feel comfortable being frumpy but serves food is not okay. Food that lazy isn't worth the calories or potential trip to the hospital. Why choose Scorekeepers to meet friends when there are so many other options out there?
