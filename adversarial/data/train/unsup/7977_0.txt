Went here on the first night of a week-long sales conference with part of my new extended team.  Someone in the original group couldn't go so they asked me and I jumped at the chance.  I've only seen a handful of shows in Vegas so I was excited to see this one.  It shows at TI (Treasure Island) which gives you a sense of its place in the hierarchy of Cirque shows.  It's better than the traveling Kooza in most ways, but not as good as O.\n\nThe show is pretty funny.  Yes there are definitely parts where it is breathtaking and spectacular, but what strikes me the most are the funny parts.  It's not even just a 30-second way to transition between scenes.  There are full-on 5-7 minute skits where it's that big baby or the crazy emcee.  Funny yes, but they completely break up the flow of a show without a lot of flow to begin with.  Where Le Reve was simply visually stunning at times, Mystere has some really trippy parts where I just have to sit back and shake my head a few times.  Nothing lewd or incendiary, but it's somewhat surreal to be watching.\n\nAs for the acts, some where astonishing, but I actually feel like Kooza (even in the smaller stage and area in the AT&T Park parking lot in SF had more astounding physical acts.  We sat slightly off center stage and about 6 rows back, so we had a very good view of the stage and everything around us.  There is more crowd interaction than a lot of shows, particularly Le Reve and Kooza.  They brought at least 2 people on stage and interacted directly with about 8 people in the audience.\n\nVery good show.  Unless you're a hardcore O fan, you will definitely enjoy this.
