I used to have a Massage Envy membership.\n I travel a lot for my work so I was happy that I could use my membership in many other cities I went to.\nI experienced in other cities, Facials, Stone therapy , and Aroma therapy.\nHowever, I went to the one in Phoenix, and I really was never that happy with them. Not  the Masseurs, but the way the store itself was run. \n\nSo fast forward about a year. My body needs some major help.\nI decided I would get a massage. You know that nothing ever feels better for your health.\n So I made an appt. and I was lucky enough to be seen the same day.\nThe place is decorated very soothingly.   It smells nice as well. Like spa products. Which always makes me feel calm.\nThe girls working the front desk are very helpful and not pushy at all.\nI love it when they are not pushy, it makes me more interested in any thing.\n\nAnyway I decided to get a membership again. Guess what! Buying the membership meant my massage that day was complimentary.  I thought that was divine.\nMy Massage was wonderful, I I really needed it. I suffer from  Migraines so relaxing my body and getting rid of toxins helps very much.\n\nI am truly looking forward to healing my body, and they even do facials here as well. Using all Murad products which is a great brand.\n\nI have not had the facials at this location yet. But, I have had them at other places and always enjoyed them.\nThey always provide you with nice cool fresh water, which you should always drink a lot of to rid your body of the toxins.
