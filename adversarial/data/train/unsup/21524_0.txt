Well, you could have knocked me over with a paper towel, triple-ply, when I discovered this luxurious, circa 1929 hotel is not a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed masterpiece. The architect of record is Albert Chase McArthur, who was once one of Wright's draftsmen and obviously he was heavily influenced by his employer and mentor. In fact, Wright consulted McArthur for a few months in the textile block construction which is one of the hotel's architectural trademarks. But let's get real. As talented as McArthur was, the owners knew Wright was the one with the marquee name and have played up the connection big time ever since its construction.\n\nTo reinforce the same misconception I had, they added a signature Wright-designed stained glass in the lobby (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2wOrfC5) and the familiar Japanese-influenced stone sprites from Wright's Midway Gardens project in Chicago (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2fpJ7AJ), as well as naming the three onsite restaurants after Wright, including one that celebrates the actual architect, Frank & Albert's - even though poor McArthur gets second billing (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2horLVx). Driving here at night from Camelback, I couldn't tell how close I was getting to the hotel until I saw a small sign at a creek crossing (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2xBj9kg).\n\nThe entrance was designed in the familiar prairie style accented by intricately designed blocks (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ylbQu6). The low ceiling of the expansive lobby is covered completely in gold leaf, and the lamps, rugs and couches are all typically Wright in their angular and orb-focused design (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2xoc6Mi). Strolling outside to the back terrace, I saw more sprites and sat on a Morris chair that served nicely as a lounge seat. The hotel has changed hands a number of times and is now part of the high-end Waldorf-Astoria collection. Hell, I didn't stay here but rates start at $265 per night for a standard guest room to around $800 for a villa. Well worth a stop and a stroll even if you're not a guest.
