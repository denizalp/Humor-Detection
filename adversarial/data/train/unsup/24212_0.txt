I wanted to take my girlfriend here since it's a Heights institution from its hippie days- plus it offers lots of vegetarian options. She ended up getting a turkey burger, but I was the one who got a veggie option: the tempeh burger. Delicious. However, I had to make my meal unhealthy with the addition of a milkshake and fries.\n\nThe menu is pretty large and is not all veggie (I think there's more meat on it than I remember). However, sticking with a veggie option was the best choice for me since that's what they're known for.
