This place is awesome!!! My husband and I have been here about 4 times and every time has been amazing. We only sit at the \"Raw Bar\" when we come. The guys behind the raw bar are so personable and make your visit special each time. They are actually one of the main reasons we keep coming back. I love this place, and we will continue coming back and telling others.
