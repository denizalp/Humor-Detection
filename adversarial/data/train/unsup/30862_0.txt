Literally the worst airline in the entire universe. Their policies and procedures are not aimed for customer satisfaction. They choose to nickel and dime you for everything and could care less if their customers are happy. Every flight I have ever been on has been severely delayed. Also, how classy of an airline, a wheel fell off of a plane and their flight attendants talk about it like it is some hilarious situation instead of a huge safety concern for their passengers and workers. I spoke with Ticket Agents, Gate Attendants, Managers, and Customer Service on the phone about unfair charges I was given, and each person said that Allegiant is a horrible company to work for and that they never address customer concerns. Sounds like a well run, customer service based company, NOT! If you have any other choice for an airline to fly, even if it is hundreds of dollars more expensive, I HIGHLY recommend doing so. My $150 round trip flight turned into $410 dollars with all of their outrageous fees and HORRIFIC customer service. Run as far and as fast away from this airline as possible!!!!! I wish I could give them 0 stars.
