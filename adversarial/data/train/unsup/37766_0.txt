Oh....my.....god....dude, this place is insanely great! The food is sooooooooooooooooo good! And the gin and tonics are also delicious. I love small plates\/tapas\/sharing type places and this one is one of the best ones I've been too. I highly recommend but if you're wanting to eat here on a weekend night, make your reservation early so you can get a good time. Enjoy!!!!
