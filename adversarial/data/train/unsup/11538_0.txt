I went to this location at 6:30 am specifically for an Oreo Milkshake and fries only to be told, \"Our milk shake machine is down and won't be running until later.\" Why? Why the hell is your location 24 damn hours and I can't have what is being advertised to me on the menu??? Already angry and pissed off because I was craving this while I'm pregnant, I ended up ordering the number 12 which is the chicken strip deal. I got home and my chicken strips were gummy and tasted weird. The fries were ok but the whole meal overall tasted like disappointment.
