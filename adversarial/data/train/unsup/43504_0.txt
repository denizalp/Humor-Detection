I will NEVER go back to this place again.  Today I had an 9 AM appointment with one of the \"stylist\" there named Alicia.  I arrived at 8:55 AM (I'm always punctual) long story short I was still in my car waiting on the salon to open at 9:35 AM.  Being pissed off doesn't even describe the way I felt.  My appointment was very important since I needed to get some photographs done for much needed marketing material.  I left this establishment and had to go to a different salon as a walk-in due to their unprofessional behavior.  In all fairness after calling the Shawn's direct cell number she stated that she would not be at the salon on that day, but my appointment wasn't with Shawn...it was with ALICIA! So all-in-all I would never advise anyone to go there and if they did I would certainly tell them to steer clear of ALICIA, the world's most unprofessional stylist!
