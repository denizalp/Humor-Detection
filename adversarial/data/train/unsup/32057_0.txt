Aloha hour is the best! How can you beat $6 apps and drinks?! We had a feast. We got the wagyu sliders, beef skewers, calamari, and lobster potstickers while I sipped on a pomegranate mojito. The service was great, very friendly, fast and attentive. And nothing beats the views of the Desert Ridge Marriott!
