This hotel\/casino is gorgeous, loved it. Large casino where we gambled a little. The shops oh my yes you can drop some serious cash here. Many restaurant options to choose from. The design is beyond gorgeous with the canals with gondola rides. \n\nWe shopped here, gambled and ate at a nice restaurant. My next trip to Vegas I would stay here, the Luxor or Wynn as all three were beautiful and had so much to offer. You never even have to leave the resort there is so much to do. \n\nStill one of my favorite's hotel's. Service is great and the beauty is spectacular. \n\nThe Italian dream!
