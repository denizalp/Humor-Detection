Take that HOA Weed Natzi's . . . I have finally found a landscape company that told me what they were going to do . . . when they were going to do it . . . and . . . .what it was going to cost.\n\nCame home from work yesterday . . . and everything was done.  Looks better than it did when we moved in over 7 years ago . . . and the best part . . . they are going to be coming back every month to make sure it stays this way.\n\nAnd the best part . . . the HOA WEED NATZI'S can now start picking on some else.
