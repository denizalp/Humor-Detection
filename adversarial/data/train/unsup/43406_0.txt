I liked this place a lot and would like to go back but since I live nowhere near here,  doubtful I will ever make it. They had maybe 6-7 beers on tap. I had a stout, IPA and a simple lager infused with a blueberry concentrate that were all very smooth and drinkable. The food was very good also. Loved the beer cheese soup and the macaroni with cheese, andouille sausage and tomatoes was very good. There lots of brew houses here and there and some are good, some not. This is one of the good ones.
