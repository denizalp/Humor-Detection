This is my favorite book store above all others even new book sellers.  Admittedly I buy most of my reading material digitally now but I still like a paper book now and then.  Their kids section is absolutely wonderful, we have found all of my daughter's favorites here.  She picks things that I never would have expected & books that I would have thought to be too advanced for her to really like.\n\nThey usually have multiple copies of all of the most recently published, popular reads as well as things that I missed when they first hit the new book stores.  (I go less often now in favor of Amazon and Kindel so I miss more than I used to).\n\nI've noticed that most new book sellers have fazed out the chairs & couches.  Other places seem to discourage lounging and browsing the inventory now, a real shame.  Not at Half Price Books.  This place still has several seating areas for customers (I wish there were a few more, sometimes they are all full).\n\nFor the same price as what I spend at Barns & Noble for one or two titles I can get a pile of good quality books.  I don't sell, I just buy.  I can't comment on what they will pay you to take used items off your hands but I will tell you that if you are purchasing items the prices are unbeatable.  Great value, great place, highly recommend.
