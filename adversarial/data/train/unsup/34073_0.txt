Want bumpy, uneven, poorly injected lips? This is the med spa for you. When the swelling on my lips went down post-injection I was left with multiple bumps\/bubbles on my lips and they are also uneven. I've been getting my lips done for years and I have never had a bad experience with other injectors. Do not trust the pretty offices and sales pitches; it is not worth having to spend a lot of time and money to fix botch jobs.
