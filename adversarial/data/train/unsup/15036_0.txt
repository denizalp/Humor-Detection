I've heard good things about this place, and this is my first time eating here. We came for our friend's 21st which also happened to be on Easter.\nSo we tried to order waffle fries, which were out... this restaurant is known for those aren't they?! And then there weren't any tortillas because we had tried to order chicken nachos for the table. Oh and then they didn't have PINEAPPLES for our pineapple pizza? Uh... and then no pierogis for the pierogi pizza.. \n\nSighhhh.... well onto the food, when my friends' burgers came out, the smell was mouthwatering! And the fries were crispy! If I come again, I'd probably get the shady burger.\nI ordered the barbecue chicken pizza. It wasn't too sweet! I liked it. We had also ordered the shroom pizza, way too cheesy for my taste, but it also had 3 different cheeses. They were both $12 for small pizzas, but there were like 6 slices and I had only finished half. \n\nAs for service, our waitress Olivia, was really nice.  However she didn't refill our waters.... only once. And the service was quite slow. We spent two hours here.  Debating on returning again, maybe for the bar instead?
