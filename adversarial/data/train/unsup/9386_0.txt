Luke's Lobster in Las Vegas is located outside of the Fashion Mall and is a very tiny outlet with a few chairs to sit in.  \n\nAt the time that we came here there was a table for two that we would be able to sit in. The seating arrangement is so small though that it feels a little bit uncomfortable. \n\nThe food though is pretty good. The lobster rolls seem like a mini size and we decided to try all three different types. \n\nThe thing is that I didn't actually enjoy was that the meat was cold. I don't know if this is the correct way of having a lobster roll but the other places that were in Vegas had the lobster inside warm with the bread. \n\nOverall it was still an interesting place to try and see why so many people enjoy this spot. It does take time to get your order ready, so just wait a bit and you'll have a pretty nice time.
