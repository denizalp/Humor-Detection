Sometimes what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Other times, you post it in a review on Yelp. I visited the Double Door on two occasions while in Vegas many, many years ago. The first time was at about 6 or 7 am after spending the entire night at a strip club for a friend's birthday. Went to the bar with a few friends and a stripper one of them was dragging around. It was kind of quiet, being early morning and all. We played some pool and some jams on the jukebox, which featured some great stuff, before returning back to our room.\n\nLater that night, we returned after having stayed up all day consuming more beverages. If yelp reviews were anonymous, I could tell you more about what happened, but suffice it to say that I was kicked out within ten minutes of arriving, the bartender telling my friends \"you guys can stay, but that dude has to go.\"
