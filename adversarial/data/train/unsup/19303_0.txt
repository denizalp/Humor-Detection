Sephora does for me what Tiffany does for Holly Golightly.  All the brightly lit walls filled with shiny, black lacquer rows of my favorite beauty products -- makes me feel like nothing bad can happen in a place like this.  Everything you need and everything you didn't know you needed, all in one stop shop. \n\nThe sales staff here are always very polite and helpful, I've never had a bad experience or felt pressured to buy anything.  One of the great things about shopping here is that Sephora stands behind their products and you can always return what you buy if it doesn't work out for you.
