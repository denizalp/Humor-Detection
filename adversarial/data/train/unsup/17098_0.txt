Awesome place. Brand-new in the lake Wylie area. They have three entrances, which makes it a lot easier for foot traffic. It's pretty crowded for a Saturday night.\nPretty good prices. Their food is very filling so if you order a kids meal you would fill up too. \nTheir menu is digital as opposed to a wooden board so that gives the place a more modern feel. \nAnd of course, because it's new, it's very clean. It's not very good for large groups though because it's a long narrow space. \nVery, very friendly staff. We were welcomed about five times when We walked in.
