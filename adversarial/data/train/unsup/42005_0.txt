I'm sorry that I'm super harsh with these ratings but the food at this place is terrible. I mean, the best thing about my experience here was my good looking waiter. I ordered a chicken breast that came with shrimp, scallops and veggies. SUPER SALTY! The veggies were very undercooked, and the seafood just sucked. One thing I've learned about steakhouses is that if you order something other than steak, prepare to be dissapointed. Steakhouses only care about the steak. I really wanted to like this place especially since it was for my anniversary. My boyfriend on the other hand loved his steak but I sampled it and it could've been seasoned way more, that's for sure. The atmosphere was very nice, and intimate, definitely nice for a date but they need to improve their non-steak menu. That's all.
