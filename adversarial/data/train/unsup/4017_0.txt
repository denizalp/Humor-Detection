Athena's plumbing to the rescue!!!! They came out immediately for my water heater issue. They were highly recommended by my home warranty company.  Excellent customer service with coming by my place immediately and the pending process that took a couple of days was on the fault of my warranty company. Athena's kept in contact with me and provided a heads up call when they were heading out to my home for the new installment of the water heater. This company has been great, unlike the previous company that installed the new water heater back in October where they have NO record of the water heater serial number or info.  So forgot that old company and Athena's has gained my business for any future needs. Installation was quick in less than an hour, professional, clean and friendly. Top notch!\n\nTHANK YOU Brandon S. and Jason for all of your help! My apologizes if my warranty company was any kind of issue during the process.\n\nBTW Athena's has a A rating with the Better Business Bureau. :)
