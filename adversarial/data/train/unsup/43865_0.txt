Another top notch Fox restaurant. They do have the formula down. I cant say this place is anything really incredible or unique. But what it does it does very well. Its affordable. Its very trendy. The quality seems to be top notch. Service was excellent. Our dessert came out approximately 5 minutes after we ordered. It was delivered to us by the manager with apologies that it took so long and it was on the house. We had the warm peanut butter cup. I'm not a huge dessert person, especially chocolate ones, but it was good. The cookie on the side really deserves to be broken up and tossed in the bowl with the gelato. Getting back to the beginning of the meal, we had an appetizer of bacon potato fritters. They are amazingly light and airy. The taste of bacon was only slight. Everything is better with bacon right? The entrees were order were the ricotta dumpling bolognese and the meatloaf special. The dumpling were great. Again light and airy, almost slightly dry. A tad more moist and they could be gnocchi. The bolognese sauce were fairly oily. Most likely from the fat rendered from the cooking of the ground beef. I do think of myself as a meatloaf expert. I'm not easy to please. It was made perfectly. A perfect sweet glaze on top and a moist tender center. Nothing cutting edge with this. Just the basic meatloaf but done well. The mashed potatoes were a let down. I prefer my mashed potatoes on the rustic side. These were obviously whipped in some type of food processor. They get a slightly gluey texture when processed. We had a bottle of Stronghold Nachise with dinner. A great pairing for what we had. I was impressed they dont gouge you on wine prices. Their markup seems to be a more reasonable 100%. I've seen many places triple and quadruple the retail price of a wine. So kudos on that. I would def go back, but not right away. There are so many other places to try yet.
