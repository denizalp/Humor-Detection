I never expect to get great food from a gaming tavern and Giuseppe's met my expectations. My first time here was back in 2007 when my real estate agent brought me here for lunch. It wasn't until recently that I returned for a second visit. The place is spacious with a dining area full of comfy booths and a bar area that's enclosed to limit smokiness throughout the place.\n\nThe menu is large and offers just about everything for lunch and dinner, plus there's a kids menu too. The chicken noodle soup was decent. The wedding soup was similar to the chicken noodle soup with the addition of meatballs. The garlic bread, on Italian bread topped with cheese and sauce, was pretty tasty and a good sized portion. The gnocchi was way too dense and thick. The kid's order of chicken fingers was of the typical frozen variety.
