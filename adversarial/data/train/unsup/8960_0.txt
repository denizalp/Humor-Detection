Needy, greedy, and rude.  Needy and greedy happened before we even got into the restaurant.  The entire parking lot was empty, but coned off for valet.  Not a valet was in sight so we went ahead and parked.  It was like someone said Beetlejuice three times because as soon as we locked the car, a valet magically appeared and demanded the keys because this section - the entire parking lot - was valet only - needy and greedy.\n\nWe went into the restaurant, and the hostess told us only the bar seating was open.  We went to the bar area, and all the tables were full, and we didn't want to sit right at the bar.  As we started to head for the door someone walked by and said we could have one of the dinner tables if we wanted, but that section was closed so we told him we would just come back some other time.  At this point everything was still fine.  As we were walking out, we heard the hostess make a disparaging comment about us.  I called the restaurant's manager from the car, and he half heartedly said sorry, but he didn't hear the comment.  Note to manager:  your employees don't act rude and make nasty comments when you're standing there.  Very. Rude.\n\nI don't care how good the food is at this restaurant and I certainly wouldn't know after this experience.  I live in Scottsdale, and there are many excellent restaurants throughout the city.  I will spend my dollars elsewhere.  I don't see this restaurant being a player for long with such a rude, coarse staff.
