I came in at the walk in clinic on a Thursday morning for the purpose of refilling my prescription.  i didn't need to do a check up nor planning on switching to their medical centre. However,  they still insist that I answer 6 page questionnaire.   STRIKE 1.\n\nNo one was in the waiting room with me, so I figured it would be quick.  NOPE.  After 40 mins in the waiting room, they finally took my my vitals, weight etc and made me wait in another room.  STRIKE 2.\n\nAfter waiting another 30 mins inside the 2nd room, i finally got fed up and left, only to be stopped by the doctor finally willing to see me.  She apologized and made small talk -- fine... but when i asked for a year's worth of prescription, she told me she could only provide me a month worth, maximum 2 months, unless i register them as my family doctor.  Is she for real? Cause i know for fact that walk in clinics, are able to give you at least 3 months worth no questions asked.  so that's STRIKE 3.\n\nIf i knew it was going to take that long, I would've just seen my family doctor.  Needless to say I wont be going back to that walk in clinic.
