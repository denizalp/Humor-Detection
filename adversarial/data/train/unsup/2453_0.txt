I had a wonderful dinner at this place. First of all, the restaurant has a great ambiance and looks upscale. It smells like fresh seafood, without smelling too fishy. I tried the lobster risotto with chorizo oil that was to die for! I had a simple butter lettuce salad as a starter, and it was quite nice as well. Overall, a very nice place to dine and the food is excellent. The staff is very professional as well.
