Dr. Sharma was AMAZING! I don't have insurance so he gave me a very reasonable rate for my visit. he also did not charge me for my return visit and gave me the instructions to get a better rate for my prescriptions. very professional, helpful and genuine... which is not usually the case at a doctors office. thank you doctor! I will be back!
