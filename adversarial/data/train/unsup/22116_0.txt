I'll cut to the chase .. For a steakhouse of this caliber  the level of detail and service was not all there. The hostess and waitress was hard to connect with and was distracted on who knows what! I ordered the simplest one could get 10oz Filet Mignon Medium-Rare+ and it came out cold and raw  in the center. I had to send it back and they ended up burning it The sides were great like Au Gratin but outside of that nothing impressive and wouldn't trust them with a steak again. If Gordon Ramsay ate here he'd rip them a new one and then some!. I eat a lot of steak and this place is overpriced on steaks that don't deliver. I don't mind paying more but this was a complete disappointment on quality of their featured menu item (steak) including a new strip which isn't even featured as the restaurant name suggests. Find better options!
