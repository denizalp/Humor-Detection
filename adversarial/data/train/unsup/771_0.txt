Garcia said she would send over a prescription for my son a WEEK ago. I went to where she claimed to send it and nothing, I call and leave a message which the machine says they will call by the end of the business day and again NOTHING! I have called many times and left messages and still no return call. Worst customer service ever! I will be switching doctors and will not recommend this place to anyone. I miss doctor conti he actually got things done!
