Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the food and the service was avg.  I ordered a linguini primavera and I got a dish that didn't resemble at all what the menu described. The noodles were a fettuccine style, I got a red sauced frozen vegetable type heavy dish.  The greek salad didn't taste fresh and the dressing was a bottled dressing. I just think nothing was authentic or made in house, except the pizza. The thin crust was the only thing that tasted amazing so I would go back maybe for just the pizza.
