I have been here on a couple occasions and am just now getting around to writing my review.  I got a pedi and the girl who did it was great!  I was able to walk in and get seen right away.  They have several different packages you can get for your pedi, mani, etc. and you know up front how much it's going to cost. No $5 more at this place.  I will be back!
