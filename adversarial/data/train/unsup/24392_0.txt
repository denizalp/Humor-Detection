Service reused at LOLO's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI tried to called in a order at lolol's and was REFUSED SERIVCE!!!!!!!!!! I was told that they do not take pick up orders on Sundays. I work 3 mins away, I then asked if I could come in and place the order, pay for it then return for the food. The answer was NO!! I proceeded to ask to speak to the manager. After being placed on hold, a young lady took the call stated that she was not the manager but she was directed by the boss to confirm: \"NO orders for pick up!\" and No coming to the resturant to order and wait for food as pickup! \n\nHow about updating your website and menus!!!! And letting people know you refuse service when ever its convienent for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
