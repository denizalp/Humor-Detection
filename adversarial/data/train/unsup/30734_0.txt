Everly is a terrible place... I mean a terribly  AWESOME place!!!! Logan, the bartender helped us and made excellent food and beer suggestions. We have seen the boss working hard too... He loaded a bunch of coolers by himself. I guess it's gonna be a great picnic somewhere... The food was excellent, the service was excellent, the atmosphere is excellent!!! Just travelling trough but would come back to Madison just to eat here again. Thanks guys for the great dining experience! And they are dog friendly! The patio is a great place to hang out with your pooches.
