This location of Timothy's World Coffee is at the corner of Major Mackenzie and Bayview. \n\nA lot of the patrons here are students from high school nearby. Can be quite noisy after school hours. (study group, student doing homework...) \n\nBarista here is cheerful and friendly. \n\nCappuccino ($2.99) \n- brew is a little weak for my preference... \n- good value for the money... since it is quite a big cup \n\nFree Wifi... please ask staff for password. \n\nI feel like I am back to high school when I sipping my coffee in this Timothy's.
