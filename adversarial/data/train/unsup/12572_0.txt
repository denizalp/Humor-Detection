I had such high hopes for this place.\n\nFirstly, it's too small for Fri and Sat night crowds. It was literally elbow to elbow in there. It looked like they have some sort of balcony area above the bar (?), If that wouldve been open, it wouldve been 10 times more bearable.\n\nWe stopped in this past Friday night and man were the douches out in force. W\/ in the 1st 5 minutes after getting drinks my friends boyfriend was rammed into and had his beer spilled all over him, and watched as a couple who'd moved their stools away from one of the tables proceeded to say \"Were using that table!\" to anyone who tried to just lean against it. I got the impression from the clientele that they were just there to try whatever brew had the highest alcohol content rather than try different\/ new beers, but thats what a location on Mill brings I guess. Its still disappointing for those of us that like craft beer for craft beer, not for how wasted we can get in one sitting.\n\nTo say that their beer list is overwhelming is an understatement. I kinda felt like there shouldve been a companion to their beer book (which was listed by type of beer) that was listed by country like at certain karaoke bars (by artist\/ song title). I realize that their fridges are set up by country but we could barely squeeze in at the bar to order, let alone peruse the cases on either side of the taps.\n\nUnlike Kate K., not one server stopped to ask if we needed anything. However, once we got past the 2 girls that were just hanging out at the bar taking up space (\"Cuz this is where the scene is\"), the bartender was quick to take and get us our order.\n\nI'd like to go back here during happy hour on a weekday or maybe right when they open on a Sat to give it another shot, because I really want this place to be awesome.
