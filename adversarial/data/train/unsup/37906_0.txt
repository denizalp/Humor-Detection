Was in dire need of a good tailor to hem an ultra expensive dress for me.  Saw Studio Kim from blogs and website recommendations.  The ladies were lovely, courteous, and takes time to listen to what you want your clothes to look like.  The price was reasonable compared to some of the other tailors in town.  The pick up and drop off were smooth.  Would certainly recommend and go back in the future.  Just a note: cash and debit card only.
