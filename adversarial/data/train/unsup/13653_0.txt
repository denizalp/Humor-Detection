'Murica... F.U.C. Ya!!\n\nWe came here after spending great time at the beach. I got the philly cheese steak with poutine. Tastes philthy in a very good way. Portions are 'Murican. Wonderful, friendly service. Philthy and they know it. If you love philthy, greasy foods then check this place out. Please eat responsibly.
