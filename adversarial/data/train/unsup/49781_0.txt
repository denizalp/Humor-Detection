I saw this place while driving by. I wasn't sure that they were open until I drove around back. As I entered I was greeted with a friendly hello. I ordered the Local Hottie. The lady behind the counter gave me a complimentary sample. I don't know if that's the protocol or she could tell this was my first visit. I really did appreciate that. After sampling the local hottie juice I was in love with the flavorful spicy hydrating juice. I will definitely come back and try the variety of other juices and Brazilian bowl.
