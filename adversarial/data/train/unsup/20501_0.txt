What is it with you Clevelanders drowning everything in this processed queso sauce?! You wouldn't know Mexican food if it came in dancing La Cucaracha with a Mariachi band in tow and threw salsa on you? \n\nThis place is a spinoff of Taco Bell as a sit-down restaurant. \n\nI grew up in Southern California and spent the majority of my days eating Mexican food... real food cooked by real Mexicans. Nowhere in that state is queso a thing. I have also eaten Mexican food in New Mexico- also cooked by Mexicans. No sign of queso there either. And the ground beef! Neither state uses ground beef in their tacos unless you are at Taco Bell, by which, SURPRISE! Its not real Mexican food. Somewhere, someone's abuela is saying 25 Hail Mary's 40 Our Father's and rolling over in her grave. Trust me.\n\nWe came to Compadres a couple weeks ago for dinner because it was slammed busy and the numerous good reviews. Boy was that a mistake. My hubby ordered enchiladas and I ordered tacos. everything was ground beef and drowned in queso. It was like a heart attack on a plate. I actually felt my arteries crying out for help or an angioplasty. The service was also terrible. \n\nNever again. I will have my dad ship me some spices and I will have to make my own Mexican food from now on. A taco is carne asada, onions, cilantro and chile on a soft corn tortilla. None of this hard shell Taco Bell stuff. \n\nI realize that this is probably a regional thing... the processed cheese sauce and lack of flavor. We are VERY far from the border. If I were to open a Mexican restaurant in Cleveland, it would fail miserably because people would die of flavor overload at the tables. \n\nMy tip to you all, travel. Experience real foods. Don't be afraid to experiment with flavors. Don't expect that this is actually Mexican food, because its not.
