Mexicans are the best cooks in America.  Go to the back of any kitchen of any cuisine and you'll find hard working Mexicans cooking American, Italian, Chinese, French, and of course Mexican food.  But shit goes wrong when a extraordinarily pale white dude, whom is supposedly a chef, recreates the Mexican recipes. I love seeing Guy Fieri's TV show \"Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives\", but sweet geezus his cooking sucks.  \n\n$18 Chicken Mole Verde enchiladads...on the menu, this looked good for soem reason.  In my mouth it was more like WTF?  Did they mix a can of verde salsa with a jar of mole sauce?  Blah! It was still edible...\n\n$22 Chicken fajitas...wife decided to play it safe.  Too safe? If you google \"Blandest Chicken Fajitas\", you might find a picture of Guy Fieri's fajitas. The chicken was barely seasoned with anything, if anything.  It comes with only 2 tortillas...want extra tortillas? $2 for 2 extra...seriously? Again, it was till edible, just boring. \n\n\"Would you like to see the dessert menu?\" - Friendly waitress\n\"No thanks!\" - Chun P (I didn't want to waste another penny here.) \n\nAgain, the food isn't bad, its just extraordinarily bland...this had me yearning for a Chevy's, On the Border, or even a El Pollo Loco.  Disclosure: I live in San Diego, where we have amazing Mexican food, which surely obscures my opinions.
