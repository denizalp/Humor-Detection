LaMonica can straighten hair well. However, she is not the best at blowing and neither are her employees. After having my hair blow dried my ends were broken off. My ends were not previously split bc I'd recently had them trimmed. I tried to talk to the owner about the issue but she defended the stylist poor techniques. I've known others to go this salon and not be pleased by the outcome. I will not return.
