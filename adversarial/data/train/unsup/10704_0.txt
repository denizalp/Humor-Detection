To get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, and perhaps the heat, check out the Fashion Show mall! It's huge and very spacious. Lots of your regular department stores here, but has other neat stores as well. I ate my first Nathan's hot dog in the food court! I was kind of upset at first. Scrunching up my face at my husband and was like, we are in vegas and you want to eat at the food court? Hush and eat your hot dog. Yeah.. it was pretty good.\n\nLovely mall!
