We decided to try Hot N Juicy for the first time... I enjoyed the experience, however, we thought the prices were kinda high. It was $50 for a 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish, 1lb crab and a small basket of calamari. There were 2 of us and we left still hungry.  The seasoning on the food was great but, next time when we wanna spend 70 dollars on a meal we are going somewhere where the seafood is already prepared and de-shelled. The service was mediocre. Nothing special. \n\nAll in all again it was a good experience but not worth the money and probably will not be back.
