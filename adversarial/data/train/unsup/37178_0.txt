This was a very nice store and the lady that worked there was very helpful. I decided not to buy the Christian Louboutins because I heard that they just lost their case against YSL and that now anyone can have the red soles. This was very disheartening and therefore decided to buy a beautiful pair of Monolo Blahniks  instead. I dont want to spend over 1000 for a pair of shoes and later see someone like BEBE come out with a pair similar with red soles. :(
