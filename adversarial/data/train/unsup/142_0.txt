Were from Los Angeles, but we looooove Matty's show on munchies. So when i got married (part 2) in Ottawa, my boys and I had to drive to Toronto to check this out. Glad we were there on Tuesday, so we were able to try Matty's Tuesday night Chicken special. comes with about 4-5 pieces of fried chicken and 2 sides ($26). \n\nIt was ok. but thats sad because OK shouldnt be the case for Matty. I didnt know if this was the pickled brine, or just normal chicken. But i cant hate. i come from a place where fried chicken is a regular thing and everyone has their own special blend. But in Toronto, where there isnt too many fired chicken joints, this was probably their best. \n\nIll try them out again in the future to try and kill my minor disappointment \n\nbut them Mac and Cheesuz Christ tho!!!!!!!!!!
