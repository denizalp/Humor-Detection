Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. \nParking lot is small and around the back. \nRestaurant is small but spacious; looks renovated.\n\nOrdered the 888 Combo that comes with Sashimi (8pcs), Sushi (8pcs), Special roll of your choice (we picked Black Dragon Roll) and Nichiban Sushi that comes with Sushi (12pcs), California Roll (6pcs). \n\nSushi was fresh; good quality for price. Would recommend.
