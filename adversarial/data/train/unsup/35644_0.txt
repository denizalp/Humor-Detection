I actually expected very good taste food because my friend recommend this place but seems like the kitchen chef changed.\n\nThey have variety of menu with good price. I got a spicy seafood soup.\n\nTaste was good but not stella.\n\nMy complaint about this place is so slow service.\n\nIt took more than 10min to get my drink even it was not busy.\n\nAnd also took another 15min to get my meal. \n \nThey need to be improved on their customer service.
