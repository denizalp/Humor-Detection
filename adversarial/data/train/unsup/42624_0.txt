I am going to start off by saying that we first ate at Mug Shotz 6 years ago when visiting a friend in Calgary.   We now drive 1600 miles round trip from Seattle every so often just for Mug Shotz wings.  We just ate here again a few days ago and they are still as delicious as when we first had them.   They always live up to the craving. \n\nThe Mug Shotz Salt and Pepper are our absolute favorite.  If you like heat, try them hot or suicide style.  Mmm.  They have so many flavors that I can't claim to have tried them all, but the ones I have ordered I love. 7 of us finished 15 pounds of wings for dinner and probably could have finished 20 if we wanted to be gluttens.  \n\nThey have wing specials many nights, so check their website for a good night to go.  I know they have other food on the menu as well, but we have never once bothered to order anything but wings because they are just that good.
