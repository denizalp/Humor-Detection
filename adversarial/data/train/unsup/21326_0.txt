I had a horrible experience last year doing our taxes here. I went by the reviews of this place but the rep that we had didn't have a clue as to what she was doing. We didn't get a high return like we usually do and the rep even forgot to add in the school costs when we told her about it twice. You can take your chances but I won't be returning.
