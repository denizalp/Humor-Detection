\"Epic failed attempt to mimic STK steakhouse ...\"\n\n... \"N9NE, I have been served in STK steakhouse, I know STK steakhouse, STK steakhouse is favorite of mine. N9NE, you are no STK steakhouse! \" Pumping up the music, lowering the lights, hiring \"models\" as staff, does not put you on par with STK. There is NO excuse for serving a medium well to well done steak, when medium rare ordered and expressly acknowledged! The Celeb-Wanna-Be Chef was socializing in dining room\/bar during entire prolonged meal! Time, I believe, better spent in kitchen ensuring quality food is being sent out!\nAn easy rename would speak volumes about this restaurant, change \"N9NE\" to \"NEIN\" Steakhouse at the Palms and consequently provide a quick answer to every diner's three initial questions about any steakhouse: 1) Does it have great service, with a reasonable wait for your entr√©e? - \"Nein\"; 2) Can the kitchen prepare a steak to requested temperature? - \"Nein\"; and 3) Is it a venue I would frequent or recommend? - \"NEIN\"!!\n\"Auf Wiedersehen!\" to this impostor!
