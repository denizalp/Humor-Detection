I have always wanted to try Filipino food. Longganisa is to die for! \nMy friend took me here, and I gotta say this place is really good. From the location, ambience, friendly service, and of course great tasting food! \n\nSince this was my first Filipino food experience I ordered the Chicken Adobo. It's their national dish apparently. The chicken was really savoury sweet and salty (not too salty). The chicken seems grilled or rotisserie. It came with a poached egg with went well with the flavorful rice that came with the whole dish.\n\nThen we ordered the Ensaymada French Toast. I think this is the best french toast I have EVER HAD! I told the server how much I enjoyed the french toast, and he said \"thanks I'll let the chef Daniel know you are enjoying it\" and I went \"DAMN DANIEL!!\"\nI know I'm embarrassing sometimes LOL -_-' \nNo but seriously please do not go here for brunch and not order the french toast. You will regret it.\n\nI am going back here and bring people with me to try their amazing food!
