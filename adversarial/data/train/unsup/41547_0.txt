I have been coming here since day one! I have one particular nail tech I use, Henry. He is the best and my sister and I have followed him around the valley for at least 6 years! He is a professional and introduced me to SNS dip powder. THE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE! Going in today! I love the massage chairs, and everyone on staff is professional and friendly, and excellent techs as well!
