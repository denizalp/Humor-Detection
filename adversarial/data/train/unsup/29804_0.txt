This woman needs to be put out of business!.   I too did not do my homework before going to her----  she made a total mess of both eyebrows and eyeliner.  It was very painful and my eyes were very puffy and sore for a good two weeks.  When I called her to complain she said to give them time they would settle down.  A month later I went back to her and complained.  She told me that had she not known she would not have believed that was her work.  TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!  Then told me for 400 she would fix it.  I don't think so.  Today I went to Allure- night and day---- they took alot of pics, made sure I was happy with shape etc and now starting an expensive process to correct the mess she made of both brows and eyeliner.  I would highly recommend that anyone getting permanent cosmetics do your home work.  Quality is much more important than price when you consider this is permanent.
