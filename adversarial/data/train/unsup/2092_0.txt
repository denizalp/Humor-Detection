This store sort of feels like a guy had a an attic\/bedroom full of comics and other geeky goodies and when his mother told him he needed to clean his room he opened his bedroom to the public to sell his wares.\n\nThere's certainly lots of things to choose from. There's lots of board games, graphic novels, anime, magic cards, and other random oddities. The store isn't pretty. It's actually a little scary when you're climbing the narrow staircase to the 2nd floor. The products are organized into their various sections and are generally organized well, except for the board games. The games seem like an afterthought and are haphazardly lined up on tables, over-head on shelves, or stacked on the floor.\n\nThe staff were a little aloof. Not really interested in helping the random customers that were in the store, they just stuck to chatting up what seemed like regulars, or playing with the cat.\n\nThe prices seem fair. I don't have a ton of knowledge about the graphic novels and anime, but the games seemed to be competitively priced.
