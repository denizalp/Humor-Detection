I dont think I have ever left a place with such mixed feelings. I liked Markaz. Actually no, I didnt really. No but I kinda did. Meh, not really. See what I mean?\n\nLets start with the Do's first:\n\nDO: soundproof that ceiling! Exposed brick and hardwood floors make for an echoing mess in this cozy but chilly atmosphere. If I wanted strangers to hear my every thought, I would walk around with a microphone stuck to my neck. Ya dig?\n\nDO: whisper to your friends because all the tables and staff are going to eavesdrop on your convos. Have I proved my point yet?\n\nDO: Order the sheesha. No tobacco, no nicotine but tastes the same as the one thats bad for you. Good deal. Read Sameer D.'s review for the inside scoop on this concoction.\n\nDO: order the masala chai. A bit on the unconventional side, its a pleaser nonetheless.\n\nDO: check this place out once. The decor is traditional and upscale. The staff knowledgeable.\n\nNow to the DONT's:\n\nDONT: go here with just a $20 in your pocket. This place is NOT cheap. $14 for a regular sheesha. $22 for \"specialty mixes\". Insanity.\n\nDONT: look shocked if the owner brings your tea, points to the miniature french press and chimes \"do you know what this is\".. Umm..do i know what a french press is? Would that be a place where newspapers are printed? \n\nDONT: get milk with your masala chai. You will be adviced against it and just listen to the guy making all the suggestions and teaching you the mechanisms of the french press.\n\nI like this place but something was wrong during my first visit there. Once the upstairs patio opens and I have another wednesday night to spare, I will re-try the Markaz Cafe and Shisha Lounge.\n\np.s. they are fully Halal and do not serve alcohol. \n\np.p.s they are open till 3am on weekends.
