Patients beware of this doctor!!! As a new patient, I felt talked down to you and she is very condescending. I waited 2 1\/2 hours for her to be be rude to me! And, then she told me my thyroiditis and hashimoto's disease was no big deal and basically said my symptoms did not relate to my thyroid. How odd is that I when the last doctor I had, who has since moved out of Las Vegas, said my symtoms were all related. \n\n\nI walked out of her office that day and will not return ever!!!
