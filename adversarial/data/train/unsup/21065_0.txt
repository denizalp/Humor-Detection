I have bringing my car here for 2 years and have never got my car back at the time in which they promised.\n\nThe other day, I went in for the A service (oil change) and dropped the car off at 745am. There were 6 people ahead of me. I was told that the car would be done in 1 hour.  I left to grab breakfast and left with the shuttle.  I called back an hour later asking for a shuttle pickup.  After being on hold for 9mins, I called at 930am for a pick up and was told that the driver was unreachable??! I asked the service advisor, Max to dispatch him and he said that it was not possible. He asked me to wait until the driver called me. I did not want to wait, so I walked for 45 mins and arrived at 10:30am, at which point, I still hadn't received a call. Pathethic. They can't even run a shuttle service! At 1030am, I walked in asked for the status of my car and was told that I had 4 people ahead of me. Ridiculous! They still hadn't started on my car. I flipped out and told them that I would never be back again. I then tried to escalate the complaint - the Senior Advisor Ray gave me some lame excuse that there were 40 people ahead of me.. all waiting in the waiting area.. (There were 3 in actuality)\n\nAt 1045am, they offered to do my oil change. If I didn't get upset, I think I would have had to wait another 2 hours.\n\nThe service advisor Ray is extremely unhelpful and works for himself - definitely needs customer service training. Very rude and comes up with a rude excuse for everything you say. He fits the prototype of a 'sleezy' service advisor.\n\nDowntown Acura always takes more orders than they can handle, which is inappropriate for busy people that need to follow schedules. I will not be going back to this dealership EVER again. I will drive north instead, even if it's a bit further from my house.\n\nBeware - do not go here! Don't waste your time or money!
