I love this place.\n\nNeed a wallet? Purse? Briefcase? Suitcase? Betty Hemmings to the rescue.\n\nThey're one of the only places in Toronto that carry Longchamp goods. For Christmas, I decided to buy the mother a couple of Longchamp bags so I popped in here this afternoon (Saturday). I don't want to harp on Longchamp, but......... they have A LOT of different coloured bags and styles. \n\nBH's is not limited to this French brand, you can find items from other parts of Europe too. \n\nCustomer service is worth four stars. I was able to go in and out within 10 minutes.\n\nYay, I'm a fan.
