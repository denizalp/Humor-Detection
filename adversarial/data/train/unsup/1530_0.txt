Love, love this place! Modern, fresh, efficient, relaxed. On the strip within walking distance of the action, but it's not on top of you...no casino, perfect! Great pool area, friendly valets...think the young lady's name was Julie or Julia, she was fast and brought two bottles of ice cold water to send us out into the Vegas sun--excellent customer service! The rooms are wonderfully appointed, the views amazing, the bathrooms are immaculate with enormous soaking tubs. My new fave property in Vegas...
