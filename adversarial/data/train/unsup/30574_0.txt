I'm feeling a little frustrated after dining here this evening. I come here quite a bit because the chicken is tasty. \nI get my tray of food and sit down. I quickly realize I was given two spoons and a knife. It's kind of hard to eat the side salad with a spoon. I went to the counter and no one even acknowledged I was standing there. I waived at a couple of folks looking in my direction, nope. No response. I finally yelled \"excuse me\" and got their attention to request a fork. \nThe salsa bar and drink dispenser were a mess. The floor in front of them was a mess. A gentleman came by to refill the salsas. I figured he would clean up the counter by the drinks or even tend to the floor. No. \nNo one was out in the dining area cleaning off tables, sweeping the floor, etc and the restaurant was getting busy. \nThe food was good but I'm hoping I don't end up getting sick from the lack of attention to a clean restaurant. \nI won't be back.
