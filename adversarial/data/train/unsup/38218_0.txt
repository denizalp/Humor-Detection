Beautiful restaurant at the Wynn. We went for brunch during the week. The outside patio was closed, but I can't wait to go back and sit there. The ambiance was beautiful, very relaxing and tasteful decor. The food was delicious. I ordered a chicken burger which was cooked very well per my request. The french fries were my favorite. My friends ordered salad and an egg sandwich and a BLT. Needless to say I tried everything and loved everything.
