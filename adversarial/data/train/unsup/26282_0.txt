I have stopped by here a couple times for lunch, as I work in the area. I love their lunch specials. The size is large, they are less pricy compared to their dinner items, and takes really good.\n\nMost of the lunch specials are accompanied with the 6 sides, from which the kimchi and the potatoes are my favorite. Usually a soup is provided too, a light miso soup with egg, and that is really good too. My favorite entree here is the vegetarian bibimbop which is given in a hot sizzling bowl. I recently got the \"spicy chick\" which was marinated chicken and stir fried in a really tasty spicy sauce. \n\nThe atmosphere is loung-ish, relaxed and have korean songs playing in the background. Definitely not a place to grab a quick lunch, but instead have a more relaxed one!
