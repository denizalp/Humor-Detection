What is a hummingbird's favorite food? Hummus! This is a good lunch option in Independence. The hummus tastes watered down. Aladdin's charges a little bit more than what it should be but I guess they get what they want. I rather eat any of the places up on Lorain west of W 117th but this is where I go when stuck at work. A lot of cute girls come here for lunch so I will be lurking in creep mode.
