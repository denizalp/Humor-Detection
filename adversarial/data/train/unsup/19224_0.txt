Gallagher's showcases their dry-aged steaks in a glassed exterior wall to draw attention to those passing by.  This is brilliant marking because the steaks look absolutely amazing. \n\nWe started with shrimp scampi, clam chowder and a wedge salad. The shrimp scampi ($18.00) was prepared with a tomato cream sauce and was very good. The clam chowder ($8.00) was made with a heavy hand of bacon. The bacon choked out the flavor of clams. The salad ($9.00) was fresh, cold and delicious. \n\nFor entrees we took the advice of our waiter and ordered the cowboy ribeye. ($47.00) It does not come with sides so we added creamed spinach ($9.00) and a baked potato. ($9.00) The ribeye was cooked perfectly and looked mouthwatering good. The compliments stop there because the steak was really tough and bland....a huge disappointment. The baked potato was good but the creamed spinach was not seasoned properly and had a distinct taste of flour.
