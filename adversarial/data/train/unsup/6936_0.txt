I enjoy eating in delis; I guess living in NYC and the surrounding areas for two decades has made me develop an appreciation for this genre of food. I'm glad that this deli does not disappoint. The dishes are deli staples, the servings are generous, and the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you get - and you get the food fast because you make your choices from the already-prepared offerings in the large trays as you move through the queue.  The convenient location, bright and spacious interior, modern vibe, and friendly service all contribute to an overall pleasant and relaxed dining experience.
