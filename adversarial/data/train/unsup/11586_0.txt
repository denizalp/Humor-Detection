A waste of money! Never live here, it's a fucking shithole. I'll be moving out. Fuck this place. Community areas are always dirty, takes about 3 flushes before my toilet water is clear, 1980's blinds breaking, incompetent assholes always shutting water off to fix pipes, dog shit everywhere in parking lot, I was charged $160 bc idiot maintenance couldn't fix my kitchen sink and they had to call outside plumber in. I misplaced my mailbox key and they tried to charge me $51 for another one... that is, until I told them it only costs $5 to make a key. Then ooops, my bad... \"actually the cost is $5.12 with tax\". They will rip you off every chance they get. Fuck this place!
