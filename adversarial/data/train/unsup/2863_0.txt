Great place to take anyone with A big enough appetite. My friends and I decided to stop here after a movie. I had never been to the diner so I figured hey At least they have a vast menu and they serve breakfast all day.\n\nWe were seated right away in a booth which was very comfortable and large. Our waiter Aaron was a great at his job and was really accommodating especially for my friend who's very picky about what she eats. He was able to make me a virgin mint julep which tasted great!! \n\nI ordered the Greek eggs Benedict with a Greek side salad. The dressing on the salad is definitely the best that I've ever tasted. When my eggs Benedict came out the chunks of Gyro meat that were on them were humongous. Of course I couldn't eat it all because the English muffin was twice as big as what I'm used too. The Gyro meat was very flavorful and juicy the eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce just added that perfect creamy touch to the top. My husband ordered the veal Parmesan which was actually pretty decent. The marinara sauce they use is made in house and has small chunks of tomato in there so you know it's fresh. \n\nOur friends ordered a chef salad along with an omelette both of which were very filling. The salad alone came in this large bowl that was big enough for about four people to eat. \n\nAfter dinner we ordered a slice of one of their various cakes, it was mango and raspberry filled. I wasn't too thrilled about the cake, the bread was kind of dense and maybe on the dry side. I think next time I might skip dessert or try their rice pudding instead. \n\nAll in all this is a great place to take your family or friends when you're not sure what to eat. The menu is large enough to accommodate anyone's  tastebuds from from Italian to Greek to American they pretty much have it all.
