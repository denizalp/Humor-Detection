Overwhelming... Crap everywhere. They look like they went to auctions. Priced stuff for TV and then threw it in this place. A lot of the stuff was way overpriced. I didn't even really find anything I wanted cause I actually would have tried to negotiate. Not sure if they would go for it but worth the try. They got everything here from Tvs to umbrellas to dishes bikes tents. Didn't see any furniture, primary household stuff. Got s lot of bikes outside but not in the greatest condition for the price. Rather pay a little more and get a new one.
