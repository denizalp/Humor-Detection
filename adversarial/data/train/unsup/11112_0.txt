I love Haus!  They have a wonderful array of modern furniture and accessories.  But what I like the most was their display of concave mirrors.  They also have some very nice walnut framed mirror.  I have a friend that likes Jonathan Adler, though I'm not seeing it.  They also have some fun items to sort thru.  Give 'em a shot, you will be visually entertained.  They also have a location in Biltmore, but this store on Scottsdale is bigger.
