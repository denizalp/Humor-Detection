No.\n\nEvery native Arizonan swears by this place...so much so that I just had to check it out for myself. And...? No.\n\nThe fries were pretty good, and Pete's is generous with them. But the fish? I've had frozen fish sticks that tasted better than that stuff. Yes, I tried the shrimp too. Those weren't much better. So, no.\n\nWait, their red sauce was kind of good. I do agree with people about that. But, what's the point of good sauce on rubbish food? So, still, no.\n\nWill I be back? I think you know the answer to that question.
