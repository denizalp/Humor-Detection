Very snobby. Had lunch with a friend here today. I bought a sandwich for lunch and she bought a dessert. We ate on the patio and although we were both paying customers, we were asked to leave because my friend had a salad from a competitor outside of Maman. I didn't even get a chance to finish my lunch (that i purchased at Maman). When we explained to the waiter and showed him what we had just purchased from Maman he said he didn't care and told us to leave. It was very rude and unprofessional. I will not be dining here again and will recommend to my colleagues to not bother giving them their business.
