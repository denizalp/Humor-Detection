We've made a reservation to come here on a Friday night right before heading to the light show nearby. BIG MISTAKE! \n\nWe arrived 10 minutes before 6p.m. that night. Even with lots of tables available, they made us wait until exactly 6p.m. before sitting us. Not a big deal. Then, we seat for another 10 minutes before anyone noticed us. Since they were so busy that night, our waiter wanted us to order our food right then and there. Not a problem. We understand. Needless to say, our main entr√©e did not arrive until an hour later. Yes, you heard me right. It was exactly an hour. What made me furious was this - I order a prime rib medium rare and it came in almost completely cooked. \n\nIt clearly wasn't our water's fault that the kitchen wasn't doing their jobs. Even the manager came over to apologize and gave us a free appetizer. I notified the waiter that my steak was not to my liking, but I was too hungry to wait for another one. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because the manager felt bad and comp us on my meal. The music was so loud we couldn't even talk to each other without screaming. Overall, it was a horrible experience. \n\nI will never come back here again. It literally ruined my Friday night.
