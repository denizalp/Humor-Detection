These guys do a very good tribute show to the Bee Gees.  Their voices are similar to the Bee Gees I grew up with and to which I listened a lot.  From the late 60s with \"Massachusetts\" to the more modern disco sounds of Grease and Saturday Night Fever, they covered a litany of the Bee Gees music.\n\n1\/3 of the way into the show, the drummer and bass player left the stage and the 3 used just one mike and one guitar for several songs they sang.  It was a superb series of songs and really showed off their talents.\n\nAt the end, when they were doing the disco music, Club \"Mo\" opened and people were invited to come up and dance and one number they sang was \"You Should Be Dancing.\"  \n\nAs for the venue, it's relatively small, holding a couple of hundred people.  I got a seat along the counter between the floor seating and the rear seats.  It was a great place to sit because I had a place to lean on, place my soda, and just be comfortable a bit higher up than the floor and with an unobstructed view of the stage.  I've been in the theatre before to see Louie Anderson and Ronn Lucas, and I was seated at one of the 8 person long tables, and I don't like that layout as well.\n\nA few gripes about shows in general, namely audiences.  Please plan to arrive ON TIME.  Coming in 20 minutes late is not fashionable and is very disruptive to other members of the audience.  Also, the fact that you paid to see the show doesn't mean you have the right to keep talking throughout the show.  Why do people pay good money to see a show and then miss a lot of it because their talking with the person with whom they came.  Shut up, watch, and listen.\n\nThis is a great show!  Go and see it.
