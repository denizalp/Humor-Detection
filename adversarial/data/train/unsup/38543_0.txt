Allyson and I ate here before going to Zumanity on our early Valentine's Day date. It was really easy to make a reservation; used OpenTable. Once we were there, we arrived about 15 minutes or so, and was promptly seated. Very impressive since they were really busy that day.\n\nThe lighting in the restaurant was fairly dark, but I can see why. It is more of an intimate and romantic place, and you should be aimed in on your date.\n\nOur server, David, properly introduced himself, and we were given a menu as well as their wine selection.\n\nI ordered the Prime Bone-In NY Steak, and Allyson ordered the filet mignon. On the side I ordered a side of asparagus, and topped with the truffle poached lobster, and had a big pour of Ladera on the side.\n\nSteaks were ordered Med. Rare, and were cooked to perfection.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate lava cake, and it was the perfect way to end our dinner.\n\nI have to say thank you to the staff for the experience, and will definitely be back for another special occasion.
