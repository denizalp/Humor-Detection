My husband and I have both tanned at this salon a couple of different times. The girls are ALWAYS very friendly and they do everything they can to make sure you don't wait long, even if they give you a courtesy upgrade. \n\nThe beds a clean and they have a wide variety of selection for your tanning needs. \n\nWe like how fast, easy and convenient the location is to get to! The owner is A+++ and def knows how to run a business. We stopped tanning temp due to moving but if\/when we are in the market for tanning again we will be back for sure!!!
