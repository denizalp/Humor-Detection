I would like to share a positive experience I had with Lorex. I previously posted a negative review regarding a situation I had with my NVR. The NVR stopped working 12 months and 4 days later. I called the 800 number many times with no results just added frustration. They would not help in anyway. I ended up having the NVR serviced at a Electronic Repair shop. The power supply was the issue. At that time I posted a negative review on Yelp. A few days later a lady ( I do not want to mention her name to respect her privacy) at Lorex\/FLIR head office located  in Markham,  Ontario. contacted me. Through communication via email and phone. She offered to replaced the NVR with a BNIB NVR at no charge and pay return shipping for the defective unit. Unfortunately at the time the defective NVR was being serviced and now working. I had to refuse. This lady then went over and beyond and offered me the new NVR at a very very reasonable price with a full 1 year no BS warranty.  I accepted the offer. I have invested alot of time and money on this HD IP system. .. bought extra cameras and had it professionally installed. I now have a new NVR with warranty and a backup NVR incase needed in future. I must say KUDOS to this lady. My recommendation to everyone who has an issue with there products. Call the head office in Markham before you give up and post negative comments. I am still experiencing issues with Android mobile App. I hear that there will be a fix out shortly as they are working out all the bugs. I hope that ALL Lorex\/FLIR employees read this and follow this ladies ethics. I hope her higher ups read this and praise her as it is well deserved.
