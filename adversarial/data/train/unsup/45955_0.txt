I love Snapdragon! I have been going here since 2011, and I have never been disappointed. I have naturally dark, wavy hair and Kandy is a wiz at bringing it to a natural looking blonde without frying my hair like other colorists have done in the past. I love this place so much that my mom started going here too! The staff are friendly and cool, and I always feel like I'm a good friend here for a visit. The decor is open, full of light and airy, and they have very comfortable seats at the shampoo bowls. I have lived all over the country, and have been to dozens of different salons, and by far, Snapdragon is the best.
