You enter the lounge and are greeted by five or six women aged between 20-35 years old who sit behind their counters. Not all were friendly, some acted as if they did not want to be there, or did not want to be bothered. I asked a couple of questions regarding the package we purchased and I was treated as if I was pestering the woman I was speaking to. Not a good start when you just spent approximately $1000 for your driving experience. We are a military family that purchased our tickets through the mwr at Nellis AF base. We decided to go with Dream Racing because the voucher we bought included an additional lap for each person driving a car. There was a total of five of us in our party. When we actually got there, they offered us only one additional lap for one of our drivers. \n\nThe instruction prior to being brought out to the track is thorough. However, each car we rode in had no AC. When it's the middle of summer, it's as if you are driving in an oven, I'm sure temperatures were over 100 degrees that day. \n\nAfter the experience is over, you're brought back into the lounge where the staff you met initially tries to up sell photos or videos. Some of the staff were subtly insulting, just by the way we were spoken to and treated. The ladies working the counter were overly nice and attentive to all the men in our party including my fiance. But as for myself and the other women we were visiting with, the staff were downright nasty. Rude, unprofessional and catty. It was clear they obviously had a problem with us. They desperately need to train their staff and emphasize how important customer service is. We visit Vegas multiple times a year.  Unfortunately we won't be returning back to this place. We were hoping for an amazing experience from start to finish. The driving itself is awesome, but when it's paired with horrible customer service... It just kind of makes you cringe and wish you had picked Exotics Racing instead. If I could give zero stars I would.
