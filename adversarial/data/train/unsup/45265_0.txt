After a sad 2 studio-less years for west Bloor West Village, after Moksha's landlord suddenly and unceremoniously ended their lease early and kicked them out to redevelop the building, it is SO nice that the owners have finally been able to save up again and rebuild. And the new space is right across the street from the old studio and looks out at the Don't Worry Be Happy sign they had to leave behind - that has to be some kind of karma! :) \n\nThere is one large heated mirrored practice room, new change rooms with (at least in the women's!) 4 working showers (2 individual), and many of the same friendly welcoming staff and patient, encouraging teachers. \n\nThere are more Yin style classes and 75 minute Moksha hot yoga classes on the schedule now than at the old studio - a good thing in my opinion! My only request is another late-night class for those of us who aren't home from work in time for the 8pm one!
