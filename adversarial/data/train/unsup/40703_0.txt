Great collection of pinball machines, old and new!  There is also a wall of video games, including the likes of Paperboy, Frogger, and Donkey Kong.  No shortage on 2 player games, like foosball so bring a friend.\n\nBring enough cash to play.  There are plenty of change machines and no charge to enter so more to spend.  There is also a soda machine and 25 cent popcorn to keep your hunger at bay.\n\nI was expecting it to be the size of a warehouse bit it was quite smaller.  Don't let that dissuade you because you could be here for days and still not play all the games.  Fun times a short distance from the strip!
