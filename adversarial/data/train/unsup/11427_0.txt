Good, solid bakery and cafe chain.  Always seems pretty clean.  Employees are friendly and helpful.  Can be pretty busy around peak hours though.\n\nThey have a nice combo special where you choose 2 items (1\/2 pasta, cup of soup, 1\/2 sandwich, and\/or 1\/2 salad) and get a freshly-baked cookie for dessert -- they always give you a chocolate chip one unless you request something different.  The portions are decent sized, I always leave pleasantly full.\n\nI recommend the Garden Vegetable soup with pesto (which comes with a roll), the Fontina Grilled Cheese panini with added tomatoes (make sure to check that they melt the cheese all the way, sometimes when it's busy, they seem to skimp on the grill time), and the Crumbly Blue Cheese salad (ask for light dressing though -- they usually really go after it -- unless you like salad with your dressing).
