I was referred to NO &SC by a friend of mine who has seen Dr. Ashman for multiple surgeries. I thought my experience would be much better than it was.\n\nOn my first visit, it was over 2 hours that I sat in the waiting room before I was seen. I had an early appointment, 9am, so I find it hard to believe that the doctor was running so late. It was very rude for him to be so behind- I don't show up to appointments with my clients 2 hours late. Do you?\n\nI was immediately taken to get an x-ray. The nurses did not notify me that this was not part of the standard appointment and that my insurance would be billed. Had i been notified, I would have asked to reference my insurance about how much my bill would be.\n\nTwo months after my last visit, I received a bill in the mail for the x-ray. I was told that my insurance only partially covers the cost and that I was responsible for the balance.I questioned why I wasn't given the chance to consult my insurance prior. Every employee I spoke with at the center about the bill was extremely rude. \n\nOne patient services rep told me that had I wanted to call my insurance during my appointment to consule about costs, Dr. Ashman would move on to the next patient because he didn't have time to wait for me to make the call. \n\nI was appalled. I was paying for a service and was made to wait 2+ hours on my first visit and the employees treated me as though they do not care if I return? Don't worry, I will never be back.
