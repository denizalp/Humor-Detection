I had The classic eggs Benedict. My husband had the egg and bacon in the whole French toast. This may be one of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had outside at the five-star restaurant. The hollandaise is homemade. The eggs are beautifully. Michael, our server, recommended extra crispy hashbrowns. I would recommend the extra crispy hashbrowns. They were delicious. My husband left his French toast.  Cute Decour. Quick service. Highly recommend for a breakfast or brunch in Henderson.
