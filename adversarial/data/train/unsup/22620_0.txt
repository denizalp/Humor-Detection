We accidentally came across this taco stand and I'm so glad we did! It was 11pm on Saturday night when we decided to stop by. The two guys working were friendly and helped us out right away. \n\nWe ordered one carne asada quesadilla with the guacamole and pico de gallo on the side, and my friend had a carne asada taco with everything on top. \n\nMy quesadilla was delicious! The cheese was stretchy and the meat was great! I drenched my quesadilla with the red salsa and it was heaven! My friend enjoyed her taco and she said it was so full of flavor! \n\nThe quesadillas are $7 and drinks are a $1.50. (They have canned sodas and water) They have three tables available on top of some cute fake grass and our table was clean! The music was poppin and the ambience was nice! \n\nWe will definitely come by again sometime soon!
