What is great in life?  Being with friends, close in at the table, great conversation, wine and food. Without a doubt, our night at Parallax was one of the best dining experiences I have had in my life.  The service  was perfect- not too much, not too little - just right.  Our apps were great but the star of the show besides the company ;) was the skate wing.  I have never had a better meal in my life.  when in Cleveland you must go to Parallax.  It's all great.
