If only I can give negative stars the worst hotel I've ever been and the two ladies working there are very rude. I was hung up on, I took out my own trash the floor was so dirty the sheets had stains and it just smelled bad. The very first 10 minutes I was there they were trying to kick out a homeless lady while the homeless lady yelled profanity. I could listen to what the people in other rooms are doing and yes exactly what you think they were doing. I was just trying to save some money at the end I ended up going over.  Check  out time of 11 and I checked out around 1215 and was charged $20 extra. Never again if the owners are reading this please change your attitude.
