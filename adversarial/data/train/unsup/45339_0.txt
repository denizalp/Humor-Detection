10 stars. The size, the flavors, the food, THE FOOOOD!  I can't express my love for this restaurant in words. You MUST go here. Please!!  Best chicken and waffles ever. I don't know what they do to their fried chicken but it must have been rolled in gold dust and liquid amazing. My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. Ok I can't say anymore or I'm going to have to drive here now!
