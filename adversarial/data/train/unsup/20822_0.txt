food is SO. GOOD. Came here last night with my mom for a quick bite. My mom had been here before and was impressed. Must say far exceeded my expectations. \n\nFirst up the waiter brought us crackers and this addicting onion sauce\/jam\/oil thing that I couldn't stop eating. \n\nChecked in on Yelp and got complementary sangria that was pretty good, maybe a touch too sweet but hey it's free. \n\nDrunken Avocado empandillas-reminds me of cheesecake factory's avocado eggs rolls. Comes with a delicious sauce, just wish there was more of it. Especially liked the little salad served on the side. Tons of avocado, if you like avocado this is for you. \n\nPaella para mi-holy YUM. Could not stop eating this delicious, paella with lamb sausage and mild heat. \n\nShish kabob with Isreali salad and jasmine rice-the meat was soooo good. Tender and juicy and perfect. The Isreali salad was a standard but done correctly. Rice was delicious as well. \n\nQuick service and friendly staff. 100% will be back want to try the potato bravas, shakshuka, hummus and basically everything else on the menu.
