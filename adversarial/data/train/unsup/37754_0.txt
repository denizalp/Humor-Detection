I called Thunderbird and they set an appointment for February 10 with Carlos. He came to our home to provide a design recommendation and was very receptive to our feedback during the visit. He said he would have a design to us by the end of the week. A week passes and we receive nothing. I email and text him and receive no response. Days later I called the office and they stated this type of delay was normal and to give it a lil time. Carlos calls the next day and leaves a voicemail claiming he had just got his computer back and was catching up but working vigorously to get our design and estimate. Well that's the last we heard from him! No design, no phone call, no follow up whatsoever. Needless to say we took our business elsewhere. TERRIBLE customer experience! \nI left a similar comment like this on their Instagram page they said we are very sorry about this! And That's definitely not okay, if I could please email my contact information so they can get this handled to kelly@thunderbirdpools.com then deleted my comment so no one could read it. This has been handled we went with another company! I just wanted to leave my experience I had with Thunderbird Pools
