My mom was still moaning and groaning from the time I forgot to pick her up from the airport. So when mothers day came around I knew I had to go all out with something special. I yelped for the nearest flower shop and headed over. The hottest redhead I've ever seen was waiting to help me with my floral arrangement. Long story short, my mom is a happy camper! Thank you English Garden! I'll definitely be back to pick up some oversized bamboo for my feng shui living room.
