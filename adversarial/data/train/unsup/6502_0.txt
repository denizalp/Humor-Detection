I came here Aug 7, 2017 because of rave reviews, and I really liked House of Eggroll (not the name tho, the food).  But for Let's Eat Noodles, I feel the Yelp definition of 2 stars \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is very accurate.  My most salient impression is the same as the reviewer who said the \"food was overpriced, and not enough meat in the noodle bowls\".  We ordered 5 different noodle bowls.  ALL had TINY pieces of meat, like 4 small pieces.  The most tasty was the pork intestine in spicy broth.  Person who ordered the noodles with spare ribs said she only got 4 skinny pieces of spare ribs maybe 1\" long, and the meat was very dry.  Also the total portion in the bowl was not very much.  Big bowl only half full, makes the portion look even smaller.  We also unanimously agreed that we wished our egg that they put in each bowl of noodles had soft yolk instead of kinda hard boiled-like.  \n\nWe shared a fried tilapia for $9.95.  It was hardly anything for $9.95, especially fried where you can hardly find the fish meat, and the head takes up 1\/3 of the size.  Tilapia was tasty, small, but not tasty enough to come back and order same again.  It was like \"fish jerky\", we said.  \n\nI felt the noodle broth that was not spicy, was \"eh\".  I would have preferred MSG in it to make it taste better, less bland.  I shook salt into the non-spicy broth.  But the pork intestine broth was full-bodied and \"good\".  \n\nMy Taiwanese friend said she gets so much more portion and good taste-wise from China Magic Noodle house, for less money $8.50 vs $10 at Let's Eat Noodles.  She was quite dissatisfied with the four short and skinny little pieces of spare rib she got in her soup,\n\nThe BBQ skewered appetizers in the glass case are 6 for $4.99 but with so little on each skewer, our opinion was it wasn't worth buying.  \n\nWe also shared a Magic Ice jello Dessert.  It was unremarkable, herbal tasting, good for diabetics tho, not too sweet.  \n\nOne of my party said he was still hungry, when we were leaving.  But we didn't wanna pay for MORE food when we thought that we were already overpaying for what we got.  \n\nHardly anyone in the restaurant the entire Monday night.  I hope for them, more business when ASU is in session.  \n\nI give the service 4 stars.  Li was sweet and friendly, told us about the menu, and brought us everything we asked, brought us more water, and they divvy upped the bill so that 4 shared, and 1 had their own bill, without complaint.  The people I ate with said they would rate the food 1 star, but I said Li was at least a 4 star server.  So I am ranking 2 stars.  \n\nWhen I left the restaurant I told Li we all felt that the noodle bowls had too little meat.   She said \"If you want MORE meat, we have to charge you MORE\".  I said, \"I mean we all felt that we were already paying too much for the amount in the bowl of noodles are are unwilling to pay MORE\".   Li just acknowledged my opinion with a gracious smile.  Food was not terrible, but the 5 of us all agreed it was NOT good enough to come back to.   Poor value.  We talked about how we could get a larger bowl of pho #1 everything in it at most Vietnamese restaurants for $7.50.\n\n   I do look forward to trying \"Shaanxi Garden\" when they open at 67 N Dobson Rd Unit#109 Mesa AZ 85201 in Oct.
