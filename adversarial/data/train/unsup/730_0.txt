This review is not about the food... Chain food is all the same regardless of the name of the business (Denny's. Applebees. Chili's. TGIF)\n\nFirst  - Great Happy hour!! Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.\n\nSecond  - Bartender!!! I don't know the cutie pie's name but !MAN O MAN! It was like watching Tom Cruise in Cocktails. But better. This guy is so talented and entertaining. He was able to throw those bottles and shakers and glasses around while making the perfect drink..\n\nThird  - Service was quick. Well, in the bar area....\n\nAll in all, I would return if I wanted cheap chain food and the handsome and talented bartender was working.
