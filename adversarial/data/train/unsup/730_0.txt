Absolument génial!\nI'm so glad I found this place recently; it's definitely my favourite café in Toronto now. You'd swear you were stepping across the ocean to France. There's beautiful french music in the background, an incredible selection of genuine french treats, and absolutely lovely staff who always greet you with a 'bonjour'. :)
