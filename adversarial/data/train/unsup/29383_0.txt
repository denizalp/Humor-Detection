Awesome place! Old Town Scottsdale has the rep of being just a nightclub district, but this place actually has amazing food and a killer happy hour. Don't get me wrong, it is a great bar\/nightclub but the food is totally underrated. They make their own fried pickles from scratch and have mini corn dogs made with CHORIZO sausage! Never tried anything like that before but loved it. For the meal I tried the Shrimp & Grits, and for the size of the shrimp it was surprisingly affordable and the grits had chunks of ham in it (I didn't even know what grits were before but loved it lol. Kinda like mashed potatoes). My friend tried the Whiskey Burger and said it was delicious. Grilled jalape√±os and bacon under melted cheddar with BBQ sauce. They also have a great drink menu. I tried their New Fashioned, which was served in a mason jar over crushed ice and had fresh blackberries muddled into it. The bartender told me how they use a blackberry whiskey in it and a type of bitters that really makes the drink. The staff is polite and personable, and the girls aren't bad to look at either ;). The layout is cool; big bar, nice open patio, wood panel walls that give it that country feel and the stage where live music performs is ABOVE the bar. As far as an overall restaurant\/bar\/club in Old Town, this has to be my number 1 spot! This place has everything and you could catch me here any day of the week.
