For a couple who loves to explore and find new places to eat, we found Eggspectation on our first day in Montreal and then never looked for another breakfast spot.  I don't recall the last time we did that.  For eight different breakfasts over four days we never found a meal we didn't love.  \n\nWhether it was the Sugar Shack (Scrambled eggs, potatoes, ham and crepes bretonne), the French Toast Flambe (French toast with bananas, strawberries and walnuts in triple sec) the Eggtravaganza (two eggs, French toast, choice of breakfast meat and potatoes), Yolk Around the Clock (a split Montreal bagel with eggs fried in the holes and covered with cheese), French Toast, Healthy Start (Eggs and fruit), French Toast Pagen(with fruit and Crème Anglais), or Pancakes Page they were all wonderful.  The potatoes are lyonaisse style which is 1\/4 inch thick slices which are then cooked, finished in the fryer and served with sautéed sweet onions and parsley.  Absolutely fantastic.  Of course, only pure Canadian Maple Syrup was served when required.\n\nSo maybe, eight meals in four days is a lot.  However, we feel there are several menu items we have yet to discover.
