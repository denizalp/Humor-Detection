I was a little wary of using this company after reading some of the reviews, but I called to get a breast pump (covered by my insurance), a week ago, and it arrived today.  The initial phone call to inquire about the process was helpful and efficient, and they took care of the rest with my medical provider.  I can't speak to how this would have gone had I needed some other kind of equipment in combination with a different insurance\/ doctor, but getting this breast pump was a relatively smooth process for me.
