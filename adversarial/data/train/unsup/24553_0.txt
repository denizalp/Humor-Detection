This is my favorite Bimbimap spot in Vegas. Why? Because it's healthy, affordable, located walking distance from my work, and the food here is tasty!\n\nThe interior decor is simple, yet very cute. There are books to read, ranging from how to speak Korean, KPop culture, Korean cook books, and even Korean slang. It's adorable, lol. \n\nThe staff are always kind and ready to help customers out.\n\nThe set-up is similar to assembly style\/build-your-own spots. First, you pick whether you want a classic bowl or a hot stone bowl. You then order a base (white or purple rice). Select a protein (beef, chicken, spicy pork, organic tofu, salmon for an extra $1.50). Choose your veggies, and then top off your food with the final touches. \n\nI get a classic bowl with purple rice, beef bulgogi, spinach, zucchini, fried egg, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and side sauces of sriracha mayo and teriyaki. \n\nWill definitely be a regular at this place. I'm addicted to BIBIM Kitchen.
