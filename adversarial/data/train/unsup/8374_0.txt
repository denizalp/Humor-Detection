Dinner was absolutely divine!! \n\nWe ordered the tasting menu - but to really get the bang for your buck I would recommend ordering two different tasting menus. We ordered the vegetarian tasting menu ($55) and the full tasting menu($130). We had 15 different plates and there was enough food for my boyfriend and I. \n\nThe service was wonderful - but you would expect that. The servers were great and each dish was explained. \n\nIf I could I would go back! :)
