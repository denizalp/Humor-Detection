The food was terrible at best. Prime rib was tough. I thought mashed potatoes and gravy would be a safe bet. I was wrong. The gravy was thin and lacked any flavor. The seafood was underwhelming. The crab legs were so small and the tempura shrimp was greasy. I wouldn't go back even if the meal were free.
