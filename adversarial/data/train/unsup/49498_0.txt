Both my girls loved this gym. My oldest who is 21 now loved the classes way back when and my six year old loved it as well. Unfortunately we moved and my now 6 year old attends USA on power road and germann and let me tell you I wish we were still at Az Dynamics. I love that they let you make up a class if you ever miss, others don't. I also love that the area for parents is up close and personal so you actually get to see your kids. I definitely would recommend AZ to friends. I did take away one star only because the customer service could have been a tad better.
