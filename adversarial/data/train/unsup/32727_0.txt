I have been trying to get here for a while and it happened. The place doesn't look like much when you drive by and you can miss it.\n\nThe inside has a wall of pictures and Is divvy looking with two dining areas. The kitchen is exposed and you can watch your food being prepared, see my pictures.\n\nThe menu is not huge but it all sounds good so figuring out what to get was a challenge. I settled on the gulf shrimp po boy with red beans\/rice with sausage.\n\nThe food came pretty quick and smelled good, see my pictures. The gulf shrimp is hand breaded and cooked to order. The gulf shrimp po boy was very tasty with fresh ingredients and was a good choice. The red beans\/rice with smoked was very good. The red beans were in a thick but mild sauce and the grilled smoked sausage was the perfect complement.\n\nThis a great cajon place with great food and I can see why it started to get a line while we were there and wait times were going up.
