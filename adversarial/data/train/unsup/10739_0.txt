Came here as our last stop before heading to the airport splitting after a great family weekend celebrating moms 50! We enjoyed a great time watching the 49er and many other games play this day! \n\nWe started with the loaded nachos (minus any meat) and potatoe skins minus the bacon. Both were delicious, nachos were full and you can actually taste the beans which is rare! We loved both these dishes!\n\nFor lunch, table ordered the: Cajun pasta(no meat) grilled cheese, vegetarian sandwich, enchilada sandwich with black bean party, chicken pesto and the quesadilla (added spinach instead of the cheese). The food was really great for almost all members! It was hot, spicy, and tasty! The Cajun pasta was not very spicy and therefore the older sis was unhappy and the vege sandwich was very dry. Buttttt everything else was like amazing! We all wish there was a place like this in sacramento\/california! \n\nOne very important factor in enjoying the game, food and the experience was our waitress! She was super prompt, made all our substitutions perfect(which is hard!) and was super easy going and happy! I really really am sad to head to the airport after such a great meal! I highly recommend this place for any football fans and anyone in desire for a great American meal! Very healthy options too and kid friendly!!!
