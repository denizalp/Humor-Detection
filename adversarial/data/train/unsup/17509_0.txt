Came here because I desperately had to use the bathroom ... so I paid $7 (I think) for a subpar fresh fruit mango bubble tea.\n\nIt wasn't delicious.  I have had better.  And it was over-priced.\n\nThe bathroom was really gross too ... not E-Tea's fault since I think they share the bathroom with the other tenants in the building.  But, it is one of those washrooms you see in movies - narrow hallway, dark, dingy, yucky, and although this washroom didn't have a single hanging light bulb with a string to turn on and off, one would have fit perfectly in this washroom.\n\nAnyway, still on the hunt for a yummy fresh fruit bubble tea :)
