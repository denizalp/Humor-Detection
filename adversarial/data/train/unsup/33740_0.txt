Incredible food, fabulous vibe and amazing service! We were a party of 15 and the staff were super accommodating and attentive. Our glasses were always filled up, they were always smiling and super kind! The food was perfection! We now know what all the hype is about. \n\nSince we were a large party, we ordered from the family style menu ($49 per person). There was more than enough food and by the end of the three courses, we were stuffed to the brim. Out of all the fabulous food, the calamari fritti, kale salad and the canestri alla vodka are must-haves. Our entire group of friends was astounded by the flavours and quality of the food. The ginger carrot cake at the end was truly iconic. Fluffy, balanced, moist and the perfect way to end a memorable meal. Can't wait to be back!
