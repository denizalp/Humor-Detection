Working in this area, there's not too much to choose from except fast food. So I decided on a break from Tim Hortons, subway and McDonalds. This was during lunch time and I was the only one there.\n\nEgg roll = more oil then flavor.  But was hot and freshly made.\n\nPad Thai = meh. I've had better. Good size portion, tastes like it was made when ordered but the sauce is barely there.\n\nSatay = yes it's made fresh. Peanut sauce is good. But so not worth the wait\n\nService = the only saving grace.
