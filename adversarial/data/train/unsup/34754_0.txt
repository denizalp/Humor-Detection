We decided between North and South and went with South after looking at the listing.  It's pretty easy to get to rather than deal with downtown.  Also, shops look more affordable than your Gucci and other high end stores.  The place looked pretty decent.  I found the Ralph Lauren Polo store and Brooks Brothers to have really nice deals for Memorial Day.  My mom found a belt at the Banana Republic.  We tried looking for an Eddie Bauer but no luck here.  Interesting stores here with Volcon and other brands which I haven't seen.  It takes a while to walk from one end to another.  Other stores on outside hard to access in this indoor mall.  But, at least it's all indoors and you don't have to battle weather, etc.  \n\nThere is an Annex to this outlet which has Disney stuff for real cheap, Saks Off the 5th, and some other local stores.  Other stores are wicked expensive for usual touristy stuff like ponchos and leather goods.  There is a random apparel store with heavily discounted Disney and hats with no logos and T-shirts with some random stuff on it.  I think the store owner got these shirts and stuff for dirt cheap and now off-loading for less than $10.
