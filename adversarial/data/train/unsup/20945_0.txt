A perfectly perfect first dinner here at a company private-room gathering for a group of 11. Beautiful presentation, delicious fare, and professional service. I had no clue this is a selective chain restaurant, so I frankly do not care. Beautiful restaurant that I see as a perfect locale in which to host private parties for two or more. The decor is pleasantly dark, deep, and rich.
