Cute place with 4 stories of options that is M&M related, from pajamas, t-shirts, toys, to peanut butter M&Ms! The candy is a bit pricey but there's so many options of flavors and some that you can't get anywhere else but here. \n\nI was mesmerized and that's the point, with all the bright and shiny souvenirs, you can't help but spend money here. They even had an M&M dancing outside to some music, it's really cute and really kid friendly in Vegas, no less.
