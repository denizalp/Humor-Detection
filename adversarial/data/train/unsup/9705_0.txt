Two of my favorite reviewers, Blair B. & Elizabeth L., checked in with 5-star reviews of this joint, so against my natural impulse to RUN...RUN FARRRR AWAY from this place considering its cheese-tacular setting and it's in the Paris, which is just a gotawful hotel, (with albeit a really good Double Deck Blackjack pit) I decided to give it the ol' college try.\n\nHmmm. Niiiiiiice.\n\nHow do I put this?  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is like that girl you knew in college that you'd see across the auditorium in PoliSci 103 that didn't really look 'all that' from afar so you didn't pay much attention to her.  That is, until your pal tells you that she was at the kegger the other night that you missed to study for your Stats final and it turns out she's kinda cool but deliberately hides her face in class, wears a Chargers jersey on the weekends, and can down 5 shots of Patron faster than that chick Marion from 'Raiders'.  \n\nSo you check her out just for yuks and you discover that she's actually immensely cool, really smart - heck, she's acing the class - on top of being about a solid '9' & you realize you've been a total dick for pre-judging her and wasting your time not getting to know her better.  But by then your sophomore year's over and she transfers to another UC, changes her digits, and you never see her again.  Ever!  \nDAMMMMMMMMIT!!!\n\nHmrph.. uh, where was I?\n\nTHE FOOD?  THE VIEW?\nOh yeah.  Food's good.  And the view's pretty awesome, what with the fountains and strip and all.  Your girl will definitely dig it.  This is classic French cuisine and eating here made me feel like I was cheating on Andre Rochat.  \nWe're eating French here, so you should know that the dishes will be small, right?  And you should go with classic French dishes, right?  Duck 2 Ways, Rack of Lamb, or Venison.  Fois Gras & Escargot.  And so here we go:\nDuck 2 Ways: 5\/5 \nRack of Lamb: 5\/5\nVenison: 4\/5\nFois Gras: 5\/5\nEscargot: 4\/5\n(\"When in France...\" you eat French food, right?   So who the heck goes to a French restaurant & says, \"I'll have the seabass\"?  Cripes - would you like a bowl of Miso soup with that?)\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE?\nThis is for the most part, a really elegant, classy restaurant with prompt and formal service.  I did notice an interesting theme however - that service quality appeared proportional to one's dress, so consider yourself forewarned.  I came in a sportcoat, dress shirt & slacks. \n....Did you ever wonder why Andre Rochat, famous for his Las Vegas French cuisine, never built an \"Andre's\" or an \"Alize\" in the only French themed hotel in Vegas?  Well, it might have something to do with the LOUD, CLASSLESS JACKASSES & THEIR OFFSPRING THAT PERMEATE THE PARIS HOTEL.  If there's one item that does not belong in any fine dining establishment, it's a HIGH CHAIR.\n...I'm sorry, but I really can't ignore this point.  The food is quite good but the environment while I was dining, was downright teeth-grating at times.  I can see why they are enforcing a dress code.  Too bad it's not enough.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nFocus on the food.  Dodge the tourists, go on the off season, and get to know this beauty of a restaurant.  Lest she disappear, a victim of the Vegas economy and you never get your chance.\n\n4-stars.\n\n------------------\nINSIDER'S HINT:  LAST MINUTE RESERVATIONS\nThe place is the only joint that fills up with reservations at Paris.  If you get in late, and you can't get a reservation by calling into the direct line, go to http:\/\/www.opentable.com and try getting a reservation there.  Eiffel Tower is available on OpenTable which often can get you reservations when none are otherwise available because the restaurant has to \"keep a few seats open\" for the service.
