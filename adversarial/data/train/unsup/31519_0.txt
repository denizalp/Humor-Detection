Let's keep this simple - it's fast and it's furious!\n\nI always get take out with Gal's because their service is amazingly.... FAST! \nEverytime I call in, regardless of how big the order is, they always tell me on the phone: \"Okay! No problem! Come by in 15 minutes!\" It amazes me how fast they go because that's how long it takes me to get there anyway sometimes. \n\nThe sushi I would say is okay - pretty consistently o..k.. - but for that price, it can't get any better.\nSo if you're ever looking for a quick fix for dinner, call Gal's! They can do everything for 15 minutes! \n\nI'm definitely looking forward to trying their Korean food though!
