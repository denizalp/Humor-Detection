Two extremely un-handy people move in together. Hilarity and handy.com on the proverbial speed-dial ensue. \n\nHoh-lee craaap. I've made a lot of trips to this hardware store, and my best bud has made even more. We slowly realized we needed one of every tool, screw, nail and hook known to man, and naturally we realized them one at a time. Enter agonizing trip after agonizing trip across the street to Home Hardware.\n\nBut here's the thing, the people at this Home Hardware are so lovely it wasn't nearly as painful as it could have been. Unfortunately, though they're all very nice, not all of them are experts on all things tools. You're looking for the dark-haired thin man. No, he's not a villain in a Charlie's Angel's reboot, he's the guy who knows what's up.\n\nThey have everything you're looking for, and if they don't, they (well, he'll) help you find it elsewhere by writing down exactly what you're looking for. \n\nHanging a TV on a drywall wall without studs that is secretly covering up decaying brick can be a harrowing experience. I wish your relationship well as you tackle it together.
