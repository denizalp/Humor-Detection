Oh my goodness! Talk about a great AYCE sushi restaurant.  Everything that comes to the table is presented wonderfully.  They even plated the squid and scallop as an amuse bouche.  As well, the soft shell crab was cooked to perfection.  I have to admit that I had to order the crab three more times. The decor is stunning.  The staff is very knowledgeable.  Leo, one of the waiters offered great suggestions, especially the 'black pearl' maki roll.  You have to try it.\n\n This place is owned by the same people as Ginza sushi on finch and on clark in Thornhill.  They clearly know what they are doing.
