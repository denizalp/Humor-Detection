My French mani took forever and was poorly done, with lots of imperfections. The poor lady knew she had done a bad job and actually apologized. I also had a pedicure done by a different tech, which turned out fine.\n\nI liked the modern white decor, but the service brought what should've been a zen experience into 1 star territory. The manager was not particularly pleasant towards me, and he had an strict, condescending attitude towards the techs which I found chilling. I watched as my tech asked him one little question about pricing and he was so rude when responding to her: first ignoring her, then snapping at her. For a second I felt like I was in a 3rd world sweatshop, which is pretty much the last thing I want when I go to a salon.
