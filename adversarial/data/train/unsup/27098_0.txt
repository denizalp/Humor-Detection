Stopped in after a long day at work for a late evening dinner. We were greeted almost immediately.  I ordered General Tso chicken combo. It came with egg drrop soup which was some of the best I have had. It ctame with cheese puffs, egg roll, fried rice and lomein.  A huge and tasty meal. The wife got a bowl of wonton soup.  It was huge and full of shrimp, veggies and lots of wontons.  Overall a very good meal at a reasonable price. We will be back.
