My first review of 2018 goes to Boyd's. I am very honest in my reviews and things have to be seamless from start to finish for a perfect rating. I HIGHLY recommend Boyd's and will update my review the more I utilize the services and see the consistency. \nThis cleaning service is 5 star from customer service to diligence in fixing what may be wrong as long as you point it out (if applicable). I'm 9 months pregnant and was up super LATE unable to sleep the Eve of New Year Eve at about 11:30pm I decided to check out Yelp to see if we could get lucky to get our family SUV detailed on NYE. I sent estimate and availability request to Boyd's and several other suggestions appeared and asked if I would like to send the same questions to others and I said Yes. I honestly didn't expect to hear back from anyone but I was awake. \nBoyd's replied quickly and we had dialogue back and forth and he provided us with an available time for 1pm on NYE. I was excited and I LOVED the location even though it's pretty far from us we wanted to get out and figured why not walk around in Uptown while the car was being detailed.\nBoyd texted once the car was completed, so we headed back. Thomas is such a nice, friendly and respectful guy. I see why he stay busy, he had another car working on it upon our return. We went to check out the SUV & did find a couple spots that were untouched on the roof and head rest of one of the seats. We also noticed a couple other small things that he immediately went to resolve for us and ask if there was anything else. The SUV is only a year old and it ended up looking like it did when we purchased Oct.2016 . Once the seats dried that evening they were pretty clean only a small stain left but I'm sure Thomas would kindly clean it if we took it back. \nWe are scheduling our teenager 2005 for a detail which REALLY would be a task worth a Before and After shot so we will definitely be utilizing his services again. \nWe HIGHLY recommend you give this service a try. It's worth it, did I mentioned no one else replied and once they did I was told they were on vacation.
