This is the cutest little place! It is also the perfect example of a good experience heavily depending on great service. The food was very normal and pretty cheap. The overall atmosphere and theming was really nice. However, the staff was super friendly, nice and very very welcoming. No complaints!\n\nBe mindful that they take cash only!
