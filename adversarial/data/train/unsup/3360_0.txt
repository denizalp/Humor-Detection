Those of you who have read my review of sportsclips know I like the concept and frequent the chain monthly.  I even have come here before and had good experiences with another stylist.  However, my most recent visit was horrendous.  From the greeting to the end, I was disappointed but mostly with the final product.  Here is what happened.  1) I arrived and even though I was the only one there besides those already seated, I had to wait while the girls chatted with each other.  Then the stylist came over and took me to her station.  Of all the girls I have had cut my hair at a sportsclips, this one was the worst.  She didn't even try to engage me in conversation.  I asked her to style my hair the way I always get it done, 1 1\/2 on the sides and fingers pressed on top with blending.  She tried to convince me her fingers were really small and I should get higher but I told her I wanted it short.  When she first told me she was finished, there were at least two finger lengths and it was uneven. Probably the worst I have seen.  I learned a long time ago to speak up or end up with unhappy cuts so I told her and she gave me a bit of resistance before trying to cut it shorter. I don't know if she didn't want to get close to her fingers or didn't care but she still didn't get it right.  Even through the massage and shampoo I got the feeling she had no interest in her job, client or anything but the final paycheck.  I still gave her my normal tip which is pretty generous and she didn't even say thank you or come back again.\n\nI give it two stars because I have had other stylists here who have been better and I do like the sports screens and the hot (and now cold) towel treatment.\n\nI wish I remembered her name, I remember only that I sat in the second seat from the rear on the left side of the store if you face the rear.\n\nOh, and if anyone cares, it has been almost a month and it grew in horribly uneven.
