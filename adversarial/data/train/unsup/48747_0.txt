Hands down my favorite caf√©. Wonderful atmosphere and warm service. I really love the piano instrumentals they play throughout the day. For a student like myself it's the perfect place to sit down, relax, and study. Usually I spend quite a few hours in their care and have never been asked to leave. There are more elderly patrons but I have noticed that most are well acquainted with the family running this restaurant. I have even seen an old man speak his thanks in Korean. This place soothes my soul and I definitely recommend bringing someone for some meaningful conversation.
