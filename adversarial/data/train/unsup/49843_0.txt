First time here with my lovely wife  for lunch. Was greeted by the staff with a smile and we both ordered the chopped brisket sandwiches with macaroni and cheese.  OMG the sandwiches were fantastic! Finished our meal and was asked by the owner how everything was. Super nice and found out he has a second location over on Shea and the 101 that I will visit as well. Thanks and definitely will come back!
