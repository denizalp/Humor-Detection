Pho Tai Bac is located at Yonge and Weldrick. I am going to have to say this Pho place is one of the best in Richmond Hill. This hidden gem on Yonge Street is not so visible, but if you find it you wont be disappointed. You can tell how good a place is based on how good their pho is, and as Tony the Tiger would say, \"It's GRRREAT!\" The pho portions are a decent size, and the broth is wonderful. The broth is full of flavour and not so fatty. So it is great to have when you have a cold or flu. Many pho places have a soup base that is really fatty and though it might be really tasty, when you finish eating it you feel like all the flem in the world is sitting in your throat. Lastly at the payment counter they have these soft chew candies that really hit the spot after a nice meal. This place is my go to spot in Richmond Hill. JimStar Out!!
