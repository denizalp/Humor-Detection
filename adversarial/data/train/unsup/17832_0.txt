I live extremely close by :)\n\nI only come here when I'm stuck and forgot to buy something as the prices are a bit higher, yet still reasonable. I would pay the premium for the convenience.\n\nIt is a unique grocery that is rarely seen in mtl, it has a very large selection of obscure and hard to find items. They do source from all around town and in the province... so instead of going all over town to find esoteric spices and ingredients come here. few examples they have spices from Jean-talon market, macarons from Point G, bread from the famous bakery in boucherville, the list goes on and on, lobster bisque in a can!!! yo hold up what?\n\nOne time, I was looking for gelatin sheets, which they did not sell, but the staff went into the pastry kitchen and took out a few to sell to me, now if that's not service I don't know what is. this place is just cool, it's not big but it has everything from fresh produce to butchery, pastry, cheese and deli counter. Organic, gluten free you name it they have it. Come here if you're looking for higher quality ingredients or stuff that's a bit more artisanal... you'll find it, if not they can always find you something in the kitchens hahaha\n\nit's a fine grocery store, for fussy items that you wouldn't find in a regular grocery, even the frozen food section is particular, they even have tourtiere du Lac St-Jean!!! try to find that at metro!!\n\nWhen I'm cooking for two and I want to impress I come here, there's always something that will make people talk... the meat is superb!! fresh thick bacon!!!\n\nthey even have these degustations\/classes (rsvp required) where you showcase something, my friend went to one and she liked it...\n\nAll in all, very high quality and the convenience of having stuff from all over the place gathered here for you to pick out, cool no? would be 5 stars but high prices loses them one star :) finally our own little dean and deluca just like they have in NYC, but with local flair I like it very much...
