3.5?\n\nI'm confused about this rating...I'm not a huge fan of the name of this place but was with friends and they really wanted to try it so I said why not. The store is clean with minimal seating. Went for a weekday lunch and got a spot with no problem. \n\nI wanted to get something light in calories...is that even possible for a burrito place? Looked at the quesadilla and it seemed to be a good option. You get to choose your toppings and type of quesadilla or burrito - so I like the customizability of the menu. \n\nOpted for a Veggie quesadilla...but they made me a burrito instead? I was too hungry and the line was too long then for me to go back and say my order was wrong. I also ended up paying more than the cost of a burrito but whatever. \n\nThe burrito was huuuuuge, and quite tasty - hence why I feel the rating is close to a 4. I really liked the flavours and it is quite filling. I've never had a burrito like this. In my opinion it's comparable to chipotle and possibly even better. \n\nI'll probably go back at some point. The taste and portion size was pretty good!
