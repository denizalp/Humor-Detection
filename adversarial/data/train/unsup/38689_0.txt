Awesome experience! From start to finish, the entire experience was perfect! Everyone that worked there was extremely polite and helpful, they explained everything in great detail, and they made sure we all had a great time. I recommend this to anyone looking for a thrill. I also recommend purchasing the high flight, I purchased purchased in other reviews and it was 100% worth it. We did not purchase any video or photo but I wish we had, you cannot take your phone in the jump area so be prepared and buy the video! I plan to bring many of my friends and family here!
