I have a fairly bad case of kyphosis, a scoliatic curve, and often debilitating back, neck, and arm pain from these conditions.  A wonderful chiropractor in Houston helped me until my husband and I moved to Phoenix in August 2010.   It took 19 long, painful months for me to find the right chiropractor after our move, but Dr. Aaron Kovac was worth the wait.  \n\nI saw six chiropractors around the Valley before meeting Dr. Kovac, and none of them had the skill and knowledge base that he possesses.   I was in such pain; my back hardened like a curved wall, my neck and arms burned, and my lower back spasmed every day.  I saw little improvement with these other chiropractors.  Most of them were very nice, but they treated their patients' bodies in much the same way, cracking and adjusting the usual spots after a cursory glance at x-rays and medical histories. Dr. Kovac, however, took the time to carefully assess my condition with scans, x-rays, an examination, and a thorough first appointment.  He is an expert in ART (active release technique), and I've seen amazing improvements from the combination of ART, adjustments, and the exercises he gave me to perform at the office and at home.  Dr. Kovac is a thorough, intelligent chiropractor with a warm personality and a passion for what he does.  He genuinely cares about each of his patients and wants to see them past pain management to lifelong health.  If you are suffering from pain or even just curious about what chiropractic care can do for you, don't hesitate to call Back in Line Family Chiropractic.  You will be amazed at what Dr. Kovac can do for you!
