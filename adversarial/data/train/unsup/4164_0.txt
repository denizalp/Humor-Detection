It's a pretty standard K-spa. Which is to say, you go in, you get naked, you splash around in the tubs and sweat in the steam and sauna and shower and repeat until you're super mellow and clean.\n\nThree stars because it's honestly not on par with the ones in LA and in SF. It's bigger but dirtier than the one in SD.\n\nIf you're in Vegas I'd recommend just doing the spa at the Luxor, it's the same type of deal but way more modern and cleaner. This is definitely a no-frills K-spa experience for a city all about hedonism and pampering.
