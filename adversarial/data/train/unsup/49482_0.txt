If I could give zero I would. My husbands white shirt has a rust looking mark on the back of the left sleeve, and has an overall dingy look to it. My graduation gown supposed to be steamed, but it is still wrinkled. They can charge low prices, because they only do half the work. I called them and they said to bring it back in, but I do not trust them. So, I will take them to another cleaner, and pay more money! Ugh!\n\nUpdate : I just left another cleaners and they inspected the shirt and found a small break in the material (as if it was scrubbed to hard), and two more rust marks!!! I am so upset  oh and they are going to stream my gown to get out the creases and wrinkles. The shirt upsets me because it is the Hawaiian shirt he wore at our wedding in Maui. He has only worn it once since then, so there is no reason it should have a stretching tear in it. Again zero stars if I could
