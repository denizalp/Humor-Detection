Great place to bring family on a Saturday or Sunday.  Lots of shade with picnic tables for you to enjoy the beautiful scenery while eating a good sandwich with organic ingredients.  At the end of the farm you will find the morning glory cafe that offers a great brunch.  Price is medium\/high for breakfast but it's worth it.  Once you are all set and done you will spend about $20 per person with tip.  Worth the trip.  People that work there are great too.  I almost forgot to tell you to bring your camera and you best smile as there is a lot of cool spots to take pictures.  If you have kids bring them over and let them run wild in the nice grassy areas and let them check out the chickens and ducks.
