This place absolutely lived up to the hype. The line was about 50 deep when I go there and it was worth every minute of the wait. Fortunately they still had one fatty brisket left when I finally got to the counter and not only did they hand out samples but the staff was friendly and engaging. I ordered the brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and a sausage. All were moist, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. The jalepeno grits and baked beans complimented thing well and I finished the meal off with one of those great little pecan pies. If you like smoked bbq, this has to be on your list of places to eat in Phoenix. Just make sure you get here early!
