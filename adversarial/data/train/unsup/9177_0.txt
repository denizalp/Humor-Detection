The best Thai I've ever had!  Everything was cooked perfectly and they were pretty big portions.  Prices were reasonable, although the seafood dishes were close to the $20 mark.  \n\nWe had:\nTom yum Goong and Tom Yum Kai soup\nFried dumplings\nBeef larb\nCombination fried rice (chicken, shrimp, pork)\nSea bass\nGarlic Prawns\n\nYou HAVE to try this place!!!!!!!
