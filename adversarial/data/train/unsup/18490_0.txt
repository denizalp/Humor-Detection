Two Words: Rosemary Mint. \n\nYes, please. I'll take the hand and body soap, as well as the lotion and shampoo! And while I'm at it, can you throw in some Sap Moss shampoo and voluminizer? Thanks. Oh, and don't forget the oils you have - ylang ylang, sandalwood, lavendar. I'm gonna need some of those, too. \n\nOh, you like my hair cut? Thanks. I just got it done upstairs - at Mood Swings. Oh, that reminds me. Add Pure Abundance Hair Potion to my cart. I love me 17% extra body. What? You have Voluminizing Tonic and Phomollient Styling Foam? Throw that in there, too. Love that stuff!\n\nOh, hell. Who am I kidding? I'll just give ya my Visa. \nDo I get a discount for maxing out my card here?
