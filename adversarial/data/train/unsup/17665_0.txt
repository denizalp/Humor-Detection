Brought my car here thinking I needed front brakes pads. Craig told me that my brakes were just fine with 80% pad life left. He could've easily sold me for a $240 brake job. Craig was very honest and a man of integrity. I gave him $20 for his trouble and told him I would be back when I needed a brake job. Highly recommend this brake shop for anyone that needs brakes done.
