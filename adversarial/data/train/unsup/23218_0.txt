Stopped and had the buffet for lunch today.  In all the years I have been going to Indian restaurants, I have only had one dish.  Chicken Tikka Masala.  I was going to get takeout but looked at the buffet, and there it was.  (choir of angels sing... \"ahhhhhh\")  \n\nWhaaaat?!  All I can eat chicken tikka masala AND garlic naan.  The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the chicken was juicy, the sauce was a little watery but had all the right flavors, and the naan was amazing!  It was so good, they should call this place Naan-dini.  It was soft and crispy, perfectly seasoned and cooked just right.  I wish it wasn't so good, because I ate 2 baskets of it and now I have to go back to work and try not to fall asleep at my desk.
