I enjoyed going to Tokyo, and was heartbroken when they closed in commercial center. Luckily they reopened downtown! The food is still as delicious as ever, I love the decor, and the vibe here. Definitely not disappointed with this place. Service was good, our server was very attentive and made great suggestions. \nSo glad that there's a great sushi spot downtown!
