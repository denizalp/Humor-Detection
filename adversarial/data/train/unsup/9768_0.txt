We are a foodie family, and we have a foodie dog (a Pom). We love D Liche (only acceptable cupcakes in the world by my standards), so does everybody i've ever met, no surprise there.   \n\nSo here's the thing, my fluffy Pom (who gets nothing but freshly prepared organic food- damned thing eats better than we do) gets a D Liche treat now and then - no store bought dog biscuits thank you, kraft? puh-lease, camembert only.   \n\nWe had some friends over one day, they knew i love cupcakes so they brought over a half dozen of the nearby competitors' cupcakes. I took a bite - gross, over-processed and way too sweet. Pom was at my feet begging thinking it was D liche, so i gave him some... he spat it out on my couch so fast, gave me the nastiest look ever.   \n\nNow i have a nice blue food colouring stain on my couch. Thanks D Liche, for spoiling my dog.
