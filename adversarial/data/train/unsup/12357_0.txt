Hey Southwest:\n\nIt's no surprise why people whisper behind your back, calling you \"SouthWORST.\" It's no surprise why, when asked, your unfortunate patrons say they feel miserable whenever they fly on your airline. It's true. You make people miserable - with your strange and stupid delays, your cattle-call boarding, your small seats with no leg room and your rude, obnoxious employees. \n\nTo your surprise, it does, indeed, sometimes rain in Phoenix (and even Las Vegas, for that matter). Sometimes with rain, comes fog and low visibility. I think you should have learned that in 3rd grade science. In any case, whenever it rains, you, SouthWORST, forget flying fundamentals - perhaps like an actor with stage fright - and simply refuse to perform. \n\nIt's true; you make people miserable. You make them wait in other cramped airports for four to six hours (maybe longer), just hoping to soon be boarding, just hoping there's not an excruciating wait on the tar mat or that their checked bag(s) won't end up in Bangladesh.\n\nThey say misery likes company. I believe you hate yourself, SouthWORST. I would, too, if I were you. So, in hating yourself, you hate others. You bully them, take their money, make them wait, cackle when you know they're hungry, tired and in need of some deodorant and a breath mint. You're miserable, SouthWORST, and you make me miserable, too. \n\nDisregards, \nAlicia
