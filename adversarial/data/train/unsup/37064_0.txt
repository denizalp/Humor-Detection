Never ever go here. I had two different tests done here. Paid the bill for the first one and was sent to collections because my payment wasn't filed properly. Just called them again to find out the status of my outstanding bill and was told that I've already been sent to collections again. This place is an absolute joke. There are many other places in town, go there. Wish I had read the other yelp reviews of people with similar experiences.
