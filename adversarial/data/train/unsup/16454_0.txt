Simple.Tasty.Fresh. This is how I would describe Harumi Sushi. It's hard for me to fall in love with sushi here in the middle of the desert; but I was pretty wow'd by Harumi Sushi when we were here the other night. My favorite was a H3 Roll, ( ABSOLUTE favorite!) ; Black rice in a roll!!! Yes please. The spicy tuna; The salmon; and the OMG! Which is in foil and flamed and lit up at table. We over ordered , as we usually do from not being able to decide or simply wanting to sample so many different things. The servings here at Harumi are generous. It's probably best to not be like us and order as you consume! Every roll was fresh and came out to us fast. The  wait staff wow'd us with great, friendly service and from the kitchen they even seem to have a fun environment too. It's nice to dine in a place like that! Love the location but parking here is kind of a bear at times and another 'con' is the bathroom is in a weird place. Let's be honest, sushi in the desert is always 'weird' to someone or maybe anyone who lived in the Californ-I-A but this is legit and I am a fan!
