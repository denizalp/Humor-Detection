I hate hate hate leaving bad reviews but this is nothing against the estheticians because they all have been great to me. This is for the girl who sits at the front. For twice now she accidentally overcharged my card. \n\nEach time was for an extra $20. She'll charge it and then say sorry for charging the wrong amount. I don't get it, either she doesn't know math or she needs to pay more attention. \n\nThe first time she said she couldn't credit me but would comp the next service. Of course the next time I came back, she completely forgot about it. The second time it took forever for the amount to credit my card. \n\nWhen I called and asked for the manager, she said she wasn't in but would tell her I called. I still haven't received a phone call and it's been a week and a half. So frustrating. I understand people make mistakes but it's a matter of owning it and making it right. Will be going to another location.
