My friend and I were walking around on a rainy Tuesday night looking for beers. We stumbled upon Hogtown and were not disappointed. $2.50 tacos (favourites being spicy octopus & pulled pork). The service was amazing. Christine, our server, was friendly and attentive! Beers were decently priced. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of one of their nightly specials!
