Ha! Reading all of these negative reviews from newbie record collectors makes me laugh. Go find yourself a more suitable hobby like video games. Rich is a record dealer. This was my first visit and I liked him and his spot. He deals in rare and valuable records. This isn't a dollar bin store, he's got rare records. And yes, you are going to pay market value.  When I walked in he pulled out some gems in the genres I was looking for that I had never even heard of before... And I've been collecting for 20+ years. I have about 20,000 records give (most likely) or take (not likely) a few. Guys like Rich bought heavy while the world forgot about records. Here is how it works: sometimes you get lucky and score cheap wax and sometimes you buy from dealers like Rich who have what you want (even if you don't know it exists before you walk past the puppy security door guard). Newbies like the whiners on this page are the ones who are driving up record prices anyway. So real collectors don't mind if you take to collecting stamps this month. It's the hot thing to do boys. \nI'll come visit this shop every time I am in Vegas. I look for rare records. TIP: The time to buy a record you want is when you see it; Even if you have to pay market value. So pony up or hit the thrift stores. I hear cabbage patch dolls are a pretty trendy investment this year. Hop that train. \nI'll be stopping back buy Wax Trax this weekend before I skip out of town. \nHappy hunting, digging or whining.
