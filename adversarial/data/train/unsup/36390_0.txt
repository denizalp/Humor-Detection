I love going to Chilis in NY but all the ones I have been to in AZ sucked until now.  Chilis in Mesa has redeemed themselves. \n\nI went for a friends birthday and I was surprised to see the place was spottless, the service was great and the food taste good. \n\nWe ordered Loaded Queso, cheese bites and a southern burger with grass fed beef.  Food came out on time and was delicous.  The only jiccup was my burger was gooded well done when I wanted it med rare.  Our server, brittany and the manager was very attentive.  They were quick to recook our food amd even offered us soup\/salad while we wait.  We are only human so it is never aboit the mistake, only how you redeem yourself after the mistake.
