I'm SO elated to have this delicious sandwich chain in Northwest Las Vegas. I've come to the realization that it is humanly impossible to order a bad sandwich here. \n\nMy personal favorite sandwich is their vegetarian sandwich which has alfalfa sprouts, avocado, cucumbers, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, cheese, bomb sauce and cream cheese on their signature Dutch Crunch bread. Their roast beef sandwich with cream cheese is delightful too, but I'm not sure if that is an actual sandwich on the menu. They will customize any sandwich on the menu to meet your specifications just because they care about the customer experience. At the Sandwich Spot, you can taste the love in each and every bite.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about The Sandwich Spot is the amount of time it takes to make a sandwich.  On my first visit, I was the only person there and it took nearly 20 minutes to make two sandwiches. I thought about hoping over the counter and giving them a hand, but they had it under control. This week, I came in during the lunchtime rush and it took more than 30 minutes before my two sandwiches were ready. \n\nHelpful hint: Call ahead and make it a meal with chips & a drink for a buck more.
