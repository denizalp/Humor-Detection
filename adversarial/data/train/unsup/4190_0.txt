Stop # 2 Rasher...... an sandwich shop just at corner of queen and carlaw just across from Leslieville pumps which was stop #3 , I would think because of that this place probably see less business but given I was at both today I would say Rasher was better of the two but never were a bad sandwich\n\nI had the hogtown sandwich, which was 3 piece of juicy peameal bacon with dijon mustard, there is an option to add cheese for a dollar which i did.between the peameal bacon and the cheese and mustard it was an unbelievable good sandwich.\n\nIts very small through, little to no seating
