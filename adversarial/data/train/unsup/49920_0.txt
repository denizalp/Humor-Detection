Our group of Three ladies and myself had a great lunch today at LOS DOS MOLINAS on south Central in Phoenix.\n  We started with their Kick A. Margaritas which it does not get better than this.  With our drinks we had lots of chips and super red and green chili sauce.\n  I had the Blue cornTamales with extra beans.  The ladies Dina and Karen had Talapia fish tacos.  One lady had Combo Talapia Fish Tacos , and a green corn tamales.  This was Carla who was our driver.  Her drink sadly was diet coke.\n  The food was well cooked, fresh and very, very good.  I can not wait to return as this is one of my top favorite restaurants in Phoenix Metro.\n  Manager Dominique and waiter Carlos do on o.utstand job in making everyone happy.\n  Try this restaurant.  You will not be disappointed.  It is Outstanding.  All my guests agreed.\n\nsincerely,\n\nEddie Altman  Jr.
