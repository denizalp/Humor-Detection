Awesome southern comfort food.  Had the deviled eggs, smoked salmon eggs on top, delicious.  Also had the Blue Plate Special (2 pieces of fried chicken, biscuit and watermelon) and it was fucking awesome.  Fried chicken was tender and moist and the biscuit was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  Great place if you like southern comfort food.
