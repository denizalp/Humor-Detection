I don't understand how so many people have had great experiences with the owner. He gets grumpy when we use a card instead of cash and it's not like we're placing a piddly order -- we're buying more than enough to justify it. I prefer to get the food to go (I love the tzatziki) but recently decided to eat in and realized I won't ever do that again. I had ordered Greek fries but received regular fries instead. When I mentioned this to the waitress, who was really nice, she told the owner who then complained about me in the nearby kitchen. I like to think that cashiers, waiters, and customer service people in general appreciate my patience and kindness but this guy makes me feel like it's such a hassle for him to even bother with me. I had another bad experience ordering lunch today and I'm done with this place...I just don't get it. :(
