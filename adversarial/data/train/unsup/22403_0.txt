Whenever I think of chain restaurant I think lack of quality. Of course that really depends on the type of food and type of restaurant really. I rarely ever go to kabuki and I think the last time was probably 2015. I think there wasn't really anything that kept me wanting to go back. The food was mediocre, and just whatever. I think a good side to this is that it's open fairly late to Arizona standards and the interior is nice. I will say that they have improved on the menu items and selection. The only thing I highly discourage of getting here is the ramen. It's not the best. The way to describe this appropriately is that is more for \"western palettes\" if you understand me youknowwhatimean. The sashimi is good here surprisingly. The salmon is good and also a few rolls like A vegas. They also serve it with freshly made wasabi. I believe I have a better reason now after coming back.
