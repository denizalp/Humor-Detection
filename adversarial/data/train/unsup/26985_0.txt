This is a Czech place and the food is staple Central-European.  The Vienese Schnitzel is humongous! You will have two meals there!  It also tastes quite good, though I was not over-excited about the roughly chopped cabbage on which it was served.. The chicken paprikash was also good, but I've had better.  Large portion again.  It might look pricey for an eastern-european eatery, but the portion sizes make up for that.  Service is friendly, in an eastern european manner.  Don't expect the server buzzing over you every 5 mins. The pints of Czechvar went very good with the food.
