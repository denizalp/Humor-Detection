On my most recent and likely last (for awhile) Vegas trip, my intentions were to eat at some top-notch restaurants...We stayed at the Palms on Thursday night and headed to N9NE...\n\nVery cool atmosphere, nice bar area...definitely good scene\n\nMy girlfriends and I elected to order apps for the meal rather than full dinners\n\nStarted with the tunta tartar...Perfect!...Fresh, delectable, just right\nThen on to Oysters on the half-shell....small (guess I need to be close to some body of water for normal size), these were ok....\n\nThe real winner was our third app, Risotto....WOW!, warm, heavenly and comforting...\n\nSauvignon Blanc by the glass was an excellent choice\n\nN9NE all in all was a nice experience
