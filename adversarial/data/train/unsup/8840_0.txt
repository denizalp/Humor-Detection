I would give 5 stars but the hipster staff looks exactly like the hipster guests and I can tell which hipster to ask for services from. I may be being harsh but I personally find it one star worth of annoying. They should at least have some sort of hipster dress code where all the hipsters look like working hipsters instead of guest hipsters. \nOther than the staff not having any resemblance of being employed there I think the place rocks. Good food but not cheap. The scenery makes up for the food prices. The games are fun but it's definitely missing a major bar game = billiards. \nDecor is awesome and so is the rest. Good times.
