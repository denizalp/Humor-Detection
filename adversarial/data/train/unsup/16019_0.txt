Apparently, when you play music and there is a microphone, I will sing anything! \n\nMan oh man, I had such a good time here after my strawberry, grape and lemon sojus down the street at Pojangmacha (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/pojangmacha-restaurant-north-york#hrid:MjbTu27lSzXOK0kfDSjzsw). \n\nYou can get drinks here (pop, water, very limited range of beer, coolers, unflavoured soju - bring your own kool aid mix) and some Korean chips and snacks. \n\nThis karaoke place is all about the private rooms. I must admit, I felt apprehensive paying to go into a room ($30 for an hour) with dim lighting and a big vinyl bench with 4 other people. If it wasn't for the karaoke, this place could have been a whore house.  But, once the tunes started playing and the tambourines (yes!!!!) came out, it was all about the music, bad singing on my part (awesome singing by Danielle P!!!) and fun!!! \n\nThe rotation was varied. We had some System of a Down, Brooks and Dunn, Blur, Keane, John Travolta & Olivia Newton John, Ricky Martin, Rick Astley, etc. \n\nWe laughed, we sang, we danced, all in all fabulous beyond fabulous!
