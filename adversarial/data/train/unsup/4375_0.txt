The only reason I've taken off a star is because the coke is $5. That is the biggest rip off of life (and the waiter agreed). This was also my first time so I can't discuss consistency. Otherwise, Ruby Watchco is A +++++. \n\nVIBE \nRuby (as I will be affectionately calling the restaurant throughout this review) is lovely in its simplicity.  From the cheerful but not saccharine reservations agent to the theatrical waitstaff, this place has got it going on in spades. Great for small groups of 4 but also for deuces too. The banquets are comfortable, the place is busy but you never feel rushed. It's a good Saturday night restaurant to be at. \n\nWE ATE\/DRANK\nThe menu changes nightly but it's all home cooking\/farm to table fare so you feel like you've gotten your five a day. The menu is hearty. I'm writing this three hours after my meal and I'm still full! You definitely get your money's worth here. \n\nFirst of all the biscuits here are to die for! All made in house with house made butter. If you like chives and buttermilk, you're in for a treat. \n\nWe started off with a big bowl of spicy pink shrimp salad, had Ruby's brick chicken with red onion marmalade, roasted sweet potato, butternut squash and gala apples, rosemary roasted fingerling potatoes, and charred romaine hearts with parmesean dressing. We were quite impressed at this point by the heartiness and vibe of the meal. I wasn't a fan of the charred romaine but everything else was fantastic. \n\nA note that on the menu, there are wine accompaniments with each course. We had the Verdichhio Podium 2009, Garofoli. It was not a cheap glass of wine at $15 but it was a big glass that was crispy yet dry and went very well with the meal. \n\nWe moved on to a robust Canadian artisinal cheese (one for each of us) with brandied date jam, honey and roasted pistachios. It was a nice segue into dessert and gave us enough time to digest our main meal. \n\nThe dessert was fantastic as well. Aptly titled \"Chocolate Deliciousness\" it hit all the right notes: brownie. Check. Milk chocolate mousse. Check. Chocolate meringue kisses. Check.  That said, dessert really did us in! But hey, it's winter. So why not?!\n\nEverything was spaced out well, all servers helped each other out and the food was fresh, bountiful and filling. Regardless of what the meal is next time, I will be back! \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nWatch out now: Ruby Watchco is one of Leslieville's best restaurants. A bit pricey. Hoping they'll mark down the coke price to $3 (even then it's a rip off but I'm willing to compromise). Regardless, all elements work to make a memorable dining experience!
