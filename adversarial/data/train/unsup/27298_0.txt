A huge variety of flowers and houseplants, all for a remarkable price. The owner was super sweet and willing to ask every question I had. Plus, the plants I got were all in great condition and obviously very well cared for. The orchids were especially beautiful, and some of the biggest I've ever seen.\n\nI'd suggest going with a clear idea of what you're there for or else you may get carried away like I did!
