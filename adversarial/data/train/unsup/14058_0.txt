Definitely a spot to go to at least once for the theme. It is hilarious, cool, and way fun. You are greeted by a host in a mini RV. Teehee! I am also happy to say the staff is reporting using all local talent on things that were built. Gotta love that. They have some cool benches and furniture in here. \n\nSo, by now you all know that the place has a camping, outdoors theme. The menu is very diverse, Alligator sausage, elk sauce, fish, pizza, outdoorsie, campfire types of things. The drinks are very good here according to my dining buddy. The Smores campfire drink was tasted. I can say really good. They light it on fire right at your table. That smell will trigger every childhood memory you have. Ha! I shudder to think of the calorie content on that one though. \n\nThe food was okay, not earth shattering but not bad either. I had the beet salad with whipped goat cheese. It was different. They use strands of greens so a little hard to eat but I liked it. I felt it could have used more beets though. My friend liked the brisket sandwich, again good but not outstanding. We also ordered the Brussle Sprouts which were not the best I have ever had, just okay. \n\nThey have a game room in the back which is an added plus. I want to come back here and swing on the tire bar seats. I think this place would be a really fun place to gather friends for  a birthday or happy hour. The drinks are a bit pricey though. \n\n4 stars theme\n3 stars food\n4 stars cocktails\n\nPS- our server was fantastic! Everyone here greeted and smiled when I came in contact with them, even the dishwasher who was out front for a few. The manager made two trips to our table to say hi. Impressed.
