I agree with Aaron B.  I did, in fact, take these reviews with a grain of salt when I decided to take Nabob in and after all is said and done, I'm glad that I did. \n\nIt's very easy to be upset when you're not in control, or you don't have answers. Unfortunately, animals can't  - and wont - point to their pain.    The doctors were very thorough in gathering his medical history - at times it was maddening (just fix him already!!!!) - there were questions that didn't seem the least bit relevant to his symptoms but that's the thing.  They were looking for the underlying condition - and for that they get four stars.  \n\nRather than write it off as a simple UTI and send me off with a 'script,  they were able to diagnose kidney disease.  Now I'm in a better position to give my guy many happy, healthy years and not a few sickly ones.   \n\nYes, it seemed to cost a lot of money but MY health care is free so what the heck do I know? \ndid they pressure me into spending it? not once. \n\nI would have liked them to be a bit more proactive when it came to giving me updates but once I relayed that to them, the entire team stepped up and gave me the comfort and answers that I needed. Even going so far as to follow up weeks afterwards.  \n\nDr. Mitelman is a bit of a character, but he is (and the rest of the team are) kind, caring and dedicated to healing your pet.  If you're not looking for those qualities in a vet I don't know what to tell you...
