Diamond nails is Fantastic!! They are friendly and offer a wonderful experience.   I have had several pedicures and manicures with them since 2012 and have never been disappointed.  Each staff member is very skilled.  I have never had a problem with consistency.  I would HIGHLY recommend them.  They take walk ins when they can.  Make an appointment if you need a specific time.  Being a family business, I'm always happy to pay them in cash to help avoid high credit card fees. However they happily take credit cards as well.  \n\nNewly remodeled with more stations....  Easy to schedule.  Prices are competitive.    Give them a try.  You won't be sorry.
