Run, don't walk, away from this agent.  As an out-of-state buyer, she misled us totally on our recent almost-purchase of a multi-unit apartment building in Phoenix.  She mis-represented the list price on the property -- quoting a non-negotiable price that was more than 30% ($200,000) over the listed asking price.  We trusted her and wrote a full price offer at this inflated fictitous price.  The offer was, of course, accepted.  She then went on to mention that someone in her office was a partial owner.  She failed to mention that the property was for sale for months at a much lower price and stated, instead, that it had just hit the market that day.  She also mis-represented the apartment vacancy rate -- stating that  50% of the 48 apartments, rather than the approximate 25% we saw upon inspection, were rented.  Fortunately, we uncovered many of the concealed facts during the diligence period, but not after investing thousands of dollars and 2 trips from CA to AZ.
