Encore Douche Club is more like it.  We didn't have to pay the 20$ cover, but unless you pay hundreds\/thousands of dollars for lounge chairs, there is no place to sit except for a few couches in the back bar area.  The good reviews must have been written by one of the many douchebag guys who were ogling the \"hot\" girls all wearing too-small forever 21 swimsuits.  Come here if you want to party with some foul guys and get crabs.
