Want a great breakfast? Check out this cute little place. First time there, I had the Eggs in a Nest. Two thick slices of cheesy bread with an egg cooked into the middle with a side of home potatoes and fruit. Really hits the spot on a cold fall morning. \n\nOK, so the service is a little slow but it's bearable. At least you're not waiting in line like those fools going to Beauty's. :)\n\nWhen you're done, get yourself across the street for some authentic Montreal bagels!
