I called in the afternoon because my house wasn't cooling down past 85 degrees on the hottest day of the year, and they sent someone out that evening. The repair man, Serge, was very professional and fixed the problem promptly and at a fair price. He even called later that evening to make sure that the house was cooling off. I appreciated his honesty about the condition of my unit and his not pushing a new unit replacement when I told him that we were on a tight budget. The house is still nice and cool today. I highly recommend this company for your heating and cooling needs.
