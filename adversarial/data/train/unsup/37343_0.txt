The food & dim sum was just ok, nothing special sigh. Got there around 2pm so most the dessert stuff was all gone. So if your a dessert person go early. Was waiting for the tea person and they came towards almost the end of our meal. I was a bit upset about that. We didn't even get any water or anything.\n\nAlso I love rice noodle shrimp but their rice noodle skin is thick which I don't like and they don't have the sweet soy sauce sauce its a sesame oil with sugar water. Doesn't taste good but the shrimps are big and de-veined so that's good somewhat hehee. Some dim sum things they changed to make a little twist or something but I think I'm kind of old fashion when it comes to Dim Sum unless it's new desserts hehee. \n\nOrder a lot of dim sum stuff and nothing was like wow.\nOrder some fried rice and it was so oily and almost no favor =T \nI wouldn't go back to eat unless it was comp.
