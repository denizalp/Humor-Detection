I'm a huge fan... \n\nBeer, haircut and a relaxing place to spend 30-45 minutes after a tough day... all at the cost of a normal hair cut with no beer and grumpy people at other places. \n\nAfter going here I have actually called friends from out of town to let the know what they are missing out on.
