My daughter and I headed here for a sushi lunch on a Friday afternoon and had a lovely time. She's doing a \"keto\" diet and so this is precisely the sort of food that she needs to stay on program. The restaurant is definitely fancy and being upstairs can certainly make it perfect for a successful date night if that's what you are looking for.\n\nTheir sashimi platter is a nicely presented platter with a selection of the usual core fishes including salmon and tuna and squid. Big pieces, thick slices, I'm told they tasted very fresh.\n\nI stuck with traditional maki rolls and they do a good job on presentation and assembly here. Tasty and good looking, it is the usual \"edible art\" that I have come to expect from better sushi restaurants.\n\nDefinitely worth it at Jade Asian Fusion!
