Love WorldMark!\n\nI usually love our stay here at WorldMark on S Las Vegas Blvd and often stay at this location when in town but the studio we were assigned to was not completely prepared.  Although the place was clean it was missing the usual 'welcome' setting I was used to.  On the dining table for two it was missing the placemats and centerpiece.  Later on in the day we found the placemats on top of the fridge.  Also, there was no centerpiece on the living room table as well where they usually have the little WorldMark 'welcome' sign... other than those things the place was well equipped.  I still give it high marks because this was just an isolated incident. Sorry, as a WorldMark owner these are just little things but when you're used to some things WorldMark provides you expect it each time you stay in one of their resorts. Love the security WorldMark provides especially coming in the resort. The pool and Lazy River is wonderful too!\n\nReview #0146
