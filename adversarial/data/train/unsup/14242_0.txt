Tearless Brazilian? Yes! \n\nI'm giving them 5 stars for the quality of the wax (OMG! I could never go back to soft wax!), good\/prompt service & clean facility. \n\nHeads up regarding 3 little issues: \n\n1. The illusion of privacy is non existent, lol. In most places that I have been to they will leave the room to have you undress & give you a napkin to use as a blanket. No such thing here. They will prep the wax while you shake & shimmy out of your clothes. You are getting a Brazilian wax though,so really, what aren't they going to see anyway? \n\n2. They might hand you to a total stranger,,, & by that I mean an esthetician, so don't get all excited! I wanted to have a good experience so I researched who had been named in the reviews. I got an appt with Rachel C. When I arrived I said I have an appt with Rachel C. She said \"of course! Please take a seat\". Someone came out & called my name. I thought she was Rachel C, but it sure wasn't. I was doing this thing no matter what, so I wasn't turning back over the ol' sitch-a-roo! All went fabulously anyway, but now I'm not relying on names. \n\n3. Flexibility. Each appt is set for a specific block of time, but even if they have time left over you can't sneak any other services in. No biggie, just make sure you plan ahead.
