A lot of stores like this can be a real nightmare to navigate, but not this one! \n\nStumbled upon this gem for the first time this past weekend, and I'm sure glad I did. The store is very clean, very well organized and the friendly staff is the cherry on top. There are lots of different styles to choose from across several decades, and the prices on everything are reasonable.\n\nIf you like vintage fashion, you have got to check this place out!
