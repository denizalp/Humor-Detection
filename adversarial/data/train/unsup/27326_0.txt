Had a coupon so I decided to try this place. I had 2 suits dry cleaned and one was ruined. There are now several indents that I cannot smooth out. Save your money and go somewhere else. I've used Pine Cleaners, which is across the street, and had a pretty good experience. Stay away from this place unless you want your clothes to get ruined.
