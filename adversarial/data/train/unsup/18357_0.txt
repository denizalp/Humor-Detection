I've never stayed at the Palace Station before--honestly, why would you unless you're broke\/trying to realllllly save every bit of money & for some reason, want to hang out in Vegas....where being broke will get you nowhere--but I'm going to rate it for their amenities. I did read a recent review that they've updated their rooms though, so you go, Glen Coco!\n\nInterior:\nIt's kind of what you'd imagine a casino that no one really cares about would look like: tacky carpeted floor, smoke filled atmosphere, lots of loud slot machine noises, & not nearly as beautiful as the newer hotels. Can't say I've been in the hotel rooms, so this review is useless for that. It's a bit of an eyesore, but I don't come here for the interior design. I come here for the....\n\nFood:\nOYSTER BAR!!!!!!!!! I'm eating my leftovers right now as I daydream about my dinner from there last night. -1 star because they need to expand this bar. Just...figure it out. Take out some restaurant & just make the whole thing a huge steam kettle cooking establishment. I sound ridiculous, but it needs to happen. Just imagine how many more people they could accommodate & the profit they'd make! Heck, they'd even make more jobs doing this. Waiting 2 hours for this food is ridiculous, but pretty much worth the wait. I have one piece of advice for you when you've got a party of more than just your lonesome self: take turns standing in line, go to the bar, &\/or play the slots.\n\nBar:\n5 STARS FOR YOU RANDOM BAR CLOSE TO THE OYSTER BAR! 99 cent frozen margaritas?!?! Josh G. said he would start measuring all monetary items in the wonderful new denomination of 99 cent frozen margaritas. Here's an example for you: he could've had 107 frozen margaritas yesterday at Palace Station at 1 PM, but instead, he got 1 pitcher of Rum Runner from Encore Beach Club. Still not clear enough for you? I could've had 15 frozen margaritas yesterday at 11:20 AM, but instead, I decided to get an 8-piece \"real crab\" California Roll from EBC. (To all of those people that hate on others that take photos of their food, THIS IS WHY FOOD PICTURES ARE RELEVANT: SO WE CAN SEE WTF WE'RE GETTING. CAPS LOCK TO GET POINT ACROSS.) What have we learned today? Everything at the newer hotels on the strip, in a club, are worth a lot of frozen margaritas.\n\nNot a fan of tequila? Pft, that's okay because it makes me wish I made better decisions too. $4 Bloody Mary's, baby!! I love Bloody Mary's & I've paid anywhere from 10-13 frozen margaritas for them, but here at Palace Station, it's 4 frozen margaritas. $4 & ACTUALLY DELICIOUS. I drank two within 20 minutes waiting in line for the Oyster Bar....so great. I asked for extra olives & the nice bartender gave me 8 olives. Best deal all weekend in Vegas. \n\nGambling:\nI don't gamble, but there are lots of slot machines & even a tournament of sorts. Some of the machines aren't as sparkly or \"modern\" compared to the ones at the Wynn\/Encore\/newer casino. I saw a Plants vs. Zombies slot machine at one of those hotels while PS has some strange Dragon's Law slot from Konami. Bets are really low though so that's pretty awesome. It's like being at a Dave & Buster's except you might win 10 cents. Patrons are a bit older. The youngest people you'll see are standing in line at the Oyster Bar or are kids running around in the buffet. \n\nAll in all, I am a fan of their bars & the Oyster Bar, so I'd make a special trip out here to have a more laid back dinner experience.
