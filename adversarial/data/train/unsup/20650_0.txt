What an awesome experience!  My friend suggested we do a double date and booked a cooking class.  On Fridays the cooking class offers beer and wine, bonus! The chef Joe Cambria was very knowledgeable and patient.  He explained each course we were preparing as a team.  There were about 14 couples.  We had to prepare an appetizer, a salad, an entree and a dessert.  For the appetizer we made  phyllo dough brie and pear beggars purse,  I decided this is the station I felt I could shine and I also took a couple of bites of the extra pieces of brie cheese available.  Our salad was a ceasar's salad and the main dish was flank steak which was delicious.  I couldn't believe that we would be able to put this together so fast.  The session started at 6:30p.m. and the chef was explaining each station and the process before we were divided into teams.  By the time he was done with the lessons it was well after 7:30p.m.  I was being a doubting Thomas and was not sure we would be eating before 9. Well, once the teams are divided, everyone goes to work on their area.  The meal came together pretty fast and delicious, I was impressed. Our dessert was creme brûlée, which is one of my favorite desserts.  I could have had three of those. By the way, they do provide an apron for everyone as well as the recipes of the dishes prepared.  I think this should be a regular rotation for date night.
