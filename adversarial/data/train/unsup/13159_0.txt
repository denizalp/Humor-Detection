First room: carpet is stained, meh not that big of a deal. The crowning of the roof looks awful (needs repairs, ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ eh it's just decor)....then I noticed a light was out. Okay it's one light, it's not that big of a deal. Go into the bathroom, okay the towel rack is coming out from the wall and looks like it will be ripped from the wall at any moment.... (-2star for these things).\n\nI go to put my stuff in the safe...\"Lo-bat\" appears. Okay really, that's a BIG deal for me -1star \n\nCall front desk, friendly assoc. asked to be relocated. They did so in a timely manner. (And also bumped us up the next level room) which btw the same light is out in the new room.\n\n1-star friendly assoc\n1-star attempt to fix previous problems\n\nEdit: see photo added. New room has a huge-ass line on the tv screen\nAlso the AC doesn't work -1star\n\nWow to the damage found in the bathroom see pic!
