Ahh, my local hospital. The only reason I go here is because it's nearby. The quality of care is nothing to complain about and the nurses are nice, but the emergency ward is completely abused and you'll end up waiting at least 3 hours, even on an off-night, to get care. I hear they're modernizing it though, so it'll likely up its service as well.
