Doc was caring and actually concerned, took the time to discuss my medical history. The office was clean, quiet, and effecient. I was in and out for my annual physical in less than 30 minutes.\n\nNote: give yourself an extra few minutes before your appointment to locate the office within the building, it is kind of a maze.
