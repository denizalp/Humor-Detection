An Akron classic. From here or not, you will most likely love it! You can never go wrong with their award-winning Galley Boy- I'm usually picky when it comes to burgers but I love this burger! They have an array of different milkshake flavors- all of which are superb as well. Overall, if you're looking for a classic burger and milkshake meal, I recommend Swenson's!
