I arrived and departed through Virgin America, so my terminal was right where the entrance\/exit was. Super convenient. \n\nWhat I did appreciate: The Coffee Bean next to my gate (yum!); not having to remove my laptop, belt or shoes to get through security. \n\nWhat I did NOT appreciate: the snatching of my Vaseline Cocoa Butter and hair cream out of my carry on just because the bottles were just a tad over the size limit. So irritated-- eff you, Bin Laden.
