poor service! rude disrespectful staff! from personal experience they will not inform you if and when your child gets hurt!!!! so they get a big fat zero (0) stars from me!! but i had to give one star or i could not post im just saying..oh and the old black lady that works here acts like she just hit a pipe!!! and does not remember the kids she is watching names..if your looking for quality child care with no worries this is not it! not all the staff is bad but my gawd..one bad apple spoils the bunch for me!! when it comes to my children who i love! that's my opinion and maybe other have experienced better service...but my first few days was a hott ass mess!! and i quickly removed my child!
