my friend ordered Bella's lechon for his daughter's bday. it was a big disappointment, hit and miss kind of thing. i wasnt around the time my friend ordered one so i havent mention him about my(-) experience with Bella's lechon. i could have sent him to one of the chinese bbq specialty restaurant. they ordered it and have it cut with extra charge....its better to order the whole lechon and not have it cut bec. you can see by the looks of the lechon if it is cook or not. the taste of the lechon is so \"piggy\"(me amoy)....in short, not recommended.
