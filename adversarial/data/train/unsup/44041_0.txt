Susan is amazing! She really knows how to transform your brows. When I first saw her, it had been well over a year since I've had a professional wax\/threading. She really knew how to boost my self love! I was never a huge fan of threading, but she's extremely affordable and makes the experience enjoyable, with amazing results to boot! She's quick and personable! She blows me away with the things she remembers when I only see her once a month. I always look forward to seeing her.
