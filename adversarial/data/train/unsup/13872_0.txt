Just saw the opening of Pin Up at Stratosphere and it was rough around the edges, but the top level talent of the dancers, producers and the band held it up. Although, the lead singer and headliner were a miss. The singer appeared to be singing above her ability and Clair was just completely out of her element. Not only was Claire out of her element, but she detracted from the whole show. \n\nIf you think Holly Madison was okay in Peepshow then Claire  Sinclair was terrible in Pin Up. In Vegas, where actors, performers, musicians and directors work years to get to the Vegas stage Claire managed to do it with no discernible skills except the need to always \"wanting to be a Pin Up girl\". I could really tell when she spoke that she had nothing else to offer the show except for her face. Sorry Claire, this isn't Playboy. \n\nSomeone PLEASE give her some acting and singing lessons!
