We have had take out from here 3 or 4 times and it is good and they do not skimp on meat or quality, but occasionally it has been a bit cold, which seems odd since I am sitting there waiting to take it home.\n\nIt is currently rated the number one restaurant in Whitby on Restaurantica which shows me more people need to do reviews in Whitby..LOL
