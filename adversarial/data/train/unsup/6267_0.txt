5 stars for the products. Great cappuccino, very nice cannoli. Bought an olive smaller bread (bun), we just finished it and we feel like going back getting another one. The service is excellent. My only complaint is that the place is a bit tiny but who cares... The food is great. \nI must mention customer service. It's excellent. Everyone is paying attention to your needs, asks if you are being helped and all this with a genuine smile on their faces. Whoever manages this place deserves 5 stars. Thank you for existing in my neighborhood.
