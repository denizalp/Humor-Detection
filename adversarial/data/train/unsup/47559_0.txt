Stinks that it's on the South Side, but La Palapa is one of the best Mexican joints in the 'Burgh.  They told us they were inspired by Mexico City & it's nice to see something other than the typical Americanized Mexican in a restaurant.  The platters are a really good deal.  I highly recommend them- they can easily feed three or even four people.
