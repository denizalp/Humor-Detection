I booked with them and received a good to go email, called off work, and they sent me an email 2 hours later saying the airline did not honor the booking but to call them to get a new price. They also have spammed me 7 times since I signed up 2 hours ago.... I feel really great about this unsecured site having my travel information and am shocked fly.com is allowing them to operate on their page.
