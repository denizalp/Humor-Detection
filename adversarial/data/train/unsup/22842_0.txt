Stayed here for almost three months for business, so a review is definitely needed.\n\nI loved staying here! I was originally slated to stay in a different place on the other side of town, but paying about $120 & basically living in a cardboard box was not my cup of tea, so my coworker suggested the Residence Inn, where he stayed last year & was currently staying.\n\nCheck in was seamless and the lobby was beautifully decorated, my bags were taken to my room, I was given a brief tour where I was shown the business center, gym, pool, breakfast area, and basketball\/tennis courts.\n\nMy room was on the 8th floor, and upon entering I was pleasantly surprised, a full kitchen greeted me to the right, including a table for two, a complete living room and office area greeted me to the left (the couch even had a pull out bed), and the bedroom\/bathroom\/closet was just around the corner.\n\nWith sweeping views of the strip, Las Vegas Eye, and the mountains, I was very pleased.\n\nThere was a complimentary breakfast each day from 6am-930am (I was only able to partake a couple of weekends due to my work schedule), and every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday the hotel had mixers where they would play music, serve delicious food (taco night was amazing), and unlimited drinks. You got to meet other folks who lived in the hotel and it was super fun!\n\nMy one complaint was the washing machines. They had a weird smell and I found myself washing my clothes at least twice to insure they were really clean. Also, a hotel with 11 floors and probably 20 rooms on each floor should have more than six washers\/dryers. I was sometimes doing laundry until 2-3am because of how busy it was.\n\nOther than that. I will now only stay at Residence Inns!
