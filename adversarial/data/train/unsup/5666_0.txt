Omg, the Yelpies was such a fun event! I'm so excited that I was lucky enough to get in. :) \n\nI've never been to High Street before, but after this event I can't wait to go back! All of the restaurants and bars are awesome, and we got to try so many. Everyone was so generous, too, with their samples and offerings! We had so much fun trying a little bit of everything. \n\nA bunch of Yelpers have already posted such great reviews of this event, so I'll keep mine short! Every place we stopped in was amazing, and I didn't even have time to get photos because we were just taking it all in ;) \n\nThanks to Hailey P. and Yelp for putting this together!!
