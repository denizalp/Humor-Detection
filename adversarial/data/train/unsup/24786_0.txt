HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! Don't go here. Went with my girlfriend to grab some dinner the other night. When we arrived they only had patio seating available, it was chilly so we turned it down and decided to wait til something opened up inside. Bought 2 outrageously overpriced beers for $17 and waited about 20 minutes til we were seated at the smallest circular table in the restaurant, tucked away between the patio door and the wall. 15 minutes after being seated our waiter came over and FINALLY gave us menus; we sat for 15 minutes nursing our beers before being able to even glimpse at the menu. I had looked at the menu online before going and it was fairly extensive, the menu we received upon sitting gave a selection of only 7 cheese plates and 7 sandwiches, all $15 or more (and they were out of bison). 15 DOLLARS FOR A SANDWICH!!!! We placed our order, deciding to split a board and order a couple sandwiches. We sat and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. A HALF HOUR LATER, THE SERVER CAME OVER AND SAID \"WE SCREWED UP AND NEVER PUT YOUR ORDER IN, IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU?\" I glared at him and said \"Well we've been here starving for over an hour now, what can you do for us?\" THE WAITER SAID \"WELL THERE'S NOTHING I CAN REALLY DO FOR YOU ACTUALLY.\" COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!! AND NO ATTEMPT TO EVEN RELIEVE THE SITUATION!!!! We left in a rage and went to the W Burger Bar right down the street on College and had an extremely delicious and prompt meal (our appetizer came out minutes after placing our order).\n\nLONG STORY SHORT: HORRIBLE, UNFRIENDLY STAFF, OVERPRICED FOOD, NOT NEARLY ENOUGH BAR OR SEATING SPACE. DON'T EAT HERE!!!!!!!!
