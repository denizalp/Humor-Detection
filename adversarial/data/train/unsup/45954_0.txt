Best customer service I've ever gotten at a nail salon. The workers were very friendly when I walked in. They took such great care of me and didn't make me feel rushed at all if someone was waiting. Best pedicure I have ever had! My mouth watered during the entire pedicure. I also had reflexology done. Drinks and snacks on the house too. This place is definitely worth a shot. I live in scottsdale and make the drive every time. Quality service, my gel never chips and shaped perfectly. I was also given my own personal nail file, and two buffers to ensure safety and sanitation. This place is the best. I will never go anywhere else.
