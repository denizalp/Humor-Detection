A surpringly good steak.   Overdone?  Well yes, but such is life outside of Captial Grille.  IT was still delish, not overly salty, and tasted like BEEF.\n\nThe asparagus was decent, the rolls were tasty, and the drinks were fun.\n\nI guess the best description is a better version of Applebees or fridays.  A cut above, if only slight.  It still has that mass-produced feel, but hey. \n\nSo not really a place *I'd* take a date, but if you're reading this while wearing a jersey, your date will probably be impressed that you stepped up your game a bit (but only a little bit. . but then again she's happy when you shave and\/or put down the xbox controller to ask her if she wants pizza so expectations are low. . .  very low.)\n\nYes,  I am making fun of you.\n\nPutz
