Quite possibly my favorite dentist's office I've been to. The staff was SO nice and welcoming, they give you a tour of the office and even a welcome goodie bag (which has cookies in it.. At the dentist!) I purchased the groupon for a cleaning cause I hadn't been to a dentist in a while and I definitely chose the right one. Also they have great pricing and payment plans for teeth straightening, etc. I will be a returning patient.
