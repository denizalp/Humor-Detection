This is the perfect buffet for when you want to feel like you're at Disneyland but in France but in Vegas and ready to consume six plates of food.\n\nIf you've been to Disneyland, I'd compare this atmosphere to the Blue Bayou. It's trying to bring the outdoors in, but you feel kind of strange about it but you're glad they tried. The ceiling is painted like a blue sky and that's really the main factor that brought my sister and I here on a Monday night. This was our only buffet of our trip, and we looked at a bunch before deciding. I'm really glad we picked this one - the Bellagio was so ugly inside, and even though it has rave reviews, who wants to be in a dim, themeless, windowless room that you paid $40 to be in? Not us. We'll take a cute little village atmosphere, please and thank you. \n\nHighlights of our food: the mashed potatoes, the truffle pasta, the prime rib, the sushi (don't be scared), the creme brûlée, and the crepe station. \n\nBummer items: carrots (not done enough), sweet potatoes (also not done), beet salad (lukewarm), duck (too tough).\n\nBeing that this was my one and only Vegas buffet and we kind of fasted all day for this, I took about six trips back. They cleared our plates real quick and were good about refills. Between the two of us, we had five plates of dessert. FIVE. Get the strawberry crepe, not the apple one. I tried both for you. Get two creme brûlées so you don't have to go back when you eat your first one in five seconds flat. Get all the desserts and have one bite of each, you're in Vegas, don't feel guilty, don't be modest. They live for your food waste.\n\nAnd for goodness sake, ask to sit under the painted blue sky. Don't be stuck in a little room when there are classy fake trees and storefronts awaiting you.
