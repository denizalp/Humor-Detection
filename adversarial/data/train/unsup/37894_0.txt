Relax , you are in good hands with Raul. If you want to be the cutest \"Blondie\" at your office then don't trust your hair to anyone else. Vegas is notorious for poor quality , I guess they fugue we are all tourist so they won't get the repeat business . Well not so with Raul , he looks to the long term with both your hair and his customer base . \nHe is very respectful , as I hate it when the stylist talk on their phone as they do your hair or joke and cackle loudly with coworkers. Raul does none of that and he listens to your needs. Keep up the goog work , thanks B
