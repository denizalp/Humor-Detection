I knew California Pizza Kitchen served tasty pies, but you can never be sure that all locations have the same goodness. So when I took a chance on paying a third party crew a sawbuck to deliver a veggie pizza pie ($13.99), I wasn't sure what I would get. \n\nBut I was not disappointed. The pie with traditional crust was delicious and ample with toppings: broccoli, eggplant, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted corn, red onions. Unfortunately, it was a small pie but delicious indeed and I nearly ate it all in one sitting. \n\nI also requested the $7.49 butter cake, (fat kids love cake) but I was sorry I did. Not worth the price. the bottom of the cake was crunchy with sugar granules and the top center had some kind of frosting which tried to pass itself off as cream cheese, I guess. I'm not sure. I cut both the top and bottom off and was left with just a center layer of something that used to look like a cake but I didn't even finish that.\n\nLesson learned - sometimes you can't have your cake and eat it too because it just isn't fricken edible.
