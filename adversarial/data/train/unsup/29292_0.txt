Great place for Torah Observant folks to get clean meat, etc.  Good place to have lunch - I just wish that I did not live so far east otherwise, I would be a regular!  Oh - almost forgot!  The reason I give them four stars instead of five is because they over-price their products. Be prepared to shell out the dough for a little... but at least its kosher.  If there was real kosher competition in this valley they would not survive with exorbitant prices.  Nevertheless, the folks at this deli are really nice people and helpful.  I highly recommend this shop.
