Beware the sign that posts the gas prices.  This is one of the places that you have to read the small print.  There is another smaller sign that says you pay more if you use a credit card.  No big deal? I say that it all adds up.\n\nThis is also one of those places that seems to tack on a few cents here and there when it comes to the specials on water, Rockstars or other things for that matter. \n\nBeware the car wash. You would do better to just use the squeegee and clean your car at the pumps.\n\nLaziness has brought me here many times.  Now that I have said my piece, I shall make peace (with myself) and just head down the road a little further.
