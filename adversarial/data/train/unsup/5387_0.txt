I think your experience at pastries and chaat will be very different depending on what you order. I went with a few friends and we tried 3 different cakes. We had one that was a light honey and nut kind of cake...this thing was so delicious! Light, airy, flavorful in a nuanced way...just great. The other two flavors I tried were not so good. Those were the chocolate cake and the red velvet cake.... This may have been our faults for ordering those kinds of desserts from this kind of bakery, but they offer them so we figured why not. Both of these cakes were dense and heavy. They lacked chocolatey richness and instead were somewhat bland. If you hit this place up, be careful what you order, but I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.
