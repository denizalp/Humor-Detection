The people were very nice (both the server and the owner), the food was mostly average, and the wait time was extremely long even though we were pretty much the only people there.\n\nThe veggie omelet was very uninspired - a few pieces of red and green pepper.  The pork chop was fine and the corn beef for the corn beef hash seemed like it came from a can.  My toast had two big, soggy, lukewarm butter spots right in the center.\n\nHowever, the topper was ice.  It's a warm day.  I order a soda.  It comes in a can and alongside it is a glass and two small chunks of ice.\n\n\"Can I have some more ice?\"\nDays pass.\n\"Excuse me, can I have some ice?\"  Then my dining companion says, \"You know, that looks good.  Can I have a soda as well?\"\nDays pass.\nHe emerges with another soda, and a glass with two pieces of ice in it.\n\"Can I have some more ice?\"\nDays pass.\nHe emerges with a glass with 4 or 5 chunks of ice in it.  \"We're actually out of ice.\"\nWe hear them sending someone to go buy a bag of ice.\nMan enters with bag of ice.\nDays pass.\n\"Excuse me, can we have some ice?\"
