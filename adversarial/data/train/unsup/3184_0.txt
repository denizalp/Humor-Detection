Wow... I just had a horrible experience at One Coffee Co. \n\nYesterday, I asked a friend who works downtown if she had ever tried One Coffee Co and she said she hadn't. So l, I figured I would give it a try. What a mistake. I walked in and was looking at the menu. The young lady at the register with the black hair and glasses asked if I was ready so I walked up to the register and ordered a breakfast burrito with sausage. She pointed to a post it note that said \"no burritos\" and said \"We don't have any burritos.\" Dripping with a negative attitude. So I ordered avocado toast. \"We don't have that either. We don't have food. All we have are the muffins in the case.\" So I ordered an apple cinnamon muffin. I then went to order a mocha and I thought she asked if I wanted it extra hot so I said \"no, thank you.\"  Then with, sass, she said \"hot or iced.\" At that point I decided to say no thank you, and went down the street to Cartel for a much better experience. This girl's horrible attitude made the decision for me to never return to One Coffee Co, whether I am here for business or pleasure and to tell all my Phoenix local friends to stay away as well.
