Took my SUV here for body work after having been in a rear end accident. Best customer service ever. Even though it was only the rear end that needed work, they inspected the entire car and found a couple of other serious issues on the front end that needed to be addressed. They were super nice from beginning to end, kept me updated throughout the process. Even though there was some miscommunication between the insurance agency, myself and Classic Gold, they made everything super smooth. Car was returned super clean. Will definitely be coming back for any mechanical work as well as general maintence and up keep! Thank you!!
