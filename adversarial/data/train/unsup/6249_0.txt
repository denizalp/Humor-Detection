If you are a tea lover, I cannot stress enough... Take the tea class!!! It was so informative and interesting. The owners are adorable and really knowledgable about their teas. I'm such a nerd about tea, I really learned a lot about the right ways to store tea, the origins of certain varieties of tea and correct ways to even drink the different types of teas. Plus, It wasn't just them talking to you, we also got to ask questions and sample a variety of teas and snacks. \n\nThe class is $25 and they offer a Level 1 and Level 2 class. I can't wait to go back and take the level 2 class. They even give you a gift bag of tea on your way out! \n\nAside from this, still a stellar store to buy loose leaf, international tea and snacks and even coffee. A MUST for any tea lover!
