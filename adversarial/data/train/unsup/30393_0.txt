Decided to check out their Sunday Happy Hour a few weeks ago.  Came in around 4pm and the place was about 20% full.  On Sundays their Happy Hour Drink prices run starting before noon so it wasn't surprising to see a couple of people on their way to hammered.  We ordered almost every app on the HH Menu and none disappointed.  For a total bill of under $70 we ate and drank like Kings.  We'll be back for sure.
