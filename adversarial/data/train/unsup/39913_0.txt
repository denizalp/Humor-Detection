Choolaah is a fantastic, great fast food Indian restaurant.  The lamb meatball sandwich with a side of tikka masala sauce and wheat naan area divine!  I highly recommend this place.  I usually eat here 3-4 times a week to quench my Indian food cravings.  You can taste the fresh, quality ingredients and the food is delivered\/ready to go in minutes.  Love it!
