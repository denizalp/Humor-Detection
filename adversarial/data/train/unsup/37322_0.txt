Probably the worst run business I have ever run across.   It was evident from the start that the sales person, John Arendt, was not a \"people person\".    My wife who met with John thought he was rude and arrogant. After he left, it took me multiple calls, in a two week period, to get him to send me a quote.    After I received the quote via email.   I called and asked what I had to do next to move the project along.   There was virtually no communication from John, or anyone else from West Coast.   I was told to come to the business and pick out the cabinets and counter tops.   We drove to the business and was told that John was the only person holding the quote and no one at the business knew nothing about our project or quote.    Long story short, again after having to call for more information, we received a different quote with all new prices.   The new quote was over $2000.00 more than the original.     In the quote, they were even charging us $150.00 to pick up trash that they would leave after the installation.   Truly run from this disaster of a business.  They just always seemed like they could care less about us or our business.
