Sometimes policies are great--like \"all employees must wash their hands before leaving the restroom.\" Other times, policies are ridiculous. Today, at White Chocolate Grille, I experienced the latter, which is a shame because I usually experience fantastic customer service there. \n\nThe prior two days, I suffered a spat of food poisoning from another restaurant that will not be mentioned, so I've been in recovery mode pretty much eating bread, cheese, rice and potatoes to gently rebuild my appetite. So when I learned that we were going to WCG for my coworkers' going away party I figured I could still partake in the farewell by having a grilled cheese sandwich--an item that's not on the menu, but seriously, what place can't make a grilled cheese sandwich that has other sandwiches on the menu that contain bread and cheese? \n\nI ask for a grilled cheese sandwich, and the waiter tells me that I can't order that. OK, I'm not some difficult eater who hasn't moved off the kiddie menu, so I explain to him my food poisoning rationale, but no. He can't put that order in for me. I ask for the kids menu because I bet it's on there--nope, can't see that. I ask for the manager, but the waiter goes and comes back and tells me that I can order the Rustic Club Sandwich instead. So I proceed to order that, hold the turkey, tomato, lettuce, bacon and mayo. My coworkers were amazed that I was willing to order an $11 grilled cheese sandwich. The price didn't matter to me--it wasn't on my dime. It was the process of finally getting to what I wanted that bugged me. Now, I did get my sandwich, and it was a great grilled cheese, but I must say, it would have gone down better had the policy been bent a little. \n\nIt's a shame because I honestly really enjoyed their Grilled Artichokes. I guess I'll just be going to Houston's now when I want to get my \"dark restaurant\" fix.
