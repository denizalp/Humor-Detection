The decorations inside of the restaurant was cute and lovely. Their outside patio looked nice too but it was too hot to dine outside. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. My boyfriend got the lunch special with Caesar salad, The burger, and the brookie. I ordered the chicken sandwich with rainbow carrots on the side because I love me some rainbow carrots. I also ordered the white sangria which was very good. I love it. They had cute napkins that had the restaurants name on it. My chicken sandwich was really good. Portion size is big so we had to take it home. My boyfriends burger was good too. I tried some of his Caesar salad and it was delicious. I liked the croutons in it as well. The ice cream that came with the brookie was amazing. When it was time to pay they bring your receipt in this journal that allows you to write in it and so I took the opportunity to write Michael and Donna was here! With the date on it. :-) Overall the food and drinks here are awesome and the restaurant inside was decorative and welcoming. Definitely would try coming back for dinner here.
