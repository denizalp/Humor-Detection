As a follow-up to the 'owner', who has many typos in her response, the Disciplinary Board, after stating that Dr. Fremont had been in breach prior, ONLY closed my file because I was busy working, and missed deadlines.  Do NOT allow non-doctors and unlicensed people to insert needles into your face.  And yes, the argument occurred when the 'owner' said I need 4 times the amount of poison in my face, that I have had administered many times before.  Not only could that amount be toxic in a small area, it would have been extremely expensive.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
