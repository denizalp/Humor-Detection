This place is such a treasure here in Las Vegas! There's oh so many clubs, but after a while, the typical ones just become mundane. Foundation Room has the exclusive feel that most people are looking for. \n\nWe've been here on many occasions, with each time getting better! So, this review is LONG overdue. The nightclub is so fun! They have amazing GoGo dancers, guest DJs, celebrity appearances and a whole array of signature drinks,  along with VIP bottle service. The bar staff and servers are TOP NOTCH! .. And their executive hosts are very accommodating! They'll make your visit to Foundation Room unforgettable! \n\nI had my birthday party there last year. The view of the strip is breathtaking! It's definitely the place you want to be to celebrate any special occasion. It's also without a doubt THEEE BEST venue to celebrate NYE! We took so many memorable pictures and video. \n\nLast night was the first time we dined in the lounge. Highly recommended. We decided to eat in their comfortable lounge and tried a bunch of noms :-)\n\nMy favorite was the Saturn's Crust Grilled cheese! I'm still thinking about it as I type. We also tried the steak skewers, Korean fried chicken bao buns, and the Korean BBQ riblets. Everything was delicious! I can't wait to go back.. enjoy!
