Blech, no thank you!\n\nWe went here to celebrate Cinco de Mayo and it was just a bad experience all around. I wish we would have saved our money and gone elsewhere but in the name of being festive, we went anyways. I've been to Senor Frogs in Cancun when I was in college and it was a little too tacky and rambunctious for me then and much hasn't changed since then. \n\nWe sat out on the patio hoping to enjoy some food and drinks and we did but everything took forever and their prices for what they're serving are completely asinine. I got a chicken burrito that was swimming in different types of salsa, one of which smelled like curry and made me want to throw up. There was no taste whatsoever and I could barely choke down 1\/3 of it. The drinks weren't much better either but at least I could taste the hooch in them. If you're going for drinks it's a great place (if you got money to burn) and if you want to do a conga line for free shots poured down your throat, again great. Personally when I go out for food and drinks I want to enjoy the full experience, not worry about my feet sticking to the ground due to liquor, sweat, hoochie and broken dreams.Shaking my head just thinking about this place.
