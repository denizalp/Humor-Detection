I have always wondered what the heck is this place cuz there is always a giant crowd here.  Well we finally checked this spot out and now we know why this place is always busy.\n\nThere is nothing fancy or Vegas like about this cafeteria style Sammie spot,  no crazy menu, no neon lights, not even girls in skimpy outfits lol.  Earl of Sandwich does deliver some great tasty Sammies for a cheap $6.99.  We ordered the Tuna Melt which was perfection, light soft crispy bread with gooey Swiss and tuna salad.  I coul eat this Sammie everyday of the week.  We also tried the roast beef Sammie which was named the 1762 or something close to that.  The beef was so tender it literally melted in our mouths. The cheddar cheese and sweet spicy horseradish sauce complimented the tender beef perfectly. \n\nThe only bad thing I can say about Earl of Sandwich is that the sammies are on the smaller side and you might need more than one if you are a big eater.  Don't wait any longer to try this place it is worth standing in line for and it won't dent your wallet.
