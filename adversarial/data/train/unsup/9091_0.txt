This is definitely a \"hole in the wall\" type Mexican restaurant.  Located on the strip between the MGM and Polo Casino.  Surprising great tasting and fresh ingredients.  Try the carne asada taco!  Cubes of soft, seasoned steak on 2 flour disks.  Great salsa bar.\n\nTaco Tuesdays:  Almost all tacos are $2!\n\nAlways open, this is great hangover food!
