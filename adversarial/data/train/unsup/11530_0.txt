Considering our friends were staying at the University Inn, I think we won.\n\nThe location is clutch, adjacent to Monona Terrace and right off of the capitol. Some of the rooms even have lake views. We had a decent group rate since we were there for a wedding, but I can't remember how much it actually cost.\n\nThe room was a standard hotel room, but the bathroom was really, really dark. So dark, in fact, that I had to do my makeup in the armchair by the windows instead of in the bathroom. If I hadn't done that, who knows what kind of monstrosity could have come out of that dimly lit loo. Put some better lighting in there, Hilton.\n\nThe bed was really comfy, with GREAT pillows. I do believe my guy and I looked at each other in the morning and said, in unison, \"We have to get new pillows.\"
