As 2017 is about to give way to 2018, it's time for the old to make way for the new. Just as Uber is the new taxi, and orange is the new black, this once glowing Asian establishment has met its end to become another Asian establishment.  \n\nThere's nothing trendy about this place, nothing cool or modern. In its heyday, it was THE Asian mall, when P-Mall was just a Chinese developer's dream. Remember that? An era of Markham when Pacific Mall didn't exist? Now, Market Village is an eclectic collection of things your grandparents need to do. Dim sum, groceries, various household items, feng shui shop, jade jewelry, McDonalds for the little kids that don't want dim sum. \n\nDespite waning numbers, it never really died. Partially because of the customers that get tired of P-Mall and decide to check this place out. Also partially due to the little shops that have gained a loyal following. There's quite a successful series of restaurants outside and a couple inside. Graceful Vegetarian, Sam's Congee, Tung Tung Egg Rolls, Miu Garden; all have been around since I was a kid. \n\nAs my parents have abandoned me on Christmas, so too have shoppers begun to abandon this  mall from a past life. Going there on a recent weekend, the usual nightmarish parking lot near the HSBC was significantly less nightmarish. Shops are closing, and if lucky, moving on somewhere else to continue their business. People are taking one last stroll in the antiquated hallways that were surprisingly, quite well designed. \n\nAs the world bids goodbye to 2017, we in Markham bid goodbye to Market Village. I will always remember the days when I had fun eating egg waffles, buying chrysanthemum tea, and excitedly exploring the Anime-centric gift shop and later, the giant One's. Market Village, you aged gracefully, never letting the new guys take everything from you. I'll remember you fondly. \n\n(99\/100) - 2017
