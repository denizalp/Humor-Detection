Going to Blake and Dr Youmans at Dynamic Stem Cell Therapy was a life saving decision. Having taken on being my fiance's caregiver due to chronic illness, a suppressed immune system having little to no energy, brain fog, anxiety and mood swings. Dynamic Stem Cell Therapy helped reverse all that I believe it was the stem cell therapy that catalyzed her returning to good health.
