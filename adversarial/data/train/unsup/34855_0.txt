We had American Plumbing replace our front spigot and replace the valve that feeds our pool leveler in back. They also pulled out an old Reverse Osmosis System under a kitchen sink and fixed a bathroom sink faucet. I highly recommend American Plumbing based on our experience today. They called before they came, they showed up on time, and we're very professional and personable. Also, importantly, they charged us what they quoted us over the phone, even though they had to do a little bit extra work to make it all right. We are located in Gilbert and I would definitely use these guys again. Thank you American Plumbing.
