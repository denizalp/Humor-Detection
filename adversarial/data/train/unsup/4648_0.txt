I attended a birthday party at Gaetano's and was impressed by the well orchestrated staff. They have been in business for more than 25 years, which translates to a lot of weddings and other special events. You can trust their exacting attention to detail. \n\nThere's plenty of parking, even though they might hold 3 events simultaneously.  I did find it a bit confusing there were no signs directing me to my specific party. \n\nI also noted there is no elevator to the second floor, which could be a hugh issue if you are holding an intergenerational event. I felt sorry for the elderly guest with a walker, and I'm not sure how she navigated the steps. \n\nOur food was quite good and they kept restocking the chafing  dishes at a furious pace. A late arriving group of 3 were also ceremoniously served, much to my surprise. \n\nThe food itself was very traditional, things people know and expect. I would trust their off-site catering as well.
