Had the Chicago stuffed pizza and it was great!  Definitely worth waiting for.  We also shared a large dinner salad and it was really good and if you like spicy try the chipotle ranch dressing.  We sat outside and the weather was really nice and the tables were not too crowded together.  Our waiter was very attentive and brought sodas before we were finished as well as checking on us just enough to not be annoying.  Overall I would be a regular if I lived here but since I don't I'll just have to make a point of going every time I'm in Phoenix.
