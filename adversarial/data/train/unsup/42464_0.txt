I have used the mailbox services many times for faxes, shipping and passport quality pictures and have been pleased with the pricing and customer service. They also have an excellent jeweler in Marvin the Goldmaster. I commissioned a large custom ring. Marvin listened to what I wanted and designed a beautiful original ring that surpassed my expectations. Every step of the way he checked in with me to make sure he captured my idea and translated it into a physical piece of custom jewelry. I could not be happier and the price was so much cheaper than the larger jewlers quoted. So support your neighborhood small business and use UR Mailbox store for all your mailbox service needs and get a quote on all your jewelry needs, you will be a regular customer like me!
