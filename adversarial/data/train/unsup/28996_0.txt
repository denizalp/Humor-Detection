The treats are really delicious, but the whole experience was only ok.  First, there's nowhere to sit down, so you have to get everything to go.  They offer a good selection of small and bite-sized items, so this seems odd.  Seems like they could put some stools by the window or even some tables outside....maybe serve some coffee while they're at it.  Second, the person helping me threw all my items into one small bag, so everything got smashed together.  Next time I'll bring my own tupperware.
