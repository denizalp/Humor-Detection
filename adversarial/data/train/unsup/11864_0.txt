Just got back home from getting my 30k service on my car here. My third or fourth time going here. The past couple were for my oil changes. The guys seem honest to me and they are very friendly. It cost a little less than what I had originally expected thanks to a sale they had going on and a LOT less than taking to the dealership. Would definitely recommend this place and will continue to go there for my service. FYI - they had oil change on sale for 9.99 Can't beat that!
