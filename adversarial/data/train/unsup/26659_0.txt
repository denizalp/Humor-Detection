I went here for the sake of removing all of the metal fillings in my mouth. I also needed a root canal and cap. I had the root canal done elsewhere and came to Dr. Scott Condie for my cap. Not only was it not shaped well, it was significantly larger than my tooth that it was taking the place of and I had to return to his office several times to get the bite fixed. I also never felt it was cemented down properly as I could feel movement in it from the day they put it on. Even then when I suggested this to the dental assistant, she made excuses telling me that was normal and everything was fine. 3.5 years later I call in because the cement isn't holding like it should have due to it not being cemented properly and wearing down over time. Instead of being concerned for my well being and offering to schedule an appointment, the receptionist starts getting on me for not coming in to maintain it. 1) I was never advised to return to maintain it. 2) caps should be taken care of by the dentist for 5 years. I have never heard of a dentist that doesn't do this. Horrible!!! I would never recommend that ANYONE EVER go here as I can only recommend places that will treat you kindly with respect and concern for your well being.
