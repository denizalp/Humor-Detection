Really good fresh taco! A variety of different meats. Decently priced. But keep in mind they are smaller taco most likely will need to order a couple. However ordering system is wonky, don't understand it. Luckily went there with no crowd so wasn't an issue. But there are multiple lines to order different things then you go pay. I'll go back for more tacos tho!
