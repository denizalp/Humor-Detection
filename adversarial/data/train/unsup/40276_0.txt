I haven't been to the buffet at the Mirage since before it was renovated and renamed Cravings.  I joined a friend from out of town tonight for dinner.\n\nWe were pleased with our dinner.  The design is so much more friendly than the old set up.  The only thing I thought was that the seating looked almost like diner seats but that didn't matter.\n\nThere is a wide variety of stations from which to choose.There are: Italian, carving, Rotisserie, Latin, Raw Bar, Fishmonger, Noodles, Chinese, Salad, and Desserts.  Those are the names on the lights at each of the areas.\n\nStandouts tonight were the asparagus, lobster bisque soup--better than what I had recently at a high end Strip restaurant, the ravioli, and the desserts.  I mark them down because their prime rib that was supposed to be rare was more medium than rare even though she cut into a new piece.  I could have told her to cut in the middle, but she took from the end.\n\nThe dessert selection was nice.  I had some red velvet cake, a cookie, and the newest serving idea--a chocolate shaped mini tea\/coffee cup filled with chocolate mousse and topped with whipped cream.\n\nService was very good.  In fact I had to stop her from refilling my iced tea so many times because I was going to a show and I didn't want to have to leave in the middle for a bathroom break.\n\nThe buffet is priced a little less than the highest rated ones and I can see why.  I can see myself coming back sometime.
