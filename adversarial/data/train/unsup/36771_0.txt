I have not gotten to the hotel, the staff as already been rude. The quote on quote manger \"James\" --- was the rudest of them all, cause he make the final decision so he says. They promise a free airport shuttle, that does exist before 3 pm. Even when I called to confirm the day before. This is already turning into a bad experience before check-in.\n\nUpdate: Never end up check-in --- worst customer service I have every dealt with !!! Of course the place is bad if management is horrible !!!
