I made my appointment online. I went in to be seen for a sore throat and possible sinus infection. I waited in the lobby for 10 mins and was seen by the medical assistant as soon as I was taken to the room. He was wonderful and very professional. Once he left the NP walked in no less than 2mins later. She was awesome! I am exclusively breastfeeding and everything she prescribed me she double checked to make sure it was safe for BF Moms. Overall I was taken care of and had a great experience !
