4\/26\/12\n\nCame to check out the Van Gogh-Alive exhibit, and what a great way to spend $25!  The average exhibit-goer takes about 45 minutes to go through the exhibit, which includes 5 to 10 minutes of \"reflection\" in the second room, where you may look at pictures and descriptions regarding Van Gogh's life and specific artworks, so do make a note of this.  Had we had more time to spend, my cousin and I would've stayed for at least a couple of hours... The music, Van Gogh's letters, and the beauty of the digital presentations captivated us so!  \n\nI did find the benches, placed in a haphazard fashion, to be very distracting.  They broke the flow of energy in the room and kept me from being able to move about freely as I wanted to, and the benches' marred my visual field as I looked across the room.  This observation was again confirmed when I found a great YouTube vid that showcased the Istanbul presentation of this exhibit, which did not contain benches in the room.  (Now, I do not mind having somewhere to sit.  Indeed, there were lovely fabric and leather couches in this exhibit, and thankfully, they were by the walls.)  I also noticed that the Turkish exhibition suggested the room to have a larger dimension that that of Az Sci Center's.  I found its exhibit's dimensions seemed more open and had a better flow.  http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p1ACUNyN_Ec&feature=related\n\nI would definitely recommend people to check this presentation out!  I would love to re-visit this viewing, but perhaps in another city...\n\np.s.  The exhibit's $25 fee includes admission to the rest of the exhibits within AZ Science Center.  Please note that the Van Gogh exhibit can only be entered and exited once, and that it runs through June 17, 2012.
