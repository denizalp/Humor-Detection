Awful!! Just came from there now 8\/30\/2017. Went to their appliances section. No one came to offer help. On our way out I told the guy that checks receipts that no one helped us and one idiot employee overheard me then the idiot said in a mocking voice \"have a good day\". So unacceptable. I'll never go back there again. If I can give no star or negative star I would!!
