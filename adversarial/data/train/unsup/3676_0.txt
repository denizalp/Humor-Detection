I get it this place is new but I feel like if your not ready to open then don't open. The place does not look inviting its location is terrible the white parking lines need to be re done people were just parking any kind of way. Inside looks horrible , chairs and tables old and chair i was sitting on was wobbly set up was horrible, service was horrible, my friend put in an order and come to find out if was never put in. Then there was no soda because it broke. The menu sucks and way too expensive for bar food. Who serves just a burger for $15 and comes with no fries. Gumbo lacks flavor tasted like rice sitting in water barely any crab or sausage, margarita was super sour no balance. I mean don't get me wrong I get it first day it is to be expected but if your not ready don't open that's it. Big disappointment for me and will not recommend this place or ever come back.
