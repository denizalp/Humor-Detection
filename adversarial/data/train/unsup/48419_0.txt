This Walmart is shamefully bad. It is better than the ghetto-mart in Severance Town Center, but that isn't really a fair comparison, because at least the management at this store chooses to put items on the shelves instead of dumping them in the middle of the floor. That place deserves negative stars. \n\nThe biggest problem is that it seems that nobody works at this store. If all you want is ramen noodles, shampoo, and paper towels, this store is probably fine, but heaven forbid you need help with anything, because it will take you 10 minutes of aimless wandering to locate an employee who is willing to help you. I was trying to buy ammunition (which they actually have decent prices on here) and wasted 20 minutes trying to get someone who had a key to unlock the cabinet. Nobody was staffing the sporting goods desk, so I took off trying to find someone. I asked three blue shirts, two of whom told me off and said they were busy. The third reluctantly walked over to a phone and called for help in the sporting goods department. I returned to the sporting goods desk and waited a good five minutes before I left the store. I got in my car and drove the 15 miles to the Chardon Walmart, which is a great store that I highly recommend. \n\nWhoever manages this store should be immediately fired by Walmart corporate. It is really sad that the only decent Walmart within a 30 minute drive is way out in the middle of nowhere in Chardon. They have much better management and really have their act together.
