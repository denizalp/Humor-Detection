High hope bc of high rating from all the other yelpers. We ordered a special seafood spaghetti and lamb chop.  Why is it special seafood spaghetti?  It is because it included half lobster and crab legs tonight in the spaghetti!  Honestly, there are lots of seafood in the plate, but I would prefer more tomato sauce.  On the other hand, the lamb chop is very good!  Lamb meat is very tender.  At the end of the dinner, the restaurant provide free dessert, which is very nice!
