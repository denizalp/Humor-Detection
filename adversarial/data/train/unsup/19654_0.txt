We ventured to downtown Gilbert for a double date and stopped at Liberty Market for dinner and really enjoyed our experience!\n\nFood (4\/5)\nThe majority of dishes we tried at Liberty Market were scrumptious. We started with the Buffalo Fingerling Fries which were thick cut steak fries with cheesy buffalo chicken topping. Divine! For dinner we shared the Italia salad with chicken and the Salmon BLT with a side of pasta salad. The Salmon BLT was perfect! Large, smoky, and complete with crispy bacon and huge ripe tomatoes. The pasta salad side was also very nice and light. The Italia salad was just okay. Honestly nothing special and it lacked flavor. \n\nService (3\/5)\nThe concept on Friday nights is to order at the counter and then have all your food and drinks brought to your table based on your table number. Everything came out on time but we rarely had someone stop by to clear empty plates. We also ordered another round of drinks and they brought the bill before the drinks came. Then we put our credit card and never saw a waiter again. I eventually just went up to the counter to get our card run. \n\nAmbiance (5\/5)\nThe restaurant is cool and modern. There is an open air kitchen for the pizza station and the main kitchen is surrounded by glass so you can see in as you walk by. I always love these open air concepts as I believe it ensures your food is fresh! They also have a nice patio with lovely views of Downtown Gilbert. \n\nI am definitely open to trying Liberty Market again in the future, especially for brunch!
