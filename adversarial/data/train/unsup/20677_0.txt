Ugh..where do I even start about this airport? My friend and I arrived to the airport around noon since there wasn't much to do in the limited time we had prior to departure. Instead, we arrived to the airport to get through security and do some last minute souvenir shopping.\n\nLuckily, our gate was near a few food stands, so we had a few options to choose from for lunch. There was a sandwich shop that had St. Viateur bagels, so my friend got a sandwich there.  I guess the upside is that you can get a bagel without having to visit Mile End. I opted for a Tuna Melt and at $11.00, it was okay for airport food.\n\nUnfortunately, the presence of bagels could not save this review from how filthy the bathrooms were on this day. There was no toilet paper in practically every stall and you could tell they were completely neglected from routine maintenance.
