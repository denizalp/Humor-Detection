I was here 4 days in a row for a convention.  I didn't stay in any of the guest rooms, so my review isn't about the accommodations, but about the rest of the property that I experienced during my time here.  \n\nThe property itself is very nice, well kept, with clean common areas. The valet area was always bustling. There is a little cafe inside with a very cozy sitting\/ eating area.  (I didn't eat at the cafe, but I did sit in one of those comfortable chairs.)\n\nOur conference took up the entire 3rd floor.  Both restrooms on this floor were nice and large.  They stayed clean and stocked.  Housekeeping was tending to the restrooms, what seemed like, at least once an hour.  The main auditorium was huge and held up to 2K guests.  The hotel staff was attentive and helpful whenever they were needed.  \n\nThey lost stars, however, for broken promises and expensive parking.  This property had initially promised to offer convention guests discount parking at $10 per day, instead of the normal $19\/day rate.  However, at the last minute, hotel management informed that they wouldn't be honoring this promise.  So guests, some of whom were already spending thousands of dollars to attend the convention and stay at the property, had the burden of an extra $60+ in parking expenses.  That is bogus.  Don't make a promise and then renege on it. That is bad business.  AND there are no in and out privileges with their over-priced parking, so parking fees could easily double.  Street parking isn't any cheaper, especially if you arrive early and stay late.  As an alternative, the Arizona Center parking lot charges $12 per day.\nI'm seriously hoping that when this convention returns, they chose another property; one that offers complimentary parking.  \n\nAside from my dismay for their parking situation, the hotel is nice.
