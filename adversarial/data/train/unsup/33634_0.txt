My husband and I came here with a coupon (thankfully). Before we arrived, we read the mixed reviews, so our expectations were low, but we needed a bite to eat and thought we'd give it a try. \n\nI ordered the petite filet steak with vegetables and balsamic greens. Our server warned us that the portion size would be small - \"Nothing like Outback\". He was right. My steak was about 3\" long and 2\" wide. It was pretty tough as well. \n\nMy husband started to order the Hibachi Salmon, but again, our server warned him that it would be nothing like \"Hibachi\" style - more like a glazed salmon. My husband went with the country fried steak with mashed potatoes, white gravy, and vegetables. He said it was edible, but nothing he'd return for.\n\nAs new patrons we were given two muffins as we left. You can tell the management is making an effort to improve; however, with so many other food options around, there is continued room for improvement.
