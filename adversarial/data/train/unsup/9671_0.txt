I've been going to John's with my family since I was a kid, and it hasn't failed me yet.\n\nSouthern comfort food as it should be. A variety of tasty entrees with a list of delicious sides to choose from. Always served with a biscuit or cornbread. If you go for dinner, they'll also give you a complimentary (yep, a free) bowl of the soup of the day with your meal. A rarity this day and age, for sure.\n\nJohn's is not going to be your fancy place, or a spot with a crazy fly atmosphere, but it's not trying to be. It's good, affordable food served by nice folks.
