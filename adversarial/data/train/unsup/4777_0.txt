It is very unfortunate that there is only ONE Colombian restaurant in Las Vegas, and this one is not a good example of our gastronomy.  What I really dislike about this place is the inconsistency.  One day food might be good but the next it will be terrible; customer service is very bad, and sometimes they dare to serve OLD OLD food.\nI do love their empanadas.....they are pretty good!\nLas Vegas needs a GOOD Colombian restaurant and not this mediocre place.
