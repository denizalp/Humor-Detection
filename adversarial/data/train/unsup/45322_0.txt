Came across this salon because it's in our neighbor hood and my husband was tired of going to those quick cut places which you normally have to wait. After finding this salon we haven't tried any other because Susie does such a wonderful job and my husband is quite picky about his hair. After seeing what a wonderful job Susie does, I decided to give her a try myself and I have to say she sure knows what she's doing...either with men's cut or women's she does an amazing job. You can tell she's been doing this for years because she's quick with the scissors not like some salon stylist that takes forever because they are new to the field and still need lots of pratice. The only draw back is that it's on the pricier side...$30 for men and $50+ for women but it's worth it every time because we get good results.
