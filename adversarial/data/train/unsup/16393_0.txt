Ye's Is A No's!!! \n\nThis is the worst Sushi Place in Ontario never mind Oakville. I only gave it a one star because I couldn't give it a no star! If you love crappy food, crabby servers & non existent service you'll love Ye's .... excuse me because I have to run to the bathroom ..... that's how bad the food is here. \n\nNote ..... I'm not trying to be malicious but this place really sucks & why at 7pm on a Sat it's half empty!
