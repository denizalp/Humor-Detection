One of the best dim sum restaurant in the U.S.A. I've been to many dim sum restaurants in NYC Chinatown and Brooklyn Chinatown, but Ping Pang Pong in Vegas beat them all because every single dish is great... like a restaurant in Hong Kong. I gave it a 4* because of the hour wait, but on Sunday brunch hour this is probably the norm being how popular this place is with the local Asian population. It is located inside the Gold Coast Casino (has a great priced buffet which I also recommend.)
