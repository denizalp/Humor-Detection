The first thing one notices about this grocery store is that it looks more like a crack-house from the outside than anything.  Actually, I'd passed it many times before without knowing it was actually a grocery store!\n\nInside, it's not much better in that it's pretty dark, musty, and just makes me feel dirty. \n\nTheir aisles are narrow and things are somewhat organized and categorized, and despite the fact they probably have the most variety of all the Asian grocery stores, you'll probably spend a lot more time looking for what you want than anything else.\n\nPrice-wise, they're okay, but I don't know if they take credit cards or not... I get the feeling that they may not. \n\nTo summarize:\n\nPros:  Lots of variety, relatively inexpensive\nCons:  Dirty, can be difficult to locate what you're looking for\n\nThis is the Asians' Asian grocery store.
