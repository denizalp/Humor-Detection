I used to get Chinese food all the time. I think back in my college days specifally. Nothing tasted better than a greasy tub of lo mein noodles. Loaded with veggies and shrimp. \n\nI used to get it all the time from Mandarin Gourmet or Fui Lai downtown. You know the places, very different, but both very good (or good from what I remember). So I was pumped to go back to my fave dish. \n\nWhile it wasn't terrible by any means, it lacked flavor. Plus, the shrimp that I did get was minuscule and I'd guess there were maybe 5 pieces. I also love bean sprouts and cabbage in there, and there was hardly any at all. And forget about any sugar snap peas or broccoli. I guess maybe that was always a bonus when there was veggies in lo mein at other restaurants. \n\nI think this might spur another resurgence of the hunt for the best Chinese in the Burgh!
