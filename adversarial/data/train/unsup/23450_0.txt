Went on Wednesday to see Tarzan in 3-D with my girlfriend Sharee & her mom. My husband and I used to live near by this theater and never really went because it was so run down. But to go into it after about 2 years what a difference. \n\nThey had a bar now in Lobby. Drink prices are what you would expected to pay $8-10. Did go to concession otherwise. Stick with the good stuff. . \n\nWent into theater couldn't believe it. Nice recliner seats. Since I didn't purchase the tickets didn't know, which was a surprise, they do assigned seating. Which is wonderful. Always love that about other luxury movie theaters and felt they were worth paying a little more. The quality of the movie was good. Sound was a little loud. \n\nUnfortunately though the women's bathroom left something to be desired.  Disappointed that there was a little care taken into keeping it cleaned up. And I understand if a movie just let out but it hadn't. A lot of paper towels and toilet paper every where. Once I came out of the movie it had been cleaned up better thankfully. \n\nIt was great to see the new changes. Wish it was like this when we lived up the road.  But good to know I'd come back.
