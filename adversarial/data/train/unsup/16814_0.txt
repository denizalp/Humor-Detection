This is a decent alternative in the morning to the cafe.  The service is slow and not the greatest.  The coffee is good.  I tried a few different types over recent stays and was happy with each.  The food is ok.  I tried the ham and egg crepe.  The flavor was just ok, but the portion was huge.  It was a good value.  This is an ok option for coffee, a quick breakfast, or a snack.
