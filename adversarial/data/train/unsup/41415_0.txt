We are completely satisfied and happy that we went to National Stone! We ended up getting new kitchen counter tops (but kept our kitchen cabinets) and it was the best choice ever!  A family owned business in Las Vegas who gets things done for a reasonable price. And also a company who picks up their phone calls. \n\nI called to set up a appointment and Mo came to our home and gave us a estimate. Service was very professional and top notch. After Mo did an estimate, we went into the store to pick our our granite. We chose their special, which was $32.99 per sq foot. This price includes installation and fabrication. We also added a new under mount sink to this purchase and it was worth it. The installation does not include plumbing. They require you to hire a plumber to reattach the plumbing work. But National Stone has a plumber that they referred us. Immediately after granite install, the plumber came after and attached everything. \n\nThe best part, we needed to complete this project the earliest possible. Mo initially said it would take at least until the weekend, but luckily he called and said they had a Thursday opening! It took us a total of 4 days to replace the granite, which includes, final measurements, going into the store to pick out the stone and installing the granite. Installing took about 2.5-3 hours! It was amazing. The two installers were quick, professional and accurate. Just a warning, the installers work very, very fast! So, if you're use to slow workers these installers might not be the best fit for you. But we liked it, because they got things done and did not waste our time. \n\nIf I get my next home purchase, I would definitely hire National Stone in a heart beat. They are absolutely the place to go for granite! Oh, and I would ask for Mo. He's easy to work with and will get things done fast!
