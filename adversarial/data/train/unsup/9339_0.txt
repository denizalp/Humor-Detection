Whenever I visit Phoenix I try to spend a few hours at Camelback. Each time, my experience is similar and fantastic.Happy people going up and down. Everyone working pretty hard, some more than others depending on level of fitness, but even so, everyone seems content. I don't mean \"laughing happy\", I mean \"stoned on endorphins\" happy. There is a particular and striking low-stress look about it.\n\nRegulars who know the joy of this hike are here all over the place and the 60-75 year-olds jackrabbiting up the scrambles are amazing.. inspirational really. I treasure the times I've made this small trek. If I lived in nearby, I'd be here all the time.
