I debated between giving this one or two stars...one star won.\n\nWe did get to the hotel early in the morning, around 10am, and we waited in the slowest moving line ever to check in.  There were a lot of people waiting to check in, and maybe, 5-6 employees actually checking people in.  Our room wasn't ready but they were able to hold our luggage for us.  \n\nWe stayed in the West Wing tower, and were literally the 3rd to last room on the floor.  Had trouble finding our room, look at the picture below and you'll see why.  SO GHETTO!! You mean to tell me that maintenance at MGM has not had time to order a new room number plate for the wall?? That they had to write it ON the wall in SHARPIE??  The room itself was odd, mirrors behind the bed and next to it, some weird funky chair that was oddly positioned in the room.  The best part was the bathroom, how disgusting is it that I can see mold and mildew in the shower stall itself? Or that the all glass shower door had been busted off before, and they tried to rig it back together, so that now, when you turn on the shower, water leaks into the toilet area??? Oh, and the toilet area itself, is enclosed in glass, so, no privacy there whatsoever.  You can literally hear EVERY. LITTLE. DROP. lol \n\nWe did find an elevator that was much closer to our room, instead of the one we took when we arrived which had us walk past 95+ rooms to finally reach ours.  Anyways, this much closer elevator took us down to the main floor, when the doors opened, we arrived to what looked like a deserted, dark, red room.  Once you walk past all of that (no signs of course) you end up in a casino.  Thank Goodness for that.\n\nLong story short, don't stay here.  Unless you don't mind filth and sharpie on the walls ;)  Should have been a sign when NO ONE else got off the shuttle from the airport to stay here..and it was a full bus lol.
