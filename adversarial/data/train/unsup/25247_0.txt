I love this wine bar!\nIt has an hipster vibe to it, with menu on chalk board ( which I hate by the way, it's unacceptable, hipster or not) but the quality of the food and wines made me forget the other details. Our waitress was very helpful and ended up choosing for us since we couldn't see the damn chalk board menu. The food felt healthy but impressively tasty and paired perfectly with the wines which were all so fresh and lively. \nIt is a bit expensive, and the food is in small plates to share. It might be a better option for lunch or just before a show like us than for a full diner as it can get pricey in the end. There was a good diversity in the choices even if they were limited and all very creative.\n\nMy favorite part was at the end, we took a cheese plate. We had three different kind and each and everyone of them were so flavorful. One of them, called les pouilles was particularly strong, smooth and amazing.
