NOT RECOMMENDED\nonce you buy the car they wont even recognize you.. they will be really good while they are selling it but once you purchase it, its all gone!! i will never recommend any one to do business with them..\n\nAlryt it starts from where i bought my car from them, there was a noise in steering when i bought it i told them there is a noise , they said o we will fix it its not sum thing big, they give me time of one week i went back, again told me to come back after 2 week the third time i went there, they said its not cover you have to pay for it ... I PAID FOR IT, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT!! STILL THAT NOISE IS STILL THERE..\nits not end yet.. its a big review , i m taking time out of my day so you can understand how wrong they did to me.\n\nSO after that today i went there , there is some thing wrong with  my radiator , the car is getting really heated.. first of all the lady at the computer at mechanical department was highly rude and unwelcoming.. i said can u ask sum one to check my car its getting really heated, she said leave your car and come tomorrow.\ni said i have to go to work tomorrow if you can  just check it i ll wait for 2. 3 4 hour here, just ask someone to check it so i know whats wrong in it and than i ll leave it for a day if i exactly know the problem.. she said NO YOU ARE A WALK IN you need appointment.. i said ok\ni came home, call them ask for an appointment , she said 28 october... and today is 13 oct WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I CANT DRIVE MY CAR TILL 28 WITH RADIATOR OFF.. THEY ARE NOT EVEN WILLING TO CHECK IT BEFORE THAT, HOW I M GONNA DRIVE THIS CAR TILL THEN..  \n\nSO LONG STORY SHORT SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY..\nNOT RECOMMENDED
