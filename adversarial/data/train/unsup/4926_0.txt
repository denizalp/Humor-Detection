This church has been around FOREVER! I can't believe there are no reviews! The pastor here is Fr. Rinn. His sermons are short and to the point, he never goes around in circles. What I love best about him is that he's from Chicago. What I hate most about him is that he's a White Sox fan! Sometimes when his mirophone goes out, he blames the Cubs fans in the back...what a funny guy. There are 'children's' masses at 10am on Sundays, Fr. Bill is normally the presider then, but the singing is normally the kids from the adjoining school. Talk about beautiful. Their singing brings tears to my eyes, it's breathtaking!
