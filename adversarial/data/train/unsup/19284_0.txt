First visit: 09\/13\/2015\nLast visit: 01\/24\/2016\nAnother small Phoenix strip club that was on the top ten list the past couple of years. We aren't really sure why though. It wasn't a horrible club by any means; we've seen a lot worse.We went on a Friday night after we left a different club and it was definitely one of the busier clubs that we have visited here in Phoenix. The door girl apparently did not want to be there that night because she literally told us the price, took our money, gave us change, and said nothing else. We almost walked out right then, but it looked like it was busy so we figured that meant it was going to be a good time; at least we hoped.After our horrible experience with the door girl and the door guy patting down Kristian who was dressed better than the entire security staff there, we noticed that there was a smoking patio right there as well as the ATM. We then entered the club and saw the bar to the right, the left side of the club was lined with two people tables and chairs with a mirror running the length of the wall.We were sat by one of the security staff right up front which we appreciated and he was one of the more personable staff members that we would encounter the entire evening.There's one stage; not a bad sized stage, with two poles and two high heel chairs on it (no one used the chairs, but that would have been nice to see if the dancer was erotic and sensual enough to pull it off).Sadly, we have a lot to say about the club, which we actually liked, but we couldn't tell you much about the dancers because not a single one talked to us even after we used the cash cannon a couple of times. There were a lot of them working the floor, walking around, but none talked to us. And they only have one song to dance to on the stage so we didn't really get to see all of them work, but the ones we saw were pretty good. They all seemed to be flexible and have basic pole skills and a lot of them were gorgeous....yeah that's all we got.
