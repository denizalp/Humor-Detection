Fantastic facility, goofy rules and creepy old guys.  \n\nThis facility is fantastic.  Everything you would need under one roof. So much so that sometimes the place is a little too busy for me, especially with all the kids.\n\nI know some people have stated that there are goofy rules about the locker rooms.  I don't have kids, and since they have another set of \"adult\" locker rooms, I really don't care.  The goofy rule that drives me bonkers is the treadmill\/fitness area.  I can't figure out the whole 30 minute rule on the machines when they have 100 machines and 3 people working out.  Checking in with some attendant and then only getting 30 minutes? Meh.  Especially since I see other people going past the 30 minute rule.  \n\nMy biggest and most annoying complaint about this place, is the creepy old guys that use the pool.  Getting hit on by a guy old enough to be your dad while trying to swim laps?  Not enjoyable.  \n\nI'm torn on whether to renew my membership, I love the facility, but the goofy rules and the creepers tick me off.
