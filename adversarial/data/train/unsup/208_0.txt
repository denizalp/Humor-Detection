Arizona Republic has been notoriously dropping off their SPAM SOLICITING on my property. I have NEVER ordered from them and I have REPEATEDLY have called, emailed and have even spoken to management to REMOVE my address permanently. It has been an ongoing issue for over two years. These idiots refuse to comply and I will have to look into further action since they continue to leave their garbage. From the reviews of fellow Yelpers this is a known problem that isn't being resolved. If someone has an idea of what to do to END this, please message me.\n\nI'll continue now with filing against a complaint with the BBB.\n\nUpdate so after I put in this complaint with the BBB this company has reached out to me via email and NOW I'm on their mailing list?! HARASSMENT and I am interested in further action. If anyone can help with this matter, please private message me. I have also filed another complaint with the BBB.\n\n(I wrote the above several months ago and listed in their other location. It's only right to also place it here.)\n\n***An update** and further info to my complaint. Arizona Republic refuses to end their soliciting. Should you experience the same from this GARBAGE of a company like I have, you can contact the following:  Better Business Bureau and file a complaint, if the complaint was closed, reopen it.  BBB # 877-291-6222. Federal Trade Commission # 877-382-4357.  I have NOW consulted with a law firm and they will be following up with this company along with BBB and the FTC.  (Arizona Republic is still sending me soliciting on a regular basis.) STOP Harassing me! \n\n** Latest update, a sieze and desist letter was sent by my attorney and the deliveries have stopped since then.**
