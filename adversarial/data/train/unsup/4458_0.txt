A little bit of Paris, smack dab in the middle of the Strip.  It's a perfect lunch spot with a grand view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, the fountains don't start running until 3 p.m., so I guess if you're here in the summer, come for an early dinner (and avoid the lunch time heat if you're on the patio), if you're here in the winter, just come for lunch, minus the active fountains.  Don't be scared, they have heat lamps everywhere.  \n\nFor seating, try to request either the open air patio or the enclosed glass ceiling bistro area (does remind me of bistro floors in Paris, only cleaner and brighter).  The formal seating area inside is dark and gives off that reddish brown light of a stuffy steakhouse.  If the restaurant isn't packed full, then you're safe, because they default to seating people outside or in the bright covered area.  \n\nI started with a Frangria, which I'm sure is not French.  It's red sangria that had good fruity\/sweet balance and was inexpensive.  \n\nHeavily recommended by my server was the French Onion Soup (which I normally love), but I didn't order it because I would've been too stuffed.  Next time.  Our server was very attentive.  \n\nI had the Steak Frites\/Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce, $25.95) medium rare.  The steak is big flat piece, smothered with peppercorn sauce.  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  The steak frites are definitely worth getting, just pick your preferred sauce (butter, caramelized onion with red wine reduction, peppercorn, blue cheese).  \n\nThe frites\/fries that accompany the steak are thinnish potato shavings that curl a bit after frying.  Have you ever tried Pik-Nik Ketchup Fries from your grocery store?  Their cut reminded me of that, except they have more give on the inside from fresh frying.  Unique, yes.  I can see how some people would love these fries while others might hate them.  \n\nShe had the Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad with avocados, blueberries, walnuts and citrus dressing ($17.95).  The salad was a solid choice, the citrus salmon played well with the avocados and blueberries.  \n\nWe were here for lunch.  If you come for dinner, you get more choices on the steak cuts.  Added choices include filet mignon, hanger, New York strip and bone-in rib eye.  \n\nThis is a very relaxing place to have a meal with one of the grandest views in all of Vegas, I can't wait to come back!
