My second second visit and so far food I would recommend if your the mood for Chinese delacasie. .I gave them 4 stars because the people are friendly and acknowledged my concern about one the meal I had on my first visit. The place is clean and cozy..I can have to admit I will be back again. I don't normally re visit other chinese restaurant I have been in this town. This is might the only one I would definitely keep coming back as long they stay consistent..
