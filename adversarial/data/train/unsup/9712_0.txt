I wish I had been a this bar on one of those great nights all the five star people wrote about! It was awful... When we walked in it sounded like a bad karaoke night! Whomever is in charge of sound for the place needs to be replaced. the acoustics are difficult in this venue as its multi leveled but really at one point all I could hear was bass drum, snare drum and mumbled singing. And yes apparently drums is part of their dueling piano line up - who knew?  \nI ordered a Cape Cod with extra lime and my waitress came back and said they were all out of Cape Cod... I asked her how they were out of Vodka and Cranberry juice? I guess the bartender is only familiar with cheap college beer and no mixed drinks that don't include redbull or sex in the name. I suggest the bartender needs replacing as well. I finally did get my drink which tasted like straight cranberry juice. we stayed about an hour but just couldn't take it anymore. I will not bother going back.
