First time here (just moved to Arizona TODAY) and a man named Tony greeted us by shaking our hands and asking each of our names. He then sat as at a table and brought us some complimentary garlic knots since it was our first time here. (They were delicious.) Looked at the front of the menu and saw that he must be one of the Cassanova bros. He was calling us by name and greeting others at the door also by their first names. Already impressed and by the time we were having our Cesar salad and pepperoni pizza, we pretty much decided we would be back once a week for the duration of our three month stay in Arizona. Magnificent service and delicious food. Just... yes.
