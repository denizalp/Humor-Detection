This is my wife's favorite Chinese in the world. I don't get it, but she's swears by the sweet and sour tofu. We used to get it when we lived by 1-90 and route 91. Now i live by 1-90 and west 150th. I must have some strange attraction to the interstate.\n\nWe had said tofu Saturday and it was exactly the same. Crispy and not soggy. The egg roll is actually a spring roll. I hate when you order a spring roll and they give you a disgusting greasy egg roll. This place is the opposite. You never know which you'll get depending on the establishment.\n\n Anyhow, for making my wife so very happy, this place gets high marks. It's also across from Lake West hospital. If you are staying there for any reason, you can have Chinese for your last meal.
