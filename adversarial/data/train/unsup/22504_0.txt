I cannot say enough how good this buffet was.  It was so good we went both on Saturday and Sunday and we weren't even guests at Paris hotel.  Just great selections, Crab Legs, Shrimp, Prime Rib, Corn Beef Hash, to name a few.\n\nFRESHLY made Crepes, the Creme Brulee made me want to do somersaults all through the restaurant.  So damn good!  I'm a big ice cream person and their Custard-style Ice Cream hit the spot, i even took a Cone to go!  I highly suggest Le Village Buffet.
