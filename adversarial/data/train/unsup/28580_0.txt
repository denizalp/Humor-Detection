Best chocolate in Nevada. Their chocolate is a true food experience; seat back and savor the moment while the chocolate melts in your mouth. I'm a foodie & not every one understands why splurging in something special and decadent is worth it until I share some & the reaction is always the same...almost like when you get a chakra alignment.  I just wish that they had more store front locations
