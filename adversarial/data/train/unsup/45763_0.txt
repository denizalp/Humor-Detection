Loved everything about this place. It is a truly old-school nostalgic restaurant right off the Las Vegas trip. When you enter there is an old man named Gordy who plays an accordion who tells stories about how Sinatra and the Rat Pack were regulars here.\n\nThe place is filled with pictures and autographs of stars and singers from the Vegas heyday. What is amazing as soon as they seat you they bring two kinds of house wine which is included with your meal. The wine is very good as well.\n\nYou also get oversized garlic bread and a great Italian salad with really good dressing before your meal. The seats are very big but the waiters and waitresses are awesome and friendly. I had the egg plant Parmesan which was fantastic and I also was thrilled because they brought out cappuccino with whip cream to end the meal. I think my total bill was about $38 but it was well worth it.\n\nDefinitely will go back.
