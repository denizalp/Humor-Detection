I had planned a weekend trip to go to David's Bridal in Edmonton, until one of my bridesmaid's called me and let me know that a David's Bridal was opening on Macleod.\n\nWe promptly cancelled our Edmonton plans and made our way here on the second day of the store being open.\nI had called ahead and made an appointment and told them I was looking for my wedding dress and that 3 of my bridesmaids would be with me.\nThey misunderstood this to think that we were just looking for bridesmaid dresses. Even after I was told to fill out another form upon arrival where I promptly circled BRIDAL dress.\n\nThis store is HUGE they have everything formal you can imagine from grad, party dresses, bridesmaid, mother of the bride, shoes, bling and dress preservation kits.\n\nAfter our consultant showed us around and we cleared up that we were primarily looking for me, I had come prepared with the 3 style numbers that I wanted to try.\nShe swiftly went off and brought the dresses back. We quickly put on the first two which were not so good on me, until the third one where I started crying cause I knew I had found my dress.\n\nI can say I have only ever tried on three wedding dresses.\n\nWhen I had expressed my desire that \"this was my dress,\" the consultant brought the manager over who handed me a bell, and told me that I should make a wish or a prayer with my eyes closed and once I had done so, to ring the bell.\nMy one bridesmaid whispered, \"wish for no pregnancy\". After gaining control and deafening myself from the bell ringing I was ushered over to the entire alteration crew to see if anything would need to be done. Though my wedding isn't for almost two years, it was nice to be fussed over.\n\nWe then got to peruse the bling and the bridesmaid dress section.\nI smartly held off buying any other accessories and told my bridesmaids not to worry about getting a dress now.\n\nThe one thing that did annoy me a little bit was the dress I bought was off a mannequin, so they didn't have a bag for it, I had to purchase a garment bag.\n\nMind you it was $8, but still.\n\nI gotta say, this place rules for those brides on a budget, they have beautiful stuff. I got my dress for under $500 and I am 100% in love with it.\nI think I will be coming back here to get the bridal party dresses, they also have an arrangement with Moores for the groom's side, so they can match colours, etc.\n\nHad a good time, despite bell prayer ringing and I got my wedding dress!!!
