The location isn't far from where I live... I'm between a couple of locations but prefer this one.  Everyone talks about the parking, etc. but I tend to try and shop when others don't in order to avoid that whole situation.  If you can make it on a week day (especially mid-day) or earlier on the weekends it's really not that bad.  The gas station is great!  I honestly have never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to get to the pump and the prices are what you'd expect of Costco.\n\nCustomer service wise, they aren't that great - but it's a warehouse and honestly, I'm just trying to get in and out of there and never really peruse much.  The produce is fresh and it's a great place to pick up the necessities you don't mind buying in bulk.  Since I'm single and live alone I tend to drift a lot more towards things such as cleaning items and toiletries as well as other items I frequently use such as batteries, spinach or non-perishables like pasta.  Frozen items are great as well and I gravitate toward the fruit to make smoothies.  Their return policy is unparalleled and their book section is nice.  I love indulging in a cookbook every once in a while when I go in!\n\nThis location does have a pharmacy, food court, optical department, and tire service center but I have yet to utilize those services.  I am a fan of the place and will surely keep up my membership there.
