the place itself is very clean and felt brand new.  the hostess wasn't nice, wasn't mean - there isn't much to say about the service.  it was pretty indifferent.  the atmosphere was actually pretty awkward since we were the only ones in the restaurant.  \n\ni ordered the pulled bbq pork sandwich.  it was dry and salty.  i pretty much hated it.  the fries, however, tasted pretty good.  my boyfriend ordered the hotlinks and he said it tasted fine.  its pretty hard to mess up sausages.  i'm not sure they should be in the bbq business though - i feel like the venue has potential but they should maybe change their menu.\n\noverall, i give the place two stars because the venue itself was nice.  i would have given it a one if it wasn't.  i would say skip it.
