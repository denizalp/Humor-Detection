In my opinion this place is not worth the money they charge. \n\nESPA is a medium-size facility on the third floor of Vdara hotel. It's modern, pleasant-looking and everything seems tidy there. You can book a service by the phone or at the reception. If you have any questions a nice man or woman will patiently answer all of them and smile the whole time. I don't know about any other services but I didn't have to wait long to enjoy my gel polish manicure, just hour and a half. The manicure itself was rather standard, not very long and no additional treatments, like hand massage or a good hand lotion. The woman chose to hardly talk to me so it was rather me making an awkward small talk, as I do not like silence much. What's more, her nails were damaged and there was some nail polish coming off. I usually don't even notice such things, but as a manicurist, her nails should be her trademark or something. The treatment was relaxing and the effect pretty long-lasting, however the price was definitely to high for such an average service (80$ plus a customary 18% tip). If my nails weren't in such a bad state I wouldn't waste my money.\n\nThe second thing that was certainly too expensive was ESPA after the sun lotion. I burned myself a bit and I was in desperate need of some relief. However, the majority of lotions have an aloe vera as a component and I unfortunately get a very mild case of allergy after using it. Still not pleasant though. After a long search it become clear that I have only one option - a very small bottle of ESPA lotion, costing 65$. Ouch. \n\nSo, if you do not care about the money much it's a place as good as any other, but otherwise i would recommend to go there only in case of cosmetic emergency.
