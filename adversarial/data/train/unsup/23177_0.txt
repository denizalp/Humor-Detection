Southwest is my carrier of choice for short haul flights.\n\nCheck-in is quick and easy via their app 24 hour prior to departure. This will determine the boarding position.\n\nThe entire plane is open seating; thus first-come, first served.\n\nWifi was supposed to be available on my flight but my phone couldn't detect the Wifi network?
