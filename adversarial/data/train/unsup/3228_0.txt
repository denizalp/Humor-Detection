If you are reading this you quite possibly are doing research before going to the Grand View Timeshare Presentation. \n\nI would strongly recommend that you stay as far away as possible, the bodysnatchers that will get you to sign up for this timeshare presentation will tell you about anything to get you to go. They will tell you that it will take only two hours. It will take four. You will go through a series of Hard Sell closers that will brow beat you and swear in front of your children.\n\nAfter politely declining their 27k timeshare at $700 a month, the last manager said \"you just ain't buying shit today are you?\" In front of my 5 year old. \n\nScum. You have been warned. Nothing promised will be worth your time, NOTHING
