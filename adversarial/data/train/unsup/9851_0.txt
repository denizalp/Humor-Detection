We just went there on a Saturday afternoon without any expectations but just to try something new. We were not disappointed actually. We enjoyed the experience more than the food. Each table is equipped with a BBQ grill where you grill your food yourself. The service is pretty slow hence you it's better to order in advance. Out of all chicken theriyala was my favorite.
