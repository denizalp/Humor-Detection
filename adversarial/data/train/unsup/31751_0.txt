Very inconsistent drink presentation. Some highballs came with a straw or no straw. Side of tonic first round next round they just poured it in my drink. Level of side tonic 3\/4 full or full.  Hendricks gin first round with lime next one with cucumber! Not sure what the hell they're doing but this is supposed to be a bar the \"specializes\" in  high end cocktails\/ drinks. WTH very disappointing. Probably will never go back.
