06\/02\/11\n\nTook Mom w\/ me for my second visit (her first) and ordered a small Mista salad and a large Clevenger (olive oil base, sausage, spinach, red onions, feta, no tomato sauce).  The salad arrived pretty fast, since our server placed the order in BEFORE asking us which pizza we wanted.  (Our pizza also arrived later, bec. the kitchen took extra time to wipe down the oven's surface of as much cornmeal as possible to mitigate possible allergic reactions I might come down w\/...)  Believe you me, this pizza was worth waiting for!\n\nThe mista consisted of mixed greens, tomato wedges, crunchy walnuts, feta, and Florencia's fantastic balsamic vinaigrette.  (You can purchase the vinaigrette to take home!)  This salad was so delicious and so much fun to eat (crunchy walnuts, creamy feta, and tangy vinaigrette were the secrets to this simple, yet delightful salad!), I could see myself coming back and ordering a small order for my main meal and be completely satisfied.  In fact, I WAS satisfied w\/ my half of the salad and could've gone to the movie we were planning to see, but didn't, bec. we had to wait an extra 30 minutes or so for the pizza to arrive.  No worries, though, as the Clevenger was even MORE spectacular than the Bravo I tried the first time around!  (And if you read my first review, you can see how much I loved that combination-- I ate half of the medium pizza at one sitting!)\n\nI apologize for the terrible photos of the pizza I've included here... (My Mac powerbook is in the shop and isn't available to correct for the dark lighting.)  Bon appetit!
