Holy cow. This place is legit! \n\nBeing a snooty foodie in Southwest Las Vegas is tough... there really aren't any upscale restaurants with good food. Pier 215 is probably the closest thing we have to upscale but the food is just A-OK. \n\nI saw The Black Sheep when I was on a Skinny Fats food run and thought I'd look it up... after seeing the photos and reviews, my boyfriend and I came in for a happy hour to give it a try and  holy shiitake mushrooms was the food incredible!!\n\nThe Vietnamese Imperial rolls-- absolutely incredible. Tasty crispy outside with a warm delicious inside.\n\nWest Coast Oysters-- Not big weird oysters... succulent smaller treats that are buttery and flavorful with no fishy flavor. (Only $1 for happy hour, score!)\n\nBao Sliders-- Orgasmic. Don't be afraid of the quail egg, it's just like a regular egg, only smaller. These little sliders have so much flavor it's incredible. One of the best sliders I've ever had. An absolute must try!\n\nWatermelon, Burrata, and Tomato salad-- this too was incredible. Tasty frisee and delicious fresh tomatos. The watermelon... perfect. They could have given a bit more burrata, but I'm kind of a sucker for cheese! Delicious.\n\nHanger Steak-- Now I've never been a fan of skirt steaks or hanger steaks. TBH, I've always thought they were inferior cuts of meat being peddled as hip, new cuts to try. This hanger steak is the best think to happen to me in EONS! The steak was incredible! Juicy, tender... perfect might not be too strong of a word lol. The sweet corn was also incredible.\n\nThis place is fantastic. It's not a cheap dinner, but it's well worth the price of admission. There's no way anybody could ever have a bland meal at this place. Will definitely be returning!!
