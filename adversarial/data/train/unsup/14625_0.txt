While checking out the area for an upcoming event I stumbled upon the first location of La Gourmandine. I had no trouble parking and was pleasantly surprised to find it open on a Sunday morning.\n\nI went in and like its sister shop over in Mt Lebanon, the layout is virtually the same. They are noted for their flaky almond pastries which I have had before. That alone is my number one recommendation! However, since I have had it twice I decided to try something different. So I asked the lady about some of the new items they had. One was called Clafoutis which is made out of bread pudding and stuffed with cherries. The other was lime Bavarian cream with raspberry. I ordered both since they told me I could store the Clafoutis in my refrigerator for one day.\n\nThey served my lime Bavarian cream on an actual plate with a fork. They also have a few tables where you can sit and eat. Again, they offer sandwiches as well as coffee or tea. You can also order cakes or pastries in advance. The staff was very helpful and explained everything to me.\n\nThat new lime Bavarian cream was delicious and not overly filling which was perfect for me!  I plan on eating the Clafoutis later but I'm sure since they recommended it to me, I know I won't be disappointed. When I had finished eating my dessert I placed it to the left of the cash register which I was told was fine so they could take it away.\n\nThis place is easy to miss while you are driving down Butler St but again the place fills up very quickly since it is a popular place for sandwiches and French pastries.\n\nI did ask if they were planning to add any other locations at the moment and was told they aren't. Either way if you visit this location or the one in Mt. Lebanon you will get exceptional service and some of the best Parisian desserts you can imagine.
