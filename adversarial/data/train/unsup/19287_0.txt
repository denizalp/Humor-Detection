Without Yelp, we would've never found this place. It's pretty tucked away. I didn't see a parking lot so we parked on the street about a block away. Coming from the Wexford area, it took about 40-45 mins because of traffic and detours. You Pittsburghers have some crazy streets (especially through downtown). \n\nGot there, we didn't make reservations, and sat in the bar area. The lady that took care of us was friendly. I ordered the pork rib chop and my friend ordered the lamb gnocchi. My chop was accompanied by brussels sprouts and gnocchi. The pork chop was a tad overdone - it was a little tough. The brussels sprouts were good but I didn't expect them to be thinly sliced\/shredded. I have never had gnocchi until that night. I don't know how I feel about it yet. However, my friend says that's what good gnocchi is suppose to be like. Not chewy or rubbery. I guess I'll have to trust her judgement! \n\nThey had a full bar but they could use a bigger wine list.\n\nI would like to come back to this place when we're not in a time crunch and let you guys know.
