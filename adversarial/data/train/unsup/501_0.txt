I love the quiet atmosphere here and how they would play kpop in the background (I think it was kpop). The servers are also nice and welcoming and they would sometimes talk to you while you wait for your takeout. Took 2 stars off because the quality of my sushi... it wasn't that great. The rice were falling off or the seaweed would fall apart. It was hard for me to eat so I had to use my hand instead of my chopsticks. I hope that doesn't happen again when I come back. Overall, I love the customer service and how the place is designed!
