NEVER AGAIN....\n\nI went here a few weeks back with friends who know the owners and kind of call this place their's....now I have a wonderful time with my friends and was even treaded to my meal, but if I had to pay I would have screamed.\n\nThe only thing that was good was the wine...and they didn't make it (eek!)\n\nEach item is a-la-cart and the sides are served up family style almost.  I had the Shrimp with chorizo  on a polenta bed.  I had the massed potatoes as the side because the waitress talked me into them....cause they were SOOOO good.....not in my books.....the whole meal was lacking in taste and substance for the price.  The potatoes tasted like a box, the chorizo was chewy and over cooked and the polenta was hard to cut....I thought polenta was to be creamy.  My friend steak was cooked from frozen and tough to eat.  He also ordered it with no onions, but it came with no mushrooms.\n\nFor after dinner my buddies ordered Espresso...I'm not a fan, so I just watched as they went through 2 rounds of sending it back and it was still crap!
