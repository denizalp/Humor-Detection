Can't say enough about this place. We had brunch there on Sunday and you get SO much MORE than you pay for!! From the service to the food and drinks. Bottomless mimosas with more flavor selections than I knew were possible and bottomless FOOD!!! Who does that ? And all great tasting and good quality! I want to go back to vegas just for their brunch and all that for less than you would pay for breakfast and one drink anywhere else!!! Highlight of my trip.
