Greek done GREAT!!  From start to finish, this little local joint was an absolute delight offering a step up from the gyro\/fries segment making for a delicious, slightly more than casual evening.  \n\nThe \"Grilled Octopus\" was my primary reason for coming and it totally delivered!  The super tender, tentacles with the addition of EVOO, red onion and red wine vinegar was superb.  I made an oath around the 3rd bite to order it every single time I go here.    \n\n\"Roasted Feta\" featuring a block of oven baked cheese over tomato and hot serrano peppers arrived sizzling on a skillet and was a total cheesegasm.  I had no idea feta could be prepared like this as it was kind of like a tender, more robust paneer.  The pan fried zucchini known as \"Kolokythakia\" lived up to the Yelp hype; luxurious veggie chips with a cool, thick tzatziki yogurt dip were addictive as hell and all magically disappeared.  \n\nThere were many other starters we considered including the saganaki (fried cheese), calamari, and the mussels.  We almost opted for a six starter, no entr√©e meal, but so glad we didn't!  That's because missing out on sharing the whole grilled seabass would have been a goddamn shame.  Wonderfully grilled, simply seasoned and then drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice let that beautiful fishy flesh shine; fantastic for $30!  Yet another solid spot in SW Vegas!!!!!\n\n4.58888888 stars
