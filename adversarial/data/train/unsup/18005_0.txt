This place definitely seemed like they were going for a high-end feel. \n\nI came here for dim sum with the family and was impressed by the selection as well as the quality of the dishes. I did not see the bill but I am confident that it was very pricey compared to other dim sum joints in town.\n\nI personally feel that the environment did not feel very \"classy\" as compared to the mansion house 2 minutes away. It was a wide open space with round tables like your typical yum cha restaurant. \n\nService was mediocre and we had to wait a sold 15-20 minute before being seated.
