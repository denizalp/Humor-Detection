Showed up with 10 people for drinks and dessert.\n\nI had a look at their menu and it looked like that had something for everyones taste.\n\nTheir dessert menus is pretty fancy. I did not have any dessert, but a few people ordered some stuff, and it all looked so yummy.\n\nThe service was alright. The waitresses kept a good eye on us, and were quick to bring us our orders.\n\nDefinitely a quality resto.
