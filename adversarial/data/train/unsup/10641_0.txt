Alright. I feel awkward leaving a review for a strip club, but NO SHAME. It was a crazy Vegas trip and some of my girl friends and guy friends were wired after clubbing and we wanted to go all out, and of course. For the girls, we wanted to check out our first strip club, and what better place to check one out than sin city.\n\nKeep in mind it is 5-6am on a Tuesday night. So alright, maybe it just wasn't their night but seriously a horrible experience. Like...I CAN'T EVEN. I'm hoping not all strip clubs are like this because talk about a massive turn OFF.\n\nMy friend got us a promoter to get us a limo ride there but not back, seriously? The place seemed old school and the strippers...not that cute. Sorry. It was entertaining at first, but then this one girl totally had to ruin the night. Her name was Alessandra, watch out for her. She tried to scam me for my money and my friend and we only got our money back because my friend complained to the manager. A lap dance is $20 not $30. This lying b*tch...then she took my friends $25 which he paid for a lap dance for our friend, didn't give the lap dance and went away with the money! Talk about shade!! Save your money. Seriously. Go somewhere nicer. You won't regret it.
