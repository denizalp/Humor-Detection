Came here twice for the KBBQ\nThe design of the store is nice, the staffs are friendly and the place is clean.\n\nThey changed the menu the second time i came, so they no longer have the BBQ sets. You have to order each meat individually now. It comes with some vegetables and side dishes. Rice has to be ordered separately. The quality of the meat is good. The type of KBBQ grill they have is unique. The server cooked the meat for us.\n\nService: Excellent\nFood: Good\nPrice: on the pricier side for kbbq
