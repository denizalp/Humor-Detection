Disorganized.\n\nI booked an 8:40 am flight home from Vegas.  I know, what was I thinking.  It was peer pressure!\n\nI've never flown with Southwest before.  I didn't know about the open seating.  This combined with them delaying boarding the plane until 8:30 made for a big mess.  There seemed to be no carry on bag restrictions.  I saw people with full on trunk sized suit cases trying to jam them into the overhead bins.  Meanwhile my bag is being jammed and crushed into who knows what.   \n\nDue to a mechanical issue we had to de-board and change planes.  Don't get me wrong I am thankful they caught the issue before take off.  I don't even want to think about the alternatives.  But the way it was handled was messy and frustrating especially for a person that's been up for +24 hrs.  I heard one of the staff announce over the PA system to another waiting flight that they \"didn't know when or if they would be making it to Pasadena today.\"  WTF!?! \n\nWe finally get on the replacement plane and make it to our destination safe and sound.  That's all you can ask for.  But I will definitely think twice before booking with SW again.  My sanity is worth the extra 20-30 dollars.
