Took Amber's class for the first time today and let me please tell you , bring your A game cos this little lady means business. The music was loud the class was hot and the workout intense, better lace your boots up for this one. When I dismounted that bike and walked out of class I thought I had been in a bar fight. Only 45 minutes but that's how it's done, yeah c'mon! It's all happening at FSY, come an git yer Amber Slammer!!
