I purchased a Groupon ($45 for two dinner entrees and a 12oz carafe of wine) for this place and decided it give it a try.  We arrived on a Monday night without reservations, and were promptly seated.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the Cioppino, and my sweetie had the Diver Scallops. My Cioppino was delicious!  Lots of seafood, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The Diver Scallops were wonderful and super tender. Overall: good food, good service. Thanks Groupon!
