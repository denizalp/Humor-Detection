I have had one of the best experiences ever dealing with Jeffrey as my new insurance agent. When I was switched over to him from another agent about a year ago I had a sit-down consultation with him. At this time he explained to me that I had a lot of coverage that wasn't necessary for the average driver. Apparently I was sold a lot of covers that was not needed. That was a great beginning to our business relationship. He helped me save a lot of money. \n\nThen my next experience dealing with him was the other night when I got in an accident. It was late at night however Jeffrey was still available to answer my phone calls and answer all of my questions. This was a great relief considering the situation. I have to say I really appreciate all the help I received in that matter.\n\nIt is because of the continuous excellence in customer service that I am writing this review. Thank you for all your help.
