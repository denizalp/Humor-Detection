You know when you spot your seat on a plane to notice that your seatmate is spilling over into yours with love handles, and you know from then on that the experience of building your own protective hot pocket corner of a space you're about to embark on is something you should mentally, emotionally, and physically prepare for? That's the situation here, possibly including said sprawling love handles. You approach it, you know what you're getting in the 6 table space: long waits and tight squeezes. So, the reviews mentioning these two things come from just not taking notice of these facts before kicking off an adorable and delicious meal. \n\nI don't take The Best Brunch title seriously, and I'm not out to competitively eat finding the title winner. I take this place seriously though, as serious as they take baked french toast and peameal bacon. If I want meat + bread + butter, it's this. Don't mind if I do, you adorable french grandmother I've always wanted.
