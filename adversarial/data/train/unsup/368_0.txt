Extremely disappointed with this place....after 3 yrs of being a loyal customer I was told at their cold meats counter \" sorry dude just cleaned the meat slicer\" meaning he would not cut some ham I was seeking as it was near to closing time..... That's fine..... You've just lost a customer... Keep up the great attitude and loose some more why don't you!
