Wilbur Square Park is the perfect place to relax after cruising around the little boutiques and caf√©s on Nevada Highway in downtown Boulder City. It's located at the beginning of a residential area near the Bureau of Reclamation Lower Colorado Region, which is a huge building, so it's hard to miss. \n\nThe park itself is beautiful. It's not hard to tell that the park is well kept. It's very clean and there isn't a brown patch of grass in sight. Wilbur Square Park is mainly grass, big trees, and a little bit of paved sidewalk running through the middle of it. There are a few benches scattered throughout the park for people to relax and enjoy the breeze. One thing I noticed though, is that there aren't any trash cans here. I had to take our trash with us and throw it away elsewhere. If there was a trash can, I didn't see it. Also, I'm not sure if there are any restrooms here. I didn't notice any. Parking is available along the outskirts of the park. We parked along the curb!\n\nOverall, this is a nice park for everyone to enjoy... A good place to just stop and take it all in. The best thing about this park is that it's extremely pet friendly! My fur baby loved Wilbur Square Park! We will definitely be back!
