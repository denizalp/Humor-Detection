I was here with my husband.  We order a banh cuon ( rice roll plater), after 20 min later, one of the waitress came back  and told us that they don't have it ready to serve although it's on the menu.  She recommended to order pho instead.  We thought that we should try it anyway but there isnt any flavor at all. We regret to come here.  They re very unprofessional and their service was suck. I will not come back here or recommend anyone to try it.  Horrible!  \n\nP.S they even over charged us! But we caught it.
