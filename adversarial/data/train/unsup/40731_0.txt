Eh.  It was okay.  I suppose.  Our waitress was overly helpful and kinda in your face nosey, which I really, really don't like.  My food was good enough.  I got the grilled chicken breast sandwich with onion rings (really thick but pretty tasty)My sister got the white pizza and was very pleased with it and said she'd get it again.\n\nOur overall impression on our first trip To Frankie and Louie's on a Sunday after church, was the food was okay, the service left much to be desired and I thought the pricing was a little high for the offerings.  I might try it again if going with a group, but doubt I'd dine in again alone.
