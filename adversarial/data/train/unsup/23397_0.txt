Blue Man Group\n\nMy Vegas trips are filled with many things to do and many friends to see! But I don't ever get a chance to watch a show! I always saw floor to ceiling high ads and billboards all over Vegas promoting the Blue Man Group so I thought maybe this would be a pretty exciting show to watch! You see ads for this as soon as u get out the airport! Lol It wasn't much of a stretch that I was anticipating my first show in Vegas. \nBoy was I wrong! This was DEFINITELY the worst show I've ever seen in my life and I'm not joking! I'm from NYC. I've seen shows in NY which were all great and in Miami I've seen 2 Cirque De Soleil shows which were also mesmerizing! Unfortunately, this show really disappointed me in many ways. Point blank: the acts were cheesy and could have been executed better. I will most definitely stick to watching a Cirque De Soleil show next time in Vegas. Do not waste your money! Otherwise, if you're getting free tickets then go for it (but beware)!
