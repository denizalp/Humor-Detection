Kenyetta helped me pick out a new phone on Sunday.  I reeeeeally do not like change and it took me a LOT of time to pick out a phone and finally give the \"ok\" but she patiently spent as much time with me as I needed.  Now that I've had my phone for two days and am getting used to it, (ok, texting is still a huge pia since I can't walk and text on my touch-screen phone,) but now that I see I can take videos of my dog and post them to Facebook and Instagram I am in love.  The array of cases the store had were blech- so ugly for the most part.  I don't care if my boyfriend thinks I'm 12 because I like sparkly cases that is what I like!  So besides the lack of cute cases all the time Kenyetta spent with me was amazing.  She not once tried to rush me into a phone I didn't want or push me out of my plan into anything I didn't want.  I had never seen her at this store the other times I went but I hope she is there next time I go.
