The should've torn down the old Sahara, rather than just painting the building and naming it the SLS. The parking lot was extremely old (Same shitty 50 year old Sahara parking structure) dingy and scary. Ghetto thugs walking around and no security to be seen. A dirty, vomit smelling elevator ride downstairs lands you right where you would enter in the old Sahara. What a foreboding disappointment. \n\nInside, the casino is boring, the workers are incredibly rude, and even the waitresses and restaurant servers have an attitude or don't seem to give a shit about you, me or anyone else. If you want upscale - go elsewhere. This isn't the place. If you want cheap and casual, again, this isn't the place. If you want a miserable, overpriced, aggravating disgusting experience - then by all means, go to the SLS Las Vegas. \n\nHey SLS employees! Go fuck yourselves. The rest of the strip has far better workers and a lot better hotels, and better, more exciting and fun casinos. Gone are the days of giving bad service and bad attitude without anyone finding out about it. Thank Yelp for that. \n\nYou lost my business forever. \n\nNo soup for you! My actual rating is 0 stars.
