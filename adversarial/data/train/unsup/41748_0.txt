My masseuse was INCREDIBLE!!!  (he was male, forgot his name though).. deep tissue & really went to town on my back\/neck. All my knots & pains are gone! Highly recommend this place.! I will be back when I'm in town. (& I know great foot spas. I'm from the San Gabriel valley. Enough said. Lol).. Soo happy I came here and instead of Hakkasan..haha. Worth it!!!
