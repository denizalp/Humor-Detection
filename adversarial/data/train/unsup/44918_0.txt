Mad House Coffee is my go-to spot in the mornings for good reason. The coffee, tea and food are amazing! The employees are always super nice and quick! This morning I really wanted ketchup with my bagel, egg and sausage sandwich but they didn't have packets. The gal who was waiting on me was so sweet, she filled up a little cup with ketchup and put it in a plastic container. Made my morning!!!! She deserves a raise!!
