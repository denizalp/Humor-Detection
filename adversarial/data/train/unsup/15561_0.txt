It has been a decade or more since I have eaten at a Steak n Shake, back when I called Seattle and the Northwest home. It was great to find out that there is locations in Las Vegas. The restaurant here at South Point is that of a 50's style diner where they even play music from that era too. We were seated in a booth by the hostess and ordered table side where the server takes our order and brings the food to the table. \n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful at taking our order. She wrote our order down on a little white note pad it is nice to see they do order taking here old school. We ordered the western bacon burger and the double bacon burger for our main entree. The cheese fries sounded so good with our strawberry and Oreo shake so we had them too!\n\nThe cheeseburgers here were really good and all cooked to well done. The bbq sauce on the western bacon burger was exceptional good since I also requested pickles on the burger to which made it even better. It gave this burger a sweet and tangy sort of taste. The Oreo shake was really good once it melted a little since both this one and the strawberry were really thick. I did love that the Oreo shake had larger pieces inside of the shake of the Oreo cookies themselves. The appetizer of the cheese fries I did not really care for since they used liquid cheese type paste that was hard. Aside from that the twins liked the cheese fries, was just not for me. The music keeps the good times going here while the ice cream offerings will keep you real cool!
