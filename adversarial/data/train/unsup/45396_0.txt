I was glad to see one of the better Santa Monica Mexican restaurants in the Mandalay, where I was \"stuck\" for several days on business. \n\nThe restaurant has both indoor and exterior seating and after being in the smoking, dated Mandalay, I was super happy to enjoy 3 lunches at Border Grill. \n\nAs with every Border Grill lunch or dinner, complimentary house made chips and sals are rolled out. We shared the guacamole which is every bit as good as good as the SaMo location. There is a lunch special ahi tacos on the menu which sounded good, but I really wanted a light salad. I asked if they could take the ahi and substitute for the the steak on their normal steak salad. This, with a light vinaigrette made for a very refreshing and light meal. \n\nI love the flexibility! Great service in Vegas!
