I had never heard of OnTrac until I had an order from Amazon delivered by them today. It looks like I'm not the first problem to have a problem with OnTrac. My item was delivered on one of the stormiest days of the season with rain pouring down and wind gusts up to 50mph. I was apparently not home when this package was delivered and it was left near my front door in the pouring rain. I don't have a porch and they could have possibly put it in my mail slot, but didn't. It was just on the ground in what was somewhat of a shallow puddle due to the downpours all day. I found it 1-1.5 hours after Amazon said it was delivered and the cardboard packaging was soaked on the outside and water was starting to seep into the inner portion of the cardboard. Thankfully, my bluetooth headset packaging wasn't soaked yet. \nI called the Customer Service number listed online and submitted a complaint, but I'm not sure anything will be done. The customer service rep was nice, but she did indicate that since the package didn't have to be signed for, it was ok to leave. I told her that it would have been common sense not to leave package in direct downpours on a day such as this. Get a clue, delivery people! You don't put a cardboard package on the wet ground out in the open when it's raining. Hello!!! Perhaps it would be wise to supply the drivers with plastic bags to put items in.\n\nI posted comments similar to this on OnTrac's Facebook page and they were deleted. I guess they don't want people to know the truth.
