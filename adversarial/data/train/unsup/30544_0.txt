I feel guilty that I don't get what all the hype is about.  \n\nSure, the service is professional and courteous.  Yes, the linens are extra nice.  The grounds are pretty, yada yada yada.  I just don't get the hype, and  guess that's because I've had equally nice things from other hotels such as the J.W. Marriott line and Hyatt.  \n\nI spent 4 nights on per diem and the weather could not have sucked more.  We were putting in some long days, but to make matters worse, the weather was so cold that it was not inviting to go outside.  The most beautiful day, by far, was on Wednesday when it snowed.  We left the airport early (just as it started to come down), and found that as we got closer to the lake, the snowfall was getting heavier and heavier.  Once I made it back to the hotel, I opened all the curtains so I could see all the snow falling on the lake and sidewalks.  It was very pretty and totally out of nowhere.  Who would've guessed that much snow would fall on VEGAS?!?\n\nI did have the chance to check out their fitness center and spa on Sunday and have to say that they are both unbelievable.  The fitness center isn't as nice as their Marina del Ray location, but it still beats some, if not most, hotels.  The spa was fantastic; I got the place to myself and used the jacuzzi, the small indoor pool, steam room and relaxation room.  \n\nThe lobby bar has a great menu of drinks.  I got something with some crushed basil in it and while it was totally different, it was actually very good.  \n\nThere is a self parking garage adjacent to the hotel, and the parking there is no charge.  It's about a 20 min drive to the airport and 25 min drive to the 215 and Las Vegas Blvd.  \n\nWould I stay here again?  Sure, why not, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make sure i had a reservation there.
