I had to make a yelp account just because of the terrible food. There is no way this place has the rating it does. It's 100% inflated. I got boiled ribs with spices thrown on them. Unsweetened tea that tastes like well water with ice, and even after adding cane sugar made it 100x worse. The only redeeming thing was the salad I had, and even that is pushing it. I'm debating at this moment to make myself vomit due to how terrible it was. Someone else was paying, but I suffered to show appreciation for the meal. I understand it's a truck diner, but god damn. I've been too hole in the walls, but never a back alley shit hole. \n\n0\/0 would not feed to my dog.
