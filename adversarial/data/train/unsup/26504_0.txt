I am without a doubt blown away by Bonnie and her talents. My husband celebrated a big birthday and I asked if AZ Cake Shoppe would make two different cakes for his celebration. One word: \"WOW\"!!! Not only were the cakes beautiful, but absolutely delicious. The price was very fair and so worth it. I cannot recommend this business enough and have given several business cards out to my friends and family. Bonnie and her daughter run this bakery and are very kind and professional; everything from the great communication to the box the cakes are placed in when picked up are perfect! It's all perfect! I cannot thank Bonnie enough. I am definitely not the type of person to recommend everyone's product unless I'm blown away... in this case I am. Thank you again!!!
