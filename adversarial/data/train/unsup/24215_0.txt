No joke if you are looking for some delicious and might I shockingly add authentic Mexican food, than look no further than this unassuming gem located in the food court at Paradise Valley Mall. \n\nI ordered the sopes al pastor and they were as good as I would get at my favorite little stand in San Jose del Cabo. The sopes were perfectly prepared, and the al pastor was some of the best I have ever had; juicy and falvorful, and all for $6.99. The rest of their menu looked delicious and I frankly can't wait to come back and try more!\n\nThey offer a selection of free salsas and chips, I am a fan of the avocado salsa, and I really loved that they offered a few super spicy options (beware, they are pretty spicy) as well as roasted jalapenos and pickled carrots and onions! \n\n100% worth the 5 stars and truly highly recommended!
