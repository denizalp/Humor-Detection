When ordering from the Value menu, one can not expect perfection. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find my Hot-n-Spicy McChicken was actually hot (temperature wise, too) and fresh tasting (I know it wasn't freshly prepared (too quick)).  Great job, Ronald.\n\nHowever, the 2 staff members that I dealt with seemed bored with what was going on, and while courteous, it was mechanical on their parts. So, that costs 'em a star.\n\nNow, based on some of the other reviews, I'm surprised to see such low marks for this place. But, my experience through the drive through went pretty well.
