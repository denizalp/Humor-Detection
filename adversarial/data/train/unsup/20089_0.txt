Ok this place conflicts me so much...\n\nMe and the bf went here one night and I was conflicted if i liked the place or not lol, I ordered the bone in parmesan chicken wings with fries and a drink. I must say I love how big the chicken wings are and the way they fry them is delicious but i wasn't a fan of how they do the parmesan they just sprinkle it on so half of the wings were just plan because the parmesan wasn't sticking to it. I usually go to wing stop and i love the way the do there parmesan wings its more like a sauce rather then just throwing it on so if chicken bonz had wingstops parmesan sauce they would have been alot better. I'm not a fan of their fries either there thin and tasteless. \n\nI thought this place was ok and its a bit pricey I'm not sure if I would return here I might just stick with my wing stop and call it a day.
