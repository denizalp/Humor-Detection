I've been here three times now...and every time has been a 5 star experience. I am in love with my gel manicures that Christy does for me (with bling and studs).  Actually, I'm quite in love with Christy and the other gals who work there. Everyone is super friendly and I feel very much at ease there. Never rushed, Christy always spends as much time as she needs on me. Even as I hmm and huuuh over the color(s) I want or where I want the rhinestones or studs!  She's super patient, very artistic, and HILARIOUS!  She's always on time, and everyone there has super cute nails so if you walk in having no idea what you want on your nails, just look around!  The possibilities are endless. :) I'm very pleased at the cleanliness of the place...they're highly organized, keep your information on file...and for a non-cash carrier such as myself, they allow you to pay with a credit\/debit card and you can add the tip right on!  Super convenient.  On top of the gel manicures, Christy gives the BEST pedicures. I live in vegas and wear flip flops about 364 days out of the year. That can lead to some preeeety dry feet. After my first pedicure with her, my feet were so soft...I really couldn't stop talking about how amazed I was with the results. It was truly quite epic. Anyways, I know there are nail shops on every single corner in vegas...but this place is worth the drive. I love in Summerlin and probably drive pass up 50+ shops that are closer just to come here.  Love it love it.
