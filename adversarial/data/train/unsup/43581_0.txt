My wife and I visited the Chandler location for dinner.  We found the food delicious and the restaurant very helpful in accommodating our dietary requirements.  Staff was professional and friendly.  There was so much to sample on their menu that was tempting.  Very tasty grilled cheese sandwiches and soups.  The Pear martini was addicting.  We would go back for more at the first opportunity to sample other dishes.  Highly recommend this place!
