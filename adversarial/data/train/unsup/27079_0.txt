Recently as we do here in Arizona experience an issue with our a\/c unit. I had known of honest air from a customer of mine so they were my first call. What a great first call it was! We recently bought this house. The unit was replaced two years ago but was our baby. I talked with Jeff and they promptly came out. Turns out there was a leak in the handler coil. Without a second though he offered to replace it under factory warranty. I did not expect him to even offer that. It was not there install and was willing to pay for the repair. He got the part covered and we paid the labor. That in itself was a mind blowing deal. He could have easily charged us but did this immediately showing us the integrity of the company. Things were good but again the unit started blowing warm again. Figured here we go we got a lemon if a unit. They had told us that the unit was too small for the house in the beginning so with another issue we were ready to step up and upgrade. He sent a tech out very quickly I might add. They found the outside condenser coil was leaking. He then told me that he was going to replace it no charge at all. Again that was not his responsibility and not even the company's install but he felt bad for us that we had two issues that really doesn't happen. I again was blown away. Being this was the first experience with this company I just can't go without giving them the best of reviews. Very professional folks! I am glad I had the recommendation from a customer of mine and will never use anyone else when the unit fails me. We still are thinking of upgrading but he told me the unit was like new again and to spend the money in new windows instead. As you can see they had a perfect opportunity to sell us a new unit but obviously integrity comes first with this company. They are local and should be everyone's first call! Thanks again Jeff for a job well done!
