Went at noon and  the entire restaurant was empty.  Place looked deserted, but we were greeted rather quickly by a nice woman who showed us to our seat. \n\nI ordered spicy orange chicken. It came out  quickly, but that's kind of expected when there's no other patrons. The food was extremely bland.  In fact, I ate only 3 bites and couldn't bring myself to eat anymore. \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be recommending this place to anyone anytime soon.
