My boyfriend and I were exhausted on our last day in Vegas and I was getting HANGRY. Everywhere that sounded good was too far and my poor feet were too tired. As we sat at Paris trying to decide where to eat, my boyfriend found this place on Yelp and said that prime rib sounded good. I had actually bookmarked this place previously for their steak and eggs - so off we went! \n\nThis place is off the strip, but literally just the street behind Paris\/Bally. Not too far at all. As we were walking other pedestrians were headed that way as well. The area definitely looked a little sketchy, so I probably wouldn't walk there too late at night. It was around 5pm so still plenty of sun. \n\nThe place is pretty small for a \"casino\" - the parking lot is in the front - but we were there just to eat anyway. The restaurant is straight back and to the left when you enter. \n\nThe restaurant was busy! I took this as a good sign. Seems like a lot of locals, but also people who discovered this place from Yelp. We decided to share the prime rib special which came with a salad, prime rib, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a pint of beer. We don't drink so we asked our waiter if we could substitute it for something else - she said root beer - which we don't like either. She said \"that's the special - take it or leave it\" so we just opted out. Would've been nice if we could just have Sprite or Coke, but oh well. Still a fair deal. The menu said to \"ask your server about the double cut\" so we ended up getting that. And BOY did we f--- up hahahah. \n\nSo as we're waiting for our food, the table next to us gets theirs. The gentleman gets a HUGE slice of prime rib, and we're thinking - \"that must be the double cut.\" Then the waiter comes over and says, \"see, that's the regular size.\" OHH. if we had known the regular was THAT big, we wouldn't of got the double cut. Hahah oh well - when in Vegas...\n\nThe salad was a standard green salad and we got ranch. Lettuce was clean and cold, croutons were crunchy - what else can you ask for. \n\nWhen the prime rib came it WAS huge and every one stared at us lmao. After we took the necessary yelp\/Instagram pictures, we dove in! The meat was juicy and flavorful - I expect if we got the regular size it would've been more tender, but it was still good! Mashed potatoes and gravy were tasty and green beans were good. They were fresh green beans too, not the weird grey canned kind. \n\nOverall, very funny experience and tasty. I would return because everything is priced very reasonably and it's only a short distance from the strip! If you're looking for a local spot, try this!
