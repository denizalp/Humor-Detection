I called for a quote on a 2 piece suit; the man said $11. \n\nI dropped off the items half an hour later; he charged me $12. \n\nHe asked me to pay cash since he gets charged a cc fee. I would have preferred to pay with credit as I get card points. \n\nMy items were ready for pick up the next day without any issues. \n\nDowngrading one star for the price discrepancy and not being able to use credit card.
