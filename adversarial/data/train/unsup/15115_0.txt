I was all set to come check this place out, I check Yelp for what's open now, it's 8:47am on a Sunday, I drive a few miles to get here, only to see the door displays their hours as 8-4 on Sunday but it's locked up tight.\n\nI'm no restaurant mogul, but that's crap service to not open your restaurant for business.
