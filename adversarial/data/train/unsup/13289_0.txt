Service was very good, very pleasant. Slow at times in terms of refilling bottomless brunch drinks but otherwise no complaints for the server or management. \n\nAs for my meal, different story. I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken Wrap and after pulling out a non-edible piece with bone\/joint on it I couldn't bring myself to try to finish the rest. \n\nOther times that I have been here it's usually for happy hour and I order the green chili Which is good, but very heavy FYI.
