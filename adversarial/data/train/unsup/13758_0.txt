Although this isn't in my regular rotation of 24 Hour Fitness locations, they do have a BodyPump class on Saturday Morning that I sometimes attend and it works well for that. This is an Active location which means its not the same size as other clubs, in this case it means that they don't have a swimming pool. basketball court. or spin room. Additionally, the locker rooms are pretty bare bones and this club definitely has an industrial feel to it. I do like the fact that they moved all of the clothing, accessories, and supplements out of the little store area at the front and turned that into a stretching area. \n\nAll in all, it's not the greatest location... but it's also not the worst 24 Hour Fitness I've ever been in. And, if you're just there to workout, and not worried about anything else, this is a good option.
