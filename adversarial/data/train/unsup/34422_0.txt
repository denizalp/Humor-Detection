It thought the cheese steak was great. Fries were above average and I do like the new style soda machine with a thousand options. \nOverall the place was clean and presentable. The open kitchen had a nice clean appearance. \nProblems... Cashier could've been a little more informative about their favorites, we told her it was our first visit and we struggled to get an answer on what was great there. We finally settled on the cheesesteak by default, not recommendation. \nI also bought two half sandwiches of the same thing and noticed that you get free fries with a full sandwich. Just figured she would recommend the free fries, especially since I hinted on it then just bought them. \nThey also have a promo for free fries for Yelp users but I didn't want to beg for free fries, so I just let it go.\nJust down the street is a brand new portillos which is basically the same concept on steroids. Going to a place like this I would've expected a smaller and more personalized experience which never happened. I would think they would be busier if they were a little more on point. \nOh... The ketchup seemed watery... Weird.
