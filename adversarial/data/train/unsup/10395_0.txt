I went to Dr. Caplan a few years ago and he told me that I had 11 cavaties.  I was devastated as I didnt have insurance and the fees were going to be extremely expensive.  He filled 4 of my cavaties.  He also said that I had to pay for a second X-ray because I waited a few Months between getting cavaties filled.  I questioned him about the cavaties because they did not show up on an xray.  I also was not comfortable with the way he answered my questions.  I felt that the way he answered my questions and concerns were condecending.  I decided to go to another dentist.  I told my new dentist about the other cavaties that needed to be filled.  The new dentist performed an X-ray and found that I had no cavaties.  I'll never know If the 4 cavaties I had filled by Dr. Caplan were actual but I've had many dental visits and xrays in the past several years and no dentist has identified the remaining 7 cavaties.
