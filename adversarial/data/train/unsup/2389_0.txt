YO, this was the weirdest and most uncomfortable eating experience OF MY LIFE. I'm not even ten seconds in the door and the restaurant manager makes a comment about how my boyfriend looks like he doesn't have any money and then he proceeds to GRAB MY HAND and LEAD ME to our table. So completely unprofessional and unwarranted! He lingered by our table and the table next to ours and made the whole experience awkward. The food was mediocre - the steak was fatty, the eggs were undercooked. Even if the food was awesome I would not come here again because of the manager. Everyone around seemed to blow it off but this was the most wildly unprofessional, awkward and invasive experience I've ever had and I will not be back.
