Stayed at THEHotel for a conference this past week. (A conference in Vegas - imagine that!)  And I can honestly say that I loved the modern\/contemporary decor - it made me feel more like I was staying in a very upscale hotel, which just happened to be attached to the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino. \n\nMy suite included a nice sized living\/working room - with separate large flat screen tv, nice \"bar\" area and plenty of comfortable seating - and a very generously sized bedroom for the king-sized bed... The bathroom was very generously sized as well - and had a nice small flat screen tv mounted so you could view it from the sink or the shower. (A nice touch!)\n\nThe conference was also in the hotel - on the fourth floor - and I found the conference rooms to be adequate - and the catering to be what you'd expect from a higher-end hotel. (We had a catered breakfast and lunch.) \n\nMy only complaint - I'm not a big fan of having to pay for high-speed internet access when you're already paying for an \"upscale\" hotel... The additional $15 charge for that service ($15 for 1 24h period of access) seemed a little \"nickle and diming\" to me...
