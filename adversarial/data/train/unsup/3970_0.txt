We came on a Saturday to celebrate a friends birthday, even though we called to reserve a table, we had to wait in line for 2 hours, the bouncers keep all the guys and girls that they feel are not attractive in line for hours to show the place is busy, and they only allow attractive girls inside. Bouncer keeps walking the line and asking people to pay him$20 so they don't need to wait in line, Management and staff are extremely rude. I will never go back.
