They do not do fake nails, of any kind. So if you need a fill don't bother. The website is deceiving, it allows you to pick the option of a gel set. I picked that option, and then good thing that I called before I went to ask the price or I would have gone all the way there for nothing! take that option off your website! apparently its been over a year since you offered gel nails! Disappointed...
