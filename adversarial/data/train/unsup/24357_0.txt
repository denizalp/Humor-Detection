As y'all can probably tell from my previous Tips & Photos, I've been anxiously awaiting the opening of Rolled Ice Cream.  So of course I was there on opening day (11\/28)...twice :D\n\nThe owner explained that he wanted to open on 11\/18 originally, but couldn't get everything together by then.  Even now, he doesn't have all the equipment, ingredients, & workers he needs.  So, if you're looking for a job.... \n\nI told him how we love doughnut ice cream sandwiches & tried to get him to partner up with Fractured Prune (few doors down).  But, he surprised me by saying he already planned on making doughnuts himself.  Nice!  Until then, I'll be getting doughnuts from Fractured Prune to add to my ice cream. \n\nExpect growing pains... the workers aren't as knowledgeable about the products yet & their ice cream making skills need improvement.  But, I'm sure they'll get there.  They just need practice.  So swing on by & let them practice on you!
