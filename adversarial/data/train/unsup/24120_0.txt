The young at heart couple who operates this place is really sweet. The lunch I ordered was delicious! The price was right too! The various \"Lunch Boxes\" run between $7-9.75. Great value for a quality home cooked meal. Note: The lunch specials are available EVERY DAY 11am-2:30pm \n\nYelped searched Korean BBQ, Henderson and Korean BBQ & Rolls is how I found this place. The reviews were valid and spot on. This gem has been hiding here in plain sight for almost a year now. Same address where M Sushi resides. Same strip mall with Weiss Deli, Trader Joes.\n\nIf you are expecting trendy fancy schmancy place and quasi celeb chefs, well, you'll be a little bit disappointed. This place is real simple, modestly furnished and run by a humble hardworking Korean couple who cooks up some good comfort food. Ready and eager to please. They remind me of grandpa and gramma who need a little prompting. (ie letting them know you are ready to check out)  So be patient especially if there are a few parties in the house. \n\nGot a warm welcome from Mr Lee. Before I even sat down, he said he was bringing out some Cream of Chicken soup that his wife made. Turned around  and off to back of the kitchen he went. So I made myself at home grabbed the two menus from the counter and picked out a table. He came back out with my drink order (No fountain drinks) and after he took my order he shouts out \"Ma!\" to his wife and passes along my order. This place is as old school home-style family run as you can get. I love it. \n\nCream of Chicken soup came presented piping hot and passes the comfort food taste test with flying colors. Yum yum! \n\nMy Galbi ribs came out sizzling hot. Literally! Sizzling on a cast iron plate!  http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/uGuAEuDSAf\/\nImpressive! Mrs. Lee even brought it out to me.The little dishes of  banchan also came with my order.\n\nI finished everything and was pretty full. Then Mr Lee brings out some Japche his wife made for me for me to try, then Mrs Lee came out with this dessert drink, then Mr. Lee appears with some Korean pancakes..omg...did I just say I was stuffed? LOL\n\nI truly appreciated their hospitality and the delicious food to boot. Definitely more lunch visits to come!
