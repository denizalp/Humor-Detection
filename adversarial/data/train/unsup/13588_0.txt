I can tell you right up front that the steak here was excellent, super tender and perfectly grilled and seasoned, but they lose a star for the tempura celery.  Who ever thought of such a thing?  \"What is this?\" I say to myself as I hold it delicately in front of myself with my chopsticks.  I turn it this way and that and then dip it into the sauce and pop it into my mouth and try to bite off a palatable chunk of it.  \"What the HELL is this?\" I gasp!  Tempura CELERY??  What the--\"  Minus one star for you!
