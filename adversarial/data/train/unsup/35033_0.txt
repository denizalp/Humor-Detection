Lunch time with co-workers. This is my second time here, there are not a lot of burger places around so this is like our go to place. There was only a few tables but as they state on their menu, we have to wait 20 minutes for the burger so it is not a place if you need a quick lunch. I got the Hickory stick burger - Hickory smoked BBQ sauce, caramelized onions and melted mozzarella and cheddar with sweet potato fries. The only other thing I expected was some hickory sticks on it to have some crunchy bite to it. The beef patty was very thick. At first, I thought I could finish it, but then as I was two thirds into the burger, was getting full and full. At the end, I just finished the patty and had to sacrifice the bread and some of the fries.
