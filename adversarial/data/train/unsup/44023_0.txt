This is what the first place that I ate at my visit to Montreal and I'm not disappointed. The staff was extremely friendly and the food was great. \n\nkeep in mind, it's not delicate French food, it's greasy heavy Portuguese food. If you like that, then you're in. The sausage and surf and turf is absolutely great. The portions are huge and you will not leave hungry. \n\nI love restaurants that give you free things too. We didn't order it, but they gave us free salads. Isn't that a nice touch?
