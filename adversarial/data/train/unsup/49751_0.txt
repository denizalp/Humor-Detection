What a pleasant surprise! I found this place on Groupon & couldn't pass up the price. With all the $200+ treatments on the Strip, it was refreshing to spend less than $50 for the same treatment.  This ended up being of the best massages I've ever had. Excellent deep tissue massage, very professional, relaxing and overall a wonderful experience. Highly recommended.
