My first review on Yelp. And I had to leave a review here.\nOh my holy God. The WORST of the WORST!\nIt was my first time at a thai-sh restaurant and I truly do wish I could write a happy, positive, 5star highly recommended kind of review but I can not and you will know why in 2 seconds.\nI found two pieces of tapes(LONG) inside the chicken noodle soup after having a couple bite. I first thought it was a piece of uncooked noodle because the texture was similar, but it was a piece of shittttt!!! Imagine what would have happened if I swallowed it by accident? Thinking of, 'oh this one piece is not cooked throughly, but its oki doki my stomach is strong enough to digest anythang' \nAnyways, I called the server A.J and he apologized sincerely along with a free dinner (we prolly ate about 15% of the dish)which really did stop me from calling the health department for a further investigation. Seriously I feel sick right now.
