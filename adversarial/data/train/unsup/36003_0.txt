I'd like to try this place again. They have a wide and unique menu, a good atmosphere, and the service was swell. I got the prosciutto chocolate chip waffles. Essentially some of my three favorite things put together. It was okay. I expected it to primarily be mixed in as bits. Everything (chocolate chips included) was literally just thrown on top which I found a bit strange. My friend got a crepe which I tried and it was quite good. While my own meal could've been better, I still think the place is worth going to and would like to try it again.
