So we came here for dinner and I started off with their Pinot Noir of course which was quite tasty... For our meal we ordered the Mac and cheese with lobster as well as the rib eye. The Mac and cheese was very creamy and delicious. It had a bit of a kick to it. The ribs were superrrrrr tender. \n\nMinus one star for the fact that its hard to locate. There's no huge sign or anything so its easy to miss. Its a really cute place for dinner or a date.
