The decor is reflective of The Malaysian tropics, island style. Wood accents throughout entire restaurant along with a foosball and pool table in the back. It's a warm casual ambience, laid back. All the employees are friendly and appear joyful which elevates the mood of the diners as well. The dishes lacked flavor and were average. The \"Roti Canai\" and curry items on the menu I believe were the standout stars! I didn't get the chance to try their whole fish or seafood items so I guess I have to come back! The stir fried noodles I ordered lacked flavor, I had to add more soy sauce. Overall, the menu has abundance of seafood items in which I hope I get to try later on.
