Linens and comforter weren't great quality. The mattress was hard. That being said, I would have given them a 3-star rating had it not been for the post-checkout issue. I called to ask if anyone in housekeeping had found a Kindle. Instead of checking, the operator referred me to a random website that had no brand affiliation to HIlton. I asked the operator if I could speak to someone directly about the lost item and she said no. Not cool.
