Living in San Jose with plenty of hole-in-the-walls and glamorized pho restaurants, I personally thought the food was legit at Viet Noodle Bar. \n\nPros\n\nService: My waiter was super nice and apologized many times about the wait times since it was a full house during New Years. \n\nPho Dac Biet: The broth, the most important component for pho was delicious and it hit the spot since Las Vegas during NYE week was cold AF.   \n\nMi Hai Vi: The dry egg noodles with seafood was delicious. I was happy that they had a sauce for their egg noodles versus just leaving it plain which I've experienced at other restaurants; however, the sauce was more on sweeter side. I also personally love their version of the thin egg noodles. \n\nPrices: All the entrees are reasonably priced and the portions were good. \n\nOverall great spot for Vietnamese grub that offers an assortment of Vietnamese entrees and not just noodle soups. I decided to give this place 5 instead of 4 stars because my boyfriend whose had his fair share of pho spots in Vegas mentioned this place was the best for pho.
