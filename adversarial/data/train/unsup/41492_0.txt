I am a loyal petco shopper but everytime i visit this location I have a bad experience. The store was a mess this last time and there was no help except for the person on the register.\n Customer service is terrible and the associates are rude. They called the GM over to help with a transaction because the cashier did not know how to work something and she was even more rude. I walked out without purchasing anything due to the lack of help and general courtesy. It's infuriating that Petco would let this keep happening. I will never shop here again and will be driving further just to avoid the Green Valley location.
