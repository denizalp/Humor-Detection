Totally amazing food. I had hamachi sashimi and the ahi stack (totally way more than 1 person should eat!). The hamachi was extremely fresh and had an amazing wasabi sauce on top. The ahi stack was a little spicier than I normally have, but soooooo yummy. I will be eating black rice from now on, and most of it here!!! Yummo.
