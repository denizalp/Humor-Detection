The event organizers should be prosecuted for this disaster. As everyone else said, the stupid wristbands they force you to get instead of using cash were a nightmare. Most people bought theirs online expecting to just cruise right in to gorge on some delicious tacos. NOPE. Here's a middle finger if you planned ahead. But if you decided to buy at the door you get right in. Makes tons of sense. We waited for over an hour, in the heat, with no shade, no water, and forced to huff amazing smoked carne. I've never felt this level of hangry. So thanks for that perspective. People were falling over from exhaustion and dehydration. Most just gave up after a while and left. I was more determined. We finally made it in and I felt relieved. Just find the nearest taco stand, get the blood glucose back up, fuel up on a couple margs, and forget the whole thing. I thought I was being smart when I loaded 40 bucks on my wristband... Once again the Salt River Staff revealed their sadism. The wristband wouldn't work. I went to three different vendors and they all said I had no money. Bull****. BULLSH**. One vendor informed me that many we're having malfunctioning wristbands and I would have to go wait in the reload line to sort it. Lol. F*** THAT. I was prepared to rampage and be sent to jail.. which probably would've been nicer. At least they would have shade and water. THIS IS THE WORST RUN FESTIVAL I HAVE EVER WITNESSED. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO SALT RIVER. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HELL IF YOU VALUE YOUR DIGNITY
