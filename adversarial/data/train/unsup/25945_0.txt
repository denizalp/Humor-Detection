My brother and I ate there at lunchtime for the very first time. The seating is not much to talk about but then again it is basically a fast food joint. I had the salad bowl that contained a little bit of everything and it was very very tasty. My brother had three soft tacos and he enjoyed them even though they were a little messy to handle. The food was nicely spaced and we left feeling like we had a very good lunch.
