I was on this side of town and since there aren't much boba tea shops in old henderson I decided to get some boba over here. What a mistake!\n\nI got a strawberry mango smoothie with boba and this smoothie tasted more like !WATER! than mango and strawberry. \nThey do have a good veriety of drinks but they just put too much ice in them.\n\nAlso the boba was tastless.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place sorry but no.
