We came stayed in June and got rainy weather.  This holiday inn is next to Chinatown and close to Norte Dame Cathedral. First we checkin at the 2nd floor before parking car in the garage and waited 30min before our room was ready. The lobby is pretty with gold fishes in the middle. Our room was huge on 8th floor with 2 King beds and view of roof top. Beds were excellent and tv was good too. It had a mini  refrigerator, coffee maker but no microwave. Starbucks is a block away and the food eateries were in Chinatown or mall several blocks away. I would come back here again.
