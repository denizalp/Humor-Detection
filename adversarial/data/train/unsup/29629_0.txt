We arrived at 11am to put our name in, this turned out to be the best time to arrive. We we're the first in line at the booth opposite to the doors. We we're told she was talking names for 11:40am then she gave us a beeper to let us know when to come back. Turns out the beeper works while you shop you just can't go too far. We ended up going to dynamite shopping then came back in time for 11:40am. We got brought into the actual front of the restaurant where we were told to wait for your name, we waited maybe 5 mins then we sat down. The service was great, food came out fast and was delicious! Our waitress was going on break at one point, she came over to let us know and to introduce us to the woman who was covering for her, that's never happened at a restaurant for me, usually they just disappear. 10 out of 10 would come back! Just like the ones in the states.
