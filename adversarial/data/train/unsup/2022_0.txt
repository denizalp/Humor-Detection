Me and my friend went here for a free trial class because I am debating on taking either jiu-jitsu or krav maga classes. You can tell that the trainers are experienced and know what they are doing. The owner even saw me struggling with a move and helped me out a little from behind the fence. \n\nHowever, I am completely inexperienced and the trainer knew this. At first he was very helpful, but when a girl who had done some wrestling in the past came to the class, suddenly me and my friend were second thoughts. Both of us were very inexperienced and just learning the moves and we were always paired together. Meanwhile the trainer pairs himself up with the wrestler and kinda forgets about us. I understand pairing people up with similar skill sets, but if the trainer is too busy wrestling to help us with a move we can't figure out, I don't know what the point is of going to the session. \n\nHowever, it was a good workout.\n\n\n\nI did end up going back to Impact MMA for a cardio kickboxing class and the classes were night and day! The teacher was super attentive and challenging and I ended up sweating more than I ever have from running, weight lifting, cycling, etc. AWESOME full body workout.
