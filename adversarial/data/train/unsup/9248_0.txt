I fear that this place is going to get out of hand very shortly.  Please people keep to Matt's Big Breakfast and Over Easy keep the crowds away.  \n\nOk Ok I can't be selfish but I wish I could this place is awesome.  \n\nEverything from the Japanese cold brew coffee to the espresso's to the amazing food.  I have had the pain perdu which is bannana bread french toast fresh bannanas sliced on top and a whiskey caramel sauce on top and the savory crepes with chicken and egg inside and a homemade sauce over the top.  Both dishes were AMAZING I will for sure go back just for those, but will have to try the rest of the menu first.  \n\nI am very greatful I have Monday and Tuesday's off to avoid the weekend crowds because I am sure they will be starting very soon.
