Very solid stadium!\n\nThe good....................\n- Inexpensive tickets.  SRO tickets for only $11.00.\n- Beautiful grounds!  I loved how clean everything was (bathroom excluded..see below)!  The walk up to the stadium was awesome!  They have practice fields and batting cages along the sides of the walkway.  Really, really nice!\n- Huge grass area to sit\/stand on.\n- Sun screen stations!  Yes, free sun screen stations.  How cool is that?  I didn't use any, but it is there for the taking.  Very smart move in this AZ sun!\n- Free parking.  Yeah, we parked a ways away near the stores, and had to walk, but it was free.\n- Solid food and beverage options.\n\nThe bad...................\n- Bathrooms were dirty as hell! Water all over the floor, paper towels and stuff like that.  The only bad part of the stadium that I can think of.\n\nOverall, I was impressed.  One of the nicer Spring Training stadiums I have been to.  It's a bit far from my house in Surprise, but I can definitely see myself heading back here to catch a game!
