The Chill Pop Shop truck visited my workplace yesterday and it was a hot day! So I eagerly bellied up to the Chill truck for a cool treat. \n\nI love that these popsicles are handmade, and that the flavors are so creative and unexpected! For example: lemon ricotta, cucumber kiwi, roasted peach, and strawberry balsamic to name a few. I had the raspberry lemonade and it was the perfect combo of sweet and tart, super refreshing!! I highly recommend you find this truck and try these pops. THEY ARE FABULOUS!!
