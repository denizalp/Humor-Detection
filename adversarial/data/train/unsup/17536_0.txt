Great place to hang out if you've got a group of people, like Meena mentioned. I wasn't drinking so it was nice to have something else to focus on other than gettin' crunk...\n\nWe started off playing some game where you have to flick a piece of wood into a hole (forget the name). When our fingers got sore, we moved on to bocce ball and shuffleboard, which was a hoot. We were lucky to be there when it wasn't too busy, so we were able to score both a bocce ball and shuffleboard lane without a reservation. One thing I noticed about the bocce ball lanes though, were that the sides at both ends were a little warped, which meant that all the balls would essentially land in the same place. I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're an avid bocce ball player. Hit up Fred Hamilton Park 5 minutes away if you're serious about the game. Nonetheless, it was really fun!\n\nThey have a small menu but allow you to bring your own food in, which I thought was pretty cool. Our group ended up at Bitondo's at the end of the night, but it's good to know there's the option. Bartenders were friendly (and cute!) and didn't charge me for my pop. I'll be back again for sure!
