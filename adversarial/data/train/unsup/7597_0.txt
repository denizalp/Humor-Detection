I vaguely remember grabbing a breakfast burrito here once, but it was sufficiently average to be unmemorable. I returned recently for lunch and got a chile verde pork super burrito. Burrito was decent, found it curious that a super burrito includes guac and sour cream but no cheese, which I will add on my next visit. The chile verde itself was solid with a bit of heat to it. Oddly, the green salsa has no spice whatsoever- but it's chunky and just slightly tart, rendering it especially tasty to me, even if it doesn't add the spice I'd been wanting. \n\nBonus points for having a drive-thru. Orders come out super quick. I placed my order via Eat24 from a few blocks away, expecting to wait, but it was ready when I rolled up just over five minutes later!
