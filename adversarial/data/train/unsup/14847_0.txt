These sweets are definitely original! Tracy takes classic desserts and puts her own little spin on them. Whether it's her signature pecan bacon brittle, or intriguing looking shoyu caramels, each sweet is carefully crafted for all to enjoy. \n\nI got a few baked goods, the ooey gooey cake and the red velvet ding dong, as well as a gift for someone out of town. Those baked goods looked so delectable! It was hard to resist getting some so I gave in to temptation. \n\nThe texture of both cakes for me was great. I liked the buttery flavor of the ooey gooey cake and the red velvety, chocolatey decadence of the ding dong. Both skewed too sweet for me though but those with a big sweet tooth will definitely appreciate these desserts.\n\nTracy is every bit as sweet as the desserts she makes! She was very kind and friendly and it was very nice chatting with her and her assistant.
