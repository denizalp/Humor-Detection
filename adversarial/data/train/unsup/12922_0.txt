I feel like such an asshole for never having been here before this week. A friend recommended it to me saying, \"it's kind of like Lux, but gayer and nicer\". Sounds good to me!\n\nThis place is so cute! There are few tables outside and even a little fire place. Inside feels spacious even though it's not a large place. The coffee is fine, nothing phenomenal but tasty enough. Everyone was friendly. \n\nTwo things that made me fall in love:\n$2 enormous iced teas\nFREE SOY MILK. Well, maybe not free...but I've never met a coffee shop that didn't charge half a dollar extra for soy. THIS IS AMAZING. I was so pleased when I ordered two medium sized iced white mochas with soy and my total was only $8 and some change. \n\nI wish I had come here sooner. I could have logged all those college study hours here rather then all those other lame soy charging snobby barista'd $5 for a microscopic small cup coffee shops. Ya know?\n\nI can't wait to try the hummus plate and their veggie sandwich!
