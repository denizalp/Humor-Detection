My friend and I went for a late brunch on Sunday. Our server Megan, even insisted we should try dessert after they had already closed. This goes to show they cared about the experience. Definitely had an European vibe, which, of course I welcome! \n\nEach time I  come here I have the fish Bouillon which is so delicious and uplifting. I did venture out and tried the Roasted Kale salad and that was amazing.  This place is absolutely a gem in Charlotte. A must try!
