Before dining I observe like a lead wolf scouting the best possible slot for the highly anticipated kill and feeding.    The choice was easy Since only one outlet was available and this wolf was at 3% battery and needs to get his Yelp on.  Interesting artwork in the dining room or as he locals call it \"kids room.\"   Food was fast and looked as if it as was made right from the picture.   They even offer the silverware in a \"take home\" option.  Brilliant.  I enjoyed this very much.  All I expected and more.   Hats of to the Chef Ronald and team!!!  \n\nEdit:  meal had a hash-brown but made the sacrifice of being eaten before the photo.  Someone had to,  I had to eat... :\/)
