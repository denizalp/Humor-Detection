Oh Brew, what to say about you?\n\nBrewhouse is either a complete shit show or completely dead. There is no in between. \n\nThursday's are Ladies Nights, which feature dollar long islands. A lot of the bartenders are inexperienced and the drinks taste like paint thinner from how strong they are, but good to get you buzzed. When my friends and I come, we are often the only people there about half an hour or more, when a few underage kids roll in.  \n\nI come here on most regularly on Fridays, for Latin night, which is something that sets Brew apart from other local bars. If enough people that the owner recognizes are Latino show up, the DJ plays merengue, bachata, reggaeton, and salsa. If not, standard Top 40. Or, advertises as Latin night, charges the 5-8 dollar cover for those under 21, and doesn't play any Latin music at all. \n\nAnd on these Fridays and Saturdays, you will swear that all hell has broken loose. More than once, I have smelled someone poop themselves. The whole bar is dank and sweaty. 18 year old girls drunkenly kiss men with visible wrinkles. Someone always pukes in the bathroom, often missing the toilet. The dance floor always looks like a middle school dance, where young girls and boys discover each other's bodies and how it feels good to rub body parts together. The lights aren't dim enough to hide the shame and cringeworthiness of it all, so if you're sober or over 21 (or both) it's truly an exercise in patience and sheer human will. \n\nGenerally, the staff is cold and hesitant to handle a problem. I'm not sure that I'd come here if they didn't play Latin music and\/or more of my friends were of legal drinking age.
