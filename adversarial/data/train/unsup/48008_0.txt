Subpar food, drinks, and service. Stopped in for a celebration dinner based on the good reviews, but everything was fairly disappointing. Cocktail tasted like something I mixed myself in college, mashed potatoes over salted, steak was meh. Everything was just meh. Server kept forgetting our menus and clearly wasn't too experienced. Maybe we're a little snobby because we're used to Philadelphia dining? We're not quite familiar with Pittsburgh dining. Just would not recommend this place though.
