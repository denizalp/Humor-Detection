I mainly walked Rue Sainte-Catherine after seeing photos on Instagram of the Pink Balls which is in the Montréal Gay Village during the summer season. Seeing all of the photos online of it, I knew I had to see it in person during my one day in Montréal. \n\nI was pretty dumb because I somehow thought it was a short distance from my hotel (man was i wrong) I was staying at Delta Montréal and it was a good 6 km round trip (granted I wandered a little to take photographs of the art on the side of streets and buildings). \n\nBesides being a long walk, the display of the pink balls over Rue Sainte-Catherine is really unique and picturesque. The only downside was I would get a lot of people walking up to me talking to me in French - which I do not speak. Therefore I sort of got a little paranoid while walking because I was by myself and do not speak French. \n\nI didn't see many souvenir shops unfortunately and only spotted one along the Rue. Most of the road further down after you pass Quartier Des Spectacles - you come to an area surrounded by bars mainly and some restaurants which was nice to see along the route. \n\nOverall, I'd say it's worth to see the Pink Balls - then I'd see if you could head to Quartier Des Spectacles to see some music or what not since that was where most people were when I was in Montréal  that day.
