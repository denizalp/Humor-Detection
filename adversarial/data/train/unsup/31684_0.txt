I would definitely return.  I loved the free cover for so many people through a site.  The d√©cor is pretty awesome.  We stayed and even went to the after hours! They also have concerts there so that was plus because it was free. The drinks were high but it's Vegas right?!  The dress code is cool because you don't see a bunch of people there with jeans but nicely dressed.
