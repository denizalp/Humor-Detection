This has been my default casino since I moved here 5 years ago. Its literally 5 minutes from home. Not sure why it has taken this long to write anything about it. Can't really give a report about it so I'll just do random notes. \n\n- My wife hasn't gambled here all that much in the past 2 years yet she still gets monthly coupon offers, free slot play\/pulls, the Palms tchotchkes when they give them out in summer like beach towels and travel bags and occasional offers for events like the World Championship of Ping Pong (I'm all over it!!). So its cool that Mr. Maloof really makes a great effort to reach out to the locals. \n\n- The Mint Lounge is my go to place to meet people for drinks in the casino area since there are almost always seats there and hotter bartenders. \n\n- After one late night, my buddy was too wasted at 7am to drive home to Aliante so he opted to sleep at one of the driving video game machines in the arcade til 4:30pm that afternoon. No one bothered to wake him up. So that's a cheaper alternative to getting a room fyi :) \n\n- The coin-op car wash on the 1st floor of the east side garage used to accept Chuck E Cheese tokens up until about a year ago. That was the best cheap carwash ever. I'm sure some Palms staff member has a happy kid with a gillion tokens for skeeball. \n\n- Brendan Theaters is in dire need of an update. \n\n- The Pearl is the best concert venue in Vegas. \n\n-Most of the Fantasy Tower suites are still great as are the 2 bedrooms at Palms Place. \n\n- The pool bar at Palms Place is an awesome spot to hang in the summer. Super chill.
