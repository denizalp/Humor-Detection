First of all i don't really understand why I was charged full price ($3.75) for a small chocolate cappuccino and given only half of a cup?! (see picture). I also don't see any reason to pay almost $3 for a cup of tea while you can get exactly the same one in Starbucks for $1.50\nEmployees were neither rude nor super friendly.  I would say kind of pretentious just like the rest of the clientele that come to this place. \nMy cranberry muffin was really fresh, tasty (and expensive ).
