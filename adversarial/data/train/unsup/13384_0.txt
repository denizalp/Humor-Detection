The Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated enjoys fishing. I know almost nothing about fishing. For the holidays, I decided to get him a gift certificate from Phoenix Fishing Supply.  I like to spend money locally instead of with big chains, and Phoenix Fishing happens to be within walking distance of my house.\nIn addition to the gift certificate, I wanted to buy a single lure. You know, so I'd have something more than a piece of paper to hand him.\nAs John K. mentioned in his review - there was the group of older guys (not employees) just hanging out near the front. The employees were all busy, so I was randomly looking at all the lures over several aisles. One of the older non employees offered his help - he spends so much time in this store he knows where everything is.\nHe seemed to like my sense of humor. I told him I was looking for a single lure (nothing too expensive) for the boyfriend. Didn't want to spend a lot, as I have no clue if it will ever be used - the real plan is the gift certificate - the lure is just a cute little add on. He asked what my boyfriend fishes for. \"BEER!\" (sounded a lot better than, \"hell if I know!\")\nWe settled on bass, and he guided me to that section.\nI felt like I was invading the boys club a bit - but not in an unwelcome sort of way. No rushing, no pressure - and if I do ever get into fishing, I have every confidence that everyone here (the staff AND the old boys club) would be happy to advise me and talk me through everything I need to know.\nI hope Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated invites me to join him when he's ready to use that certificate!
