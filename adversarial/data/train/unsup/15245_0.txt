I've seen Ka, Mystere, Dralion, Varakai, Zumanity, and O.  Of course, Zumanity is pretty cool cause you get to see tittays.  You don't get that in O.  Nevertheless, O is a wonderful experience.  O was hands down the best show.  Everything from the stage, to the story, to the music.   It's purely magical.  Unlike Mystere and Dralion that feel like a collection of street acts (which is at the heart of Cirque du Soleil), and Ka's floating stage which really felt like a gimmick, the use of water gave the entire show an ethereal feel, as if you're watching a dream come to life.
