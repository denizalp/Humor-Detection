Yay! I love when I discover a new business in a fave area. I had a meeting in Mississauga yesterday and one of the great people I was meeting with made mention that there was a new coffee shop just opened where Cafe Chocolata used to be (west of Mississauga Road along Lakeshore).\n\nI like this place, plain and simple. I wanted Free WiFi to do some work, a coffee made from good quality beans (or my signature Bap Bap Americano) and Guilty Dog delivered!\n\nThey use Reunion Island coffee\/espresso in all of their drinks (All of which are organic). In addition to the coffee, which I might ad was mild tasting but strong with only a slight bitter aftertaste, they also have an ornate glass door-ed cupboard filled with loose leaf tea options. \n\nAs the summer is approaching they are putting a focus on their Iced Teas (which I got to sample and was very happy with) but they also offer an equal (separate) collection of loose leaf teas for hot tea drinkers. \n\nThere isn't much of a selection of savory or lunch options but they've decide to focus more on coffee tea and desserts - which for my work day is fine by me.\n\nMy one little bugaboo is the fact that there is shortage of outlets for those of us seeking #power for our laptops (yes that hashtag is a J-bieber\/Will-I-AM reference). \n\nTheir WiFi password is the phone number.\n\nSip\/Work\/Play\n\nEatcrest Out!
