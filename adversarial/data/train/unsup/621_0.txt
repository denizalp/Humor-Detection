Ok, I like a lot of different types of pizza, so to say this is my favorite pizza in the world is hard to do. I have had a million pizza's in Italy, Chicago, New York, all the best pizza places. \n\nThis is my favorite pizza. And my favorite restaurant. DO NOT GO HERE ON A FIRST DATE. You have to love the one you're with. Because you have to be patient. You can't get out of it. You will spend 2 and a half to 5 hours with them. \n\nThe first time I went, I was not aware of the state of wait. So I drank at the amazingly cute bar next door. And drank. And drank. Drunk me shoved pizza topped with pistachios down my throat. Drunk me ranted and raved about how amazing the pizza was, but drunk me doubted my alcohol induced review. \n\nSo I went back, socialized more, didn't chug my wine, and enjoyed my company. The pizza was even better. The crust will satisfy any \"type\" of pizza lover. It is hard to explain the consistency, but I am sure it has something to do with the really neat wood burning, brick made fire going in the corner. \n\nSome people want fast food, they don't like long lines, they think the wait is ridiculous. So here are our options. \n\n1. They go to reservations only. All of a sudden, normal people like us don't even get to ever try this place. \n2. They make a chain. Quality goes down cause the man himself ain't makin' the pies. \n3. They build a new restaurant. BOOM. Ambiance gone, atmosphere screwed, screaming kids everywhere cause the wait is short enough to tote the young ones with... Boo. \n\nDeal with it, enjoy it, because there is no where else in town you will be able to tell people that you waited for a table for 5 hours and IT WAS WORTH IT!
