I'm new to the Mesa area pedicure scene, but I am not new getting my nail care on!\n\nThis place is fabulous! I am very glad I listened to my friend and chose here to get our nail care on, one of her favourtie places.\n\nThe owner is very friendly and goes around to each guest to greet them, offer bottled water, and ask how their service is going. I really love this attention he gives to his customers!!!\n\nWhat I like about this shop, is you can order add ons which you do not typically get in Seattle, where I am from.  Of course, I ordered the sugar scrub add on which was great! My technician, Adam, did a wonderful job on all parts of his job from massage, scrub, trimming. And with each pedicure comes a FREE hot stone massage!\n\nPrices were well reasonable.\n\nThe only draw back for me, was the medium nail chemical smell which is one of my testers for nail places.
