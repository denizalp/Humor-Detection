I have had 2 amazing experiences here. My fam and I strolled in at about 3:30pm while walking along the Beach strip. We had unfortunately come too late for any of the brunch specials but the restaurant looked nice and busy so we ventured inside.\n\nWe were seated pretty quickly and the wait staff was very friendly, bringing us ice water immediately. Not too long after we were all surprised by a delicious offering of 3 complimentary dips. The Babaganouj was addictive, the red eggplant dip was also delectable, and even the humus (which I'm not usually privy too, had a great taste and creamy texture). Needless to say we quickly finished the dips with our baguette bread. Now to the menu.\n\nThe food was all described well and was priced well for a trendy restaurant. Entrees ran generally  between $11-20 but they were all worth every penny. The chicken salads were awesome (grilled veggie one and also the luau Asain styled one). Also the paninis were presented in 3 delectable sandwiches on a long plate. All styled gourmet. To both my shock and amazment, once the waiter had noticed our dip plate was finished, he brought out ANOTHER. \n\nAnyways, great experience here. Amazing food in a lovely location is a nice weekend brunch treat and I highly recommend the experience.\n\nI am willing to try the Eglinton location...anyone have reviews on that one?
