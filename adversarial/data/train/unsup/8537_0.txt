Vastie was on time and left our house amazing!! I will be requesting her for our next cleaning. Handy cancelled my cleaning on Sunday and I was extremely angry, they rescheduled me and Vastie accepted the cleaning, I'm so glad she did. I would have given Handy a horrible Rating if it weren't for her.
