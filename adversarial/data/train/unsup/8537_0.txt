I used to get my oil changes here. I've gone here for years, because it's quick and service was awesome... but the last time I went, the guy ringing me up said my battery was lower than low.. He said he was surprised my car is still starting, and that I'm in luck because they sell batteries. I told him no thanks, and to just ring me up for the oil change.. I headed down to autozone where they check your battery for free. They said that my battery was fine. That was almost a year ago. Battery still fine. \n\nThey say it costs $65 for synthetic... But after all the fees, it comes out to $90+.. I now go to Island Auto where it costs me $52 out the door.\n\n\nOh, I also got hit up by the guy that roams around trying to scam you to fix your cracked windshield.. After reading another review about this, I'm glad I said no.
