The last time I was at Vosges Haut-Chocolat, I got some chocolates to go, and a lot of it was good.  They focus on exotic ingredients.  The shop itself has a very nice decor, and there is a lot of variety in chocolates.  I don't remember the little bar positioned in the back the last time I was here.  The little bar was for milkshakes and other chocolate drinks.\n\nWe knew we immediately wanted to try their milkshakes.  Their milkshakes are made from their selection of exotic ice creams.  The server was very nice and allowed us to sample each ice cream (4 in total).  A lot of times, you get those \"are you going to order or not?\" stares, but here, the woman was quite pleasant and helpful.\n\nI tried the Naga first.  The focus of the Naga was curry and coconut.  Curry is not the first flavor you want in an ice cream.  Though you could definitely distinguish the curry flavor, it was still very good.  And the curry went well with it.\n\nThen it was Red Fire.  It was basically dark chocolate mixed with Mexican flavors including chillies, but all you could really taste was the dark chocolate.  It didn't have the burn you would expect.\n\nNext was the Wattleseed, which was a nutty vanilla.  Very good.  And finally, it was Pandan leaf--chocolate ice cream with Pandan leaf (kind of like a vanilla flavor).  The server gave us Pandan extract to smell; it was quite interesting.\n\nI went with the Wattleseed for my milkshake.  It was very nice with a good texture.  The flavor was distinct and memorable--so often milkshakes are good (it is ice cream after all), but the flavor is nothing you would remember.  That was not the case here.  It was not too expensive either.  The size was on the smaller side, but it was still more than enough.\n\nThe milkshake I had here would rank up with the best I've had (and I've had a lot in my lifetime).  I can't see myself coming to Las Vegas again without stopping at Vosges for a milkshake.
