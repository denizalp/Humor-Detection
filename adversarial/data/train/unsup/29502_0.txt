I usually LOVE ulta stores. I've actually been coming to this store for so long. I am a platinum member and I come every 3 weeks for eyebrows at benefit bar and then buy a few new nice products. Last visit - I grew my eyebrows in and told the girl specifically that I don't want my shape touched just clean up the extra hair too on and bottom and trim. She didn't trim them and sort of tried to tell me she didn't need to even though I insisted (they are my eyebrows right?) and then after she did them she colored them in. I went those washed my face and she waxed half my eyebrow off. Fast forward 3 weeks it hasn't even grown back at all yet. For someone trained with benefit it shouldn't happen especially when you remind them not to do it. For some reason I always have an issue checking out and nobody seems to even care that I am a platinum member either. I have to ask for my free products with purchase (my app will tell me what I'm eligible for) otherwise I'd never get anything. Never have this issue at Sephora. So going forward I found a new eyebrow place and will now buy everything from Sephora.
