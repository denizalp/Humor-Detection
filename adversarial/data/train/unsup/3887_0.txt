We came here on a Tuesday, a bit before 6pm \n- $24.95 before 6pm \n- $4 other fees (I don't know exactly what the other fees are but it seems like $2\/person)\n$53.90\n\n- We parked in the Flamingo parking structure. \n- We got a tickets real fast. If you use a credit card, you can get it off from the salesman that uses the iPhone. Ticket is printed off the phone too. \n- Max pod can hold up to 40, but when we went there were only about 10 people in it. \n- Constantly moving. You got to hop your way in and out. Good thing they have a net beneath so the slow pokes. haha. The entrance and exit is curved, so no jumping necessary.  \n- 30 min ride.\n- Tried to do a panoramic pic but is hard bc people get in the way. fail. \n- Highest point is 550 ft. There's an exciting countdown.\n- Pods remind me of DBZ capsule corp. haha \n- This is the world's tallest observation wheel. 2nd is the Singapore flyer at 541 ft. \n- Great view of the Vegas sunset.\n- Great addition to the Vegas strip! Definite must ride even for locals. Good way to re-appreciate the city again.
