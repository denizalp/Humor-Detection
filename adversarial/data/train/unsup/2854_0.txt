Hotel: 1 star\nAttractions: 4 stars\nCasino: 3 stars\nService: 1 star\nAverage rating: 2 stars\n\nIf it wasn't for the attractions like the Tower and the shops (they had a good haunted theme Game Center and magic shop) this place would get 1 star.  The hotel accommodations are pitiful, especially for Las Vegas.  The shower head dripped out a pathetic gossamer of very hard water, the sink clogged mechanically, the TV didn't work, and we got locked out of our own bathroom.  Most roach motels are better than this place, seriously.  I will not return, except maybe for the shops and attractions.
