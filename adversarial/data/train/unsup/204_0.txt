Are you a guy? Do you have hair? Do you get it cut or are perhaps thinking of having it cut? Did you answer yes to any of those questions? Then do you know Mark? If not, you should. \n\nBefore I started cutting hair myself, Mark (who owns and operates ProStyles) is the only person I would trust to cut my little boy's hair. Mark is an amazing barber with his back east flavor and way of business. He knows his stuff; you tell him your vision and he will make it happen. He even hooks you up with massage when you're all done. His prices are great. If I remember correctly you get a discount Monday through Thursday. Friday's can get pretty packed in there anyway. If you are looking for a new barber and live work or play in the downtown, midtown, or uptown area I suggest giving ProStyles a try. Look them up on Facebook and Twitter for promotional specials and any changes in schedules due to holidays and what have you.\n\nDon't be scared just because Mark is almost bald either. He knows his ish.
