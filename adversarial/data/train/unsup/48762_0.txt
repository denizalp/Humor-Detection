Troy was prompt in getting my quote done for my property and came in at a reasonable price for the work I was asking to be done. \nThe day of trimming was supposed to start at 7:30. They started at 7:00 which was no problem and worked as a 4 man crew until Noon. Overall I had 4 very large and extra large trees trimmed up, thinned out, and dead limbs removed. I also had a hedge cut back and shaped and one pomegranate bush trimmed. One of my trees literally covers 4 properties in a corner and the crew took care to not damage anything of my neighbors or mine. My trees are so well done I am excited to see how they grow now. Until they finished I didn't realize how much it all hid my my house...I can see my house again!! Thanks guys!!
