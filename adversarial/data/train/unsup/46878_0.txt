Started with the Oysters Rockefeller, they were only so-so.  They weren't as hot as they could have been, and the hollandaise looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for more than a couple of minutes.  The bacon in the sauce was fatty and undercooked.  On the good side, the creamed spinach was nice and the oysters were large and fresh, but I wouldn't order it again.  \n\nFollowed that up with the bone-in filet, which was good...but nowhere near amazing.  It was tender, but not juicy at all, rather dry actually...even at medium rare.   \n\nWhen we ordered the steaks, our waiter did not mention any sauces and our steaks arrived plain.  I had to flag down our waiter to order bearnaise for me and bordelaise for the wife.  The bearnaise was fine but the bordelaise was way too sweet.  We sent it back and got the peppercorn which was better but nothing to write home about.\n\nWe were disappointed with the service.  Made reservations on Open Table where I noted it was a birthday dinner.  The hostess wished me happy birthday, but that was it....nothing from the waiter and no complimentary or special dessert was even mentioned.  That was a bummer after seeing all the pics here of \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate and the nice comped desserts.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was actually in the bar before dinner where we had the Ahi tuna sashimi appetizer...it was excellent.  Everything else I felt was middle of the road and the steak was not, in my opinion, worth $52.
