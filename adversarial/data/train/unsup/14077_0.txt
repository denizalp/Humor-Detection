Two days in a row, not too impressed.  Fredi, our wonderful bartender again gets five stars.  Food gets three.  We ordered the HH Barbacoa that was terrible & dripping w\/ oil.  The shredded beef was soggy w\/ the overbearing sauce so I gave it to my starving guy friend & ordered another one, plain.  The plain was dry & I narrowed it down to the beef just not being right.  I shared it w\/ my girlfriend & she couldn't finish her half either.  We told Fredi, but we had already paid our bill so she told the chef.  Change it please. \n\nThe Tuscan or Pesto Hummus was great, but I wish they put veggie sticks & Pita, instead of Pico de Gallo & Pita... which none of us ate.  \n\nVery nice beer selection of course & they no longer have the free beer w\/ check-in offer fyi.  I'm not a beer drinker so no big deal, but it was a nice offer.  \n\nChicken Salad after five or six bites was horrible, we thought it would get better, but it was tasteless & not totally fresh.  I thought ok let's try the Macaroni & Cheese, not the fried bites, how could we go wrong here... it was burnt w\/ hardly any cheese.  What in the world!  I will say to be on the safe side the Hummus & he Chimay Burger are the best.  Other than that, some items need to be changed or done away with.  Sorry Wolf, you left before I could mention these things to you.  We will be back & hope to upgrade the stars, but it will be awhile.
