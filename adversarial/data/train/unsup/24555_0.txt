Wow - I love this new bar in downtown Phoenix!  We stopped in this past Friday night and couldn't believe how busy it was...clearly the word has already spread about how great this place is.  The staff was extremely welcoming, the atmosphere was great and the menu looked pretty good too.  I only gave it 4 stars because the beer list was somewhat limited...hoping that will expand as time moves forward.  This will definitely be a \"go to\" place when heading out for drinks in our neighborhood.
