Excellent menu with a fun variety of bruschetta and two item combos. I really wasn't sure about the vegetarian panini but oh my heavens that was the bomb diggity!! \nThe $5 glass of wine special was impossible to resist. I'm only saddened by the fact that I don't live here. That's ok. A reason to come back to the area.
