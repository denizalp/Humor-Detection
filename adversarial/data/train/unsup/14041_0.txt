Two stars are generally reserved for places that have pretty bad food and have good service. If a place has horrible food and bad service, that's a one star restaurant in my book.\n\nWith that said, the food here is just bad. But most buffets have bad food, especially with a name like Mandarin or Hong Kong or Chinese stuck in it somewhere. Avoid those places unless you don't mind cutting your life short by a few years, gaining a few pounds, and most likely getting diarrhea in the process. If you don't shit yourself after eating here, you will down the road and remember it's because you ate here.\n\nParking: Plenty\nPrice: Not worth it\nWait: Long just to get seated
