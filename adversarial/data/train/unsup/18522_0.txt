Love this place! Blaze is right by my house and is a convenient place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. The place is almost like a Subway for pizza. You walk into the restaurant and you can either pick one of their specialty pizzas or creat your own. The best part about this place is that you can create your own pizza with as many toppings as you want with no extra charge! The pizzas here are on a thin crust so not everyone I take here enjoys it. For dessert, you can order a Smore Pie that is delicious and melts in your mouth. Their employees are pretty friendly and the place looks cool. I warn you though, if you come during the lunch rush, the line goes out the door and there is no room to sit. This place is just that good!\n\nWhat exactly do I order? Create your own pizza with white sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, bacon, extra bacon, extra extra bacon, garlic, saut√©ed onions, basil, pineapple, mushroom, roasted red peppers, oregano, spinach, extra spinach, and arugula to top it off:)
