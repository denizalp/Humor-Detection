Food was ok nothing spectacular.  could use more flavor or seasoning.  Service was good, like the concept of free wine with dinner really cool and I'm not even a wine drinker.  Don't like the menu being on the walls tacky yet fun.  Thought prices could be a little lower but factor in the free wine its cool. $25-$35 per person however this is not upscale dinning
