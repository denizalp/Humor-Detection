Paramount at Yonge and Dundas square was one of my favourite spots in Toronto for middle eastern food; however, it seems that the business model has changed since I used to go (case and point is that there is now almost a dozen locations in Toronto, including in food courts in the core). While the food is still good (7\/10) the great service of the original location didn't make the transition to Yorkville.
