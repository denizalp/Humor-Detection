I feel like I'm being generous by giving this place one star.  As you can see from my reviews, I rarely ever give a \"1 star rating\" to any place and when I do, it's usually for one single reason: horrible customer service.  And this place lived up to it too. \n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to go on a Sunday night.  The place itself was pretty well-lit but was definitely run down and seen better days.  It was a husband & wife operation (with chef(s) at the back).  \n\n1. $19.99 vs $24.99\nThe first mistake we made was to go for the $24.99 option where you got soup as well as dumplings (steamed\/fried)\/rice cakes\/lettuce\/grilled vegetables\/kimchi cake.  If you had a table of 4 or more, you had the option of jap chae as well.  \n\nDON'T GO FOR THE $24.99 option.  SO not worth it.  The soup was SO disgustingly salty, I thought I was going to suffer from dehydration.  When we told her to remake it, the woman brought back an equally salty soup.  \n\nThey also pile a bunch of chicken for you because it's the cheapest meat.  Their intention is such that you'll be so full that you won't be able to order the other meats afterwards.  \n\nThe $19.99 option provides you mostly with just the meats - I say just go for that if you're even going to step foot in this restaurant. \n\n2. Stingy on resources\nI had accidentally touched raw meat with my chopsticks and asked for another pair.  I pretty much had to get down on my knees and beg for another pair b\/c the man was so reluctant to give them to me.  I finally told him I just dropped them on the floor and he finally gave me a new pair.  \n\n3. CRAZY Micromanagement \nI could have sworn this man checked on how we cooked our meat every 5 minutes.  The first few times, it was tolerable.  After that, it became unbearable.  He wouldn't let us cook it at intense heat (to prevent meats from drying) and pretty much made us cook them at low heat, thus drying all our meats, making them taste even less desirable.  He also kept shutting our gas off.  \n\nHis constant micromanagement caused serious indigestion.  And if that was his strategy in getting his guests to eat less, he won.  \n\nOh, and because I didn't want to chew the meat around the bones of the kalbi, my boyfriend & I were given some serious hell about how we're wasting food.  I then flat out told him that I recently had oral surgery, at which point, he just kind of avoided any sort of eye contact and kept saying the same thing about how I should eat the meat around the bones.  I then told him AGAIN that I couldn't do that.  And he just finally left.  \n\n4. Meat quality & marinating \nI don't know where they get their meat but someone needs to investigate these farms because the meat was as tough as leather.  The meats also lacked any flavour, especially the steak.  \n\n**OVERALL**\nI agree with other Yelpers here.  HORRIBLE customer service and seriously STINGY!!!!!!!!!  I don't understand why these Louis Vuitton owning bosses (look at their LV bags at the back of the shop) would be SO stingy and offer an AYCE service AND be so rude at the same time.  \n\nWord of advice to these owners: save the micromanaging for your own spawn, forget the AYCE service if you're going to be so cheap, and oh, read your reviews because in case you're wondering why you're so empty, it's because you're epically rude.
