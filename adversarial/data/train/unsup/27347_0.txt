We had just finished lunch and we heard about this place as a place that had candy-related alcoholic drinks. So we had to try it out. All their drinks are named after candies and taste just like them. We tried the blowpop and bublegum. And they were good! We wanted to try the white gummi that's served in a goblet, but it was kind of pricy and you don't get to keep the glass. Those drinks served in goblets do have dry ice, so the effects of that are cool with the drinks. This was a great place to try!
