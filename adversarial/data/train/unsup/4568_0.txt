I am a professional in the beauty business One of my colleagues and myself were approached by Crystal who is their PR person to have some  discount services done she offered us a so-called buy one get half off the second we were excited hoping to recommend our clients to these people that will never happen!! I will warn you do not waste your time or money going here my colleague had hollows under her eyes they injected her cheeks instead and told her she would need to come back for a second set of services which would cost double we saw absolutely no difference in her face picture comparison we went in to see them, the Woman who injected her, which by the way, is not a doctor she is just an assistant who went and hid in a room. We went in that room and the girl ran out and didn't even say hello to us. Long story short they told us that they would do something and call back. They never called us back and they do not return phone calls we will dispute the matter with her credit card company these people are scam artists they inflate their prices and then discount them on Groupon don't get fooled by them they are very very unprofessional and tacky  she paid $1000 for a service they said would cost her 499 not one person thought she looked different!!! This is just one of those businesses that open and close their doors usually within a short amount of time because they are unprofessional unethical and inexperienced The oldest person in this office was probably in her mid-20s including the woman who did the injections
