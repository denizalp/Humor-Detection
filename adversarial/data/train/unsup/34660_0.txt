I purchased a gift certificate for someone whom later was discovered to have symptoms preventing the massage type desired (which was not known at the time). The staff was unreasonable about both the rules for the symptoms and about a refund, which was ultimately denied.\n\nRegardless of company policy the staff did not handle the situation well, and additionally did not even have a manager present to ensure it did.\n\nVisit another location, there is good reason this one has had so many low reviews with similar complaints.
