Asian Garden is by far one of my favorite little hole in the walls to go to. It's very close to my house, the food is always on point and the staff there is like family to me. I've been coming here for so many years and every time I walk through that door they greet me with a kindness I don't experience from many places. \n    Some of my favorite dishes to get there are the Singapore Noodles ( amazing curry flavor with pork, chicken and shrimp), the House Chicken ( a nice house sauce they use with a little bit of a kick), combination fried rice (pork, chicken and shrimp, ordering it extra spicy is the way to go though), cucumber salad ( very flavorful, but they put a lot of sesame oil if you're not into that) and the snap pea and shrimp is very light and filling. They also have very cheap lunch and dinner specials. For dinner they have about 8 items to choose from, which comes with a beverage, egg roll, fried rice or noodles and a soup all for $7.99...can't beat that. As for the boba drinks, they are very good! My favorite is the honey peach slush or smoothie! It is a must try!    \n     I really love this place and think that everyone should at least try it once. The staff is so friendly and caring, the prices are beyond reasonable and the food I guarantee you won't be disappointed in.
