First the good: the food. I had the lobster roll, which was buttery and delicious. The oyster selection was broad and tasty as well. The crab, also very good. The lone dish that was underwhelming were the scallops, which seemed to be more of an appetizer than a main - and was very salty. \n\nNow the not so good - The overall vibe of the dining room seemed to be several steps below the price point. I found it way too casual for a $20+\/plate spot. Staff looked to be dressed in their street clothes, and were indistinguishable from the guests (outside of the downtown sport coat crowd). \n\nBe sure to check out the eye opening (though unappetizing) artwork in the men's room. \n\nService was also quite poor. I can give it a pass since its the first month of operations and they're still figuring it out. But we had our server confirm what we had ordered a half hour after we had ordered it and had extraneous dishes arrive at our table sometime after that. My wife's dinner arrived after the rest of us had finished our mains, with minimal apologies.\n\nSo in the end in sad to say it's a bit of a mixed review. I'm sorry Rodney, but I won't be rushing back to your hipster Red Lobster any time soon.
