The CN Tower is a really amazing place! It is truly one of the 7 Wonders of the World! When you get up to the top you will experience such amazing views. \n\nFirst, I would recommend you buy timed tickets online before you. It allows you to skip the crazy long line, which is way out the door.\n\nAfter that, you get on an elevator ride that takes around a minute. Around and below you are glass panels, which allows you to see how fast and far you are going.\n\nOnce you leave the elevator you can than takes pictures or see the beautiful skyline from large windows, have a meal at the Horizon restaurant or go outside into their viewing center. I was even risky enough to my foot on the glass floor! \n\nYou can also go a bit higher into the sky pod or participate in an activity where you walk on the brim of the building. The later I would not think about! \n\nThe experience is a bit expensive, but there is only a small difference between the prices of general admission and a timed ticket. \n\nThere are also plenty of other things to do in the area including going to a Blue Jay's game. There also street vendors nearby who sell stuff like balloon animals. \n\nIf you plan on going to the aquarium I would require you buy the ticket package as it is cheaper that way. \n\nAltogether, this is a must visit when in Toronto!
