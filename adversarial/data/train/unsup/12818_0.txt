Street eats are the best!!! \n\nI love attending these street festivals and always eating way too much with my eye than my stomach can hold (this actually makes more sense in Cantonese LOL).  I can easily spend $50 at one of these places all to my self and this year is no different.  \n\nI don't even know where to begin... there is just too many things to write about.  My goal is to always support the booth that looks a bit bored LoL... I just feel bad for them and will always give them my business.  I will always support innovative creations as well.  So, you will always find me eating things that are new and different.  I tend to stay away from the typical beef\/fish balls stands or BBQ meat skewers (which is getting a little boring).\n\nWith that being said, I didn't really see anything that was a major innovative idea.  Most of the new stands were just variations of something that was there already.  Not that they were bad or anything like that, but was hoping to see something new and exciting.\n\nI will probably visit this event again trm night, maybe I will bump into something that I might have missed earlier today and will definitely update this review if I see something.  \n\nAgain, I can't stress how I love these types of events that go on.  Just wish that it will happen more often.  In my opinion, they should have something like this every weekend in the summer.  But than again, the waist line will become an issue.
