Central location on the strip and during conferences, incredibly competent staff, and every room is a suite. I don't want a boutique hotel caught up in it's boutiquey-ness. I want a hotel that really wants to cater to my comfort, and makes me feel like they just want what's best for me. Forgive me, I had to take off a star because they charge for their gym.
