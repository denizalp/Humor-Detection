I love this cozy little bakery tucked away in a tiny little plaza on Spring Mountain Rd. I always pay this place a visit whenever I am in Vegas. The owner is so nice! He always remembers me and my family even though we're not locals, and he always gives us extra goodies for us to take with us :)\n\nThey have the most AMAZING chestnut bread. I haven't been able to find anything quite like it here in LA!  Also, I'm a huge fan of their cookies! They have a ton of different cookies, and they have samples of EVERYTHING! \n\nGreat bakery. Great prices. A must try in Vegas :)
