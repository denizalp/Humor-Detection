Is there a word for getting stuck behind a gravel truck (so much construction in Madison) on your way to get your windshield repaired, and picking up another chip? If you have to get your windshield repaired, then this is the place! Great set-up to wait\/work\/lunch, easy to work with, Lori rocks....and everyone super nice. USAA preferred partner too! 100% coverage
