So I figure that if transit riders can rate street cars and buses, drivers should be able to rate roads.\n\nI DESPISE this road! I mean, all the way from the south end at the lake to the north end in Brampton where it changes names. It sucks! All of the time! There is always traffic on it (ok, not really at 6:00 in the morning on a Sunday - but almost always), the lights just don't seem to be in sync in a way to move the amount of traffic on this road along well. And I don't know why but this road seems to attract especially poor drivers. I am no longer surprised by nearly getting in accidents every time I'm on this road. I feel like my blood pressure rises every time I drive it and actually go out of the way often to avoid putting myself closer to a heart attack.\n\nThat is all.
