My boyfriend and I justoved in down the street and don't have much food in our fridge. We decided to offer some Jimmy John's. They've change their online ordering. But still easy to use. The delivery want as fast as I was expecting from previous experiences. It took nearly 30 minutes. Thats not exactly freaky fast in my book. Thats just a regular delivery time. \nAs far as the food good, it was good. I got the beach club and added bacon, which I won't do again. The bacon was way too salty for my liking.
