Freaking phenomenal people, all around. My first visit was two and a half years ago and I have since had five piercings and eleven tattoos done at P.A.P.I. Their pricing is beyond reasonable, their artists are super talented and surpass all expectations I have had for end product. They have made me a loyal customer, I will not go anywhere else. They can sometimes accept walk-ins, but definitely make an appointment! They book up super fast.
