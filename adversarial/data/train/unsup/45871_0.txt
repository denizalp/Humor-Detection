Place was huge, most people dont even know where the ostriches were and it seems to be a small part of it but the shows are awesome.....very packed.  I highly recommend getting your tickets at Frys before hand just in case there is a HUGE line to buy tickets.  It is like a mini fair with all the games that will suck your money dry and plenty of rides for the kids with an all day pass for $25 bucks which is great but get there early before the crowds....even took us 20 minutes to park.  This is fun, will cost $5 to park, $7 for kids, $10 for adults and the food and games are just like the fair so dont go if you are a cheap skate.  Don't forget to get an ostrich burger.
