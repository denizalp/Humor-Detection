Though I understand Erin's frustration with the madness surrounding \"The Festival\", some of those people wearing the badges are people who work there (or are there as part of their job, ie. members of the press, industry, etc), and are too busy being exhausted and bloodshot to even think about congratulating themselves. Some of them. The people who are buying the tickets and subscribing to any sort of mania don't usually wear badges.\n\nI heard many people complaining this year about things getting \"too big\". Understandable for those who have been enjoying TIFF since the early days, nobody likes it when their favourite indie band gets too popular. But yeah, as Anna said, it is incredibly important to our city's economy and status (sadly yes, I'm going there) and can be pretty fun and interesting if you let it. It can also be a little inconvenient for those not involved, but what can you do? It's better than flash floods and earthquakes, and maybe you'll see Brad Pitt at Starbucks. I'm just kidding, you won't.
