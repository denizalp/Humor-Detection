I'm reeeeaaaaally picky about my pizza, but this stuff was great!  We got the thin crust with steak and bacon and it was awesome!  However, the service is a bit challenged you could say... Our waiter forgot to get us water refills and forgot about our pizzarolles order or whatever they are called, but when we pointed it out, he compensated us really well, so no complaints really.\n\nI think the food deserves 5 stars, but since the service is so..... I don't know what to call it..... I had to knock it down a star.  Also, when my boyfriend mentioned that the pizzarolles were delicious but he thought he was going to have a heart attack from all the grease (haha funny funny), the waiter filled us in with how bad they are for us, like trying to make cool conversation with us.  It pretty much horrified us and made me want to starve myself for a week, but like I said, he compensated our bill well.
