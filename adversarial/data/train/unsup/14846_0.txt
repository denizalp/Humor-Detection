This place should stick to beer and beer alone.  The three of us ordered the $18 cheese plate.  When it arrived I literally burst out laughing.  The pieces of cheese and meat were, no joke, 1\/2\" long.  But the beef jerky?  That was a 1\/4\" piece.  Not an exaggeration.  Turkey was Sara Lee straight from package.  I called over the manager and expressed shock over the portion size and the lack of quality.  All he said was, \"Yeah, it's been brought up in staff meetings.\"  Um, okay...what the hell does that mean to me?  A half cheese plate at D'Vine Wine Bar is head and shoulders above this junk.  I ran into a friend there and she said her burger was just okay.  The portion sizes of everything except the entrees are small for the prices.  Yes, the design of the place is cool but the food falls dramatically short.
