The Bellagio buffet is one of my favorites on the strip....I can always find great foods as a vegetarian there.  It's one of the only buffets we've been to in Vegas where I'm not just eating odds and ends.....they have awesome tasting vegetarian foods.  Service was  bit flakey the last time....I think they were having a shift change as we started with one waitress and ended with another.  Will eat here again though!
