This place is basically like a higher end Tacos El Gordo. Super tastey food, nice selection of things you can add to your tacos in the center of the restaurant, and everything! The best part? No long lines, tons of seating, and (for whatever reason) less than half the amount of people that fill up Tacos El Gordo at night. \n\nThis place is a far from me, so I won't be able to come here often, but whenever I'm in the area and hungry for tacos, this will be my place to go to!
