On July 31st I arrived at Hooters hotel in Las Vegas.   I was late for dinner and was staying with a friend in her room for the night.  As I pulled up she had already gotten a Lyft to go to dinner so I was running to get my car Valeted soon.  \n\nAs I pull up the man \"working\" the valet was alone and he was facing the doors, back to he cars and on FACEBOOK ON HIS PHONE.   He didn't acknowledge anyone or myself or any cars.   I finally get out and walk up to him and ask if \"he's working or not?\" He scoffs and rolls his eyes, puts his phone away and takes my key.   I start to walk towards the Lyft waiting for me.  He asked if \" I want my ticket or not\" and I take the ticket and continue walking   \n\nHe then saying I can't leave the property at all.  I laugh and ask if he's serious.  I say \" I'm late for dinner, that's why I'm not going in, I have a car waiting\" he responds with \" I don't care I'll tow your car and call security\". I said \" if I was 10 min earlier, I would have gone in the casino and back out, I'll walk in and out if that makes you happy, I just have to get to dinner! \" he says \" NO.  IM GONNA TOW YOUR CAR THEN IM NOT PARKING IT!\" \n\nI go inside irate as all hell and raise hell.  The manager confirms we are staying here and apologizes and tell the guy to valet it.  \n\nThe guy goes in my car, sits in it and doesn't move it until we are out of sight.   \n\nI get back to the hotel, we talk a bit and then I  start to head out to get my car to go home.   \n\nI give my ticket to valet ( the guy is gone ) and hey go to get my car.  \n\nThe guy comes back empty handed saying the car doesn't start.   \n\n*** I JUST took my car to he dealership and had everything checked out everything was working perfectly.**** \n\nI go to retrieve my car myself, and the DICK that parked my car purposely left my car on Accessory mode which was using my battery the ENTIRE time I was gone.  My car won't even start at this point and HOOTERS expected me to pay the tow company myself and for me to figure a way to get my car out of there because THEIR valet person purposely messed with my vehicle.   \n\n\nAll of management just pointed fingers at each other to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  Finally after raising enough of a scene they called the manager that dealt with me earlier  and he told them to have someone come jump my car.  \n\nWHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THIS???! WHAT IF I HAD BEEN A GUEST HERE AND A POOR SAP THAT JUST ALLOWS THIS TO HAPPEN?  \n\nThey are gonna have a big problem tomorrow when I come in and speak to the managers.   I don't care how high I have to go on the ladder!!! This will be dealt with.  What a joke!
