Great concept will be able to give five stars after some fine tuning.  I've done one of these escape rooms in Austin and it was amazing. I bought a groupon for 6 of us hoping for the same experience.  Although it was fun this place fell a little short.  However had potential.  I paid around $100 for six of us using a groupon and would never imagine paying full price! The quality of the rooms is more on the budget side although I can only speak of the mars room few things weren't working well.  The place in Austin offered shirts, coffee mugs etc after and had great space for pictures after as well. Unfortunately escapability isn't at that level yet. My advice is use a Groupon and give it a shot and offer your opinion so they can improve.
