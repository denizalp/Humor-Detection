I never would have thought that Squirrel Hill was big enough to have two frozen yogurt shops, but as a neighborhood resident, I do like having options.\n\nTutti Frutti feels roomier than Razzy Fresh on Murray.  When the weather's nice, Razzy Fresh often has a line going out the door, but Tutti Frutti seems like it could accommodate more customers without people spilling out onto the street.  The basic range of flavors is the same at both shops: a tart flavor, a chocolate, a taro.  Both shops rotate other flavors.\n\nThe service at Tutti Frutti has been friendlier to me--employees greeted me, and asked if I needed any help with the dispensing machines.  Service at Razzy Fresh isn't bad by any means, but more reserved.  One downside to Tutti Frutti, however, is a lack of mochi bits at their toppings bar.  I'm not a Fruity Pebbles kind of girl--I want my fresh fruit and mochi.\n\nIn the Squirrel Hill Fro-Yo Battle, I'm calling it a draw between Razzy Fresh and Tutti Frutti for now.
