The pro is that it's on State Street, and you might be like me - a normal human that likes to walk over to the Terrace or just up and down State, and in the midst of heading back home, decide you need an quart of ice cream (no shame).\n\nThe con is that it's on State Street, and you might be like me - someone who would rather not have to deal with UW students acting crazy and loud, or panhandlers that love their seat outside Walgreens and asking you for money, even though you've told them no every other day for the past week.\n\nThe staff are hit or miss. It's actually a pretty big Walgreens, so I'll ask them for help on if they have a certain item if I don't feel like going through their rummage sale of a store. I'd say more often than not they are helpful, though there are definitely a handful that most likely hate their job.
