Just a heads up, this review is not meant to come of snobby by any means.  I am not a food critic, but I've definitely been to a lot of steakhouses and I can say this is the worst one I have been too.\n\nFirst, I am not the type of person who gets hyped for main-stream celebrities so when I heard this place was opening up I rolled my eyes.  However when my friend came to town a big fan of all his shows I figured we'd go since I did hear some pretty good reviews.\n\nFirst and foremost making a reservation was a pain, I called a month in advance and they said the only times they had were 5:00 and 9:30.  I'm sorry, i know popular places fill up fast, but people are not that on top of reservations in November to plan ahead.  Finally after personally visiting the hostess stand 2-weeks prior, I was able to get it bumped to 6PM.  it looks like finally the place is on Opentable so maybe that will solve that problem.\n\nUpon arrival, the eye rolling began.  As we walked into the restaurant the hostess said \"This tunnel you are walking through transports you from Paris to London\".  Next we admired what I would describe as  a tangled neon sign in the sky as the hostess explained \"This art represents the hand motions Chef Ramsey makes while preparing his signature beef wellington\".  We were than seated maybe 4 feet apart from another table, I saw this consistency across the dining floor and it began to occur to me this was more like a \"turn and burn\" cafe than fine intimate dining.\n\nThe waiter asked if we preferred sparkling or still water, when I said \"still\" he said nothing else and later brought a bottle of water to the table.  I assumed the red bottle was a decorative carafe, however I found out later on the check that it was an $8 of water.  I believe most places ask the follow-up after the water type with \"Tap or Bottled\" but this was not the case. \n\nOne tacky thing I noticed on the menu is that each item lists two prices, the normal price and the \"Total Rewards\" price.  I think the difference was about a buck and item, so I'm not sure why they didn't just put something at the bottom saying \"Total Rewards members receive X% off\" but they didn't and it makes the menu look unprofessional. \n\nSome people may like this, but I thought it was a little pointless when they wheeled the all the cuts of meat out and went through what each one was.  I can see where this is great for beginners, but I don't think it fits a fine dining setting.  That being said it looked like many of the patrons thought it was acceptable to wear a baseball hat and jeans into the restaurant.  I'm not saying you always have to \"suit up\" but it's not like you're going to McDonalds on your lunch break.\n\nMy friend and I decided on splitting the porterhouse steak.  I'll admit that several of the pieces I had were good, but I had about 3 pieces which were either really burnt and crunchy or a ton of fat.  The size also seemed like a rip-off, at $100 \"for two\" there really wasn't a lot, in fact I think the $50 Porterhouse at most places is bigger.\n\nFor a side we got the $10 heirloom potatoes.  I'm not going to put much weight into knocking the size, as it's tiny at any fancy place you go.\n\nMaybe I went wrong and got the wrong steak and instead should have ordered the beef wellington.  Maybe my preconceived notions of it being a celebrity TV chef and all the touristy things the hostess explains put me in a bad mindset.  But overall I have no want to ever come back here again.
