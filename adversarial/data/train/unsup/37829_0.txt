Caribbean Roti Palace is a hit-or-miss.\n\nI'll start with the obvious. Caribbean Roti Palace is ridiculously cheap. You can get a full meal for less than $10 dollars. You won't believe the amount of food you get for the price. Be warned---these are usually the prices at most Roti places in Toronto so cheap prices shouldn't be a deciding factor when deciding where to get your Roti fix.\n\nIs Caribbean Roti Palace is worth it? \n\nOn a good day, at lunch hour, I'd say maybe. The roti is a little bit too \"doughy\" for my taste and it falls apart way, way too easily. I took two bites before I had to start using a fork.\n\nOn a bad day, at supper time when the food has been sitting there all day, I'd say avoid it like the plague. Caribbean Roti Palace's \"hit\" factor is completely dependent on the freshness of the food.\n\nTake my nightmare experience as an example.\n \nLast time I went to Carribbean Roti Palace, I went there at around 6pm. I ordered the usual: Boneless Chicken Roti and Curry Goat and rice. The meal was disgusting. The rice tasted like it was at least two days old. The curry goat was bland and cold. To be honest, the meal was probably one of the worst I've had in Toronto. I had a few bites, and then threw everything out. \n\nI am sure there are better Roti restaurants out there.
