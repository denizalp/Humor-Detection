Thus far every time we've gone to Donut Bar, we've pre ordered the night before in order to get the donuts we want. I love the Cr√®me Brule donut! My husband is a fan of the Butter Beer Donut and anything Chocolate. We tried a couple new ones this time and they weren't that great...i.e. The Apple Fritter (not Apple-y enough), Pumpkin with filling. I thought the Strawberry Split was fabulous though and would certainly get it again.\nWe do the free coffee with Yelp check in each time and we've never liked the coffee.\nWhether you are a fan of fluffy donuts or cake donuts I'm sure you'll find something to make you go mmmm!
