I gave this place 3 chances, to be fair. Brian did my nails and 1) took FOREVER (2.5 hours) because he was dealing with other things like his mother's personal rent lease, 2) calls everyone sweetheart (learn my name!), and 3) brags about his OCD and what a good job he does (I've definitely had better) and the best part, 4) he got HIGH just before starting my nails last time!! I won't be going back.
