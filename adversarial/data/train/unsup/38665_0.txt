I attempted to go here three times and on the third try I finally got to eat here. I really enjoyed the food and my experience here. I had the Cataplana as well as the grilled sardines as an appetizer. The sardines were good, but nothing spectacular. There were a lot of little bones, which was fine with me, that got stuck in my friend's throat. The Cataplana was really good. I enjoy Boullabaise a lot and so I was really excited to try the similar dish and was very happy with my decision. The soup was fresh and I liked that it was a tad spicy. My friend also got the risotto, I believe it was the saffron risotto, which was also very well done. After my bad experience with risotto previously, I stopped eating it, but I would definitely get it again here. For dessert, my friend and I shared the dark chocolate mousse, and it was delicious. We both love dark chocolate and we were glad we opted to get this dessert out of the many other temptations. Overall, the food was good and the service was impeccable. Water was always filled and the servers were attentive without being intrusive. Definitely recommended!
