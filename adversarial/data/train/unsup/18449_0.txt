So I'm sitting here...in the chair...drafting this review. \n\nAnd all I can say is wow. Just, wow. \n\nGreat staff. Super polished facilities. I bought a groupon for this place and so far so good. \n\nThis is an amazing concept for a locale like Scottsdale.  Polished is a cosmetic dentistry practice that only cleans($95), polishes($35), and whitens your teeth($95).\n\nThe whitening worked like a charm.\n\nSide Note: I was super hung-over when I walked in the door, and they were quite understanding. Amazingly friendly staff. A+
