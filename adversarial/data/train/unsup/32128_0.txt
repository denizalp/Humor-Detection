This venue is terrible! Security would continuously force out people that were trying to get in line early. At one point a few ladies were hiding out in a near by restroom in order to keep from being thrown out until security caught on and made them leave. When tickets are general admission, those that show up early often do so in order to be as close as possible to the stage, but the staff here highly opposes that practice. People holding Vip tickets ended up going first. There were a few audio glitches and I paid $5 for a CUP of water. I really wish bands would stop doing shows here.
