July 2018. This show is great. Highly recommend seeing. We sat 3rd row from the stage. Awesome acrobatics, singing, the musical brought you back to yester years. Very colorful and no intermission throughout the show. They kept performing number after number. Such energy!  Fantastic...well worth seeing and getting souvenirs after.
