100th Review! I saved LOVE just for this =). Really 4.5 stars.\n\nIf you don't already know, I am obsessed with The Beatles (no, seriously...). I was interested in how this show would pan out, given that other Cirque shows have a specific repertoire.\n\nDespite the uniqueness of Cirque shows, what I enjoyed most about this one was that it was different. You could understand exactly what was going on. The tasteful cuts in music presented an understandable and easy story to follow.\n\nTheater: It is a circular theater facing a stage in the middle. I sat more toward the back, but I could still see everything nicely. The outside is super colorful and makes for great photo ops.\n\nThe show: SO.MUCH.COLOR. It's impossible to be in a grumpy mood the whole way through this show (even if I'm wrong, don't prove it to me please). The acrobatics were great, but some ran for a little longer than they should. I like the connection between the songs and the acts - \"Lady Madonna,\" \"Here Comes The Sun,\" and \"All You Need is Love\" being my favorites. \n\nService : Ushers Sgt. Pepper costumes? Ahhhhh yes. They were very helpful and fun to approach\/look at.\n\nDocking a 1\/2 star because it is a bit pricey. You can try finding deals outside or if you stay at the Mirage.\n\nOverall, out of all the Cirque shows, I'd recommend this one. I could just be biased considering my love for the band, but I'm sure you'll walk away from it happy.
