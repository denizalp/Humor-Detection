Every time I visit the service is fast and efficient  and the food is absolutely delicious.  The portion sizes are huge and I always have enough to take home for an extra meal. I get the same thing every time I am at any Chinese restaurant (Chicken & Broccoli with Steamed Rice & White Sauce) and I must say that their White Sauce is one of the most flavorful that I have had in the Pittsburgh area. Great lunch spot!
