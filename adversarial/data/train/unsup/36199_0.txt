We received more than 10 follow-up calls from the company representative named Moses. Rather than being solution \/result focused, he antagonized and browbeat us. Meanwhile, WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE REST OF OUR PROPERTY!\nChampion Movers swiftly executed 2 SCAMS on us. \n1st Scam = BAIT AND SWITCH the\n2nd Scam = TRUMPED UP DELIVERY CHARGES. Leaving our property and Claiming that the cubic feet exceeded weight estimate of our belongings. Given that all along from 1st contact, we explained that the move was a RELOCATION move and that everything was going, there was a reasonable expectation on our part that Champion Movers understood what that meant given all the industry accolades and awards.    We work HARD  for our money and earn every penny honestly and are just bereft over these exploiters who seem to not respect the law or consumer rights. It is clear that the movers KNEW from the beginning that they were not going to move all our property and rather than having the professional decency of  giving us an option or opportunity to select what we wanted to take or leave. Instead, they packed the truck and when it was full, notified us accordingly, leaving our medical devises and   other necessary things. This is a clear case of elder abuse, we can send our phone bill to prove the number of times we received calls from this company on Monday and Tuesday.
