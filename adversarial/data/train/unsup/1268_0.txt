This place is the best NEIGHBORHOOD Bar on the West side ! It might look like your average dive bar, but the people are what make this place great. You see a lot of fun regulars, they have great drink specials BUT by far the greatest thing about this bar is the bartender Nicole ! She is on fire, she can handle a full house all by herself, she makes GREAT drinks, and she is quick and precise and always does an outstanding  job. She used to work at another establishment and when she moved about 3\/4 of the Bar moved with her, including me ! She is THAT good ! the Other bartenders are great as well, dont get me wrong, but if you are lucky enough to get served by Nicole you will have a terrific night ! For a really special treat, ask the staff if  Uncle Gary is in the house and buy him a drink, he will make you laugh for days !
