I guess I am not as picky as others on here.  I don't eat a ton at buffets so I think they are a waste.  \n\nThis place has \npizza\nsalda\nchinese\nmade to order pasta \na great desert bar ( no soft serve lol :( ) \n\nsome of the items could taste better or have more flavor, but this is why you can just go get different food, if you spent 20$ on a plate and were stuck with it then I can see bitching.   \n \nThis was my 2nd and 3rd time there in 2 years, my son liked it so much the other night we went for breakfast 2 days later before we left Vegas.  \n\nBreakfast starts to pick up around 9:30, we got there at 9am to beat the rush.
