They have Bed Bugs that attacked me and I am left high and dry. I didn't even get refunded for the room. Can anyone respond?\nNope your response is a lie. NO ONE HAS EVER CONTACTED ME. they only give limp answers in chat! ha! \n\nTheir security guards straight out said I was bit by bed bugs and the marks of which I have pics of are 1000% bed bug bites.
