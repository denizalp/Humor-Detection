Despite our rocky experience per my previous review, I will upgrade Premier Coach to 5 stars. The manager made a difference. I had asked to speak to a manager when the bitch employee (who apparently no longer works there) pissed me off but apparently she passed me to another co-worker instead of the manager. The manager, Karl, responded to my Yelp review and offered to have our camper detailed inside and out. They did so recently (they sent a mobile unit to our house) and that did help make up for the bad experience.\n\nPremier Coach Works did an excellent job repairing our damaged camper!! The less than great process put a damper on the experience, but not the outcome. I think the manager responded appropriately and tried to make things right. If you use Premier Coach and have an issue, ask to speak to Karl directly. (If it seems like the guy doesn't care, you aren't talking to Karl. You too might have been passed to a co-worker.) I think Karl genuinely cares about his customers' experience and wants them to be happy with the process AND the results!
