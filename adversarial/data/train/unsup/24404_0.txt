Some of you may have seen my previous review and saw that I was not happy with the services received. The same day I posted the review, someone from Go Gadgets attempted to contact me through the phone number I left there the night before and inquired about the yelp review I had left. My partner received the phone call and he informed me that the workers at Go Gadgets wanted to fix the issues I was having. They explained they felt rushed the night before when I dropped my phone off, and didn't get to test it properly. So my phone went back in to get worked on. Go gadgets had my phone over night and I just got it back. It looks like everything is almost the way it was before I took my phone in. The few minor issues I'm still having I believe we're a result of me breaking my phone screen. So I just want to say THANK YOU to Go Gadgets for making things right. As someone who has worked his whole life in Customer Service, I think Go Gadgets went over and beyond to make sure that I was happy with their service.  They took their review extremely seriously, which is shocking in today's world! \n\nSo if you're planning on taking your phone in to get worked on, I'd just like to advise to be patient so your device will be taken care of properly.  Thank you again Go Gadgets for correcting the issues.
