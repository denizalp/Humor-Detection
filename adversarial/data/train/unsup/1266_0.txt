Being a Seattleite, I have to get my morning fix. In fact, I can't function without one, especially after a night of whooping it up with our clients in Vegas. Did you know that coffee is actually the best cure for a hangover (besides more alcohol)? Yep, tested and approved (true scientific research). \n\nGVR doesn't have a Starbukcks, but Coffee Bean is a short walk away from the meeting rooms. Since SB coffee tends to be acidic, I enjoyed the smoothness of these beans. They also use powder for flavorings, and my white chocolate latte did not disappoint! I recommend reducing the amount of flavoring to cut down on the sweetness and truly appreciate the espresso.\n\nStaff was friendly and as a guest of the hotel you get a 20% discount.\n\nOh, and grab a flaky chocolate croissant while you are at it.
