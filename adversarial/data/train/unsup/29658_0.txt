We used them for the tile and the carpet about two years ago. This year we had a major leak in our upstairs bathroom and we had to go back and redo some of the carpeting so was able to work with Puckets again.\n\nAt every turn they are great to work with. They're pricing is amazing and  I wholeheartedly recommend them.
