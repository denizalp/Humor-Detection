OK so it pains me to do this - essentially drop these guys down from four stars to one, but that's just the way it is. \n\nWhen they initially opened, their concept was great; they had a great cocktail menu, they were open during the day, they were doing brunch, and the music was kick-ass. Then they decided to close during the day - which I can understand if being open wasn't profitable, but considering so much thought went into designing the space to include outlets and what-not for laptops, so that people could work while they were there, you'd think they would have done some kind of market research to see if this would actually work in the neighborhood they were in. But I digress. My beef is with my recent visit, when a friend and I just felt like a drink on a Saturday night. What a major letdown.\n\nFirst, we walked in and were barely acknowledged by the two kids that were there.  We grabbed a table and waited for service. The guy comes over and asks us what we want. \n\nMe: Well, can I see the drinks menu? \n\nHim: We don't have one. \n\nMe: What do you mean you don't have one? \n\nHim: We don't have one. \n\nMe: Well you used to have one. \n\nHim: We don't have one anymore. \n\nMe: ..... [patience wearing thin - stupid people really annoy the hell out of me].\n\nMe: Can we get two Pimms then? (Note that this was on their original menu).\n\nHim: What's that?\n\nMe: Are you kidding me right now? (I turn to my friend and agitatedly tell her that all I wanted was one damn drink).\n\nHim: I don't think we have that, (then he turns to ask the other kid if they have Pimms, and the guy responds in typical Ã¼ber hipster wannabe fashion \"Um, NO, We don't have that!\").\n\n[Intermission: my friend and I look at each other and I ask 'what the f**k is this?']\n\nHim: We have the standard drinks. \n\nMe: Like?\n\nHim: We have old-fashioned.\n\nMe: Do you have wine?\n\nHim: No.\n\nMe: I'm leaving.\n\nDon't waste your time - the place had a lot of potential but I'm sad to report that it's pretty much done with that.
