Every time I come here this place is like a ghost town. It's probably me, one person waiting on their order and maybe a couple or family seated. I typically come after work on a Thursday, around 6-6:30pmish.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and always ready to help you. It's probably because there's no one in there! I'm not complaining though because it usually means I am in and out in about 10 minutes. Never a long waiting time, which is good when you're tired from work and you just want to come home and have dinner.\n\nThe place seems pretty well kept up and neat. I haven't been in here once when it appears unkept. I'm a fan.
