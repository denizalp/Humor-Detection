Yum. Burgers. Nuff said. \n\nOur gaggle of burger fans piled in last night for the 9th edition of Yelp's Burger Brigade. The premise for those not aware, it's essentially a BYOB (Buy Your Own Burger) Meat up! So we've got 2 left this year and who knows where we'll end up!\n\nThat said, I had no idea this was such a huge burger chain spanning not just Southwestern Ontario, but CANADA! Wow.\n\nLocated near Celebration square in Mississauga just off of Living Arts Drive, it's a trendy looking spot with a sweet corner location and a pretty boss little patio (for warmer weather times).\n\nLast night I went for their Steakhouse burger, which had steak\/bbq sauce, onion rings, bacon and cheese. The texture of the burger (as well as the taste) was oddly similar to that of a Harvey's charbroiled burger. That nostalgia factor and the fact that I LOVE BBQ\/Steaksauce on EVERYTHING (seriously I would put a little in my hair in the morning... how else do you think I get it to stand up, slick?) made for a pleasurable burger experience.\n\nFries IMHO were fries, not something I was a fan of and the Sweet Potato Fries were a tad soggy. That said, the redeeming side was their delicious Onion rings. Huge, well battered, crisp and YUM! AND, let's not forget that you can get domestic Beer bottles for $2.50 and import bottles for $3.50 - Ummmm yes puhhlease!!!\n\nLove their order process where they provide you with a light-up vibrating disk that notifies you when your order is ready. OH OH and SOOOO many TV's that allow you to watch the Leafs (even when they lose).\n\nI'd come back... heck I'd have seconds. \n\nEatcrest Out!
