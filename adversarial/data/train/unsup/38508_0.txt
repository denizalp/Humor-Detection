Their pesto pizza with ricotta cheese (instead of the chicken) and walnut & pear salad are our go-to items. I'm really not that predictable or consistent at any other restaurant...but I've found my favorites here.\n\nWhen you have room for dessert, their cannolis & mousse are solid choices.\n\nHave always enjoyed the staff, cozy restaurant, when we do take-out it's fast - takes less than 20 minutes for me to call-in an order and go pick up great quality Italian food. Although, I'm embarrassed because they recognize me as the guy who orders take-out from the Cove all the time.\n\nI'd recommend this place, enjoy the vodka sauce with the bread (yum). I have never taken advantage of happy hour but I think they have some specials going on for HH worth checking out.
