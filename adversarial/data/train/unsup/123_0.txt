Their pizza is a Pittsburgh staple - there's an ongoing debate on which pizza is better - Mineo's vs Aiello's - why can't I say both?  \n\nTheir crust is not too thick and a nice crunch to it and homemade sauce not too sweet plus the mounds of cheese they put on -yum. The only thing I have to remember is to bring a bottle of water to bed because I always wake up so thirsty in the middle of the night after eating this for dinner.\n\nIt's nice they have this location (I used to have to trek to squirrel hill) and what might be the greatest thing I ever discovered  (or worst if you're my bathroom scale) is that they sell Prantl's burnt almond torte slices!!  \n\nWe ordered delivery (there's a $1.00 delivery fee) but it's a small price to pay especially when they bring your Prantl's slice!!
