Oh you fancy huh? That's exactly what this Smith's is! The store is modern, very clean and smelled good. \n\nRight when you walk in, you are greeted with a huge, I mean huge selection of flowers on your left and a massive produce section on your right. I mean, I've never been so amazed by a grocery store until now. Everything looked so fresh. The thing that separates this Smiths from the other locations I've been to in the past is their wine area. It wasn't just an aisle like usual. It was like a little boutique area for wine. I also liked that they had a section to buy nuts and dried fruit in bulk. Shelves were stocked and I was able to get my everything I came in for. The employees I came in contact with were helpful and went out of their way to help me. \n\nI just recently moved closer to this location, so this will now be my go-to Smiths. And an added bonus, there's a Starbucks inside!!!!!!!!!!!
