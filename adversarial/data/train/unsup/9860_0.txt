So I came by yesterday to peek at the menu and decided to go the Vermont Sandwich place next door instead. Today, I came in and the lady at the counter remembered...\"hey, you came in yesterday and then left!\"....So either the staff is super attentive or their business is so slow that they remember every customer. Something tells me that it's the first one though. \n\nI've been to New York and I've eaten pizza while I was there, and I don't quite remember it tasting what I tasted today. I had a slice of the Margarita Village which had olive oil, garlic, sliced tomatoes, basil & mozzarella. As I bit into the za, i had oil drip down my arm. Yeah, this bad boy could have been on the SI Swimsuit cover with all the glistening oil that rolled off of it. Too oily for my taste and the crust wasn't crispy at all. You can, however, taste the basil and the freshness of the mozzarella. The cheese was gooey, but I don't think there was enough. About $3.50 for a specialty slice and the slices are a pretty decent size.\n\nLeaving this place, it looked like I had been attacked by the Baby Oil Monster. My scrubs were thoroughly dirtied. \n\nTip: They deliver for free within 3 miles of their restaurant. And there is a 15% off coupon for your dine-in bill by the register...so grab it!\n\nOverall, if you're in this complex, I would suggest eating at Andreolli's Italian Grocer #1 or the Vermont Sandwich Company as your #2 choice. If you really really want some pizza, then go for it, but I think I'll pass on this place next time.
