I'm a real jerk. I hired these folks to clean my place before I moved out, and realized truly how much of a pig I am.\n\nThey were able to get there 10 minutes after 5 during Friday rush hour. Upon arrival, I already felt bad. They were very nice. If they were evil and cruel like the Libyans that shot Doc Brown, I would have had no problem. I let them start their work, and went across to the Beggar. \n\nComing back when they had finished was life-changing. The place was spotless. Bathrooms looked fit enough for royalty to take a dump. Carpets were vacuumed well. THEY CLEANED MY GARBAGE CAN. The one place I've never cleaned because it's where my trash goes. \n\nAmazing job to Desiree and her partner at Mad Maids. I'll be getting a regular service at my new apartment, and know exactly where to turn. \n\nTip your cleaners, folks.
