Pretty nice place. Really enjoyed the ambiance and the variety of food they offer. However, their song selection was alright. They were not as up to date as I would have and their variety isn't that great. Keep in mind I was only viewing their english song selections. They served this pretty great fluffy bread which was quite good but I wish the alcohol in their drinks were a bit stronger. Mine was a little too sweet. The pricing can get pretty steep depending on your room size and how long you plan on staying so keep that in mind when visiting
