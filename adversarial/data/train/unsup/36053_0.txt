This gym is so much better than the LVAC on Flamingo.  It's so much cleaner, no dumb teenagers hogging the machines while on the phone and talking, good music, and free wifi.\n\nFree wifi is probably the best perk just because I don't have unlimited data plan (only 2Gb).  Free towel service also!\n\nThis place is never over crowded, with just the right amount of people at the peak hours of the day.  And there aren't any roided out douchebags yelling while working out here at Edge (thank god).\n\nThe dumbbells are always organized and put back.  I believe the highest weight they have is 220 per dumbbell? \n\nOverall, this is the perfect gym for anyone that lives in Mountains Edge.  Less than a 5 minute commute, you can't beat that.
