best buffet in vegas hands down!\n\namazing selection with as much as you want, don't bother with any other place\n\nbut go on friday or saturday night to get the good dinner since the menu changes\n\namazing stuff like ostrich, kobe beef (not the real one sadly), beef tenderloin, duck, quail, sushi, king crab legs, etc\n\nlots of desserts, too many too choose from, they are all good!
