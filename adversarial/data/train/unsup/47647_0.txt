This is my favorite of all the Barrio locations (except on game day).  It's big, service is great, the drink and tap selection is huge, they have gluten free beer for celiacs like me, and the tacos are great!  The late night happy hour is great too.\n\nWhen if first opened, service was a little rough\/slow, but I think everyone's gotten the hang of the massive bar.  Service is always quick and friendly too.  I especially love that servers know the menu and are willing to check with the kitchen about ingredient questions without hesitation.  I'm celiac and gluten destroys my insides, literally, andI questioned why the cheese was not listed as gluten free.  Turns out they just wanted to be safe in case they ever have to use pre-shredded cheese that used flour as an anti-caking agent. Since they normally shred the cheese themselves, it's safe for me to eat.  Although, the smoked cheddar might not be gluten free and that's understandable.\n\nThis place only turns into a mess during home games, but only because of the crowd.  It gets packed to capacity and that just ain't my scene.  If you don't like long waits for a seat and wall-to-wall people, avoid it immediately before and after a home-game.\n\nLike all Bario locations, I wish the bowl option didn't cost an extra $1 for what seems like the same amount of food as a regular taco, and I wish they had nachos.  I can use the bowl option and the free tortilla chips to DIY some nachos, but it's not the same because you won't have the gooey mess of cheese like normal nachos.  Even with those complaints, I love this spot.
