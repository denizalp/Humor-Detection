My wife and I had a very pleasant dining experience here and made dinner reservation through Open Table. Upon checking in, we were promptly seated at our reserved time. I really appreciate that they honored my request to be seated outside, on the patio, as we had a great view of the Bellagio water show while we dined. I also appreciate that they have taken notice to the comment I had left on Open Table that we there to celebrate my wife's birthday. To our surprise, they brought out a special little birthday dessert towards the end of our dinner service.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=Zt2T-QknvZbfBb__KMYDKw\n\nAfter being seated at our table, they left us with an iPad that was an interactive wine\/cocktail menu, which I thought was pretty nifty and cool. After ordering cocktails, we started with the Tuna Tartare, and it was nicely flavorful of fresh tuna. For the entr√©es, we went with our waiter's recommendation. My wife went with the Sea Scallops which was delicious, and I went with the Pan Seared Northern Halibut. My halibut was exactly as our waiter had described it would taste, and everything from the fish to the bed of risotto it sat on was outstanding.\n\nTuna Tartare: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=5Hrez-r5YEVrIq2g1SmCDw\n\nSea Scallops: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=soHdUh_514gHA79oLN334w\n\nPan Seared Northern Halibut: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=Bmk8WNWpZiirNBmAqDclAg\n\nAll around service was superb, particularly our waiter. He was very attentive and checked on us often, yet we never felt like we were being rushed. He was even polite enough to offer to take a photo of us together with a glimpse of the water show behind us. I am very pleased with the level of service Olive's was able to provide my wife and I on her special day.
