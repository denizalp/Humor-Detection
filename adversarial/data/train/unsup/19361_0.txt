I loved this place so much that I started writing the review at the restaurant before I left!  The food here is delicious.  I tried 2 entrees.  Why not order lunch for tomorrow.  Haha.\n\nI had a fish dish and my all time favorite, bandeja paisa, actually a Columbian dish.  Both were delicious.  My dish was Everything I remembered about Bandeja Paisa.  Beans seasoned to perfection.  Steak marinated just right.  Even the plain white rice rated better than any plain white rice I've had.  It was cooked just salty enough and just fluffy enough.  Perfect!\n\nDon't come here expecting the traditional restaurant. This place is small.  I counted... There were exactly 6 tables that seat 4 people.  That's 24 seats!  \n\ndon't go there if you are in a rush!  The food is cooked to order.  Home cooked food takes time.  The gentleman, Carlos, that waited on me seemed like he took his time because they understand it takes time to make good food.\n\nI even found that the folks in the restaurant were extremely friendly.  There was a regular customer there that day that kept me entertained the entire time I was there.  \n\nKeep in mind, this is a small establishment and it is not fast food, just amazing food.
