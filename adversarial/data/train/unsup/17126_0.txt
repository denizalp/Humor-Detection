PHO!?...... FoSho!\n\nWhat an amazing basin of goodness! Yes! That was my first impression of their Pho Dac Biet (#13 in the menu) a delicious bowl of thinly sliced rare beef, green onions, basil, bean sprouts, fresh basil, jalapeno slices and rice noodles swimming in this AMAZING broth! A dash of Sriracha, Hoisin sauce and a squeeze of lime slivers and you got yourself a bowl of Pho that is simply hard to forget! In an armada of buffets and pretentious eateries in \"Viva Las Vegas\" it is refreshing to find places like this! The best part is...They are open \"almost\" all the time! ( please see hours of operation )\n\nThe place is nice, roomy and clean, the servers are attentive and does their job well. There is plenty of parking as it is located in some sort of a strip mall but don't let the location fool you as this place serves some really well prepared dishes. Try their freshly made spring rolls while waiting for your order, it makes my mouth water just writing this review about it!\n\nAll in all, I have no complaints, I highly recommend Pho Kim Long especially after a hard night of partying in the city that never sleep! \n\nEnjoy!
