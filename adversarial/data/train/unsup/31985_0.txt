I found my spot for some good ol' fashion southern cooking. Everything wife and I ordered was ON POINT! Had the catfish 4 pcs but when is came out .... lets just say i thought i got the hook-up but they said this is normal. Wife ordered the Po'boy grilled shrimp man it was TASTY... haha get it TASTY... man that was corny...hahaha. I got the greens ,red beans and rice and rice n gravy. I wanted more but i was so full! Absolutely going back!!! ....Check it out you might like it!!!
