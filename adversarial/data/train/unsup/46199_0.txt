First visit here, pub is fairly new. Red wine selection is pretty disappointing and the nachos could stand to have about double the cheese. \n\nThe pickle dish was delish and the beer selection on tab is pretty well rounded.\n\nIt new and therefore clean, the location is good and the pub itself is cozy with lots of tvs full of sports.
