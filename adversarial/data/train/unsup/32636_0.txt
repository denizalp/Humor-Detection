Hubs and I came here for taco Tuesday and I honestly don't understand the low reviews about the bland food. Between us we had the Korean beef, BBQ, ground beef, Baja fish and bang bang fish tacos. The new bang bang fish taco was so spicy I had to take a break between bites (and I ordered a jalepeno margarita to drink so I have a high tolerance for spicy foods). The quest with chorizo was also delicious! Atmosphere was fun although I suggest getting there early if you want to sit outside
