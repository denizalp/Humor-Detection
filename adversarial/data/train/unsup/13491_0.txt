What does $35 get you in Excalibur?  a 20th floor, 2 queen room with a fantastic view of the other tower and the back end of the castle.  \n\nBut at a price like that, how can you complain?  Its close to Luxor, NY\/NY, MGM, and Mandalay.  Its casinos have one of the loosest tables, and they have 'beer pong' tables set up so you can show off how you became Beer Pong champ at your old college frat house.  Slightly odd to find a BP table in the middle of a Vegas Casino though... And how do they expect us to order room service if no menu is provided?  Oh well, we did anyways.\n\nBut it's cheap and provides a shower and beds.  You don't need anything else.  And hell, if you came to Vegas you sleep, you're in the wrong damn city.
