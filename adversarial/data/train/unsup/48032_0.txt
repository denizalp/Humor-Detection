Good food, good value. If you want a decent cheap burger, Harry Drive in is the place but there are a few around like that (Johnny,Retro Burger). \n\nIt's nothing special. The patties are pretty thin but the double burger isn't expensive and usually solve the issue with wanting more meat.\n\nIt's not my favourite place but it still a good burger
