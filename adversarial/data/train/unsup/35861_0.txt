A wonderful show by an amazingly talented magician and comic at a very low price. Even though he's probably done thousands of these shows, Mac King seems to genuinely enjoy performing and interacting with his audience, with whom he connects almost immediately.\n\nUsing very simple props and conscripting several audience members throughout his performance to assist, King keeps up a very funny banter while displaying amazing slight of hand magic.\n\n Like all people I think of myself as being extraordinarily  intelligent and perceptive, but I couldn't see how any of the tricks were done- especially the one with the bear and the camping tent!\n\n Seating is by Maitre d', so consider tipping to get a good seat down front and center.\n\n And yes, Mac has more talent in his little finger nail than Criss Angel has in his whole, dumb, sculpted body.
