The boyfriend INSISTED we go out of our way to stop here for lunch. He raved about the sandwich he had gotten here years before. Apparently, things have changed. \nThis establishment is fine. There was a line, so obviously people love it. I wouldn't even have done a review if it wasn't for my unpleasant surprise...\nI didn't happen to be that hungry at the time we were in the area but once we got to the front of the line, I figured I should at least try something. I got a chicken bacon avocado wrap and I was looking forward to it. We were lucky enough to get a seat and my boyfriend dove into his sandwich. We were talking when I bit into my wrap and I actually spit it out all over the table. It was DRENCHED in balsamic vinegar! I didn't skip a beat...I jumped up and walked to the counter. I found my item again on the menu-board and indeed, the last ingredient listed was balsamic, so I have no one to blame but myself. It was pretty disgusting though and inedible so I had to toss it. It would have been fine without the vinegar all over it and I am not being dramatic that ot was an excessive amount. My boyfriend's Reuben was pretty darn good though so I would give it another try for a sandwich.
