We really love the food at Senior Taco. I love the carnitas tortas and actually got it based on the recommendation of the owner once when we went in. Sometimes I will get the carnitas flour shell bowl and that it a lot of food! It is a bit on the pricey side and I have had some issues with the employees not knowing what I am asking for, but despite that, I continue to come back bc the food is good. The owner of this chain often is working and he is super friendly. Try their carnitas! :)
