About as mediocre as you'd expect from a place like this. Greasy, unspectacular food. Our waitress was fine, and the food was very average. The homemade chicken noodle soup was terrible, and the french fries were of a very low quality. My chicken wrap was fine.  Everyone else seemed to be equally underwhelmed.\n\nThe whole interior could use some love and is very outdated. Also, the first thing we saw upon entering the parking lot was two of the cooks smoking. Not such a good first impression, and it almost made us leave.\n\nThe food was edible and cheap, so if that's what you are looking for, go for it. Otherwise, it's very similar to any other cheap greasy diner and a notch or two below what you'd get at Perkin's.
