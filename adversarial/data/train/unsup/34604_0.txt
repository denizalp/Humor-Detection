This is the first time I came to this location. I have been to their other ones before but this one is much bigger than the others. \n\nOn first glance, it looked brand new with bright interiors. When we placed our order, we saw that the person who took our order did not wash his hands before making our chicken shawarma. Yuck! He also put onions in our shawarma when we specifically asked to not put that in. \n\nOverall, the prices were fair, the food was okay and the portions were average. I might visit this location again as it is very convenient and their prices are okay.
