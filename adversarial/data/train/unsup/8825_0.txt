I HIGHLY recommend Lynch Auto Body to get any work done! I recently brought in my 2012 Dodge Charger for repairs on my driver side doors and Mr. Lynch went ABOVE and BEYOND expectations! It actually came out better than before the incident with professional paintwork and letting me know what was going on throughout the entire process! I will always come through this company if I need any work done!
