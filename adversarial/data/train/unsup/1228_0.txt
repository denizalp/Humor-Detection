Fellow Elite Karl, when's the list for Men friends arriving?\nNot greedy, just a simple White Chocolate Cheesecake[1] will do.\n\nI don't want to sit near the front entrance either.\nSit me where there's Skylight, so I can watch Birds poop.\nCan I tell them I'm Karl R so I can get the VIP table?\nI went for Dessert but the Dining Room looked so much Klassier.\n\n------------------------\n[1] Double-baked in Phyllo with Biscotti Crust
