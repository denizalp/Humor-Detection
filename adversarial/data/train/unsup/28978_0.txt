It hurts me to write this review. I've been here many times and was really really happy with their Friday fish fry. I don't know what happened recently, but the fish fry has been terrible. They changed the batter and it was hard, not crunchy and oily (so sad). With this being said, I'll give it another shot and see if things get back to normality.
