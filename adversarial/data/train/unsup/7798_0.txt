This is by far my favorite lounge at McCarran. We usually plan to arrive a little early so that we aren't rushed and usually spend the extra time in the Centurion Lounge. There is usually a lot of room and it's not too crowded. They have a nice selection for snacks and I love the espresso machine. Staff is always friendly and available if needed. I'm usually here for breakfast and I've always been happy with the food choices. There is usually some kind of cheese scramble and fruit compote for waffles. Always some kind of fruit water available as well. Everything is easy to access and always clean.
