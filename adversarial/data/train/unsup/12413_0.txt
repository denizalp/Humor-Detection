Received an offer good for a three night complimentary stay and thought why not. I'm only staying two nights and only have to pay the resort fee of $12 per day.\n\nHaven't spent much time at this casino or in this area of Vegas.\n\nCheck in was smooth and easy, once I found the hotel registration. Casinos can be so confusing.\n\nWent up to my room and was pleasantly surprised. Not the nicest room I've ever been in but much better than I thought it was going to be for the price :).\n\nThere were no longer any king rooms available so I have a double room, smoking. Can't tell you how long it's been since I've been able to smoke in a hotel room. Nice change from having to always be presentable when I want to go have a smoke. \n\nRoom is a bit dated, furniture is a bit banged up on edges. But everything is clean and the beds are very comfortable.\n\nFree wifi is included in the resort fee. There is a small outdoor pool with some nice chairs around it. It is kind of blocked by the buildings though, so not sure what time of day you would have to be there to actually get some sun.\n\nThe room overlooks the covered courtyard and in the evenings you can watch their laser, water show from your window.\n\nThere are quite a few dining options within the complex as well. A couple of fast food places, a buffet and few higher end options.\n\nAll in all, I am quite pleased.
