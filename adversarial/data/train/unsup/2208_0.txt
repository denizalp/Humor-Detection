Answer one thing before you read this review. Do you like watching 2 grown men grab each others collar and repeatedly punch each other in the face until one of them just cant do it any longer, while listening to a 60 year old woman behind you scream KICK HIS ASS at the top of her lungs? You can tell the truth... That is some entertaining stuff. \n\nI had heard lots about the Wranglers and was told multiple times how fun Hockey games are but let me take a moment and be real with you. I cannot stand watching the sport on TV. As a matter of fact I would rather watch Bob Ross throw down some happy trees than watch hockey on TV. When a friend of mine asked if we wanted to go check out a game I decided that it was time to give in and check it out. What's the worst that could happen? We go hang out with some cool friends and pay absolutely no attention to the game while chattin it up. \n\nThe complete opposite happened, Hockey live is absolutely amazing, the action is through the roof and man the minute they started fight my adrenaline went through the roof, my 2 year old son that was sitting on my lap almost did too because when those gloves came off we jumped up like there was a fire and he went right up with me. \n\nIt was too bad this was the last game of the season because I really thought about trying to buy some more tickets.. I think I have a hockey fan deep down inside of me.
