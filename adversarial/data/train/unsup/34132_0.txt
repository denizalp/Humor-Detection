I was conflicted. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but I'm going with three. It's a beautiful facility. The dealers were very friendly, but maybe I'm used to vegas. In sin city the casinos are full of options. Sometimes I just don't want to hit the tables, so I amuse myself whether it's music, movies, etc. There just isn't much option here and it only took me two minutes at a slow stroll to get around the casino.  However, the dealers were wonderful. In Vegas it's like a machine. They don't.have fun with you and its all very mechanical. Here it was at least a good time. So... entertainment severely lacking, and quick dining options were disappointing, but it was at least fun to play.
