I wanted to take my family to Oyster Bar for their last dinner in Vegas. Unfortunately, they got lost and by the time we got there, the line was already 20 people deep. My dad suggested we try Landry's Seafood across the street, which is how we ended up here. \n\nThe meal started off decent enough. The happy hour menu had some nice appetizers to share including the onion strings, calamari, and firecracker shrimp. My dad raved about how well-battered and fried the onion strings were. It was good, but I wasn't as impressed. I really enjoyed the shrimp, but there were literally only 7 pieces of the small, fried shrimp (making it $1 per shrimp). \n\nMoving on to the entrees, I got the crawfish étouffée and substituted my house salad with the lobster bisque. The bisque was literally 3 parts cream, 1 part salt, and trace amounts of elemental lobster. It was inedible. The saltine crackers were stale, which didn't help matters. On the flip side, I did enjoy the crawfish étouffée to an extent. There was bountiful amounts of crawfish meat, but not enough rice to go with the salty base. The fish & chips, shrimp po-boy, and burger that the rest of my family ordered didn't fare much better. \n\nWhile the food was lackluster and somewhat abysmal, the service was great. But, If Oyster Bar has a long wait and you're having thoughts of walking across the street for seafood, think again. You're better off hitting up a cheaper Vegas buffet for your money.
