Love the Swan! Really great food, excellent wine selection. Recently, it has gotten a bit of an attitude. A year ago, it was pretty much you show up, if there's a table, great. If not, you wait. Apparently they take \"Reservations\" now??! Seems a bit ridic. Staff have become a bit to hipper than thou, but the food is still brilliant.
