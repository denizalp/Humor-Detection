I can't comment on the cafe itself because it has been over 8 yrs since I've visited the place, however I recently tried their strawberry meringue cake. Compared to Maxim and Lucculas, I found it had too much cream and not enough meringue, there really was only crumbled meringue on the sides of the cake. It was ok, but not the best. However, the cake was fresh and it's good cream.
