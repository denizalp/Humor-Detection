What can I say? It's a buffet.\n\nDisclaimer: I have never paid to eat here. I don't even know how much it costs. My Uncle has Presidential-level points. For some reason, our family likes to come here every now and then and feast courtesy of his comps (though we hadn't been for a few years until last weekend).\n\nI do appreciate the Pasta Station. You tell the guy what to make and he cooks it. It's a good option because you know the food hasn't been sitting there for a long time. It's not unique by any stretch, but I pretty much always get a plate here on every visit.\n\nAs for the rest of the buffet, it's pretty standard. Nothing amazing. Well, I did enjoy the fried catfish. Yum.
