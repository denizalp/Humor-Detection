The food here is amazing and the pide is huge! Incredible value for money. Owned and operated by a lovely Turkish family. My friend I was with said this was the best pide he's had since being in Istanbul. If you're on the Danforth and looking for something cheap other than souvlaki, you definitely should hit up Mr Pide.
