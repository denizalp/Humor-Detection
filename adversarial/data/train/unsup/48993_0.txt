First of all, I would like to clarify that I wanted to give 0 star, but obviously I couldn't. To reserve a table, you can't call in but have to show up in person. Then you would be asked to come back in an hour even there probably empty tables inside. After we sat down and waited for almost half an hour, no one came to serve us not even asked if we need a drink. A waitress cleaned up the table right next to us dropped a glass on the floor and the broken pieces splashed all over the floor right next to us and of course under our table. No one came to apologize. Finally, this waiter walked over to us and asked if he could take our order. We said: yes, of course. But can you please give us a glass of water please? And then he walked away without saying anything and never came back. I saw him murmured to his colleague saying something like they only wanted water! Eventually we had to walk up and asked someone else to take our order. The food was not fresh and completely overpriced compared to other nice restaurants with excellent service. After we paid the bill, the waiter came to us to take the receipt and opened it up to see how much tip we gave before we left!!! THIS WAS SO RUDE AND DISGUSTING!!!! I think I am very nice enough to leave a tip and didn't make a complaint in public. However, this was the worst service I got ever in the United States. I will never ever come back again. If you want to come and try, I will warn you DO NOT EXPECT ANY SERVICE!!!
