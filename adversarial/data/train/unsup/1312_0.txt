These dumplings are seriously delicious. But if you have lower spice tolerance, come prepared to battle your body as you embark on this culinary journey (worth it though). I really enjoyed the pork and chive dumplings, but if you are not into those strong \"traditional\" Chinese flavors, the chicken & shrimp and pork belly dumplings are good as well.\n\nThey have an awesome lunch combo that lets you order a smaller portion of noodles + 6 dumplings for $12, which is a nice deal if you want to try multiple things. I died a little on the inside from the spiciness of the Dan Dan Noodles, but again...it was worth the pain.
