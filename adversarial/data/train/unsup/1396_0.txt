I love eating at the U.S. Egg in Tempe, was in the Chandler area, and wanted to start off the new year right by eating at a good breakfast spot! A lot of other people had the same idea as we did and when we arrived around 11:30 there was about a 15 minute wait which wasn't too bad since there are several benches people can use to sit and chill. It also gave us time to browse through the menu and pick out our food.\n\nI got my old standby, the half and half: 2 normal sized protein pancakes (Versus the flying saucer sized ones that come with a full order) and a skillet of your choice. My favorite skillet is the chicken bacon because of the mixture of ingredients and flavors. It was served with one egg (Ordered poached today). It was made very quickly, especially considering the high volume of customers in the restaurant today, and tasted great. The protein pancakes were slightly crispy with a hearty mixture of batter, oats, a touch of cinnamon, and blueberries. A full mound of butter and some thick maple syrup were the accompaniments. The skillet was equally as pleasing, with a filling amount of chicken, bacon, potatoes, and melted cheese. The only slight negative was that there was a very slim amount of paste-like avocado mixture on the skillet. In other versions I've had they normally give you a few slices of avocado.\n\nService was decent considering there were so many people eating here today, and I appreciated that the server left us a whole pitcher of iced tea and a whole carafe of coffee so we could serve our own refills. \n\nThe actual atmosphere of the restaurant is similar to the Tempe location, except the Chandler restaurant seems to be able to seat more people.\n\nOverall a good place for breakfast!
