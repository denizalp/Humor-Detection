Wow I must have really caught this place on a bad day, basically we stopped by for lunch one Sunday afternoon and ordered some burgers.\n\nWhat was good: \nPortion and presentation was good.\nService was friendly\nDecor and location was great\n\nWhat was not good:\nBurger was bland, all I could taste was the BBQ sauce.  Even when I cut a piece of meat on it's own without anything on it I felt it tasted like something freshly thawed and cooked in a microwave.\n\nThe other thing I wasn't crazy about is choices were not presented to us when ordering.  If the menu says you have a choice of A, B, C then ask the customer, don't just assume and bring them \"A\" because that's what 80% of customers choose.\n\nAgain I'm sure this was an isolated insolent and based on the other reviews I'll give this place another try and update my review based on that.
