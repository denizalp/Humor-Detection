The only thing that prevents me from giving this place five stars is the inconsistency and slowness of the service. The place has a casual, relaxed atmosphere and the staff is friendly, but it often seems to take forever for the food to arrive, even when the restaurant isn't busy or crowded. I have nothing to complain about regarding the food itself - for me it has consistently been good, the servings ample, and the prices reasonable. And I do like the idea that they serve both Asian and Italian dishes, so that Cherry Blossom is a logical destination for me and my friends when we want to dine out but can't seem to decide on one cuisine to have for the evening. If only the service were a bit faster ...
