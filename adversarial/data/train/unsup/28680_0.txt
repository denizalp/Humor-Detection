I've been here before, thought it wasnt bad.  I ordered the moo goo gai pan and asked for white sauce.  They put brown sauce.  I ordered it to go.  I went home and it was not good. The food tasted old. The pork fried rice was sooo greasy.  The egg drop soup had no flavor. So I took the plate back and I got sweet and sour chicken comped.  I know the lady in in her own native language wherever that may be cussed me out in the kitchen to the other workers!  I went home and I bit into a piece of sweet and sour chicken and was not good it was a tendon or something and they meat was chewy. That's cause I am preggers too.  NEVER AGAIN!!! I could see why the health dept shut it down in somone elses comment.  It seems like to me they are just ok with getting by.  Never will get better.  They say oh come back I make fresh food and talk smack behind your back when you get there.
