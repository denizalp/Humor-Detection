Wow! Stopped here and found a treasure tonight. Best Italian meal that I've had in decades. They just opened 2 weeks ago and under new management. \nYummy bread, salads, and the 2 entrees we ordered were both a 5!! \nI would highly recommend it. \nYes, they had a full bar, too. And, 2 TVs for game watching if that's what you like.
