Do you know what it takes to get photos in a supermarket without getting caught? More than you think. I can't just take a photo in plain sight because it's weird. Instead, I pretend I'm a spy and take some stealth shots like it's a surveillance mission. And I don't get caught. Homie don't play that. \n\nI'm getting this inkling that you're not sure if I qualify as a homie. \n\nDefinition of Homie: an acquaintance from one's town or neighborhood, or a member of one's peer group or gang. \n\nI don't live in Denver NC, but I do live in the next town. When I visit Publix in Denver, the staff says hello and smiles. Maybe I'm giving myself too much credit, but this makes me assume they remember me. Therefore, they are acquaintances from my area, and in turn, my homies. And that makes me their homie. In fact, the next time I enter Publix, I fully expect the older lady at the front to say, \"What's up, homie!\" and give me a pound. \n\nThis place is super clean and the staff is incredibly friendly. However, I bought a cannoli and the cashier said it was an eclair, but an eclair has the texture of a puffy doughnut; a cannoli has the texture of a cookie. I like both but prefer cookies.
