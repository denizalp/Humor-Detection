Not recommended. Diane Cole ignored our instructions.  She did her own thing which was to shave our dog.  We were not happy with the result.  The price is also $10 more than any other dog groomer, nothing affordable about this place! There are plenty of dog groomers in the area so please steer clear & go elsewhere.  My poor pooch was scalped & we had to go to another groomer the next day to get her cut corrected as the fur on her head & tail was left absurdly long.  Diane gets 1 star because we feel she may be well intentioned.  At least we hope so.
