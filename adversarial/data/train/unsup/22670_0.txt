Seriously, this company has the worst communication and customer service ever! I don't know if they just hire a bunch of incompetent high school drop outs or if they have zero training available, but they need to fix something! Twice now I have tried to get someone out here just to take a filter off my line from outside my apartment and that seems to be an extremely difficult task. It has taken me over a week to attemp getting cable hooked up and I still don't have it! I've been on the phone with them 6 different times and been into one of their stores even. Each time I talk to someone I am told something different... does anyone here know what the h*ll they're talking about?! I'm about to say forget it and go with a dish!\nI'm a very patient person and don't write many bad reviews, but Cox has got me very frustrated.
