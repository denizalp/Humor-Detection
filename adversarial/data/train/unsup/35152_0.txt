Holy moly amazing! This ramen establishment is the be all end all of amazing noodle soup dishes. Their portions are huge and that broth is something out of a fairy tail, I'm pretty sure it has magical healing powers (ok, so maybe not, but it is velvety and rich!) \n\nThe chef prides himself on finding the best local ingredients to add to his ramen as well as some unique sake pairings that you might not find elsewhere. There is also a soft serve ice cream machine that serves up creamy concoctions like strawberry basil or avacado. It's always changing so you never know what you're going to get when to enter. \n\nThis is definitely a noodle house worth checking out in Charlotte!
