Vegas is in peak heat and having two units on the house I was thinking I would not see a tech for 24 hours. Not so. When I called at 8am I was told a tech would be out between 12-2, at 10am I received a call that a tech was available if I was. Phil was the tech sent to us, he assessed the problem quickly and though we have an old unit that will need to be replaced eventually he did not push for a Hard up sale. Motor was replaced and when the unit is eventually DOA I know who to call. Thank you Phil for your professionalism and skill!
