The White Chocolate Grill is a nice restaurant with a good sized menu. Some things are super expensive but its nice because there's a range, not everything is crazy pricey! So I had not been here in many years but I went back for lunch today. \nI love a good house-made veggie burger and was happy to see this option on the menu. Was also happy to see all of the different sides to choose from. I went the unhealthy route and got fries though haha. The veggie burger sounded really delicious, with brown rice, quinoa, walnuts, all the things I like in a veggie burger! Unfortunately I do not think I read close enough and there was pickles on it. I like pickles in general but hate them on sandwiches for some reason, and felt like the taste was still there when I took them off so that was a tad disappointing, but my own fault haha. Also the bun was a bit soggy on the bottom and there was too much spicy mayo (which was not spicy). The patty itself was very good though and the sesame bun was yummy, the other veggies on there were tasty! I think if I go back I'd just have to ask for no pickles and no mayo then I'd be happy. It was still expensive for a veggie burger though, I've had cheaper ones that are much better, but I did like it. I tried the broccoli too and enjoyed it! Our server was very nice and chatty, and the atmosphere there is awesome. Overall, not my number one fave restaurant, but not too shabby!
