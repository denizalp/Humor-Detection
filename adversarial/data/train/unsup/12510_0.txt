I had a family member do her post-stroke inpatient rehabilitation at HealthSouth Scottsdale Rehabilitation Hospital. She was an inpatient for 4 weeks and made amazing progress thanks to the great staff of nurses, techs, and therapists. \n\nShe did about 3 hours of therapy each day (Mon. - Sat.) in Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy. They seem to have good PT facilities.\n\nThe doctors were generally good, but one of the docs she had seemed to just be going through the motions. For minor issues like a potential bladder infection, he would not take any action until she became septic instead of understanding early symptoms and immediately requesting urine tests. Not exactly a model of preventative care. But that was just one of the doctors. \n\nThe setting outside is pretty nice and peaceful, but inside looks a bit too much like a hospital (cold tile floors, and that awkward hospital pink and blue color scheme). Cafeteria is decent, they serve breakfast lunch and dinner for the patients, and visitors can eat there too for only $3 or $4. Nursing Techs help push patients around and help them with their food trays, and they're very friendly when doing so. They even took my tray from the table, and I was just a guest. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this facility for any stroke-related rehab as they specialize in that and have won awards for their service.
