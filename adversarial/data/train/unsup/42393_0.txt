I took my mom there to eat on Valentine's Day. The good was average good nothing extraordinary. The salmon blt was good but give you all a heads up that it is raw salmon. Mom had the Blackthorn burger and it was okay. Arthur's at South Park has the best burger and you don't need condiments to taste good. The service at Blackthorn was good. It was a good experience overall.
