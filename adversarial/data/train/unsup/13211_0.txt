Stayed: Thursday, 11\/19\/2015\n\nFlamingo is clean, neat, with simple and modern room decor -- great for travelers on a budget. The service reps were well-intentioned, but this hotel was completely understaffed and ultimately did not deliver on a good experience. \n\nWhen we got to the front desk at 1am on a Thursday night, we were shocked by the size of the line -- probably about 40 people long. Even worse, it took us an HOUR to get served. I want to say the line moved at the speed of molasses, but that's giving it too much credit. Molasses moves at 100 times the speed of that line. \n\nAfter we finally reached the front of the line, our front desk assistant (I think his name was Ty) was efficient and helpful. He got us out of there in about 5 minutes, helping my group with both of our reservations and getting us rooms in the same tower. \n\nSince our stay in the hotel was only one night, I don't have too much to complain about. I called asking for a toothbrush twice. The first time, they sent us towels instead. The second time, no one even came. Eventually, we just gave up and went to sleep. In the boys' room, they complained that the shower was significantly lacking in water pressure. Fortunately, we stayed at the Monte Carlo for the rest of the weekend, and our experience with them was much better.\n\nIn the end, I'm just confused on why there were only 3 assistants serving along the front desk, which clearly had about 10 spaces available. Flamingo simply needs to hire some more people for the front desk and for guest services. The current staff is nice and friendly, but there clearly weren't enough people working to serve such a huge number of customers.
