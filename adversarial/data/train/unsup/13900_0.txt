Nearly 7 months since my last visit to this specific BabyStacks. So, an updated review was in need. \n\nWhether you're local or visiting, you have to try Babystacks at least once.  My opinion, still one of the best breakfast joints in town.  You can still get your eggs, bacon, and hash browns at BabyStacks.  But let's be honest, it's all about their stacks.  You can't go wrong with most of their pancakes and it's their Red Velvet that they're known for. Other favorites for me include their Portuguese Sausage, Loco Moco (IKR?), Garlic Rice, Biscuits\/Gravy, Macadamia Stack, and their Adobo Fried Rice. \n\nRegarding this specific location, I have to say it's the best one to go to if you're looking for less of a wait and a bigger location.  At this location, you're almost seated immediately.  However, I still think the North Buffalo location is better.  Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm just loyal, but I think the food taste just a tad better at the north location. But please, continue to go the south location so that I don't have to wait as long at the north one. \n\nTIP:  On my most recent visit, I did something that I never do. I got a full stack of their Red Velvet pancakes. A short stack is usually good enough, especially if you're just complimenting a main dish.  I don't believe in wasting food so I cleaned my plate. I don't think I ate for at least another 5 hours after.
