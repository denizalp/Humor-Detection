I know this is a froo froo restaurant.  But....damn is it good.  \nI know the waiters may seem a bit snooty and polished.  But....damn is it good.  \nI know you may want to sit outside and they won't let you because you are not a high roller.  But....damn is it good.  \nI know half the time you cannot even understand the waiter's accent.  But....damn is it good.  \nI know the waiter looks at you as though you have bubonic plague if you forego his wine selection.  But...damn is it good.\nI know you have to mortgage your house, sell a kidney, and talk your grandmother into prostitution to afford the bill.  But...damn is it good.\nI know the restaurant is on the strip and the strip sucks according to food elites.  But....damn is it good.\nI know you can get tons of different fish, pasta, steak, or other exotic food.  But get the lamb chops....because damn are they good.
