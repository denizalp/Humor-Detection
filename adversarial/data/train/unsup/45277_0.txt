I like this location because they've always had what I've been looking for and seem to carry a little more specific products than what you might find at target or walmart. \n\nAlso, I use their drive-thru pharmacy which I love because you can handle everything online or through your phone application and set up auto refills. Super convenient. \n\nAdditionally, anytime you use the pharmacy you get 500 points on your rewards card. Their program is pretty nice, everything in the store has different points and the account is easy to manage. They always have some promotions going on. From now until march every beauty product you buy is 50 points on your rewards card. 1000 points=$1 and so on and so forth.
