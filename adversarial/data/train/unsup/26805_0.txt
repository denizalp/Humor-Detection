I stopped in to Defalco's grocery to grab a couple items before heading to a BYOB wine tasting. Grabbed some cheese, dessert, and some risotto and pasta to take home as well. I went in on a Friday about 3pm and this place is BUSY! The deli was busy, people in\/out, and it smelled freaking amazing. The food looked really good on the restaurant side and I will definitely be back there for some pizza and calzones. I can see why they have such amazing reviews. One thing I did wish they had was crackers (to have with the cheeses I just bought). They only carried bruschetta type bread, no crackers at all. The dessert case had some great stuff though. Nice shop.
