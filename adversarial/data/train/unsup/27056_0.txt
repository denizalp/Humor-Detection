This is going to be long but bear with me, it might actually be a funny\/good read.\nSo, I am local here and I used to go to Sports Station very often for the games and drinks. There was a hockey game on the 22nd of April and decided to go there for it. Made reservations for 10+. \nAs usual, during a big game night, waiting for your table to be set up is not much of an issue for me, although it was literally placed right in front of the entrance. I did not complain.\n\nSo here's where everything starts off, since I came to the place right after work, it would naturally order something to eat. I've ordered the \"filet mignon brochette\" for myself and drinks for the table. Finally arrives approximately 20 minutes I've ordered my dish, as hungry as I am, I start eating. On my second bite, I feel\/hear a crack on my upper right tooth. I spit it out and comes out a pebble with my broken tooth...\n\nI ask the waitress to get the manager for me right away, I managed to take pictures of the broken tooth and the pebble during the mean time. The manager comes by and asks me what's going on, I show\/tell him what happened and brings me to the side and tells me I don't need to pay for the food... Well... It's pretty obvious taken that I only took two bites and broke my tooth afterwards. While the manager brought me to the side, the waitress managed to take the food away which I didn't get the chance to take a picture of. Basically, my whole night is ruined.\n\n10 minutes after, the manager comes by again asking me to follow him. He takes me to the back where the kitchen is and tells me. \"Perhaps it came from the spice we put on top of the meat.\" I looked at him shocked and confused. First of all, the pebble is approx. 4~5 centimeter in diameter and the spice is less than 1mm. I mean honestly, what difference does it make whether it came from the spice or not?? If in fact it came from the spice, we'd have a bigger problem because the cooks would have definitely felt (apparently they use their hands) the pebble but still served me the plate with the foreign object. Besides, my plate had no seasoning on it anyways.\n\nI explain that to him, then gives me a facial expression telling me I am right. It was time to leave; I take down the managers' name, the name of the other manager who intervened, time of the incident and the name of the waitress. They also gave me a number (headquarters) to call to explain the incident and claim my dental fees which I had to make an emergency appointment the following day.\n\nThe next day as I walk out of the dentist, I give them a call, transfers my call to human resources\/marketing to explain the incident. A week later, they carry out the case to the director of operations. I have called the director of operations several times so that I may claim the dental fee I am entitled to but never managed to pick up. Also left several messages. 3 weeks later I finally receive a call and had to explain the case all over again. All in all, according to my phone records, I've called them over 25 times and I've received a call from them once. I've given them a month and a half which I think I was being more than fair.\n\nThe person responsible for my case made several false promises and claims to get the issue resolved. Of course, the issue is still on going. I wanted to get this issue resolved in a swift\/fair manner but never came to a conclusion in the end. All I have demanded was for the dental fees. (It has led me to making 3 other appointments to the dentist due to this incident). In the end, I have decided to sue, which I have.\n\nI have been very patient so far and I am finally posting this here because I think people should know what happens when you deal with people\/company like them. It's such an easy problem to resolve with proper communication\/cooperation. I have all the evidences in hand and witnesses.\n\nAnyhow, just thought I'd share this unfortunate experience I've had\/still dealing with them, not to mention several other incidents which involves my group of party, \"bouncers\" and police officers.\n\nIf anyone is curious, I will post final outcome.\n\nThank you for reading.
