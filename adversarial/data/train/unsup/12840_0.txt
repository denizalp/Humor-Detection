Worst service! The owner hops in and out of an elevator in quote unquote greeting customers like a bird pecking on a chip of wood and sets up a surveillance camera monitoring the whole premise from the entrance onwards. What a creep. \n\nThe worst of all, the guy is incompetent and almost breaks your glasses into pieces with clumsy hands. The price is a rip-off! He charges more than the market price at well over 100 dollars -- what should be no more than a 50 dollar job. \n\nDon't go there. You are better off with other repair places in Toronto. Don't ever go to Eyeglass Repair Centre.
