Great deal on food for the price. At first I thought it was super expensive, but wait until you see how big the portions are. Like really... I'm not exaggerating. \n\nI ordered a brown sugar banana flapjack, which was delicious. But I was expecting something the size of my hand. Instead, this one flapjack is bigger than my torso. I also made the mistake of making it a combo and getting eggs and potatoes on the side.\n\nI only finished 70% of my meal. But for $14, it basically served as breakfast AND lunch for me.\n\nDefinitely come and check it out, but come early so you aren't stuck waiting.
