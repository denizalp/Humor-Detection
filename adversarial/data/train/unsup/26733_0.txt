Wow, love that a place like this moved in down the street. \nInexpensive, fresh, delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant.\nMy soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole, which by the way is super creamy. Basket of chips are free, as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious. \nI plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )
