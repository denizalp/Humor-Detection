Came here with a friend so she could get her nails fixed (her acrylics had fallen off or broken in a week, twice!)The lady that did my nails buffed the skin on almost every finger which was painful. I got dip powder nails and they're pretty cool, but they don't look that great. They're lumpy in some places and have texture in others and I had to file the tip of a couple of them when I got home. I also found out that it's unsanitary to actually dip nails in the powder (which I thought might be the case) it should be put in another container or painted on so everyone isn't sticking their fingers in the same powder. They didn't look horrendous so I went on with my life and only a week later they are all lifting already. I don't want to even go back to ask them to fix it, I just won't be back. I feel terrible leaving a bad review especially because everyone was so nice, but I spent $70 here including a brow wax and tip and that's a lot of money for not great results. Also, the brow wax wasn't bad but I don't know that she didn't double dip and I suspect she did cuz I wasn't paying attention.
