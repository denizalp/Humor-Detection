PROS: Great seafood, great customer service, easy parking, clean dishwares \/ tables, \"bang for your buck\"\n\nCONS: Wait-times can be long for groups 4+\n\nI went with my girlfriend for dinner and we absolutely recommend the Tampa dish! Our server, Juliana, was very attentive and welcoming. This is a fantastic spot to bring your friends and loved ones! The entrees come with two sides, so they are usually more than enough to fill one person. Definitely try this place out!
