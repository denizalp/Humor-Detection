I know I'm gonna get a lot of attention for this but I'm gonna be the one to say it.  This place is the #1 place in Las Vegas to find your toys that you grew up with at a reasonable price and is wayyyyyyyy better than Toy Shack.  Yup I said way better.  \n\nWhen I first saw the shop I thought to myself, \"oh it's a small shop, they probably don't have that much stuff that I'm looking for\".  Well my Grandpa always said don't judge a book by its cover and I was wrong, they had everything I wanted.  I'm a huge collector of G.I. Joe, DC Comics Superfriends, Transfomers, and He-Man.  And they had them and more!!! I was greeted by Steve.  One of the nicest guys I ever met.  I was hypnotized to see that he had the original Skeletor figure and not only did he have it, it was complete with all its accessories.  He explained to me if I have a figure that was missing accessories, he would find it for you.  This guy goes out on his way to find whatever you need no matter if its a figure your looking for or if one of your G.I. Joe figures is missing a gun he will find it for you.  And yes I bought the evil Skeletor which you can see the picture here on this business page.  \n\nBetter yet the prices are so reasonable!!! They sell it to you for what it's actually worth unlike Toy Shack where they price for over market value.  Steve the owner said it best, He opened this shop for the collectors.  I'm fully supporting Rouge Toys, and will help them get their name out to be the #1 place for collectibles.  If you want to relieve your childhood or regret that time you where playing with your megatron figure in the backyard and you forgot where you buried him,  this is the place to be.
