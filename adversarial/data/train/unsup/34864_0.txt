I came by last night with a few friends, I was starving & really wanted a drink after a long day at work. The waitress took 15min to even acknowledge us & when she did this she only asked if we seated  ourselves or if someone sat us!?!? We then asked if they had drink specials she crossed her arms and said NO but if we moved to the bar booths we could get specials.. umm ok.. once we moved the other waitress told us the had no drink specials at that time that's when we realized the 1st waitress just did not want to wait on us. Good thing the 2nd lady was so so nice & checked up on us to make sure everything was ok.
