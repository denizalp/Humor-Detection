Update (5\/26\/10):  Mariachi Valle del Sol no longer performs here.  I don't know if Placido will hire a different group or not but whoever replaces them will be of lesser quality.  Maybe he'll rename the place \"La Casa Banda\" instead.  Until Valle del Sol gets another \"planta\", my Friday nights will now be at Cervantes' in Mesa.  \n\nThe very best thing about this place is the free, two hour mariachi show starting at 8pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.  Mariachi Valle del Sol performs, in my opinion the best group in Phoenix.  Headed by Armando Chacón, the group has seven musicians and will play your requests.  But please, gabacho, don't ask for Cielito Lindo again unless you are visiting from Asia or Europe.  \n\nThe main ballroom features banda\/ norteña music for the young crowd and has an admission charge so continue to the back for the free show in the smaller cafe.\n\nHey, Lisa, \"michelada\", Mexican style, often has Clamato in it.
