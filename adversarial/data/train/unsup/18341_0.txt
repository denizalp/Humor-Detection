This is one of those moments I'm glad I didn't read the Yelp reviews. This place is right in my backyard and I've been walking past it for a number of months. I'm a fan of AYCE sushi, although I understand you trade off quality or quantity . There are not many AYCE places up here in North York. I usually head downtown to Kyoto House for some reliably passable AYCE sushi. \n\nBut weather and a back injury at the gym had me and Ms. Brooks Brothers finally giving My Sushi a try. And I have to say, I was quite pleased. The Friday night\/weekend night menu is really awesome. There's a bit of inconsistency. The tuna sushi was great but the tuna rolls were a bit meh. A real find is the ginger ice cream on the dessert menu. I didn't think I'd find anything better than red bean. I'd come back here just for the ginger ice cream.\n\nService was good. The place is not big but they had 3 people working the floor and seemingly working each table.\n\nI understand there are some bad reviews but either we hit this place on a night where they were firing on all cylinders or they've seen some bad reviews and have recently pulled up their socks.
