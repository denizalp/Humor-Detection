Well my friends and I went here for a pool party that was going on. I had no idea the type of hotel that it was :-). But I must say, being my first time in an establishment as this one was very interesting. I'm not going to go into all the details because this is Yelp,lol! But if you're really wanna go with the saying \"What Happens In Vegas Stays In Vegas\" then by all means, stop by the Blue Moon. :-)
