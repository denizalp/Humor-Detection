My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place out during the day, but it was way tooo hot! So we decided to go after dinner on a Saturday night. I enjoyed this place! First time here but I will frequent it whenever I am in Vegas. It's a get away from all the hustle and bustle from the Vegas strip. It's sort of a roof top bar, but it's not super high up. Great views of Bellagio and the fountain show that happens every 15 minutes. Also a great place to people watch and watch the traffic go by.\n\nThey serve all sorts of beers. We only did one round and did not try any of the food. I'd like to try the food next time. Seemed like it was just appi's but the food we saw looked decent and like typical bar food. The prices were normal, we got 2 beers and the total was like $21 bucks. \n\nThey have tables and also bar stools across the edge of the roof, where the view is great. The bar stools were extremely uncomfy! My bum def hurt by the time we left! So that's one thing I would change about this place. Other than that, the ambiance is very chill and there are games all around which is super fun! It was a hot night and they had cool air flowing so it was comfy. The people that come here seem to be very laid back and normal, which is a nice change from the regulars of Vegas. I was way too over dressed because we had plans prior and after Beer Park, but I could have worn shorts and a tee and would have fit right in!\n\nThe bartenders were nice and efficient and the music playing was great! I actually was a huge fan of the music at this spot. We were singing away to the classics that were played. I would def recommend this place for all those who aren't about the party scene anymore in Vegas, which I am def over! Beer Park, I am a fan!!
