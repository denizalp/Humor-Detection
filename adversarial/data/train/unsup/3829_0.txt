Worst rental car agency by far at Las Vegas. Expect huge line to get your car. Minimum one hour wait. Staff is oblivious to long lines and regularly takes breaks leaving one or two people to service 15 person line. Worst is a guy named Jeremy Blair who insists on getting your hotel info. Real creepy. I will never be back.
