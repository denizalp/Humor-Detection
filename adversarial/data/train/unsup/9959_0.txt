I remember years ago, when my parents were doing some renovations on their home, my older brother (he's an idiot) slid his chubby body in between 2 studs and started bouncing back and forth while yelling \"I'M VEAL! I'M VEAL!\". Like I said, he's an idiot. But whenever I go to California Sandwiches and order the veal I always think of that. Luckily, my appetite comes back as soon as I unfold the foil and reveal the delicious mess in front of me...my destiny. \n\nThe negative points about this sandwich are undeniable. The veal isn't a very good cut, it's a long wait, the sandwich itself seems to be unnecessarily messy and the topping (such as peppers, mushrooms, cheese, eggplant, onions) are all extra making this an expensive sandwich, but in the end...it's worth it. \n\nThere's no getting around the fact that this is just a really tasty sandwich. It's certainly sufficient, even for a healthy (see: gluttonous) eater like myself. In fact a sandwich and a pop is usually all I need. I normally get the mild veal with cheese, mushrooms and onions. If I'm really feeling like ballin' strong I'll order some olives. \n\nAs for the other items on the menu...don't be a pussy, just get the veal. My friend \"Chicken Parm\" Phil used to only get the chicken (obviously) but after finally taking the plunge he claims he'll never go back. I guess he's getting his chicken parms at East Side's now.\n\nOh and if you're struggling with the ethical issue of eating veal, don't worry, I'm SURE it's not actual veal. Also, while typing this review I clubbed 3 baby seals to death. I wonder what I'll do with them...probably nothing.
