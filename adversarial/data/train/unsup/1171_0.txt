What a HORRIBLE experience at this dealership.  I worked tirelessly with them to option and order a new Dodge Viper ACR.  I even have a signed sales intent sheet from management.  They delayed the submission and build of my ACR and demanded more money to continue with the build.\n\nNot only that but they also kept my current Viper, a 2014 Dodge SRT Viper, in service department for OVER 2 MONTHS.  Why?  They failed several times to correct issues with my Viper's electronics systems and they HIT MY CAR while it was in service.  They damaged my car when an employee backed into it with another car while it was in their service department.\n\nDodge REFUSED to fix the damage to my satisfaction.  They REFUSED to compensate me for the time my car was sitting, damaged, in their service department and they lied about the time needed for repair, the parts needed to fix the damage and they refused to honor the items for compensation they initially agreed to.\n\nI send numerous owners of Vipers to this dealership on a yearly basis for service.  NOT ANY MORE.  I advise everyone to go elsewhere (like the Dodge dealership on Sahara).\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!  They will lie, they will delay and they will probably damage your car with their neglectful and incompetent staff.\n\nAnd to the guys at Towbin: Oscar, Tom, Joe, Steve, next time maybe don't lie and attempt to take advantage of someone who is an expert in social media and SEO.  I'm going to make sure everyone hears my story about your dealership.
