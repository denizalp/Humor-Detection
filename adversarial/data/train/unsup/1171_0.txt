The worst experience EVER!!\n\nI went there for a hair cut from long to medium (long bob), specifically asked for \"just under the shoulder\".  What I got is a \"just above chin\" short, old fashioned bob. The worst is the band. I never see someone just took out a bunch of hair and just do one cut , there you go! Even for my daughter the stylist will do it for layers. The band is the worst thing I ever saw! And I can't even fix it at this short! I want to shave my head bald now!!!
