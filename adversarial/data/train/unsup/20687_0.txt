Pink is Victoria's Secret's younger, more sporty sister. The colors are brighter, the sizes are smaller, the prices are lower, and the sweatpants have words on the butt. I am too old for this. They definitely have some cute stuff, but I'm not a trim twenty year old, and they couldn't give a hoot about my business (as a corporation, generally - the local staff seems friendly enough). I would definitely consider them if they expanded their sizing, but since they're aiming for teens and college women it's likely not in the cards.
