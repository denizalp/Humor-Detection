Always on the lookout for good coconut shrimp. Not only do they have it here, but for Happy Hour it's a steal!\n\nAfter doing some shopping in the rain, the bf and I worked up a healthy appetite and wanted something for lunch that wasn't the typical bar food. After walking all around town square we decided to drop into Claim Jumper to check out their menu. We'd both been to CJ in other states\/locations but for whatever reason had never been to this one.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised when we looked at their lunch menu, it was filled with salads and sandwiches, not the greasy cheeseburgers and fries we'd seen everywhere else. While he put more money in the parking meter I waited for a table. I noticed that right in the lobby they had a huge sign with their Happy Hour info. Being that it was a Saturday, I wasn't expecting to find a HH, but was thrilled to see we'd made it with 10 minutes to spare.\n\nThe HH specials are great (Check out my photos for a listing of offerings)! Tons of options for both drinks and food. We sat at the bar and were ignored for the first 7 or 8 minutes, we sat discussing whether or not they would let us order from the HH menu at this point. But when we were finally greeted our waitress didn't even glance at the clock. She happily took our order, got us our drinks and gave us a few more minutes before coming back to tell us it was last call for HH pricing. 5 stars for that service, most people\/places would have told us we were out of luck.\n\nEverything we tried was off the HH menu. We ordered 2 orders of the Coconut shrimp - 1 each. They came with 3 decent sized pieces of shrimp, 2 sauces and a spicy slaw like salad. The Shrimp was perfectly baked and left me wanting more. $6 each.\n\nWe also ordered 2 Mini Caesar Salads which were anything but mini! We could have shared one, although at $3 each, who cares? They were good but too many croutons for my liking.\n\nWe had an order of the Spicy Asian BBQ Wings - 6 wings plus carrots, celery and dressing for $5. These were tasty! I'm not a huge wing fan, so you know if I'm downing them they gotta be good..\n\nFinally we had a couple of Mojitos $5 each on the HH menu. The consistency in flavor wasn't great, one was more minty than the other, but not bad none the less.\n\nThis will definitely be a spot I return to if only for the Coconut Shrimp, but knowing they have HH options that are outside the greasy bar food will likely bring me back as well.\n\nTIP: Happy hour specials from $2. Mon - Fri 3pm - 6:30pm, Sat 11am - 3pm. Also during football season Sunday all day!
