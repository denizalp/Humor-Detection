Stayed in room 226.\n\nRoom was clean and updated.  Bistro open until 10pm.\n\nBathroom could be better - basically has a tub-fitter instead of a real shower\/tub with real tile. Walls are thin - I can hear my neighbors as I type this.  \n\nMy big gripe is surrounding when I checked in.  I checked in on the Marriott app -basically making it so I could walk in grab my keys and go to my room.  My keys were not ready.  Also,was handed my keys in a the paper key holder with the room number exposed, enabling the man next to me to see where i would be sleeping.  With security measures under heightened scrutiny, you would think that they would be on their best behavior.\n\nI would return to this location again.
