I had a great experience with Silver State Golf Carts. They have a great selection of new and used golf carts and were very friendly to work with. Note that I showed up to their location at 4:45pm on a Friday...they close at 5pm. \n\nI didn't feel rushed at all and everyone was very pleasant even as the clock ticked away. I ended up purchasing a used utility cart that same day as I wanted to have something fun for my cupcake company staff at the Las Vegas Foodiefest. The Silver State Golf Carts staff went the extra mile to not only make sure the golf cart was cleaned and prepped for the wrap guys to modify, but also installed a rearview mirror and tossed in a few extras. They also took the time to step me thorough all the details in relation to operation and cleaning the batteries. They transported the cart for me up to the wrap\/modification guys and even extended my warranty.\n\nI will definitely be purchasing from them again :)
