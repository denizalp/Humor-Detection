Totally wish we'd been able to stay at Hotel Kutuma for our entire trip! It was a beautiful and affordable little boutique hotel, situated in a great location so you can easily walk to all kinds of fabulous restaurants, tourist spots, coffee houses, shopping, and Mount Royal.\n\nKutuma is a very small and eclectic hotel. All of our Uber and cab drivers were like, \"what, where?\" when we gave them the name and address. There are only a handful of rooms, I'd guess no more than 12-15, and the theme is African! Animal print everywhere and a fantastic Ethiopian restaurant down stairs called Blue Nile (which I'll write a separate review for). \n\nOur room, a King Suite, only cost us about $450 for 4 nights - taxes included. That's a fantastic deal, especially when our experience was so wonderful and unique. \n\nOur room had a king-sized bed of course; a large TV mounted to the wall; a pretty huge comfy couch with big pillows; a large coffee table with wine glasses and place settings for 2; and a kitchenette complete with refrigerator, electric stove top, microwave, toaster, clean dishes\/cups\/silverware\/wine glasses, a coffee\/espresso machine, a tea kettle, and storage space. It was so perfect.\n\nThe bathroom was spacious and ultra-clean. There was just one sink and not a ton of counter space, but no big deal. The only thing I truly didn't like was the frosted glass bathroom door. From the room, you can see right through the door directly to the toilet (especially because the bathroom isn't around the corner or anything). I mean, it's frosted glass, so it's not like a clear window.. and I was traveling with my significant other... but I still like privacy in a bathroom! \n\nThe concierge and staff were wonderful. We showed up our first night at 1 AM, and they gave us a call to make sure we were okay and knew how to get there, plus they sent us up some complimentary wine upon arrival. It was an extremely relaxing visit, and I would totally recommend Kutuma to anybody looking for a unique, clean, affordable, and intimate hotel with a delicious restaurant\/bar right down stairs.
