This is my new favorite sushi place! I just wish it was closer to me.  Tried this place after receiving a raving recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint. Authentic sushi that arrived fast and tasted amazing. Fresh, quality ingredients and really friendly and accommodating service. Chef Juno is a star.
