I've been dying to get to Tacos El Gordo since I crossed the CA\/NV Stateline from Los Angeles. I just learned they have a few locations around town between the Strip and North Las Vegas. My family here in Vegas, originally from Chula Vista, CA, used to frequent their taco shop on the west side of CV which is currently located on 'H' St. These street tacos are DA BOMB!\n\nAs soon as I stepped into Tacos El Gordo, I suddenly felt as if I've transported to Tijuana B.C. (Baja California). Mariachi music, smoke from the sizzling carne asada, spatulas clanging against the hot grill, handmade corn tortillas, and the carving of the shawarma al pastor meat from the vertical rotisserie. My eyes instantly turned to red hearts!\n\nJust look at the photos. Freshly made, straight from the grill, cheese quesadillas and carne asada tacos in street size form. Yes, they are tiny but pack a great flavor! The carne asada meat is fantastic - nicely marinated and finely chopped, sprinkled with cilantro, onion, guacamole, and tomato. Additionally, I like to squeeze fresh lime onto the asada and then top it off with the dark red salsa. Then there's the complimentary grilled green onion and jalape√±o. All very good!\n\nThe Horchata is great! Nice notes of cinnamon and vanilla in this rice water drink. And there are free refills. I love it!\n\nMake sure to read the menu board and fall into the appropriate line that is responsible for making Asada, Cabeza, or Adobada\/Al pastor to place your order. Yes, you may want food from a different line so bring a buddy to avoid a delay. After you receive your food, walk over to the cashier to pay. Seems a little awkward. Just glad it wasn't crazy busy so I could still enjoy the tacos while they're hot!\n\nQuality meat packed into quality handmade tortillas, topped off with fresh vegetables and excellent salsas, at ~$2.50 per taco, all make for a fantastic Taco Tuesday (or any day for that matter)!!
