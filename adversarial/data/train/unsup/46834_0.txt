Respectable variety of bagels and spreads.  My heart fell when I walked in and saw that the everything basket was empty, but I was actually in for quite a treat, as a new batch was about to be ready.  So I ended up with fresh, warm everything bagels - so delicious.  And I noted that the \"everything\" (sesame seeds, poppyseeds, etc.) wasn't burnt or falling off all over like at some other places.
