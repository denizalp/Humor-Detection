My visit left my noodle a little limp actually all of them were limp.\n\nWe ordered a small pesto with chicken, the pesto sauce was good but the entire dish was cold and the chicken was literally over cooked on a flat top grill with no seasoning and was luke warm.  \n\nWe also ordered the Japanese pan fried noodles.  The pitiful sized portion (small) was not evev enough for my wife the noodles tasted old and limp and cold.  The flavors were ok. \n\nThe curry soup was just ok.  She didn't even finish that and was still hungry when we left.  \n\nThe staff was good.  There appeared to be an owner or manager there but he was the one cooking and I hesitated to complain about the food to him, with the thoughts that it would be taken personally. \n\nI would go back,  just not for dinner and not anytime soon.
