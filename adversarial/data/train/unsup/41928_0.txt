What a quaint little spot!   Crepes everything.  I took my teenage daughter here and it stole her heart. She loved the vibe and so did I. We were both very pleased with our selection,  I got the papa k, the mushrooms were amazing.  She got the ode to sundae, sweet but not overly sweet.  She also got a chai tea and after tasting it I wish i had too, but the line was out the door. Very casual,  make yourself at home.  Water and coffee is self serve. Specialty drinks are made to order.  Definitely going to be a regular breakfast escape.
