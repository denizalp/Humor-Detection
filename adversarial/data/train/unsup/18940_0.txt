Excalibur is one of those hotels that looks much more attractive on the outside than on the inside. Decent place to stay for the price though and in Vegas, all you need is a clean shower, bed. as well as working AC.\n\n- the rooms were bigger than i thought...bathrooms were spacious and clean too\n- our TV remote didn't work and the decor was worn\/outdated\n- the AC worked well and we used it to keep our beer cool haha\n- beds were fairly comfy and didn't notice any questionable stains\n- the best part was the pool area...there was a waterfall, 2-3 separate pools, music playing, and had cool lounge chairs (not the ugly plastic ones) and free towels\n- the casino had my fave penny slot machine!\n\nNot the best but not the worst! I would stay here again for the right price.
