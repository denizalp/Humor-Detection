I was in search for something light and healthy for lunch while I was in the area last weekend and this one came up on my Yelp search.\n\nI saw several of my trusted Yelpers reviews and pictures, I knew this place was going to be good and it sure was.\n\nI started my lunch with Pitaya smoothie. It was a very hot May afternoon, dragon fruit sounded really good. They were busy with lunch crowds, I found a table outside in the shade but it was still warm, so this smoothie was just perfect.\n\nAsian salad with chicken was refreshing too. Liked the dressing, perfect food to have when you don't have much appetite as they go down easily, I finished my salad and I was full.\n\nI got to taste my friend's acai bowl. Good balanced food to eat. While it was good, I thought it was a bit sweet and it took a long time for them to make it. Around the time I was about to finish my salad, acai bowl came. \n\nI think I would have enjoyed more if indoor seating was available on the day I visited. It was just too warm on that day.
