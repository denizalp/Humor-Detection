If you're looking to watch a movie, 4 stars.\nIf you're looking to eat out, 4 stars.\nIf you're looking for a sugary treat, 4 stars.\nIf you're looking for a great glass of wine, 4 stars. \n\nPretty much, if you're looking to spend money, 4 stars. \n\nThis isn't your nightly hangout spot. It's not the public domain in which you people watch, although it gets pretty hoppin' during the weekend nights. From upscale restaurants to unique eateries, this place certainly gives you options. C'mon, it's the perfectly modern Date & Movie kind of center. But, I like it. \n\nI'm not going to go every weekend, mind you. But once in a while is certainly a-okay. There's plenty of parking in the garage, or you can park across at the Biltmore and use the underground passage. It's a short trek, and everyone knows when the weather is nice, it's a rare treat to be able to walk more than 15 feet without hyperventilating, or sweating so badly you look like the creepy guy at the gym - you know, the one with the horrid pit stains. \n\nIn any case, this is a fun spot to go. It's a great date spot, I think. Case in point: Man waits with flower at Valet. Sleek black car deposits sleek woman in black attire. Man hands woman flower. She smiles. They walk toward Houston's. Uhm... I'm pretty certain that's a date. And it happened at the Esplanade. Right before my very own eyes. I swear.
