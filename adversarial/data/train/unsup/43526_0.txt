I am so bummed, but I feel I need to give Parlour 2 stars based on my experience this evening. I was here in 2015 and had a lovely little meal before Siegel's was open. Tonight, my husband and I stopped in for drinks.\n\nWe ordered an Old Fashion and a Moscow Mule. Both were served in the same glasses as the water we asked for. Perhaps these drinks are just not in the bartenders typical repertoire. Perhaps they didn't have everything they needed to make them properly. Whatever the reason, while my Old Fashion was just so-so, my husband's Mule tasted like a sour lime-aid with no alcohol or any hint of sparking ginger beer\/ale. If we were charged $5 or $6 for them, I would have probably just laughed it off and not returned. But, our 2 drinks totaled $20 :\/
