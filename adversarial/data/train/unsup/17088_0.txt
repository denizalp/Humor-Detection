My wife and I came here on a freezing cold late Saturday afternoon.  We found street parking and rushed to get inside.  It wasn't too busy when we first got here.  We were greeted by the hostess and sat right down at a two seater.\n\n We had looked over the menu a little bit before we came here so we sort of knew what we wanted.  Our waitress was nice and she came over to ask us if we had ever been here before and if we would like her to explain the menu.  We let her and she did a good job explaining everything to us.\n\n We ordered their Meat Bao bun that had Oyster in it to start us off.  For our main dish I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and my wife got the Inferno Ramen.\n \nOur Bao came out within 10 minutes.  It looked good. Our waitress said that if we were sharing it they would cut it in half for us but they didn't but  no big deal we cut it and shared the bun.  The actually bun was good but we felt that it needed more filling.  It was a lot more bun and less Oyster.  It was good but we have tasted better.\n \nOur Ramen came out about ten minutes later.  Our dishes looked really good and we were hungry.  My wife liked her dish and you can read her review on her Ramen.  My Ramen was good but not great.  The noodles were really good.  The broth warmed us up and was good but I felt it needed a little more salt or something to bring out more the flavors in my Ramen.  I'd give it a six out of ten.  I like the vegetable in my Ramen but the chicken looked a little funny to me and tasted funny too.  The Ramen filled me up and I was satisfied.  Not the best Ramen and maybe a little over priced but if your in the area and it's cold out this is a good spot to try out.
