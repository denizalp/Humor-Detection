\"OK class!  Repeat after me...Overpriced Irish Bar Food\".\nNow, don't get me wrong-I dig this place, but mainly for the outdoor seating and awesome atmosphere.  It's a great place to bring out-of-town guests-especially if you wanna relax and kick-back a few beers.\nI usually order the fish and chips and curry french fries.  Be warned: the FULL size order are 2 huge fish pieces..wow...lots of food, BUT not great food.\nOur waitress seemed a little more impressed with herself than us, so that was annoying. Come to think of it, her attitude could be justification for my 8 month old to fling his Fisher-Price teething ring at her as she 'occasionally' sauntered past. \nMy summary is:\nIrish banger (burnt)wonton appetizer+2 dinners of fish and chips+4 beers=$89.00!!!!!\nBundle that up with Little Miss Prissy Pants and I left thinking I could have fried my own fish and drank a couple Guinness while relaxing on the patio in my PJs.  All that and have $60 still in my wallet.\nGo have beer and sit outside.  Eat later.
