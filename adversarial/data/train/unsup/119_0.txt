Sun City Animal Hospital located in Summerlin,  Las Vegas NV.\n\nExcellent Service EVERY time I come here.\n\nClean Atmosphere.\n\nCaring Staff.\n\nEager To Accommodate EMERGENCIES!! \n\nCompassionate Veterinarians Found Here!\n\nI have brought all of my pets to this location since 2001. I have never had anything less then the  BEST treatment for my Labrador  or our cats.\n\nToday was no different. We did NOT have an appointment, however our cat was behaving quite odd and seemed lethargic, maybe even in pain. We rushed her here and we were treated with kindness and complete compassion.\n\n Alexandra showed us to an exam room explaining that she was doing her very best to get us squeezed in. She was very kind and extremely professional.\n\nDR. MARISA YOUNANIAN was a true ANGEL!!\nShe evaluated our cat and gave us some suggestions as to what may be the cause (possible UTI, crystals or stones). \n\nShe answered ALL of our questions in a caring manner. Our cat had no problem warming up to her. That was the amazing part of the visit!! Unfamiliar surroundings, not feeling well, and our cat seemed to look at the doctor like she knew the doctor was gonna help her. That made us feel so good, given the situation. I felt like our pet was in the \"Best\"  hands.\n\n Dr. Marisa Younanian demonstrated the  perfect balance of compassion and honesty. \n\n Finally, Check- out with Joe was fantastic. He was friendly and even followed up with us by calling us at home regarding our question. Much appreciated. \n\nOur cat is now doing a little better. We are now waiting for the lab results which can take a few days.\n\nI Am Happy To Recommend Sun City Animal Hospital, Based Not Only On Today's Visit, But ALL Of Our Experiences With This Clinic.\n\n 5 Star Service By The Staff!! Special Thanks to Crystal (past visits), Alexandra, Joe and The WONDERFUL Dr. Younanian.
