As usual, I'm pretty divided on my review here. It's certainly better than 3-stars, but not quite 4.\n\nThe service is fantastic. I went around 3pm and they were fast, friendly, and accurate with my order. The price wasn't bad at all either.\n\nI ordered the pork sandwich, with a half-rack of ribs, cole slaw, and potato salad. The dinner combos come with a roll too.\n\nThe roll was good, but absolutely generic. Then again, you don't care about the roll, and neither do I.\n\nThe sides were solid. Nothing overly great, but no complaints at all. The coleslaw improved with pepper for sure.\n\nThe pork sandwich was a great choice. I don't mean to brag, but I'm pretty proud of my decision. It was lightly seasoned, with a great smoke flavor and managed to be both moist and have texture at the same time. It came sauceless, but the sauce was a definitive addition.\n\nSpeaking of sauce, let's move on to the ribs. (Sure, the segue was awkward, but you'll see how it works out.)\nThe rib meat was awesome. Great smokey aspect to them, crisp edges, tender meat, and pull off the bone with not too much pressure at all. The meat alone would've made this review much better.\n\nSo, what's the issue? Great question.\n\nThe ribs come out smothered in sauce. Not Kansas City-style, but just doused in it. The sauce is great. It's heavily peppered, which can seem overpowering, but in moderation is a great addition. The sauce bath knocked the ribs way down, both in flavor and enjoy-ability, which is a real shame considering how good the meat was.
