After 6 years as a Pittsburgher, it seemed well overdue for a cruise on the Gateway Clipper. I booked the sunset dinner cruise which sailed on a Friday evening. It comes with a buffet dinner and a 2 hour sightseeing cruise for about $50 a person. They offer alternative vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free entrees but you are required to select this prior to the cruise. I selected the vegetarian baked vegetable strudel which tasted like a frozen TV dinner that was not microwaved all the way through. I relied on the sides at the buffet to fill me up. They had the typical options: salad, dinner rolls, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, assorted vegetables. Everyone also got an apple pie which was a 3\/10 at best. Long story short: the food is not good.\n\nAfter the disappointing meal, we went to the top deck to enjoy the sightseeing portion of the cruise. The captain gives a brief history overview of the city for 20 minutes then you just enjoy the ride. Even though I've been in Pittsburgh for a while, there were a lot of cool things that I didn't know or haven't seen in the city. \n\nOverall, I had a great evening despite the almost inedible meal. I recommend coming for the sightseeing cruise and finding food elsewhere.
