A great dinner sponsored by one of my vendors.  16 of us were placed in the seats by the sidewalk windows....witness to the freaks going up and down the street.  The KISS guy and Superman were on full display.  Only slightly more laughable than some of the tourists.  The waitresses were hot and efficient.  The tequila list was extensive, tasty and expensive.  The chips were hot and fresh, the salsa and guacamole were top nothing, too.  My chicken fajitas were delicious.  I always give an extra star when the meal is free, right.  Everything just tastes better when money is no object.  A great view, decent service, decent meal and lots of eye candy.
