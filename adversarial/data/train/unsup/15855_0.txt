I came here recently for brunch and I think I will add it to my list of favourite places for a slow weekend brunch:) \n\n- Takes online reservations -- so key to avoid lineups!\n- Small menu but plenty of options from your classic eggs benny to more unusual (and healthy) options like socca crepes (a gluten free chickpea based grain) with hummus and chickpea salad. I went for the latter and it was light, tasty, and just the right size portion-wise. My DC had the chorizo and it looked great, especially the egg -- perfectly soft with a gooey yolk. \n- Friendly servers\n- Interesting cocktails (I didn't try any, but they sounded great!)\n- Good espresso\n\nI would be back for brunch and I'd also check out their dinner menu. There is also a sweet private dining room in the basement that looks like it would be fantastic for a small party (seats ~15 for dinner and more for cocktails\/appetizers).
