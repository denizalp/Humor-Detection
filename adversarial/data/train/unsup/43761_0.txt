Met a friend here for tasty tapas!  Service was prompt and courteous. My faves were the Baked Brie puffed pastry-light crust with just enough sweetness with the raspberry sauce;  the  White Truffle Pizza was perfect-great flavor and crust; and the Beef and Pumpkin was tender and tasty. Wish the portions were a bit larger. Ordered enough items to share and not be stuffed. \n\nI hope that add a good Moscato to their wine list!
