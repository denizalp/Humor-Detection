The service ain't the best -- typical and to be expected at an authentic Chinese restaurant. I am Chinese so believe me on this one. \n\nBut the food. The food is authentic and really good. We ordered a saut√©ed green bean dish with fried pork. Noms. We also had XLB (xiao long bao aka steamed pork buns). Finished these suckers. And a spicy Szechuan style fish filet and tofu dish. Really yummy all over white rice! \n\nOh and also -- they have the cutest delivery driver! Say hi to him!
