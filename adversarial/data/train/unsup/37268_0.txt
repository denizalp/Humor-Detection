Good bubble tea but quite expensive. I go here often and sometimes service is great, but other times it may take a while to get your order. The matcha milk tea is my go to, but even their regular pearl milk tea is quite good. My biggest strife with this location is that parking can be a nightmare during peak hours. Always reccomend CoCo for good bubble tea and will come here over Cha time in most instances!
