You know those Werther's Original hard candies that your grandpa keeps in his pocket? Okay...that's exactly what the butter beer latte tastes like. No joke, for realsies. This is the drink that evidently led flocks of people to converge and apparently was also sold out for days at a time. Maybe a brilliant marketing ploy? Law of supply and demand? Or perhaps just the latest viral like white vans and whoever Daniel is. This too, shall pass -- The lines seemed to calm down anyway, or at least in the latter part of the day when we went.\n\nDisclosure: I've never been into Harry Potter, nor tried to be. For those that are, Bad Owl's howling your name. From an outsider's perspective who knows nothing about the wizardry, I did like the dark brick affectation and the follow-through of its motif. Refreshing to see something OTHER than the minimalist hipster, too-cool-for-school vibrations that some of these newer coffee shops tend to exude. Yay on being different.\n\n**The gear-grinding (no pun intended): Lattes = expresso + milk. Why oh why would you name an item on your menu a \"latte\" if there's no expresso in it? You're telling me I'm paying almost $5 for a 12 oz. glorified milk and an extra dollar if I want the expresso part? Don't fool me with your wording and ask me if I want an \"extra\" shot either if there's not even a single one in the first place. Truth be told, I couldn't even taste the expresso even though I did opt for the \"extra\" shot, and I'm caffeine-sensitive, too. Boo on extortionate pricing. \n\nI'm not sure if this is the case for all their lattes. If so, coffee's way overpriced along with their bakery goods. You're paying for the ambiance and novelty.
