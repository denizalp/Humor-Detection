On a quest for the best torta in Phoenix, I came here looking for it but left enjoying another dish instead.\n\nI came during non-peak hours and noticed a number of families enjoying their meals. I thought this was a good sign and hope this would be \"the place.\" \n\nMy eyes directed me to the Tortas on the menu. With twelve different types, I knew this was another good sign. I picked the \"Mexicana\" with Chicken Fajita $9.99 (beef or chicken fajita, cooked with tomato, onion, jalape√±os, melted chicken, avocado and refried buns on the top bun) minus the melted cheese and mayo. The choice of chips, french fries or salad came with my torta. My excitement grew as I waited patiently for my food to arrive. Within ten minutes, I had my freshly made torta with a side salad. From past negative experiences, I made sure to peel back my bun to make sure all the ingredients were in place. Unfortunately, they forgot my avocado and cooked tomatoes and onions. Whomp whomp whomp. The well seasoned strips of chicken was cut into generous pieces yet didn't have any vegetables to balance the torta. I added the pickled onions to give it a punch of flavor. The telera (bun) was soft which I prefer compared to the crusty bolillo. I also thought this was a little bit over priced for a torta. Maybe it's just me??\n\nThe bright spot came when I tried the Huaraches with Lengua (Beef Tongue) $7.50. The Huaraches (translated as \"sandal\" in Spanish) was made with masa and beans and deep fried\/pan fried in a shape of a sandal and topped off with meat, veggies and cheese. Their lengua was cut into cube sized pieces and spread throughout the dough. I added the red sauce to each bite for the extra spice factor. Great choice and highly recommended!\n\nTo polish off the meal, I ordered the Churro de Canela $2.50 (fried dough rolled in sugar and cinnamon) with a side of strawberry jam. The two churros were piping hot and crispy but were inconsistent in the middle. It wasn't a grease sponge but rather light and crunchy. \n\nThey served a complimentary side of picked red onions, chips and two salsas. Warning: red is waaaay hotter than the green.\n\nThe interior had no frills and it was nice to watch the cooks behind the glass window preparing our meals. The staff was kind and knowledgable of the extensive menu. They also offer Taco Tuesday $1.25 each (compared to $1.50 regularly). \n\nThis business opened it's doors ten months ago and the one thing I really appreciated was the staff's EFFORT to make us feel at home. IMO, effort is trying and comes from the heart and not an afterthought. \n\nOverall, not the best and the search continues.
