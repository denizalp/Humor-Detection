I would contend to you, dearest Yelper, that I date attractive women. Or at least they're attractive to me. That's the important part, right? \n\nBut that doesn't mean that when I go out with them I always want to be able to see them... or worse yet have them see what I'm doing... And who knows what I'm doing when I'm there because I can't see the hand in front of my face. LOVE that... \n\nThe music always gets me grooving in my chair and I'm going to say something politically incorrect. I always feel cooler when I'm hanging out with African Americans. They just give off a cooler than cool vibe. I keep inviting my Afro-American roommate out to whatever and he's always like \"Naahh Dude, you're too white.\" I get it. But I'll break him down eventually. Little does he know I'm Mongolian. \n\nSo anyway, it's a little difficult to order a drink and always crowded but overall I love it. Bring your stuck up yuppie friends. Smack their skinny asses with the iron hand of culture. They'll thank you tomorrow.
