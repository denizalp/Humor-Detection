I'm a snowbird.  It's no secret that my winter home remains unoccupied much of the year.  I've asked this office not to leave advertising stuffed in my door because I really don't want to advertise to would-be criminals that nobody has been home for a while.  Although the broker promised us that they would comply, they either can't or won't follow that simple request.  Most recent offender is John Bell.  If they can't follow simple requests one has to wonder how they might handle a complex transaction...like the biggest purchase of your life.
