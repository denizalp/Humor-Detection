Apparently, poutine is a Canadian staple. My friends and I were visiting Canada and wanted to experience it the right way; considering this place pretty much exclusively sells poutine we figured it would be the best spot to try it out.\n\nRegrettably, it wasn't my cup of tea. I didn't like the sauce nor the cheese. I was assured by three different people on the staff that the sauce (normally gravy in the US) was vegetarian, but I still had my suspicions. I would've been better off just getting a basket of plain fries.\n\nThe worst part was the service was super slow and disorganized. The interior was pretty expansive and reminded me of an old wooden pub. \n\nI love French fries with a passion but I guess poutine just isn't my thing. Sorry, Canada!
