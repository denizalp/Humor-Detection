This was a great trip to Mesa to get my windshield repaired!\nThe front desk rep Dede not only welcomed me and had my apt paperwork ready to go she  also worked the SHOP RO and reduced the new windshield down another $50 and saved me a bunch of money. The windshield was installed promptly and the service Tech Dustin answered all of my questions and gave me some helpful tips to ensure the repair would stay solid. Great staff, I got to witness the environment with other techs and the mangers and it seemed like a pretty cool place to work. Very pleased with the overall experience and Dede and Dustin were fantastic. \nAcura TL 2012
