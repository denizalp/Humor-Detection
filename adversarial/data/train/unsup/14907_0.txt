As I walked into Gallo Blanco, I felt like I left Arizona in 2010 and entered a big city in 1975 with its incredible retro vibe. Making its home within the Clarendon, Gallo Blanco has quite the reputation in Phoenix, so needless to say I was excited to check it out. \n\nThe atmosphere at Gallo Blanco is vivacious and packed full of restaurant goers most nights of the week. The bar is intimate as is the seating area. With a modern meets Mexico feel to it, the character begs for you to have a margarita and guacamole the second you sit down. Since it's crowded and not overly large, be prepared to wait if you visit in the evening during prime dinner hours. However, if you are forced to wait, they invite you to wait at the rooftop bar or by the retro pool and they'll call your cell phone when they are ready for you. \n\nNow let's move on to the food and drinks. Their margaritas as excellent. Not too sweet and not too thick. I could easily have 1...2...or 6 of them. The guacamole is tangy and tasty. I think I tasted some pineapple chunks in there and the taste had a nice kick to it. As for the entrees, I need to give Gallo Blanco another try. I liked what I had, but it wasn't what I expected. I ordered the honey chicken with tortillas and expected it to be almost fajita style. Instead, it came out as a full half chicken that I had to cut and make my own tortilla. Once I got through cutting through the whole chicken, the marinade and seasoning on the fresh tortillas accompanied by the sauce was quite tasty, but it was the process getting there that makes me want to try something else on the menu. We sat on the patio since it was a busy night, which was nice and quiet. Next time when I try something different in the cuisine department, I'd also like to dine inside as well. \n\nAll in all, I had a good experience at Gallo and I give the overall evening four stars, but I will need to experience the cuisine there a couple more times to really rate it to a higher extent.
