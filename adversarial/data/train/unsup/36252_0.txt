Already a huge fan of Culinary Dropout and other Fox restaurants, I was super-excited to try this place. We had reservations, so there was no wait. The place has a very cool ambiance - nice, but casual. Everything we ordered was pretty amazing. To start, we split the roasted beet salad. Delish. My date had the Halibut and I had the Salmon. Both were cooked perfectly and I would have licked my plate, had it been appropriate. We were done with our meal, enjoying some wine (good selection, by the way) and had some time to kill before the event we were going to was starting. Even though there was now a wait at the door, our server (who was awesome) made NO attempt to rush us out. Excellent experience, great food, great service. Can't wait to go back. :)
