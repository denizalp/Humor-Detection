Bernard's is a French Bistro located at one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas, Lake Las Vegas. I've passed it many times and this past Saturday I went for Brunch with my Girlfriend and her parents. The service was very friendly and helpful with breaking down the menu for those not familiar with French food. Though despite being a fancy looking place our bread basket came out with mainly toast and jam which kind of took away from the experience being that I expected Croissants and more\/a better baguette. It's rare for me to critique the starter and apologize if I come off pretentious but I was not impressed. My girlfriend had the Spinach & Artichoke Crepe which looks great. Despite ordering it easy on the fondue both My Girlfriend and her mom felt it was still too cheesy and not leaving you desired to have more. My Girlfriends father ordered with Fish & Chips which should be an easy mark to hit but after trying it we all agreed it was very bland. I however lucked out with my meal when I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon. The eggs were done perfect and served on a nice durable English Muffin. Usually places put too much or too little Hollandaise sauce, but not only did they put the right amount but the sauce it self was very well balanced. It wasn't too sweet at all yet full of flavor which I find rare. Of course the Smoked Salmon only helped being that it was a nicely prepared portion leaving a light spice and an amazing taste in my mouth (The seasoned potatoes served with it weren't bad either). Unfortunately it seems the dished are a bit hit and miss but I give it 3 stars for the Service, Location, and the strength of my dish in particular.
