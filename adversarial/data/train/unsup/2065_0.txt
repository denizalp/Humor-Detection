Where do people who don't know how to park within the lines go? This place! LOL! \n\nBut no worries, don't think about it when you're looking for a space that would fit more than a bike. You'll have plenty of time to think about how those people managed to obtain a Drivers License while you stand in the long, stagnant line OUTSIDE. Yes, you read this correctly! Due to the large amount of people who frequent this particular office & the tiny size of the building itself, the line starts outside. Don't forget your deodorant, water & walking shoes people! There is a tarp that covers the area where the line forms. As I stood there I saw little lights dancing on my skin and the floor & I thought \"how cute, they drew designs on the tarp\",,,, uhhh, no. There are tiny holes all over it from wear & tear, lol. I also observed the large number of people who feel it's necessary to bring an entourage.... really?! I understand needing moral support or witnesses from time to time, but PLEASE, this is not that place! Unless you're accompanying a senior citizen or minor, of course :) \n\nOnce you get inside you stand in another line to get a #. Then you either sit in one of the retro looking and feeling seats OR you stand in any tiny space available waiting to be called up if all the chairs are taken. \n\nThe people who work there are very appropriate (not friendly, but professional) & seem to do their job as quickly as they can. \n\nThis place is too small and understaffed for the amount of traffic that goes through there. Someone said that after 2:45 the crowd thins out, but I don't know if it's really true, lol. \n\nIt would have given it only 1 star, but they get an extra star because the employees were polite.
