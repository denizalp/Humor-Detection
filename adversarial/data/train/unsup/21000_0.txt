Location is good, wish the management and ownership were. Expect this place to raise rent every lease term for an old building with pest problems, loud neighbors and inefficient staff and management. I have lived here four years and it has gone downhill. Teenagers and kids (I am a parent btw) tend to climb fences, run over buildings and walls with non-existent parents. Alliance management is HORRIBLE, paint up buildings while doing nothing to improve inside of apartments. Want roaches? They're here. I heard they had a rat problem across the street. I love this location but can't stand the poor management of Alliance. Behind this complex is Sierra with a lot of crime. PP has had car break-ins, problems with rain and flooding in apartments, mold problems. The corridor has a lot of foot traffic and unknowns. Kids have to be monitored all the time. If you're young twenties it could be great for you but not good for a small family. These units are old and very loud!  You will hear everything upstairs and downstairs. Mailboxes have been broken into twice. After being here 4 years, will not renew my lease. ALSO - there are obvious FAKE reviews on here, just another sign of a large rental company asking people to raise its review setting with people who don't live here. In response to Ashley O. - pictures posted of \"beautiful\". I have lived here four years because of location, not because of you or \nAlliance. Alliance makes you pay two months of rent to break a lease and increases rent for month to month.
