We came here for Mother's day at noon.  The place was not busy at all.  I have never been to Verrado before... OMG, it is like the set of a Weeds or Desperate Housewives.  Everything is perfect:  lawns, trees, houses, kids, etc.  \n\nThe place is on main street and easy to find (on the corner).  Cute modern decorations with indoor and outdoor seating.  \n\nWe ordered:\n\nPlatto Misto - Assortment of cured italian meats and cheese served with olives and breadsticks:  All the meats and breadsticks were good.  The cheese was a little hard and dry.  \n\nComplimenti alla Mamma Pizza - Mozzerella, Ricotta, Ham, Salame, Parmigano Reggiano & tomato sauce:  YUMMY, love the thin crust.\n\nClinque Formaggi (5 cheeses) Pizza - Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Provolone, Ricotta, Parmigano Reggiano:  This was my favorite, so good.  Excellent!!!\n\nAmericana Pizza - Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Parmigano Reggiano, and tomato sauce:  It was good, but a little greasy.\n\nAll the pizzas are thin crust and oven baked (like Sauce).  The service was OK.  When our cups when empty the server had to ask if we liked refills (you can clearly see with all the pizzas on the table that we were still eating), so yes refills on drink would be nice.
