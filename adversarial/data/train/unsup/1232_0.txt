I'll make this short and simple for those just doing a quick browse.\n\nNarcisse is all about the environment and the decor. The chandeliers, furniture, even the freaking bathroom, its all absolutely gorgeous. Its a place to have a fancy brunch and dress up in your Sunday best. The lighting is bright and happy and the live music (2 dudes playing acoustic songs) was just perfect.\n\nUnfortunately for me and you, that's where the positives end. The food is decent but overpriced at $12-14 for tiny eggs Benedict. They also have $10 bottomless bubbly 'but notice that they don't pour you actual champagne - aka its not french- the stuff we had was a Mexican brand, so be prepared to drink about 8 bottles yourself to break even on that deal.\n\nFood aside, my biggest issue with Narcisse was the server. For such a swanky place, it took waaaay to long to get any kind of service. I don't know if it was an under staffing issue, but our server (who apparently was also the bartender?) took about 30mins take our orders, another 40mins to get our food and a good 45mins just to give us our checks. It was a painful wait, especially since the restaurant was not packed (or even half full). Thankfully one of the other servers\/bus boy passed by our table to fill our champagne as our actual server was nowhere to be found.\n\nshort version: come for ambiance at the risk of incredibly slow service. Food is mediocre, champagne is Mexican and decor is fabulous.
