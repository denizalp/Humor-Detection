This is my first time at Pizza Hut. Shocking, I know! This place has been hyped to me on and on... to the point where my mind believed it was the most magical place on earth. So of course for my past cheat day, I picked this spot! Ordering is easy, as all pizza is. We ordered online and at this point I could already predict this is a place I wouldn't eat probably more than once a year. They offer tons of options that will lead to human depletion. \n\nWe picked this combo that let us have a medium pizza and two sides. Of course we opted for our own toppings and I bombarded my side with pineapples of course. As for the sides, we chose boneless chicken bites and the Caesar salad. We went to pick it up and we were pleasantly surprised to see it was ready in 10 minutes! In and out, I drooled all the way home with the warm pizza in my lap.\n\nIt's very rare for me to eat pizza nowadays so I dug right in and yes it was delicious. Soft, warm and exactly what I expected. It was good, but did not blow my mind especially with all the hype I hear. The salad was insanely small for a regular- I don't know how this is a share dish. The dressing that came with it was probably heavier in grams than the salad itself. Thank goodness they don't mix it in for you.. the boneless bites were good. Nothing more to say than just good. After 2 slices (keep in mind these are the small square slices) and a bit of salad, I felt a huge stomach ache as it felt like my stomach was clogged. I felt super sick and heavy and couldn't continue on. \n\nPizza Hut? Definitely overhyped in my opinion. Maybe it's because I don't eat this stuff often but I've never felt such pain eating pizza before so I don't know.. of course the food wasn't bad.. only the aftermath was.
