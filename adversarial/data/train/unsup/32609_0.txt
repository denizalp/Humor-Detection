So I bought my wife a gift card so she could come here and get a cut and style ect.  She called and made her appointment and was told that if she didn't come in today at 3 then she would have to wait until next week.  We showed up 15 mins early for the appt and there was literally 7 employees standing around the register just talking.   My wife checked in and the girl she made an appt with was not even there yet so they told her she had to wait for here to come in.  After we stood in the isle feeling stupid for 20 mins they offered us a seat.  Actually I think it was when a couple employees got up from the seating area to actually go do something.  After we sat down 2 ladies came to the register and asked if they needed an appt and were told no and they took them right back, but told my wife she needed to come in today because the were booked for the next week?  Really?  After the cut my wife's hair did not look any different than when she goes to Cost Cutters and it is 4 times the price?  She was not happy with the service or the price.  I thought the service was horrible and just wanted to do something nice for my wife.  This is a clique store that I am sure the employees friends get excellent service, but the outsider typical middle aged woman gets poor service.  There are many other places out there that will appreciate your business so I would suggest taking it there.
