Came for breakfast and got seated immediately. It was around 8:30 on a Sunday. \n\nThe staff were attentive and quick. Enjoyed the atmosphere as well. \n\nI ordered the chicken farm scramble and my sister ordered the meatloaf hash. The biscuit was my favorite part! They give you blueberry preserves to spread on the biscuit - a very pleasant, delicious surprise. There was a lot of tender, well seasoned chicken in my scramble, along with cheese and peppers. I got the grilled mashed potatoes on the side. This almost felt like dinner for breakfast, but I'm the type who loves that! There are more traditional breakfast options if that's your thing. Tried a bite of the meatloaf. It was ok. However, my sister was a fan and really enjoyed it. Again, more like dinner than breakfast. \n\nI'm going with four stars because the large portions are not worth it in Vegas. Like, I'm on vacation and not taking leftovers. I'm on the move too much. Plus, we ate here right before checking out. Taking leftovers weren't even an option. I wish there was an option to get the same menu option but in a smaller size for a little less.
