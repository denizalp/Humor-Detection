Long ago, I used to be a loyal Hot Dog on A Stick employee. I don't frequent it as much as I used to, but nostalgia always brings me back! This particular location in Town Square captures all the good things about this staple mall food that I've always loved. One of the things this location has (that I'm not sure if others have) are great combo deals and discounts, so you can load up on all the delicious fried food, for much less. The funnel cake sticks here are well done, but there's a funnel cake place right next door too. \n\nPro Tip: Park in the South parking structure for an easy walk to their outside stand.
