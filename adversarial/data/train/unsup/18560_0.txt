WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nTheir steaks! Especially the prime rib and the rib steak! But all their steaks are known for one thing in particular...they are HUGE! \n\nThey take pride in their portion sizes and their service and I have to say, I have to agree with that!!! \n\nDon't expect this steakhouse to be a fancy fancy steakhouse, but expect that the portions are huge, the service is great and you'll have a wonderful meal. The steakhouse reminds me more of an upscale diner for steaks. Not much effort goes into the sides or desserts or how they age their beef and sauce they marinate it in, but for the relatively same price you pay at other steakhouses that'll only cover you for the steak, the entree at this steakhouse will include a salad, a side of cooked vegetables, and a side of your choice. The bread to start is also warm slices of bread with garlic spread mmmm yummy! You don't get a lot of places that serve you garlic bread!\n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nA lot of ppl come with the gift certificates purchased from Costco to save 20% off the meal so maybe that'll be a good idea for you too! Make reservations! Because even though it's located in an industrial area, this place gets busy!!
