I was served these carrots with my cheesecurds. They were dry,shriveled up,and had, slimey spots. I asked for new ones, and the server returned with another set on unacceptable ones and remarked \"I just opened a new bag and they all look like this\".\n\nMy thought- just bc you open a new bag does not mean its not spoiled inside.\n\nNote to management- Train servers to use better word choices with customers.
