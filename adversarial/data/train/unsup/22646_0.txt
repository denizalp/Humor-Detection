This resort is more like a hotel than a full service resort with lots of amenities.  The rooms are nice and the exercise facility as well.  It is a couple long blocks from the Strip but not too bad of a walk.  You do have a full kitchen that you'll most likely never use as the dining options are too plentiful and good on the Strip to eat out for every meal.
