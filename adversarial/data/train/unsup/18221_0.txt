Came here with a group of 11 on a Monday night for Cleveland restaurant week (3 course Prix fixe menus, $33 per person). Very classy, nice ambience. Started with bread, white and multigrain with a herb butter. We got a few fried calamari appetizers to share, they were very tasty, with capers and a creamy sauce on top. My friends and I ordered different  things and shared. I'm just going to say that everything I ate was delicious and flavorful. The spinach and artichoke dip was baked, so the top was crusty and the rest was creamy, and it came with crunchy pita chips. They were quite more crunchy than normal. The mussels came in a creamy white broth, with crispy\/crunchy garlic bread. Their soup du hour was a carrot ginger soup, topped with goat cheese, it was super creamy and flavorful, the ginger was light, not overpowering. I enjoyed it, and I'm not crazy about carrots or ginger. The winter salad had dark greens, beets, candied walnuts, and goat cheese, very fresh and tasty. I got the bistro filet (medium rare, because that's the only way to eat steak), with polenta cake and brussel sprouts. By the time we got to the entree, i was already very full. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly, but the polenta cake was amazing. I totally thought I hated polenta, but in the past I've only had bland, dry, poorly done polenta. This polenta cake had a crisp outside, and the inside was amazingly creamy and soft, a little cheesy and flavorful. It reminded me of jade tofu, because it was so soft on the inside. All my friends loved the place. The servers were very attentive and friendly as well\/ It's a little far from where I live, but definitely worth the trip, hope to come again in the future!
