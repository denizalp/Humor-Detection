3 1\/2 Stars!\n\nMonte Carlo is one of the most underrated hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.  I suppose if the room doesn't cost more then your car note per night its not good enough.  Well shame on you, shame.  I have had the pleasure of staying at the Monte Carlo on more then one occasion and let me tell you it does not disappoint.\n\nPRO:  The Smell.  Seriously, it smells sooooo good in this hotel all the time.  I find myself walking through the hallway and casino saying aloud \"OMG it smells so good\".  Even when I'm sober.  Now that's major.\n\nCON:  I completely forget about this place when I'm planning a trip.  I'm so sorry Monte Carlo, I really am.\n\nFunny story.  My cousin and I were on our way out to the club.  Looking cute and stuff.  We get in the elevator, and there.... Is a girl who just got out the pool.  Oh wait, no... she pissed on herself.  Not only is she pissy in the elevator but she keeps saying \"Lance Burton.. Master Magician\".  HILARIOUS.  We still make fun of her to this day.\n\nThe rooms here are nice, typical Vegas rooms (that smell really good).\n\nOf course, if the possible get the Monaco Suite.  It is spacious and mid-level luxurious.  Luxury without the price tag of a 5 star hotel.\n\nStay here, you wont regret it.\n\nGood for: Romance, Girls Trips, Guys Trips, Relaxing Weekend
