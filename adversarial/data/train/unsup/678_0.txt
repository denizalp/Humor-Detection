Unless you've planned a bachelor party to Vegas to the tune of 18 guys, you never planned a bachelor party. Let me tell you, it's  like trying to herd 18 drunk cats. While searching the web for Vegas tips I came across Vegas Party VIP. Jeremy worked with me over the course of a couple months. I honestly could not be happier with the results. Anytime I had a question Jeremy was just a phone call away. I bugged the holy hell out of this guy and he never complained. We arraigned a lot through Jeremy. Limo service (if you can get Albert as your driver get him, he's one cool dude) Club service. Which is crazy when you think about 18 guys wanting to get in a club. Jeremy was busy the night of our club, but he had his partner Rich make sure all of our needs were met. They love their customers to be happy. I was very happy!
