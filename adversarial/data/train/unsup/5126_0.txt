While the pasta is fine here I find the prices too high particularly given the small pasta portions. I am a huge fan of pastas and risottos and make both several times a week and recently spent 2 weeks ion northern Italy. The wine list is fine with a few high end wines (Barolo - my favorite wine - but again pretty elevated prices) available by the glass. Given the combo of small portions and high prices I can only rate this place a 3.
