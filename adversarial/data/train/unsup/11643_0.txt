5 stars for their fried oysters! I think I'm addicted to them now. They have a cripsy outer shell and the oyster is so moist inside and the juices just kind of explode in your mouth! Delicious!!!!!!!\n\nI tried the Miko's roll last night.....not a big fan of their sushi. The sushi rice was way too vinegary and the seaweed was so tough that I could barely break through with my chompers. \n\nOverall, I still heart Miko's....just not for their sushi.
