The only thing that shined was the creamy hummus and the tzatziki.  The chicken and steak kabobs seemed dry and the greek lasagna too soggy.  however, the dolmades and spanokopita were great.\n\nConclusion:  Maybe I expected better because someone greek recommended over Market Grille Cafe, but it was not worth definitely not worth it for the price we paid.  The only other plus was that the service was pretty attentive.
