You'll have fun here, but you'll need a shower after you leave this place if you go on 80s or 90s nights...  sweat from dancing but also cigarette smokes.  this bar is RIDICULOUSLY smoky.  So, so, so smoky!  \n\nThe drinks are pretty damn good, I highly recommend the Long Treasure Island, it's like love in a cup.  Actually its all sort of rummy goodness and its so good that even my guy friends will drink it despite the fact its pink.\n\nThis is a safe bar that gets a diverse crowd of friendly people.\n\nTry Belvedere's out on a club night.  I've gone there on a week night and it was full of gnarled locals.  okay, just locals.  they werent excessively gnarled.  A little gnarled.\n\nDon't bother dressing up or wearing heels, just show up and have a good time!\n\nMy only problem with Belv's--other than the smoke--is that there is inevitably that moment I have every single time where I'm like...  \"What the hell am I doing here?  I'm too old for this.\"  If you are over 30, consider going to the Thunderbird with the rest of the grown ups bc this is not your crowd.\n\nUpside:  if you're 30 youll look younger than all the hipsters at Belv's who are all 23 but for some reason want to look like they are 60 with their beards, ugly glasses and 'grandpa got drunk and dressed himself again!' outfits.  So, there's that...
