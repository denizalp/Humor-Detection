A relative of mine received a Death By Chocolate cake from Signature Desserts o'er the weekend, and thus I was granted an opportunity to try it. \n\nOr did it try me? \n\nThis was one Luciferian cake, I'll tell you.  \n\nI'll quote their website, since I couldn't exactly tell what was in it...\n\n\"Rich chocolate fudge is nestled between three layers of moist Devil's Food cake, iced with a chocolate buttercream icing, then topped with a pool of dark chocolate genache. Ghiardelli-brand chocolate chips finish this magnificent chocoholic's cake.\"\n\nPure seductive,confectionary malice, it could have been decorated with a Sabbatic Goat of marzipan!\n\n Eating a slice of this was delicious peccancy.
