We ordered tonight for the first time since they reopened. We enjoyed it in the past and were in the mood for burgers tonight. Service was fast and the order was right. However when we got home to eat we found the french fries SO SALTY!!!! I had to lay out paper towels and wipe them down. After that they were perfect. An inconvenience for sure but whatever we moved on. Onion rings were huge and delicious, I ordered those with no salt so no problem there. The main issue I had was with my burger. The lettuce was a joke!! A thin, wilted, tiny piece. I can forgive some wilting due to the heat of the burger but this was just gross so I pulled it off and didn't eat it. The meat wasn't what I remembered, flavor was okay, texture was just a bit off. For almost $30 for two burgers, fries and onion rings, I expect better.
