Waaayy too drunk from Encore Beach to check in or take pictures.... Me and my friend stumbled in trying to find a place to eat before crashing for nap back at the Linq Hotel. We were only wearing our bathing suits, so the manager was like \"honey, you cant wear that in here....\" so i put on my kimono and he gave me an a-okay sign. ....good thing bc i had no other clothes on me and i was STARVING (aka no breakfast or lunch, just alch and its 5pm).\n\nWe ordered a fettuccine alfredo with chicken to go and waited at the bar. Where these two nice young bartenders were talking and entertaining our drunken selves. They were telling us stories, asked us where we went... etc. Super fun, gave us water to sober up a bit. And you know when youre drunk, everything seems to pass by super quick?? yeah that happened, BUT OMG the wait for the food was ridiculous!! i swear we waited for like 45 minutes or some shit. If i wasnt drunk, it would have seemed like 100x times longer. The price of food was really expensive too.. alfredo with chicken was $24 dollars....... and it wasnt even that big. \n\nBut when we got to the hotel, god damn that food was soooo GOOOOD. it had peas, chicken and two slices of toasted bread. I'm still not sure if it was bombbbdotcom because i was drunk, or if it was actually hella good. We inhaled that like we havent eaten in.... well it was almost 24 hours. \n\nI would probably come here again... if i was drunk and starvingggg. and close by. LOl
