OMG, one word: LATTE. On tap!! \n\nThis place is crazy cool, we came off the elevator from our room and saw the sign for the latte on tap. Now I'm intrigued. There is no line, I walk up to the counter and ask for a iced latte stat. The counterperson gets the process started. There are two types, a Nitro latte and the cold brew latte. I don't think I'm jonesin' for a nitro latte so cold brew it is!\n\nThere is no need to mix milk or sweeteners because coming out of the tap the drink is naturally sweet. While you're on line, walking to the cash register is a visual treat. You're able to see all of the yummy pastries on display at Jean Philippe Patisserie. My wife screams, there is a Nutella stuff pastry. Eeeek! I'll have one of those thankyouverymuch.\n\nThere is a little sitting area to relax and enjoy your coffee & dessert, 24 hours - 7 Days per week. Jean Philippe Patisserie, you complete me.
