Repeat customer due to the great job the first time. Couldn't be even better. I opted for the stronger whitener at a minimal added cost as I drink lots of tea and Diet Coke. Meredith can work 6 people at a time, know who needs what and does not miss a beat. Price, quality, service, I have found the only quality place for tooth whitening in Maricopa County. I recommend White Teeth AZ very highly.
