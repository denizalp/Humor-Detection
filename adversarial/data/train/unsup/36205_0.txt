If you know pho, you would know their broth is from a can.  Go dumpster dive in the back and I bet you will find those cans. I have eaten literally a thousand bowls of pho from largest viet communities in orange county, seattle and all over vietnam, so I kind of know what I am talking about.  Their steak meat isn't even the right thickness.  This is consistent with my hypothesis that if the menu is too big, it is difficult to make everything tasty.\n\nThey charge $12 for a vermicelli bowl. Wtf, seriously? The fish sauce a bit on the vinegary side too.  You are just paying a premium for the wine-glassed water and cloth napkins.\n\nTheir spring rolls are ugly but tasty, but the again, any idiot can make good spring rolls.  You just need fresh ingredients and a decent sauce.\n\nFor pho, go to Pho Hoa.  I am sure every pho hoa in the nation boils their own broth.\n\nI feel so bad for these folks who love this restaurant so much.
