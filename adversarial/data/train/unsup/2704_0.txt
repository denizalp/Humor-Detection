I realize that you get what you pay for, and Excalibur was for sure the cheapest place to stay on the strip during my last Vegas trip...but still.\n\nThey put us on the very first floor, 'cause we're high rollers like that, so we had the pleasure of seeing both ants in our room and a ROACH in the hallway.  Damn.  \n\nThen there was the service.  We called the front three times in our two day stay: Once for more towels (which didn't come so we had to call again only to be told they would \"check\"), once to order room service (which took over an hour), and once for more toilet paper.  The last time we called, my friend said that the person they spoke with COMPLAINED that this was our third call...really???  Sorry you had to actually DO YOUR DAMN JOB...\n\nFinally...the people that stay here are definitely the weirdest, especially the creepers that post up in the casino.  Oh, and there are lots of kids (it's a castle themed hotel with a jousting show, so you kind of have to expect this, but I like my Vegas sans brats).\n\nIt is seriously worth it to pay just a little more and stay at Luxor or something...trust me!!!
