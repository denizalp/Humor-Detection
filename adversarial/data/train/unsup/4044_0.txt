I actually got a little excited to be eating here since I'm a huge ramen fanatic. Let me just say I will not be going back here. Our waiter just seemed to be catering to the table next us and not too interested in us which I found to be really rude. Second , I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and was very disappointed. The broth was just average and I was blown away from the fact part of my ramen was still a little frozen. I have to say that I did appreciate that they did not charge me for my ramen, thank you... I really appreciated that. Now onto the appetizers were a different story. The shrimp tempura was delicious, crunchy and had some tempura veggies... which were all amazing.
