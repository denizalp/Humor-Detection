Loud trendy bar and hot dogs joint onWest Side of Cleveland.  Menu includes veggie and beef dogs and a monster list of toppings- I had the veggie with egg and hot salsa- a breakfast treat- I also tried a great local beer called Holy Moses- named after Moses Cleveland.  Bar tenders are great- I like the long bar with is semi circular with attached stools. This is a good spot.
