I am an online student. I was placed in a local intern placement where I was sexually harassed by the supervisor. ASU pulled me from the placement and expects me to repay to take the same course again when none of it was my fault ($500+ for a one credit course). Further, my husband also is an ASU student we are both majoring in the same area. They are continually up his butt for all different problems from 3 way phone conferences to placement phone calls and then they want him to register for more courses even though he can't budget it. After these last two internships he has one or two classes left. He had to give up his job to do a fulltime internship to finish his degree so I would say he and I have both been very dedicated to finishing our education. However, ASU is just about impossible to work with and there are days they are worse than bill collectors with riding him for more money, for more time, for more everything. They even dictated how we couldn't move because they'd need to know the address right away to get internship placements by June or July. They took until September finding him the internship location so that was false. It is just a nightmare. It is soul sucking and draining. The curriculum is graded to these rubrics so don't expect to input any creative input or say into your work. You recite what they want you to with quoted sources from books and websites they give you to work with only. There are so many students you never work with a teacher but instead with a \"grader\" you never get to know much about. I wouldn't recommend doing their online education program. At this point in time going local or moving to an area with a local education program would have been a better option. He is going to complete his additional certification for SPED at WSU after finishing the degree this Spring, if he finishes it. They have tried every roadblock they can.
