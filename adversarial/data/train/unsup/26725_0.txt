Kevin was very thorough.  He was excellent.  We learned a lot about codes and more. Tomorrow and Friday our warranty work is finally being done. Probably even more next week.   Kevin found things we would have never found.  (major and minor).  He gave us piece of mind and the paper work to fit to get the work done!!!! i would recommend Kevin to everyone.  His rates are very reasonable.  Great company and great person!!  Thanks Kevin!!!!!!!!
