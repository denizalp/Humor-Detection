I spend 10 to 12 nights per month in hotels all around the world. I'm in the Sheraton Crescent tonight in Phoenix. Worst night stay that I can remember. Not much better than Third World hotel. There is a rhythmic banging noise somewhere in the hotel like someone hitting a hammer against a pipe or a wall. The street noise coming into the room made me think  the sliding glass door must be open. \nWhen I called to complain about the banging noise at this very late hour of the night I was told that nobody else has complained.\nYou will probably get a better nights rest if you sleep on a bench in the bus station.
