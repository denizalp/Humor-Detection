I was in line in front of the Payless car rental counter in Sky Harbor Airport. Phoenix , when I witnessed a dispute between a customer and a customer service rep. As the argument the Payless agent got more agitated and told the customer to \"to get to Fu****out of there.\" He then told the customer that he would take him outside and show him how things were done in the U.S and not in Canada. This incident took place in front of a line of customers, some were children. I told the agent to stop swearing, but this infuriated him further. He said he would call the police. I told him to go ahead. I was not breaking any laws. He went around the back where he continued to rant. There were two agents at the counter on  Dec. 10 at around 7:30 PM. One was bald and the other had a beard and dark hair. There were no name tags. He told me to mind my own business. Someone eeds to take corrective action with this individual.
