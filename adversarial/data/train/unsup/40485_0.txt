I didn't think it was worth $40 to eat at this place.  All they had were some crab legs, shrimp and lobster tails.   I'm a big fan of Maine\/Canadian lobster, but they only had California or Florida lobsters.   They didn't have much else except for a salad bar, and little bit of fruit.  I guess their dessert bar was pretty nice.  For $40 buffet, I was expecting a pasta station, some warm buns, and all the stuff that most buffets have in addition to the seafood.
