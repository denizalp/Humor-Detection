My husband and I used to be regulars here many years back when we were dating. We went back during Grand Prix for old times and realized how much we used enjoy this place, be it summer or winter. During summers they have 2 terraces to be enjoyed with a pitcher of their sangria (sadly for me there's no sun late afternoon). I'm picky when it comes to sangria and these ones are one of my favourites on a hot summer afternoon!\nTheir happy hour (at the bar only) lasts from 4-8pm, 2 for 1 rail drinks and most beers as well as their house wine. At their prices you can't go wrong! It's a 2 floor restaurant right in the heart of downtown with a great evening vibe for all ages. \nService is always good, except when you run into a newbie. Then again I may be biased, we were such regulars there that we had our own waiter and bartender. \nMy favourites there are the pizzas and the basil pesto cream gnocchi! Oh and if you still have some space... their tiramisu is definitely worth trying!
