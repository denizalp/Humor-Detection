Look, I hardly expect THD to be all that helpful, but when I am wandering around the Electrical Department, looking confused, you would thing SOMEONE would approach me. Nope, not once. At all. And when I got to the check out, they have mostly self check out. I'm incredibly unimpressed by that.\nThe customer service is completely lacking. In fact, I do not plan on stepping foot into a Home Depot in the near future. I'll go to Lowe's or South Euclid's True Value. Both offer superior service. Oh wait...they offer service which is head and shoulders above what was offered here. NOTHING.
