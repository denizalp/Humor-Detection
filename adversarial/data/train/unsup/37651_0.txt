I'm giving the overall a 4 but if I had to rate just the steaks it'd be closer to a 3. Went in for dinner Saturday night and was seated immediately thanks to making a reservation. Our server was very nice and she explained everything on the menu as well as various cocktails and was great with refills, clearing dirty plates and silverware and making recommendations. She was absolutely 5 star. Ended up ordering bacon wrapped scallops, caesar salad, asparagus, lobster tail, lobster mac and cheese, filet mignon, a 20oz Morton's steak (I forget the cut), creme brulee and their lava cake. The scallops, lobster and salad were all excellent. The scallops and lobster were honestly some of the best I've ever had. The filet and 20oz steak were both ok. Certainly nothing to say \"the best steak anywhere\". The mac and cheese was pretty good. The asparagus was just bad. The desserts were decent, but honestly, nothing special. While it was a pretty sizeable meal and impossible to finish, it was also very overpriced. I don't mind an expensive meal but when your specialty is steak, it should be awesome steak and not comparable to what you'll get at Texas Roadhouse.
