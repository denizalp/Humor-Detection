Came here on a Saturday at about 12:30 noon time. There was a huge line up which takes my curiosity up a notch. Why is it so busy even though early bird special is done? So we waited and waited and finally after about an hour we were seated. \n\n($3 Small, $4 Medium, $5 Large, $6 Extra Large)\nearly bird special before 11am is still $3.20 for S,M,L\n\nMost of the wait staff were older women so I can see why there was such a long wait. There were only a few men working to clear the tables so you would see empty tables piled with dirty dishes and no one clearing them off. And meanwhile there is still a large lineup so I can see why the wait was so long.\n\nThe cook staff is much faster. After about two minutes of placing our order we got our first dish. Everything tasted good and fresh. I would rate the food 3.5 to 4 stars overall. The one dish we ordered that I really liked was the chicken pot pie pastry puff. \n\nI would still recommend Casa Imperial Fine Dining as my #1 choice for dim sum in terms of quality of food. This one is not bad though except for the initial long wait.
