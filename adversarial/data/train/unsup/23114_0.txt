As Trump would put it, the peppermill portions are \"HUGE\". I got their corn beef and hash. It certainly hit the spot after a night of adult beverage consumption. But sadly, I could only finish less than half in one seating. \n\nHubs got the ham plate and a side of pancakes. Even he could not finish half of his plate. The rest of the ham is sitting in my fridge as a leftovers. \n\nI love the ambiance of this place. It's quirky and fun. The wait goes fairly quickly so don't get discouraged of the waiting list.
