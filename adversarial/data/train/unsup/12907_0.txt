**HALAL ALERT**\n\nLISTEN UP YALL: This place is going to be hard to beat. I would love to say it's cheap eats, but then you'd be probably stop reading this review AND this place is just so much more than that. \n\nSure, it's much less expensive than other HALAL places in the valley - but the food is a GREAT DEAL better than other places *ahem, read my other reviews* My mom usually makes all the dishes that are on the menu here and being 100% Pakistani, she's known to be GAME for her Sindhi biryani, shami kabobs, beef nihari, etc. I'm so PLEASED to say that each dish that we tried at this place tasted AUTHENTIC and my tastebuds were surprised! \n\nAs another reviewer stated, the prices & food provided definitely are cheaper than what you'd spend at home making it! \n\nSo here it is, the *list* \n\nPros: \n1. SPACIOUS. The maximum capacity for Al Madina states that it can be occupied by 46 people at most. However, if you taste the food once, I guarantee you'll be back and you'll bring back the \"khandaan\" #extendedfam\n2. Chinese, Indian, American ($2.99 breakfast?!). HOLY SMOKES this place has a lot of choices. I wasn't able to taste the Chinese that evening because it seemed like a soft grand opening - but I'm excited to get my hands on some of that food too! \n3. the PRICE IS RIGHT! Ever pay $2 at your local Indian restaurant for a cup of hot masala tea? Me too, it sucks. Al Madina's chai is properly hand made, not any of that GMO ish...and it's 50 CENTS for tea!! *I've been told by the owner that the prices will NEVER change; I hope that's true because if they do, so will this review ;)* \n4. A bit more than adequate portion sizes. I think that's great for large family sizes. SHARE your food, mom & pop style. I went with my in-laws and all 5 of us were able to be really full REALLY fast. \n5. Friendly, ATTENTIVE owner (Syed) & staff. Our needs were addressed quickly, water was never left empty, chutneys and other things were ALWAYS offered, and so was that chai! Recommendations were given, and if you know me you know I'm the inquisitive type so all my questions were answered too! \n\nCons (suggestions for the restaurant): \n1. Probably not too much of a bad thing for me, but if you prefer to have less oil in your food - go ahead and let them know. I come from a family where oil (and salt) is used as staple ingredients so it doesn't bother me much! \n2. Bright lights - it was shining as bright as diamonds and it was 8:30 pm ! A little dimmer and it would seriously have the perfect atmosphere. \n\nPS. Grand opening is after Ramadan. God Willing (InshAllah) they will have a place for CHAATS opening up in a couple of months next door. For those folks thinking I just wrote chats instead of chaAts - that's CODE for delicious Indian snacks *please google* :) #panipuri #paprichaat
