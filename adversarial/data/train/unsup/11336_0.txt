It took a UYE (thanks, Deb!) to get me to finally try this place which is just a few blocks from where I live, and now I'm sorry I didn't try it much earlier. The cornbread starter was awesome - I could have eaten all that was in the basket, but had to be considerate ;-) Upon a yelper's recommendation (thanks, Jacob!), I had the St. Louis style BBQ ribs with sides of roasted corn and pecan coleslaw.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, so amazingly good. The more sedate flavors of the sides were a good counterpoint for the intensely savory ribs. We shared desserts -- the chocolate overload was good, and the peach cobbler was not overly sugared like it usually is in most establishments. I like it better that way because the taste of the fruit comes out more, although apparently the others preferred sweeter.  My only gripe was the lighting: on our table, the spotlight-like fixture above me shone harshly on me while keeping the others in comfortable darkness. The servers were friendly and efficient, and the mini donuts given on the way out were scrumptious. This is one place for many return visits, and I'll make sure they seat me in an area without a mini-searchlight above.
