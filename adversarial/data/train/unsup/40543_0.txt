*Fresh*\n*Authentic*\n*Friendly*\n\nCame here on a whim having few expectations, as my favorite Italian place is up north a bit, BUT was very surprised as everything was amazing. From the simple greens, to the Margherita, WiseGuy, flourless chocolate cake and the rice pudding with rhubarb compot on top. Even with 3 small children the service was friendly and prompt with their pasta before our dishes, alleviating the whining and fidgeting for a brief time. Great ambiance is perfect for a date night as well. \nWould recommend putting a couple Oregon Pinots on the wine list; showcasing the more appropriate northern varietals would set you apart from every place that defaults to California grapes. \nRecommend dropping someone off to check in before parking (next to a TJ's...lot always full).
