First, the staff was awesome, and I have been going to My Dr Now for almost a year. When I called for an appointment I was told my primary care physician was no longer there so i made an appointment with a different provider. I  needed a refill on prescriptions I have been on for over 3 yrs.  They are  pain medications,  and I  know that can be concerning, but I  also know that Dr M. Jones could have looked me up on the pharmacy board and seem I wasn't Dr shopping and I wasn't asking for my prescriptions early. If My Dr Now advertises as family practice they should behave like one. Dr Jones didn't bother to ask why I take those medications,  examine me,  or ask any history.  I felt horrible when i left, like I had done something wrong. He was very short and pointed out My Dr Now policy on chronic pain.  He should know as a Doctor that withdrawing from narcotics is very unpleasant, and having chronic pain is hard enough without being labeled a drug seeker. \nAgain the staff was great, and all my other experiences  there have been good.
