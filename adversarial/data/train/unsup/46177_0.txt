Their fries are awesome and so is the spinach artichoke dip. The drinks seemed overpriced to me for their specialty list, by like $2 each. I usually go and get well drinks since they are cheaper so you can afford to play more games. I liked the game area, but I felt like they picked some tacky ticket games for adults.\nThey have a good selection of old and new music as well as a nice dance floor. \nIt has been completely dead here a few nights though on Fridays\/Saturdays..I guess the decor is lacking for people or something..not sure...but for starts, they need to step up their marketing :]\n\nOh ya we were going to do bottle service here for a birthday, but $600 quote for a dead Saturday night at a bar...was so not going to happen.
