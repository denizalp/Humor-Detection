I love this place. Close to home and the $6 burgers on Tuesday are great but the half off steaks on Sundays are even better. The menu has a good variety of things to choose from that is not just bar food. JC Salad is always a safe go to.  \nThe staff is nice a make this place have a Cheers type atmosphere, its AWESOME!!\n\nAnd they have outside seating with is perfect if you have a dog and want to bring them along. MY pups Love their burgers on Tuesday night :-D
