Great Pizza - Margharita pizza was excellent. \nGreat Decor - Simple yet classy.\nGreat Service - Owners\/Employees were very nice.\nGreat Fresh Food - You can taste the fresh!\nBad Location- I foresee a more in the next year or so. \nThey do not have Mt Dew ... bad - Everyone cannot be expected to.  \n\nThis is one of the reasons I love YELP. There is a Zero percent chance I would have gone here. I am never in the area, would have never noticed it and never heard of it. \n\nNow, I will be taking my family there and telling everyone about it.
