I saw the review of the day today and had to throw in my two cents. This is my least favorite lunch stop I've ever been to downtown. \n\nIt's usually suggested by someone in the office who just wants a red sandwich meat sandwich and wants it fast. Then the rest of us have to suffer too. \n\nVery typical sandwiches like turkey, roast beef, etc, etc. I might like the place better if I ate alot of red meat. The people I go with swear that the \"Traffic Jam\" sandwich (a cluster fuck of different red sandwich meats) makes it worth the trip. The toppings are very pedestrian and limited. They will charge you to put something \"fancy\" like black olives on it.\n\nI would also challenge the \"clean\" assertion made by another reviewer. Although they have a ton of employees to run a pretty tight ship in terms of making sandwiches quick and cleaning up, we have had several incidents of finding questionable or disgusting items in the food we've ordered so as to make many  people in my office never want to go back.\n\nI give them one star for making a decent sandwich that I could've made just as easily at home and for cheaper. The second star is for their milkshakes which are made with real ice cream in front of you and are pretty good. Go to Sacks, duck and decanter, downtown deli, or one of dozens other downtown sandwich places first before here.
