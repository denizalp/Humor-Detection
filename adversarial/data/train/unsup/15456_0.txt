It's pretty simple.\n\nIf you like chocolates, stop by here.\n\nIf you like M&Ms, definitely stop by here.\n\nI like chocolate M&Ms (black bag), PB M&Ms (red bag), almond M&Ms (tan bag), peanut M&Ms (yellow bag.. [that yellow guy is my favorite]), pretzel M&Ms (blue bag), and the mint M&Ms (teal bag).  I could eat M&Ms like potato chips - endlessly dangerous because it's so hard to maintain your weight if you have a sweet tooth like me but the thing was, it's even more dangerous to maintain your weight in Vegas; what w\/ all the food joints and buffets and all.  \n\nIt's a cute store if you are into M&Ms but I don't think I'll be sporting an M&Ms t-shirt anytime soon.  I think years from now when I take the kids, I'll be the only one giddy to be inside this place.  \n\nChocolate oh chocolate... you have been there for me during my so-called depression (when I'm down) and you make the best out of every meal that I have you (dessert and sometimes I order dessert first)... will you marry me?  I know you will never let me down.\n\nP.S. I'll be going to the gym everyday until the day I die.  I just know it.
