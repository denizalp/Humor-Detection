This was once a must for us when in Lachine, and it's still adequate in most respects, but too many things have slipped in quality. At the same time prices have climbed above what we're used to from other similar restaurants. I don't think we'll be back.\n Examples: on a visit today, my enchiladas tasted of chicken that had been stored in the fridge for too long after being cooked, while the green mole sauce had little flavour;; my partner asked for beans instead of rice, and received literally a tablespoon of beans. \nOn a previous visit, we ordered guacamole for the table, and it was presented attractively like a flower, with nacho chips as petals. But when we finished the chips, much of the guacamole remained, so we asked for more. The waitress told us no! She explained that the chips served on the plate were all we could have with that dish. We were astonished.\nOn the positive side, although service is stretched and painfully slow, it can be very pleasant if you get the right server. Ours was embarrassed by the stingy bean serving, so he sneaked us an extra order of beans gratis. The other server where we're seated was also charming, checking on us a few times to see if we needed anything.\nSadly, nice servers can't really make up for poor management.
