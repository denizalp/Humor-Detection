This place is open 24 hours and is located outside in the Paris Hotel Casino. It very nice and the Ambiance is really nice and classy. Food is actually OK, but nothing special. The dessert are great though and actually cheap for the amount you get. I got the banana split and share it with two other people and we didn't finish it. Cost like $10 bucks or something. The Sugar Factory store however is over price. Mints and such are like $5-$8 for a small tin. It one of those place you should try once. It a fun place and has outside seating. Dessert and Drinks is what they known for.
