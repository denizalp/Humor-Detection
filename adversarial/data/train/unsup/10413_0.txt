Back when I was in my 20's, I took my BFF here for her bachelorette party.  That was probably the last time I step foot inside the Luxor, and it was during that hotel's hey day. Now, its in a remote part of the strip, where the foot traffic is practially non existent.  Technically its probably the best location if you want to get away from the hub bub of the Strip.\n\nNomally we stay at the other end of the Strip, and never pass New York\/ MGM.  Stephen has never been here, and he's a fan of Egyptian stuff, so after lunch I suggested we try this casino.  \n\nA lot has changed since my last visit.  Gone is the Nile, and no more 3D Virtual ride. The security guard I was chatting with said there's no more free stuff, and you pretty much pay for everything here.  Its not like the \"old days\" he agreed.\n\nIts still a nice looking casino.  Quiet though.  I would like to try their rooms again, but only if its free.
