I usually come here for drinks and appetizers with friends. Their meats and cheeses are to die for! The pretzels and fondue also cannot be beat. Their cocktails are unique and delicious. If you are a Moscow Mule fan like me, you will love their different varieties! One of my favorite mules is made with tequila, grapefruit, jalapeno, and ginger beer....SO yum!  :) The games (tailgate toss\/ping pong) and open vibe make for a really great hangout spot to meet friends, celebrate a birthday or bring out of town guests. I know for a fact that i'll be back soon! (Especially since it is FINALLY cooling down in the Valley!) Their HH prices are also spot on!
