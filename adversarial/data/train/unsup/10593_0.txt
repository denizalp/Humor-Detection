Vintage Las Vegas meets the future! \nI absolutely love this display of ostentatiousness in the heart of downtown Las Vegas. A huge LED canopy stretches over the street, which is a walking area (no cars). Several times per night, the canopy comes alive in a light show that fills the entire range of vision. It's an amazing display. Seconds before the light show, all the casino lights go dark, and the place goes silent before music booms over the loudspeakers, and the lights sync up to the tunes. \nWe saw Heart on the jumbo-jumbotron. It was a really cool show, and took the viewers through the history of the band, playing all of their best hits. \nThere are other musicians set up along the street, jamming out random music with people dancing and enjoying a cocktail or huge beer. \nIt's a great place to do some people watching. Vegas brings out the weirdos in droves, and you have to embrace it. Magicians, rappers, break dancers and other performers hang out, working for tips. It's a great place to get some photos with some weird folk. \nThere are plenty of places to grab a drink all along the street. Just don't take any glass or bottles out there. Most of the casinos offer cups at the entrances\/exits. \nIt's easy to get down here from the strip by taking the bus, the Deuce, which drops you off at one end of the Freemont Experience. \nI really recommend getting down here to downtown Las Vegas, and see what Vegas used to be like before all those big, fancy resorts were built on the Strip.
