I originally fired the first company that my insurance recommended. Then I chose evds since they claimed to be able to complete my small roof repair and drywall damage in 3 days. It's had been 3 months and my relays are shoddy and have needed to be redone multiple times. I would never recommend them to anyone. I'm still waiting for out to be complete.\n\nI had to escalate it to a supervisor to even get on the schedule after the initial appointment. It had been a nightmare and my contract for the sale of my house is on hold due to their shoddy work. Anytime we had an appointment I had to remind them of it. The seem to poor small jobs at the bottom of the priority list.
