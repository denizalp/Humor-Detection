I was interested in breast augmentation. I had done a lot of research online and I had met with about five different surgeons in the east valley. Dr. Geoghegan made me feel the most comfortable. She was very informative, caring, and honest with me. A few of the other doctors emphasized on size and Dr. G emphasized on what I really wanted, to look as natural as possible. \n\nThree years later I have no regrets! I have had no complications during surgery or after. I am extremely pleased with the results and would highly recommend her practice.
