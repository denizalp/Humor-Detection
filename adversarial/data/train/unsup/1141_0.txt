This review is solely based on their spray tan. \n\n\nI went to Venus Victoria yesterday for a spray tan. Prior to coming in, I called to make sure they had different levels of bronze. I specifically told them I don't want to be too dark. The girl on the phone assured me I would have a \"sun-kissed look\". \n\nOnce I was there, I double checked to make sure they put the unit on the lowest setting before I paid, the attendant assured me she had.\n\nI am now 1 day into my spray tan. My skin is a deep brown colour--not at all \"sun kissed looking\"-- which would be fine if I wasn't a NATURAL REDHEAD. I look ridiculous and am already dreading the extreme tie-dye affect when the tan starts to wear off. \n\nAlso, the attendant who helped me asked if I'd done a spray tan before and then gave me NO INSTRUCTION once I told her I had. It was only when I said: \"I haven't sprayed in years, can I have a refresher?\" that she gave me the most basic instructions. She didn't tell me which way to face, or what to do when I was finished: Do I rub the excess moisture in?  Do I dab it? \n\nI used to work in a tanning salon. That is unacceptable! \n\nVenis Victoria Salon and Spa needs to train their staff better, or hire mystery shoppers to bust the slackers. \n\nI am so extremely disappointed. I will NEVER RETURN.
