I loved SW next door with the lake view, so I made the reservation for Lakeside to try different type of food but enjoy the same view.\nWe ordered Yamazaki Whisky while waiting for being seated. Once we were seated, there was a bug in the glass, my guest told our service lady, Melanie, who didn't apologize or offer the new glass but joking about that even bugs like this whisky!!\nMy guest was nice and didn't want extra hassle and didn't say any more. But I asked our service lady for another new glass. She first told me that it's my guest's choice that didn't ask for another glass at the first beginning, and she brought up the normal whiskey instead of Yamazaki which caused my guest headache.\nAfter this unpleasant beginning, we found the crab shell in our avocado appetizer and another shell in my lobster risotto!\nAt this point, i was totally disappointed. For over $400 bill, I would expect better experience!!
