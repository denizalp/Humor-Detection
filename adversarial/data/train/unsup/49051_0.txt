I'm Saskatchewan born.  I love the Leo's vibe from the spots I've been back home.  They captured that same vibe here in Calgary: Small bar, friendly regulars, good food, and excellent staff.  I gotta say the bar staff at the Calgary spot is top notch. Jack, Brendan, Dave & Gio make me feel right at home every time I stop in. \n\nLarge wrap around bar with lots of seats.  Food until 2am, lots of local brews on tap.  Not your average calgary bar, but a place with lots of heart.  Keeps me coming back.
