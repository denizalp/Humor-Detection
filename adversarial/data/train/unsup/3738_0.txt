Tverskaya is, hands down, the pinkest restaurant in Las Vegas. Holy shit, it is pink.  Pink curtains, hot pink walls. Pink.\n\nI also suspect they have a Russian grandmother chained up in the kitchen, forced to endlessly chop cabbage, stew various meats and make borscht.  As a former Eastern European resident, I am very familiar with borscht, i.e. beet soup, and Tverskaya's wonderful version is packed with cabbage, potatoes, and chunks of beets. Great for a cold, Las Vegas day (hypothetical).  They also serve some tasty Vareniki, similar to pierogi. My boyfriend ordered some with cottage cheese (which is more like a sweet, smooth farmer's cheese) and he scarfed them all down.\n\nMy Hungarian Goulash entree included all the Slavic classics: mashed potatoes (amazingly not dry), tangy red cabbage salad, and slow-cooked chunks of pork topped in a brown gravy.  It was all tender, delicious, and very homestyle.  I washed it all down with Kvas, a yeasty drink that tastes like really, really yeasty beer mixed with apple juice.  The menu advertised it as non-alcoholic but I've always known Kvas as low-alcohol.  So, any recovering alcoholics or seven-year-olds may want to steer clear.\n\nWhich leads me to my biggest criticism of Tverskaya: they don't serve alcohol.  Now, I'm not a lush or anything, but I thought that was really strange.  Russian food without beer or vodka?  Unfathomable.  \n\nThey do, however, let you bring in your own alcohol, so, grab a six pack, a Restaurant.com coupon (it's expensive) and check out Tverskaya!
