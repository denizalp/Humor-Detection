I don't leave 5 stars.  I just don't.  This location has its problems.  Sometimes it's difficult to find a parking spot.  Often, it's difficult to find a seat that is clean.  The back of house staff at times struggles with your order however,  the front of house staff is incredible.  Taco Bell employs quite a few special needs workers to attend to their front of house needs.  They may stand and talk to you during your entire meal and sweep under your feet 50 times while you are eating, but I find the interaction quite enjoyable.  They also tend to gravitate right towards my bother, who is completely, socially awkward himself and avoids everybody when possible.  And every time we eat there my brother talks for hours about the girl at Taco Bell.  It's a nice touch, nice touch.
