They didn't live up to the one star, but had to put something. What kind of place will press something for you once ...for free while you wait, but the next time will only allow you to drop something off to be pressed if you also get it dry cleaned? Even after saying I didn't want it dry cleaned, I would have been charged the same price as if it were dry cleaned and pressed. Terrible customer service with unprofessional staff. I will definitely never return after the useless service I was provided.
