Checking out this place as we had a coupon for free wings.  We first arrived there were not many people in the restaurant.  As we were there the restaurant got a rush. The location is pretty big in a popular mall area. \n\nThe food and service was good.  We ordered 3 pounds of wings.  BBQ, teriyaki and sweet chili.  We also. Ordered a healthy bowl and Two of the original dogs. The hot dogs came with two polish sausage in a French bread.  They were huge portions.
