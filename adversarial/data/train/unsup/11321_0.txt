This is a seller review, and I hope this would be the beginning to unveil the real face of these individuals and I urge other people to come forward and share their stories, I'm pretty sure there are many more out there like me. These people are nothing but a bunch of WHITE SUPREMACISTS. Racist low class individuals. I thought at first that it's only the person who was in charge of consigning my cars, but it turns out that they have a policy that comes from the top position and goes thru every level of management and down to the representatives that if you are not like them, then, they do not want you to consign there. PERIOD. The ignorant arrogant John Cook tried to trash the value of my cars from the very first minute i talked to him, in order to put me off, then eventually deleted one of my cars and added another one to run on the very same minute like one exactly like it ,so, both cars would lose value. They knew that this would be the only way to piss me off and make me withdraw my cars instead of facing a guaranteed huge loss on all of them. When i left a very polite message to the \"vice President of Consignment\" , Gary Bennett asking to have someone else take over my account, he never got back to me proving that, as i said above, it is a policy of the company, RACISM. My advice to everyone is to use the internet to find any car you are looking for at way cheaper price that what the same exact car would sell for at their stupid auction, and to the sellers, for way less cost and without having to pay those thieves $1500 \"lot fees\" before the sale just to consign the car then 8 - 10 % of the sale price, you can sell anything you want at so many different sites online. And finally, again, I urge everyone who was discriminated against by these worthless individuals to come forward and leave a feedback with their story so the whole world would realize who they really are.
