Best dental experience possible from a person who fears a dental office.  The receptionist was so pleasant and welcoming.  The office wait was only a few minutes.  The dentist was warm, concerned, attentive and made it clear that he cared  about the patient's experience.\n    He patiently listened to my concerns regarding my painful TMJ and the bad experiences I had in the past with dental treatments.   I explained that I would have to wait a few months for a new night guard due to finances. He told me to take back the coupon I had brought in for $50 off to use in the future when I could afford a night guard. \n     Then he examined the fit of an OLD night guard I brought with me made by  another dentist more than ten years ago (no longer fit). He took it  into his lab, right then, and reshaped it to fit my mouth to use temporarily.  He did all this free of charge and even told me to take the introductory coupon back (which is how I heard about him) to use when I could come back for a new night guard.\n    One last thing, the man I met in the waiting room had had all his teeth pulled and dentures made with Dr. Cherrington and had rave reviews.  I will never have to fear the dentist again because I will only go to Dr Cherrington.
