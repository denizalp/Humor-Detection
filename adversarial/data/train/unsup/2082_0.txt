Some are complaining about a hot steam room, sloppy pedicures, and too long of a wait time.  I've been to this spa a few times and have experienced none of the above.  Both of my pedicures have been wonderful (spa and regular).  While it is slightly more expensive than say your average Asian nail spa, I'd gladly pay more for a comfortable environment (RE: Not in a mall) where I'm fairly certain cleaning policies are followed, including autoclaving nail tools.  \n\nThough I've never been in the steam room, I would imagine it would be hot... it's STEAM!  What did you expect? As far as waiting, it's a spa... it's meant to have wait and relaxation time.  If your pedicure wasn't to your standard, say something.  This is the place that would offer to fix anything not up to your standards.  If your massage isn't going that way you want it to, say something.  The massage therapist is just that, a massage therapist, not a mind reader.   \n\n If you want a rushed, tacky experience, then this isn't the place for you.  If you want a beautiful environment with helpful staff, then Kneaded Relief might be worth a visit.
