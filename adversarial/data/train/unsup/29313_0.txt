The absolute best cardiologist in Nevada. I've suffered from severe high blood pressure for years and have been to several cardiologists and other doctors who have never been able to control my blood pressure. Dr. Steljes lowered and stabilized my blood pressure after the very first visit. Prior to Dr. Steljes my blood pressure was constantly in the 180-190 range, and now my blood pressure on average is 120 or below. I would strongly recommend Dr. Steljes to anyone suffering from high blood pressure or any other cardiac illnesses. The office staff is always extremely professional, very helpful, compassionate, and also very knowledgable.
