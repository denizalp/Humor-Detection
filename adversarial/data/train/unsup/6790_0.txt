Anak, uminom tayo ng Tsaa na may sago-(my child, let's drink Boba Tea). On a recent shopping trip with my parents and tita(aunt) in this busy shopping plaza anchored with Seafood City. It's not hard to missed a Boba Tea shop near Las Vegas default Filipino town, which is one reason why this place gets a decent amount of customers and not much competition in the area. The majority Filipino staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the flavor of the actual milk teas were ok plus they don't have the option to adjust sweetness level. I prefer my drinks less sweet so I'm able to taste all components of my drink. I do like the option that they have two sizes of Boba, regular and small. \n\nThe shop is much larger than others in town, makes it an ideal place to hangout with a group of friends or family. Plus, they have various Meriendas (snacks) that have a Filipino twist.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #72
