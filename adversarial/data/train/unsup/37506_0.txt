I'll preface this by saying that this review is based solely on the food and not the ambiance or service as we ordered take-out, but based on the poor quality, awful food that we had, I wouldn't care to venture back to find out if they've made any improvements.\n\nWe ordered the following items: garlic bread with cheese, bruschetta, a greek salad, a caesar salad, and a margherita pizza.  The only item that was even moderately edible was the garlic bread with cheese, which was nothing more than your typical greasy garlic bread.  The bruschetta was a mix of tomatoes, capers, onions, and some other nondescript items that was meant to be spooned onto some of the most rock hard \"pieces of toast\" that I've ever had the misfortune of trying to eat.  After the first bite, we both stopped eating for fear of a costly dental bill.  The greek salad that we ordered was not among our take-out order as they had mistakenly given us a wedge of iceberg lettuce instead, which we promptly tossed into the trash.  The caesar met a similar fate as the container of dressing was not even homemade dressing but appeared to be the type of super creamy caesar dressing that comes in a bottle from the grocery store and tasted awful.  Yuck!  While it seemed like a true feat to top the horrible start to our meal, Nick's managed to deliver and our disgusting pizza made the whole meal even more nauseating.  The cheese was oily and of extremely poor quality and the fresh tomatoes were so pale that they were nearly white and completely flavorless.  After one slice each, the pizza found its way into the trash as well.  We'd only paid about $40 for the food, and after our experience, it's clear that the low prices are driven by the purchase of bargain basement ingredients that are not up to the standards of even moderately selective restaurants.  I really can't think of a place that one could go to receive worse Italian food than that served at Nick's.
