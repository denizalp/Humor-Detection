I went here because of all the excellent ratings.  The staff was super nice and made me feel comfortable.  The computers were having issues that day and had problems with the xray.  So i never got to see why i was having tooth issues. Then she comes in and tells me i need a deep cleaning and saw my xrays and saw that i had an abcessed tooth and that there swelling around it.  Never gave me pain meds or anitbotics after i went twice.  After talking to a few dentist about the problem i was having they said she should of removed your wisdom tooth since they were the cause of the problem..  After talking about my concerns to them they never made a plan on what to do just kept pushing deep cleaning which i did.  I don't know if everyone got a different hygenist or what but im so upset that i didnt get a 5 star experience i just want the pain to stop..  Im glad that everyone else got great care though.
