I started getting subs here 40 years ago when it was still called 3-S Subs. They made my favorite meatball sub EVER! It stayed exactly the same for over 35 years even as the name switched to Sharpy's 3-S Subs and then to just Sharpy's. Even though I had moved out of the area, I would stop whenever I was around to get one of those delicious, mouthwatering meatball subs. Suddenly, about 2-3 years ago, they changed it. Different bread, shorter bun with a slit cut in it and (less) meatballs tucked inside. Meatballs that used to have good textural consistency now fall apart when you bite into them and the sauce gives me heartburn. \n\nWhy would you change it after 35 YEARS??? If the owners of Sharpy's had a McD's they would probably be putting ketchup on Big Macs and finding ways to ruin the french fries.\n\nAfter being disappointed by the meatball sub multiple times, I stopped the other day and tried my old backup favorite, the Sicilian Burger, only to find that it had undergone a similar demotion from a full sub bun to a large hamburger bun. Sorry, but if I'm going to pay $8 for a burger I might as well go to 5 Guys.\n\nPrices continue to rise while the quality continues to slip. Goodbye, Sharpy's (sniff).
