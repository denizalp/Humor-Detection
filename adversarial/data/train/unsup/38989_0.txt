Really underwhelming experience...especially after reading the glowing reviews. I guess their menu changes all the time so maybe we caught a bad one? Who knows...this is a \"do not repeat\" for me. \n\nFood was OK, nothing special. Tiny portions so over order if you're hungry. We just went to another dinner after! $30 for what was essentially a mediocre fish n' chips. \n\nThe worst of all was the service. Slow...incredibly slow. We barely saw our server and kept wishing we could switch table so that we could have another server who was clearly doing a better job.
