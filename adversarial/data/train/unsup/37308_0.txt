I was so disappointed in the changes \"The Quad\" had made. My husband and I stayed at this hotel when it was The Imperial Palace about 4-5 times. It was our favorite spot since it was in the middle of the strip, clean, comfortable, and the price was great. We had gone back last week and it was our first time back since the change. I will never go back! Just finding the way to the car garage was a nightmare!  We stayed on a Tuesday night and checked in just an hour after their check in time. I reserved a nonsmoking king sized bed. It took forever to be checked in and when we got to our room, they had given us a wheel chair accessible room. Which had just a bed and an 80's style TV and the bathroom was gross and smelled. Calling the first desk, I was put on hold for about 5 minutes. We were told to come back downstairs and wait in another line. We requested to change rooms and only other king was going to be right above a loud band that plays until 3am or we take two queens. We went with the two queens. Now the hotel room was super plain and honestly reminded me of a motel 6. The TV is super old, beds are very hard, nothing nice. The Casino is still under construction, so it is hard to get around and even on a Tuesday it made the walk to the elevators packed. I did not like ANYTHING about the new style. I was so bummed on our trip and was so glad we had only booked the room for one night. I used to recommend people that they should stay at the Imperial Palace but after the changes, I am warning everyone to look elsewhere.
