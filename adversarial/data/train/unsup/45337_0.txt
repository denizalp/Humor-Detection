On a recent trip to Montreal for a bachelorette party we came to Bird Bar on a Friday night with 14 people. This was on of the highlights of the trip! \n\nThe staff were incredible, Jonathan our server was a total professional and made the night! Not only did Jonathan kill it while serving 14 people but he made it a great time. \n\nThe live DJ was a really fun touch as well and played great music. \n\nThe food was amazing! We tried a little bit of everything and I can honestly say there was not a bad dish in the bunch! \n\nThis will be a go to spot on my next trip to Montreal!
