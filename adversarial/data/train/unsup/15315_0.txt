3.7 stars. \n\nI like the concept here but the employees def need some training on what's in their food.\n\nI asked what was in the citrus dressing to the cashier and he said, \"idk, citrus?\".\n\nOkay obviously there's citrus in the citrus dressing. So he asked another employee next to him what's in the citrus dressing. She goes, \"ya know, it has a citrus taste with citrus in it.\"\n\nWow after that I couldn't help but to burst out laughing. \n\nShe's like \"what? Is that not good enough for you?\" \n\nI mean, no it's not good enough. That doesn't give me enough info on your dressing. After that, it just got awkward. \n\nAnyways,\n\nThe menu is pretty big with lots of options. I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich and it was pretty good. It def did not feel skinny since it had butter on the bread and it being drenched with teriyaki sauce. The balsamic vinaigrette tasted like the one from trader joes. \n\nThe French fries were good and especially with their jalape√±o ketchup!
