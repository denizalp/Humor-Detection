The  music SUCKS! The DJ still thinks he is In the 70's. You would think he would play more Strip club type of music, but he hits us with some \"Sweet Caroline\" \nI can't get jiggy with that crap music he plays... \nthe drinks are fair, \nThe girls are wack, by the end of the night you get some that are drunk AF, and smell like\nCigarettes .
