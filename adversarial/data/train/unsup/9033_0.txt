I bought my newest car here as well as get my services done too. \n\nMy experience with buying a new car was rough at first. When I first arrived I felt that I wasn't giving the right amount of respect due to how young I looked. I came in and asked about a car & I was handed down to the bottom salesman, thinkin I'm probably gonna waste their time. I heard \"oh you can have her\" & \"yah you take her\". Uhh I could hear you. Little did these sales sharks know I came in to buy not to look. \n\nServices-- when I bought my car I got a handful of free oil changes. Which is a plus. Now all the other services-- 10,000 mile service, breaks, tires -- expensive! Now I may have a lack of knowledge on what the prices should be on these services, but boy do they hurt my pockets. \n\nVince is pretty helpful though. He always tries to work with me on prices. Gives me a discount where he can. So I'm thankful. But next time I might have to get a second opinion when a service comes along. Just to see if I'm not getting suckered.
