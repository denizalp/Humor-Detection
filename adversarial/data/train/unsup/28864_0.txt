Fun outdoors atmosphere. Decent staff though nobody will approach you unless you seek them nor greet you when you walk in or wait. \nFood mediocre, & don't try to eat while seated outside as your food might taste like ashes considering the number of smokers who I'm assuming come to the establishment for that sole purpose.
