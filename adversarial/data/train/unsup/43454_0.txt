Target has won me over, and kept me away from Walmart. \n\nI love the enclosed parking lot for the days that are raining, and snowing. It's my first choice to go to on those days. Nothing worse than going outside with a cart full of bags, and get poured on, or watch yourself go from one color to all white in a matter of minutes with snow. So, thank you Target for that :)\n\nI love going up the escalator, and smelling the coffee coming from Starbucks, but I don't drink their coffee. They also have a target cafe that sells pizza hut, popcorn, soft drinks, pretzels, cookies and etc. I go for the pretzel, and drink.\n\nThey are so well organized. I can always find what I'm looking for. I just wish they had a bigger selection of items for bunny owners like they do for cat, and dog owners. I like how cheap their drinks, and grocery items are.\n\nI rarely wait a long time in line, even when they are busy. I love that!! I have noticed it is clean, but not their restrooms. I went in there one time, because my daughter had to go, but she changed her mind. Just like her mama lol. I'll hold it.\n\nI recently made a huge purchase with a DSLR camera, and I am extremely happy with it.\n\nI go to this Target like 2 or 3 times a week!
