NOT so Magical Mike.... :-(\n\nThis was seriously disappointing. The worst of these types of shows I've seen (compared to Chippendales and Thunder from Down Under - go to those instead!).\n\nThe guys were not at ALL attractive. The main guy playing Mike was the LEAST attractive of all of them and when you're supposed to be playing Mike (who is Channing Tatum), then you better be damn f-ing hot, am I right!? You're also supposed to have bomb ass dance moves, which none of these guys had. There was ONE hot guy that came on stage for less than 5 minutes and didn't come back the rest of the show. Not sure what that was all about... maybe they couldn't afford him for longer?\n\nAlso, there was this weird music interlude, where the guys played instruments and sang - FULLY CLOTHED (shirts on and all). It felt like a bad American Idol moment where they were trying to get \"discovered\". It wasn't good. \n\nDrinks are really pricing, but whatever, it's Vegas.\nThe woman who \"hosts\" the show is crass and very annoying...and not really kept or dressed well. She looked \"rough\".\n\nI felt like the whole theme of the show was that it was supposed to play towards the middle-aged, desperate, divorced woman who \"deserves\" and has a right to be treated better (sexually). That whole narrative was just really strange.... I was on a mini-bachlorette weekend, so that certainly didn't play to us. \n\nThe best moment was this water\/dance scene... which only lasted for a few minutes. They need to do more of that! Otherwise the rest of it is not worth seeing. I did like the set up of the stage though.\n\nMy 2 friends and I thought getting seats in the front would be AWESOME, but instead we sadly just sat there the whole time seriously unimpressed by the whole thing.....and the unattractive guys.\n\nI will say that the main guy took it well when they asked how the show was going and I gave them a thumbs down... he saw me which was kinda funny and played around with it the rest of the show. So luckily he had a sense of humor. \n\nDon't waste your $$ on Magic Mike, go to Chippendales or Thunder from Down Under (hot Aussies... YES!).
