Stopped in for Happy Hour and was very happy with the overall experience. Great decor, great service, and very fair happy hour prices.  We had the flash fried deviled eggs with candied bacon, the El Churro sticky buns, and the calamari \/ shrimp with cilantro dip.  All of it was awesome, the shrimp \/ calamari was .. \"Ok\" .. But the rest was def amazing and at the level of quality expected.  Can't wait to come back for dinner and try that menu.
