BEWARE!\n\nI had the most horrible experience this weekend at the Aria Spa. After getting to the steam room to relax, an asian guy gets up from the other side and walks into the middle of the room and starts jerking himself. It caught me off guard so i left and then when i went to the area to shave. There were 3 or 4 men talking together naked when the same asian guy walks in and they all start talking.\n\nNo lifestyle judgements at all but this really is a health concern if this type of behavior and possible activities may be occurring within the common facilities. Communicable diseases is what concerns me.\n\nI did speak with the Aria Spa manager Matt Gallager who said he didn't condone this behavior. He dismissed my complaints an told me to get tested for STD's and contact the Clarke County Health Board. \n\nWhat a douche!
