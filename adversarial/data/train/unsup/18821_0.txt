Yay! I'm a fan!\n\nUpsides:\n-Nonsmoking. It was perfect since I was in Vegas celebrating our anniversary and was on the tail end of a cold. The air here was still super dry but housekeeping was nice enough to send up a humidifier for me.\n-Service was prompt! We checked in super early and they told us to eat lunch and come back so by 1PM we already had a lovely suite to hang out in.\n-Clean! Cleanliness is super important.... and the carpets in the room and the bathrooms were uber clean. I think CSI and their black light would be impressed.\n-Free Valet! Don't forget to tip the guys!\n\nDownsides:\n-Valet department couldn't find our car = 15 minute wait while the guy drove around the parking structure in someone else's car looking for our car.\n-Only one \"snackbar\/grocery\" + bar instead of a full fledged restaurant\n-Stupid roundabout circular driveway was confusing since the signs sucked!!\n-Only one sink. SERIOUSLY!? They have this huge counter space and only one sink. All the other resorts I've stayed at had at least two sinks!!! I know.... something small to gripe about but I tend to take over an entire sink and I don't like sharing. I'm an only child.\n\nSign up for the MGM rewards card... they'll send you lots of hotel rates that are on sale. We got this for $120 a night plus $20 dollars of resort credit. We used it on buying chocolate covered strawberries and a lox bagel downstairs.\n\nCheck out was a breeze and we were happy and well rested.
