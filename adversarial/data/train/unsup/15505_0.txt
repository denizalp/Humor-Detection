So it took me a long time to like pho. I just didn't care for it. I'm not sure what happened but I started tolerating it as the years gone by and recently I started liking it. How my taste buds change! I've only been to three pho places in Vegas. I can't recall the ones I've been to in CA. This is my favorite one so far. \n\nI consider myself a pho noob so I'm not sure what constitutes the perfect pho so if I'll just summarize it by saying this is some damn good pho!\n\nI get good service here which is a bonus because we all know Asian restaurants are not known for their southern hospitality. When we first went, Annie was friendly and chatted with us. I had recently went in to take pho to go and the guy greeted me with a genuine smile. I got my order fast, between 5-10 minutes. He was thankful too. I really appreciate genuine customer service especially from an Asian restaurant. ;)
