I really like this place. I typically find laundromats to be a little skeezy but this one is clean and welcoming. I only come here a couple times a year when I wash comforters in the big machines but it's always a positive experience. The staff are friendly, especially with helping with machines because I'm too short to see over the machine to pour detergent. I'll keep coming back!
