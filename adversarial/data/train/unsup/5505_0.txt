EXTREME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI skydove into an open roof window of this small coffee-diner-cafe THING the other day, determined to find a meal that would raise my adrenaline and blast my tastebuds like a jet-fuel-filled jelly donut and a lighter.\n\nWell, based on one visit and one visit ONLY, I got what I was looking for.\n\nAfter doing a Kung Fu flying spin kick across the shop, I yelled my order directly into the face of the cashier who then punched it into her till using a twelve-foot greatsword.\n\nMy EXTREME order?\n\nA club sandwich, please and thank you very much. \n\nYou can't tell, but I just needed to take a 10 minute break from typing as my fingers were getting so sweaty they were slipping off the keys. Luckily, I keep a stash of climber's chalk nearby that I use when I'm not SCALING THE ANDES NUDE USING NOTHING BUT A PICK AXE AND A GIANT BAG OF TWIZZLERS!!!!\n\nBA-DA-BOOM! There was hardly any seating, but that's because this place is small and popular - apparently REAL popular with the \"old people on a saturday\" types. \n\nHooo-weee. I think I used up all of my extreme energy on the first few paragraphs of this review, so I'll just get it over with now:\n\n1. Food was pretty good.\n2. Parking was not, but that's just the way the world works sometimes.\n3. I'd go here if you're in the mood for a quick lunch and the Lazy Loaf & Kettle is too busy.\n\nZzzzzZzZzZzz
