0 stars is what this \"luxury\" complex deserves. We moved in the same exact day the new company took over. Best part? No one told us a new company was taking over! No one had a clue about anything. Took forever to get keys, gate code, everything. Pretty much set the tone for the 10 long horrid months we endured. We were sold on all lies. Office people were rude and never easy to get a hold of. Gates were hardly ever closed, so much for gated community. Drug dealers on every corner. Look around people. Our building alone had a couple dealers. Hallways always smelled like weed. Dog poop left everywhere. Dog pee everywhere. Want to throw your trash out? Good luck! Dumpsters and surrounding areas were always overfilled and filthy. Pool was dirty and freezing. No movie theater. Rent was way overpriced. Water is shared and then our ac bill tripled out of nowhere. Do yourself a favor and drive around this place to see the real deal.
