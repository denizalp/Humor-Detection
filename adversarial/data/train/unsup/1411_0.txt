I've had a regular massage person come to my house forever, but that's in NJ.  I never had one in Vegas until the other day.  Hubby gave me a Groupon for Valentine's Day for a Hot Stone Massage, and off I flew.\n\nIt was a fabulous experience from beginning to end.  The desk staff was welcoming, the ambience elegant and relaxing, and the massage I had from Patricia was to die for!  It was my first hot stone massage, and Patricia was an expert.  I absolutely loved it, came home and told my husband he created a monster - he would have gotten off cheaper if he'd gotten me jewelry, because that's a one-shot deal.  This Groupon was the gift that will keep on giving.  I will definitely be going back!\n\nI also loved the shower, since I didn't have to squeegee glass doors the way I have to at home!!
