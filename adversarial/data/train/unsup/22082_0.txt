The night my friends and I had at Hakkasan started off well enough with a pre-arranged table thanks to 2 friends who work in the industry.\n\n9 members of our 12 person group plus our local friends showed up initially, others waited on a friend whose flight was late. When they arrived, the club staff told them that our table was full and kept trying to say conditions to get more money out of them. Eventually, we gave up on getting them in. \n\nThe club itself has an Asian ultra\/postmodern aesthetic, and impressive lighting and sound. Our table servers Samantha and Vince were quite personable and did an excellent job. However, the dance floor on the main floor was on the small side in favor of having more tables that they were unable to fill on opening weekend, which probably doesn't bode well. \n\nWhen our bill came at the end of the night, it conveniently was an \"accident[al]  \" $700 higher than it was supposed to be, which we caught and paid the original previously agreed upon amount.  Well, that and a required 40% gratuity, which seemed pretty outrageous after that.
