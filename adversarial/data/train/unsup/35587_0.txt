I was here for lunch last week with some work folks and the overall experience was very nice. For a chain restaurant, it isn't too bad at all!\n\nWe were greeted and seated right away. There were two folks taking care of as one of them was in training. She was doing a great job for being new on the job. \n\nThe food was really tasty. I went with a chicken salad. It came with grilled chicken on top and the chicken was excellent! Very flavorful and a nice portion. The others I was dining with seemed to enjoy their plates as well and we all left happy and full. \n\nThe pricing on the menu is very reasonable so this is an easy choice for lunch or dinner if you're looking for something filling that won't break the bank!
