Baja fish tacos- holy friggin moly delicious!!!!! :D and only 99Â¢!!!\n\nI was very pleased with this particular location. Look if you're looking for high quality fish or seafood, you have to understand that this is fast food seafood and you wont find it here. BUT I have to say for fast food quality I LOVE LJ Silvers. And my new favorite item to get is their BAJA FISH TACOS!!\n\nWhat I loved is that normally, I just get the fish platter but today I was feeling like a fish taco, so I rolled into LJS and ordered ONE fish taco to try out, when I got to the window the cashier asked me if it was my first time trying one and I said yes. He simply said \"This one is on the house, if you like it- which you will, come back and see us again\" :D so I got my first Baja Fish Taco Free! and not only that- it was AMAZING! The taco is big! get two and you'll be full. Then theres the sauce they put in it- and ITS AWESOME- has a little spice to it and it's mouth wateringly delicious... JUST TRY IT. You will be pleased!!
