We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was very nice and friendly. The room service breakfast was good. Our granddaughter loved the pool area and the marine aquarium with live mermaids at the main entrance. Our beds were very comfortable and our room was clean and quiet. Close to Cracker Barrel and other restaurants. The hotel gift shop was the only down point. Too expensive and lack of merchandise made it a waste of time. The casino itself has many cool games and some great restaurants too. Try the mermaid bar!
