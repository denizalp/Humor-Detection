My friends and I visited Grand Lux twice during our weekend trip to Vegas because we were staying at the Palazzo. Funny, because we would never think to go to the LA location. But my experience here may have changed my mind. \n\nBoth times we were lucky enough to be able to dine 'al fresco' - meaning a gorgeous view of the casino. But hey it still felt cool!\n\nThe first trip was a woozy breakfast after our first night out. We shared a bruschetta style breakfast dish and a couple of other egg dishes. I love that they serve real hash browns instead of home fries - so much more satisfying! The service was awesome, a cute little Asian man (I can say that because I'm Asian and he reminded me of my dad) who was totally attentive and fine with bringing us extra place settings and plates so that we could share. \n\nThe second trip was late at night after a trip to XS. This was an entirely different kind of meal, a ravenously hungry, get me some comfort food now before I fall asleep at the table kind of meal. One of my friends actually may have nodded off while waiting for our food. Again, we shared, this time the zen noodles, a yummy asian noodle soup with a lemongrass broth, and the pasta carbonara, THE BEST pasta carbonara I have ever had. The service again was commendable, considering it was about 2 in the morning and the place was filled with obnoxious patrons. The waiter was super nice and even reassured us when a loud alarm went off in the casino and we got nervous. \n\nPerhaps my two favorite meals of the trip - a pleasant surprise!
