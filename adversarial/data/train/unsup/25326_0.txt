Horrible customer service. Took me two attempts to get in contact with someone after they reported 5,000 gallons of water being used in a vacant house. And when I finally did hear back their response was very blunt, full of assumptions, and did not help me in the least bit! And now that I'm living there my water use has gone down over 50%. Doesn't make sense.
