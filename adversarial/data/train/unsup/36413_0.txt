Don't even deserve 1 star. Most rudest UN knowledgeable staff I have ever felt with. I had 4 pounds of sterling silver. You guy's advertise you pay the most and can prove it? I can prove you wrong. They magnetic tested on item and there was a slight resistance, so he refused and said everything I had was fake except for a silver bowl which they offered 20 cents a gram. Which was only 45 dollars. You are taking More than half of the profit. \nWhich now because of your dickish staff, you lost out big time.
