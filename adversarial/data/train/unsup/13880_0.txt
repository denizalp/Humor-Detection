Okay, so maybe I should have rounded up on this one, but -- Vito's is a solid 3 1\/2 stars!  Maybe even, 3 3\/4 stars.\n\nThe three of us came here last night for dinner and had a really nice time.  We were seated promptly and the place was hopping.  The main dinning room had only two tables open (see photo) and the patio looked crowded as well.  \n\nOur waitress Angela, came by almost immediately after we were seated to fill our water glasses and ask if we wanted anything to start off.  Nice!\n\nAfter looking at the menus and wine list, we order the fried Calamari to start for $9.00.  Angela explained that the fried calamari was served with a dusting of garlic seasoning and buffalo dip (see photo), while their grilled calamari was serve more Cajun style.\n\nThe three of us ordered our own baseline entrees when eating in a Italian restaurant for the first time.  We ordered and shared:  Chicken Parmigiana with a side of penne pasta, $16.50; Penne Caprese, $15.00 and the Spaghettini, $11.00 with a side of Meatballs and Sausage, $2.00.  We also ordered the House Salads for $2.00 each. \n\nAngela returned after a few minutes with our Fried Calamari.  This was really good.  When ordering calamari, it is always a test for a kitchen to cook it right.  If you're busy and you cook it too long, it becomes very chewy.  Tonight it was perfect and melted in our mouths, with just the right amount of heat.  A nice start!\n\nAfter finishing the calamari our salads arrive.  They were pretty straight forward -- iceberg lettuce, with some black pitted olives and cherry tomatoes.  When we were done, the plates were bused and we sat for a few minutes enjoying some good conversation.  Angela came by and refilled our water glasses and gave us an update on our meal.  In fact she came by several times during our dinner to check on things and to refill glasses.  \n\nI only mention this because with non-chain restaurants the dining experience can be somewhat casual in nature.  This is done intentionally I'm told to create a sense of ambience for the diners.  It also means you sometimes don't see your wait staff as often.  Not here, Angela stayed on top of things!\n\nOur dinner arrived and everything looked good.  The only mix-up was with the spaghettini which we ordered with a meat sauce.  It was served however with a marinara, or so we thought .  Angela offered to take it back to the kitchen and remake it, but we opted to remove the sauce and just get a bowl of meat sauce for our pasta.  That's where it became interesting, because that in fact was the meat sauce.  We only realized it after she brought out the new meat sauce which was the same as we had initially.\n\nOkay, so the meat sauce isn't their strong suit.  We where thinking more bolognese and this was more sauce with a little meat in it.  Our error, but everything was good.  The Chicken Parmigiana had two pieces of breast meat that was breaded just right.  And, the Caprese pasta was flavored with a balsamic reduction sauce.  Nice.\n\nOur bill, before taxes came to $65.75, which also included a glass of Chianti for $6.00.   We thought it was more then fair and the portions were generous.  We even had three take home boxes.\n\nAs we were leaving, we saw several thin crust pizzas go by for one of the larger groups and thought maybe next time.  We will definitely be back.\n\nEnjoy!
