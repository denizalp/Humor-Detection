The Junction Triangle sure needed a place like this, and I'm happy to see this stretch of Dupont begin to liven up. In the two years that I've been living in this area, good coffee and a cozy cafe like this one were basically non-existent. \n\nCafe Con Leche is owned by a sweet and adorable couple who are super-friendly and very welcoming. I will always remember the one evening when Carlos (one of the owners) stopped traffic in the midst of Snowmageddon, so that my friend and I could cross the street to get lattes. \n\nTheir specialty is the Nutella latte -- it's a must try! Aside from coffee and lattes, the place offers scrumptious pastries including their famous Nutella donut. (They are very big on their Nutella love!) The shop offers free WiFi, so it's also a great place to get some work done.  \n\nI will miss being able to visit this shop as often when I move out of the neighbourhood. It's worth the bus ride to check out though, so I will be sure to pay my visits.
