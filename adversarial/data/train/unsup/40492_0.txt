Nothing special about this place. I ordered the Bangkok Brownie. Ice cream itself was tasty and would have been special if the chocolate drizzle and brownie bites didnt cover up all of its flavor. \nMy friend ordered the cookies n cream but they forgot to put all the decorating cookies and Hershey's on the ice cream.  Everything was also way too sweet.
