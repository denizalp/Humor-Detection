Ok ok ...so you know how I was major hating on White Castle in my first review...well, I'll give it 3 stars this time around!\n\nCame here on Fat Tuesday after some drinks at The Linq. Ordered the 10 mini burgs with cheese, large fries, cheesecake, and cheese sticks.\n\nIt was cool. I mean, for $20 or so, it was cool.\n\nBurgers were hot, fresh, bite sized. \nCheesecake was REALLY small for being a cheesecake (on a stick!).\n\nI think the plus was the funny cashiers and the 10% OFF FOR LOCALS!!!!!!!!
