This is the absolute worst hair salon I've ever tried.  Bought a voucher that includes wash, haircut, blowdry, style, 15-min scalp massage and 30 minute facial. \n\nOwner might have massaged my scalp for 5 mins or less instead of 15 mins as stated in voucher.  Haircut by owner was terrible. I walked in with a perfect haircut except that my hair was growing out so I wanted a fresh cut.  I even showed her a picture of what I want the end result to be and she said \"so the same thing?\"...obviously she's got vision issues.  Then another staff blowdried my hair but didn't do it properly.  Even I can blowdry better.  She blowdried 80% and asked another staff to start straightening my hair. To no surprise, that staff couldn't straighten properly either. She only straightened the outer layer of my hair.  So, I checked my haircut and it was full of flaws. I wasn't going to leave that place without having them fix it. At this point, the owner who cut my hair was gone so another staff looked at my hair and said it was fine. But clearly, it was not. There were bumps here and there, unevenness, even a non professional can notice.  So I pretty much had to pressure her to fix it, but all she did was snip a few strands here and there which made no difference.  So i just gave up instead of giving them another chance to mess up my hair.  \n\nThen, they asked if I got a voucher.  I handed them the voucher and they said they didn't know I had a voucher.   First of all, I clearly stated I have a voucher when making the appointment and owner even confirmed prior to booking me.  They should've asked before sitting me down if anything.  And they didn't want to do the 30 minute facial which was included.  But at that point, I was so disappointed and frustrated with my haircut I didn't want to bother with anything else.  So I left without paying them any tips.  \n\nThis place is horrible.
