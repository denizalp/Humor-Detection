Holy cow. Shame on me for taking so long to write this review. The place is earthy, a bit hippy, and plenty friendly. Oddly out of place in the urban jungle that is the Phoenix metro area, but definitely welcome. \n\nSome of the menu is raw, but I'm often up for trying new things, so I ordered the bagel sandwich (no onion). This is without a doubt, one of the best vegan dishes I've had in a restaurant, the bagel was more like a flat bread, and the filling was just the right about vegetables, including sprouts and vegan cream cheese. Fantastic. \n\nI'd also ordered a too large bottle of organic ale (excellent too) , and gave the rest to the neighboring table. Finally, I risked the dessert. It was OK, but it didn't matter, the rest was amazing. \n\nSadly my short time in Chandler meant that I wasn't able to go again. I'm sure I'll visit again one day. I just hope it's not 114 out.
