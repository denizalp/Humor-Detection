Been going here for years and it's the best Italian spot I know of in Arizona. Fresh homemade pastas to cook at home, pizza, sandwiches, deli, anti pasta, and all sorts of side salads. I've tried almost everything and it's all delicious. Everything is super fresh, and they'll make anything you want. It's always a tasty Italian experience with a great local business feel. Everybody I've brought here has a great experience as well.\n\nThe only thing that is tough is it gets super busy at the popular times, so it's tough to get a seat if you want to eat there. Other than that I have no complaints.
