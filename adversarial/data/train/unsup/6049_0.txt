Worst experience ever! Will never go back to that dealership again this is the second bad experience I've had there. They sold me a car and I traded my car in and they had no proof or record of my income and then harassed me for a weeks for all kinds of information. Said they couldn't get me approved for financing and offered me a totally different car-Two weeks later I finally found out who financed me. Very unprofessional. Thankfully I argued with them for a week and got my payment down $100 per month! And they took off all that stuff I did not need. \nThey also sold me a car alarm system to be added onto my payment (which didn't exist at the time) and also didn't fit the car they sold me. \nTheir response to everyone with one star is exactly the same, Copied. So yes I will understand they appreciate my concern LOL \nThey had no idea how to work the car they gave me, could not hook up the phone or get certain things to work on the car and then refused to rectify it. The guy in financing had only been there a few months but said he's been doing it for years but was in training the whole time I needed to get in touch with him about the financials. Used car salesmen, that's all they are. \nOn a brighter note, Dan the Internet salesman was at least helpful in the beginning. I hope he moves to a more reputable dealership! They are just as bad as Findlay Honda. \nAnd unfortunately Honda it is an awesome car-They need to get better representation!
