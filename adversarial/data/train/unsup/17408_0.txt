1) Upon arrival we had to fork over $300 extra for \"resort fees\" and \"Damage deposits\" - I paid everything up front MONTHS ago -  there was no mention of additional fees. WTF is that? My food money was suddenly gone.\n\n2) You would think free WIFI is included in those \"resort fees\" but NOPE.\n\n3) The TV channels SUCKED. 5 tellemundo, 6 Asian sports, 10 hotel channels with a constant stream of how awesome they are because they recycle poo water to use in their gardens.  We had 3 TV's and nothing to watch unless of course you wanted to pay for a movie.\n\n4) No matter what we did to the thermostat it stayed 70 degrees in the room. I know, I brought my own thermometer. You could turn that sucker down to 65, or up to 80 and the room stayed the same temperature.  \n\n5) You can smell other rooms. Our neighbors would order late night room service. In wafts that enticing curry smell at 2am - GAG.\n\n6) The water pressure in the shower - or lack there of. They said it was because they are eco-friendly and use low flow fixtures. Yea honey, I live in Seattle, home of the tree huggers. I also have a low flow fixture. Mine feels like a spa, yours feels like  Grandma spitting in my hair.\n\n7) The toilet paper was about the same as a truck stop bathroom. My feet walked on marble and my butt wiped with sand paper.\n\n8) The mattresses were not comfy - they had that same bounce as a motel 6, yee haw!\n\n9) The comforter and some of the towels smelled funky.\n\n10) The elevators - OMG people, they not only were slow - our trip to the 22nd floor would take close to 5 minutes, but they bounced and jiggled to were we all still felt like we were moving an hour after using them. We would seriously come up with way to use them as little as possible. For real, I felt like I was on a ride at the Strasosphere.\n\n11) Overpriced, mediocre food. Any and ALL of the restaurants on site and frankly on the strip. Believe me when I say I hit most of them and while some of them were good, nothing was great - and in most cases were blah.\n\n12) My number 1 complaint isn't any of these picky things that by themselves wouldn't have been so bad. It was the attitude. The snarky, annoyed \"I'm better than you\" tone every employee seemed to have. I know I am at an over priced hotel, but don't be a jerk-face while you are robbing my blind, at least pretend to give a sh*t before I turn my back. \n\nMy room was pretty and it was nice - but every time I had a question beyond, \"how do I pay?\" I was met with negativity that frankly ruined my trip. \n\nHeads up - you want to stay here, have the dough and be ready to be met with resting b*tch face at every turn.
