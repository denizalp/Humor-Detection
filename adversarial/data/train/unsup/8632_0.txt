I have been by this place many times and finally stopped one day. I had Breakfast on a Saturday morning. My server was Maxwell. He was adorable and very professional.\nI was happy I had gone in.Food is not the best but, it is very inexpensive, so no complaints here. \nAfter such a great experience, I thought I would go back for lunch.\nSince this time it was a week day Maxwell was not working, so I was given another waiter. He tried, however yelling at me from across the room ,did I need anything else was not professional at all.\nI know he just did not know any better. Please do not discuss your personal lives at work where all the patrons can hear. It is bad Business.\nPerhaps Maxwell should be teaching the others how to behave when they are at work. I had gone in for a late lunch so there was only 3 other tables in here. \nAll the more reason not to put your business out on the street.\nI am sure I will be back. But, I am hoping to get Maxwell or someone similar next time.\nBathroom is clean and lots of parking in the lot.
