I would highly recommend Naya. for a fabulous new ethnic eating experience in a lovely atmosphere.  Naya's cuisine is based on Lebanese food, which I had a craving for since I had worked in Dearborn for 20 years where the best Middle Eastern food in the United States is served. The food I had was fantastic, the best Lebanese food I've had since I left Dearborn.  We had, and I recommend, Mezza combo plate which is kind of a greatest hits of appetizers for Lebanese food: hummus, baba ghanouj, grape leaves, tabouliand some others.  We also tried the grilled chicken on skewers which was absolutely delicious - - tender flavorful and with a nice charcoal taste.  We finished with a perfect baklava, much more well-balanced than your typical overly sweet Greek dessert.\n\nNaya takes Lebanese food to a new level by offering some other Mediterranean dishes and serving it in an absolutely beautiful high-end decor. The restaurant would be great for dates, adult outings or even family meals for those who like Middle Eastern food. Naya is a real find in Scottsdale
