I FINALLY made it to Naked BBQ after years of hearing about it. For some reason we would always remember on a Sunday and unfortunately they are closed on Sundays. We went around 6:30 on a Friday night and there was only one other couple there so we were able to step in and order right away. We got everything to-go. I have to say I was a little disappointed in all the sides. The Mac & Cheese was dry and lacking flavor, the coleslaw was very ordinary, we ordered potato salad but ended up with another order of coleslaw instead. The corn bread was very good though, soft on the inside and perfect golden brown on the outside. My favorite thing we got was the brisket! Mmmmm... I could have eaten a few pounds of that fall apart, juicy, fatty goodness. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good, I liked the toasted soft bun. There were tons of homemade sauces to chose from. Each one of them had great flavor and one had a great kick of heat, I think my favorite was the mustard, it had a nice tang. So I would like to give this place another try. We will for sure be back from some more brisket and cornbread, I'm thinking potato salad and ribs are a must next time as well.
