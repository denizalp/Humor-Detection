I wish I could give them 6 stars! Creative Paradise did an outstanding job on our backyard. Kylee designed the perfect landscape based on our needs and wants. She also was there every step of the way helping guide us to make good decisions with regard to faux grass, plants, pavers and countertops. Their work crew is like a well tuned machine and they worked in 115 degree heat with no complaints! \n\nI recommend CP and I also give Kylee high praise for her great work!
