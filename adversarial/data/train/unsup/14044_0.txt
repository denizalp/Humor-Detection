Very weird place for a restaurant in my opinion... ha. Well, at least for now it is. Before I know it, that whole place will probably be filled with businesses. But, for those of you that want to try it.. I know the address says it's on Rainbow - but Rainbow does not go through all the way yet. So, if you're on Blue Diamond, Get onto Buffalo, turn left at Cactus and go all the way down, and you'll see it on your left. \n\nI'm not really sure what I was expecting when I walked into the place, but I liked what I saw. The place was decorated with a crap load of Christmas stuff. A little own of miniatures houses and a huge Christmas tree ! I'm not sure how festive the restaurant is on a normal basis, but it looks cute now. \n\nI really wanted to try this place for two reasons:\n1. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BREAKFAST FOODS !\n2. I'm on a mission to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas. \n\nThe CFS here was good. Almost comparable to my favorite in Vegas so far [Babycakes]. It was good, very good...[not chewy at all!!] but a little too peppery for my taste [not overpowering or anything]. Now, if you're a person who likes pepper, then you'll probably enjoy this. It's safe to say that this is the 2nd best [at least in my opinion] CFS in Vegas. The portion of the CFS is also quite smaller compared to Babycakes, but still big enough to fill you. The gravy was a very nice. Probably the best gravy I've gotten on any CFS. It was rich, thick, and had bits of sausage throughout it. Very, very good ! \n\nI ordered the scrambled eggs with my CFS, as well as the battered potatoes. The scrambled eggs were underwhelming. Well seasoned, but definitely overcooked. Potatoes were good. I'm not a big potato fan at all, but I actually ate quite of few of their potatoes. They were nice and crispy.\n\nI'm excited to go back and try the rest of the offerings.  The service could have been better, but it wasn't quite bad enough to knock this review down to four stars.
