This is one of the best kid's activities in the city. There are plenty of interactive exhibits for kids to play with. Permanent exhibits include a village where kids can change a car tire, a fake bathroom where they can fix the plumbing, an airport with an airplane they can pilot, and a water\/soap exhibit where they can make bubbles.\n\nThere's a temporary construction exhibit where kids can learn about simple machines and build things using blocks, pipes, screws, nuts and bolts. This exhibit runs until May.\n\nMy kid had a great time running from exhibit to exhibit and playing with everything. The museum can get crowded on weekends, so either come early  or stop by on a weekday to avoid the masses. Great place to spend an hour or two for kids of all ages.\n\nAdmission: $8.50 for adults \/ $7.50 for kids. Annual passes are also available, with prices ranging from $65 - 85.
