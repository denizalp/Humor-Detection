10 out of 10 Jews approve of heaping portions that require doggy bags, $25 off coupons sent straight to your house once a month, and reasonable prices. Did I mention that the food basically forced me to change my pants immediately afterward?  And I mean that in a positive way, not in a rushing to the bathroom way.\n\nI've still never been for breakfast but I did order a couple breakfast dishes for dinner and was not disappointed. The crispy salmon dish is not only delicious it's also healthy which I'm not sure you can say for the rest of the menu. I did feel a bit like half the menu might kill me with how much food and richness they provide but what the fuck do I care. Eat up and worry about your health later.
