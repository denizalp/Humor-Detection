Great new location on the southwest side of town! \n\nMy wife and I are constantly on the hunt for the best New York style pizza in the valley and Rocco's has become one of our new favorites! \n\nThey have a wide variety of pizza, pasta, salads and, deserts. They use imported tomato sauces and pasta - you can taste the quality! If you just want a slice or a whole pie, make sure you check out this new Rocco's location! You won't regret it
