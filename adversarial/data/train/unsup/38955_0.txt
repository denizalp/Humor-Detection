Service:  The people who work here are very nice!  They always greet me with a smile.\n\nDrinks: Fairly tasty.  I appreciate that they have teas as well when I am not in the mood for coffee.\n\nAtmosphere:  Unfortunately this is where Coffee Rush loses me.  There are no comfortable chairs inside but rather uncomfortable metal chairs.  On nice days I would like to go outside, but this seems to be the hang out for smokers.  That's fine for smokers, but I am not one.\n\nSummary:  If you are a smoker and want some coffee, this is the place!
