I crave wonton noodles from time to time.. so today was the day. I ordered the fish paste with wonton. I like this place as I find the broth less greesy and the noodles has a nice texture. There's a few on these wonton noodle places in Toronto, this one doesn't serve the dumplings. The atmosphere feels like you are back in Hong Kong. The Chili oil is made in house and just enough heat. My brother enjoyed it so much that we had to buy a bottle home. The Chili oil is $10 per bottle. Very tasty!
