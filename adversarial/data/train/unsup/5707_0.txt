This place is smaller than Bombay Bazar and offered less of a selection. \n\nIt appears to be clean and the guy behind the counter was very nice and helpful.  If you live on this side of town then I would definitely recommend stopping here first for your Indian spices and food products.  If they don't have what you need you can always drive over to Maryland.\n\n[exterior photos submitted]
