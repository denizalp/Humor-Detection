Surrender is one of the best clubs I've ever been to. There's like a million dance floors, always ends up being open bar somewhere or the other (or free champagne for girls) and it's so incredibly spacious that it's never too crowded. It's a lot of walking but I honestly think it's worth it because there's a lot to see and each area of the club is a greattttt time. Every time I come to Vegas I find myself at Surrender. The one huge indoor dance floor gets REALLY crowded and there will be douches that push little girls like me around. But there is always a solution to that problem, stick your gum in their hair and run away. \n\nNote to drunk girls -- don't lie on the counter in the bathroom with your purse open. Everything WILL fall out, and you WILL NOT notice, and you WILL lose your ID. And then find it 10 minutes later because the cleaning lady is an angel. \n\nAnother note -- do not go to the cabanas to pee because security WILL incessantly knock on your door yelling for you to come out or else they will kick you out. Those are private, $10,000 bathrooms and they will make sure you don't forget that. Go find a normal bathroom and save yourself the humiliation.
