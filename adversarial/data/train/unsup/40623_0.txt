Absolutely delicious. Super friendly staff. You can tell they have MANY regulars, they know people by name and are very attentive. I want to say this.... I love Mexican food and this is the very BEST. When I need some Mexican food in my life from here on out this is where I will go. No exception. My waitress Kristin was super friendly and efficient.
