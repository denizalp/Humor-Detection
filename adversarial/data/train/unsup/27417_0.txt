Loved it! Actually we loved it so much, we ate there 3 times over the week we were in Vegas. Very reminiscent of the \"old Las Vegas\" and almost nostalgic. Truly a visual spectacle! The only thing better than the food was the appearance of the restaurant.\n\nThe decor is some of the most interesting I've seen with exotic plant life all around you and neon running the walls and ceilings. The lounge was fantastic and very upscale looking with the round oversized cushions and tables. 21 and over in there, so that portion of the restaurant is not for kids.\n\nFood portions are huge! Each time my girlfriend and I took leftovers back to the hotel. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day everyday. We didn't wait long at all for food or drink! Service was exceptional each time regardless of when we went. A huge perk in itself!\n\nConvenient and easy to get to with a large side lot and front lot. Parking is not an issue. So be sure to swing by and give the Peppermill a try! You won't be disappointed, just be sure to bring your appetite!!
