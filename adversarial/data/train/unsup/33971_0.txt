Wow. What a gem. A business associate asked if we had ever been here, so tonight we stopped over. Amazing food. This is not a chain,  and the strip plaza is a bit odd, but don't   let that get in your way. Family owned and operated and warmth like you were in their home. Pasta is home made, unique dishes, and wonderful wine. Just tell Fran what you like and pure magic will happen. Can't wait to come back.
