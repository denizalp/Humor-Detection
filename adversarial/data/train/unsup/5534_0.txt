I'm a little Zor right now so I'm just gonna relax on the couch and write this review.\n\nIt's been a long time since I had the Gyro (Pittsburghese: Jeye-row) here but I remember it being pretty good which is why I give it four stars. The chicken gyro on the other hand is not a real chicken gyro so that would score 2. And the last few times I've tried to come here it's been closed when it was supposed to be open and I don't appreciate that. So if that happens again it will be going down to three stars.
