Came here with a group of 11 and had an amazing experience. Our server Christina treated us like great friends. So hospitable, tons of fun, and extremely knowledgeable. We danced, we laughed, and we ate a whole lot. We celebrated two birthdays and felt the love from start to finish. We love Christina. And we are coming back for more soon.
