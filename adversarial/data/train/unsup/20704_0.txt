Called Croffoot after waking up to No A\/C.  They promptly returned our call and scheduled to come out same day (heading into record heat weekend).  Prior to showing up I received a call the  technician was running ahead of schedule and could be there an hour early if I was available  (when was the last you heard that?). Kirk arrived and promptly diagnosed and fixed the issue.  The A\/C was up and running shortly after arrival.  Very professional, prompt, and reasonably priced.  What else are you looking for? Will use Croffoot for all future needs.
