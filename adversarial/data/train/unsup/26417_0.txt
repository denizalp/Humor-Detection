This is one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. Food is always fresh and excellent. The restaurant is relaxed and very comfortable but the service is AWESOME. They entire staff is friendly and attentive managers are always around. \n\nWe went this past weekend and Paul our waiter was awesome. We ordered an appetizer and it may have taken a few minutes longer to come out than expected but we did not notice. Paul apologized twice and then they comped the appetizer which was totally not needed. It was maybe five minutes longer than it should have and honestly we were having a nice time talking and enjoying the atmosphere. This is why we continue to come back this restaurant takes care of the customer better than just about any other. \n\nWe highly recommend Honey Salt for the food and the service. Excellent restaurant and we will be back soon. If you have not been you have to come here.
