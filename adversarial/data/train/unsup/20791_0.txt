A flock of locals from Hawaii tend to be joining the Las Vegas population so it's no wonder that there are tons of local kind grindz restaurants popping up in LV.  Finding Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is a taste of home in this desert town.  \n\nConsidering that this is more or less a casual fast food dining experience, the service is outstanding.  A friendly welcome when you step in and they bring your food, utensils and drinks directly to your table without you having to get up after you order.  The decor of the restaurant itself is simple and clean.  A large plasma screen and a gorgeous picture of Waikiki beach with Diamond Head in the background adorned the walls.  \n\nThere were four of us girls so we decided to order a bunch of items to share.  A bbq mixed plate which consisted of 2 scoops of rice, mac salad, bbq chicken, teri beef, and short ribs.  The meats were marinated really well so that each piece was full of flavor and my favorite part about it?  None of the pieces of the meat was tough!  From the chicken to the teri beef to the ribs, tender, not overcooked and soft.  It's nice when you aren't wrestling with your meal with the possiblity that the meat is going to beat you and tear your teeth out.  \n\nWe also ordered a couple of spam musubis and saimin.  Spam musubi and saimin is a great combo for some reason.  It totally complements each other.  The soup base for the saimin was tasty and the spam musubi's were teri-sauce delish!  \n\nStuffed and ready to take our money back from the casinos...our party got up to leave.  Ohana BBQ staff truly know how to show their Aloha.  A sincere thanks and au revoir to us and we were on our merry way. \n\nTruly, a great, warm tasting \"Aloha\" experience.
