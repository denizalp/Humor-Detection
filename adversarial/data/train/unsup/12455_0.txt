A very good middle of the road Brazilian M'eatery.  Located conveniently in Town Center.  A great place to catch up to that inner carnivorous primal foodie in you after a day of shopping or before you catch a film.  Opening the huge heavy doors they creek and it looks as though you've stepped into Dracula's mansion.  Very formal dark and brooding, just what you expect to see in a place that specializes in bringing tender dead animal meat carcasses from the fire to your fork.\n\nTri-tip or whatever the house cut is called is perfection!  I skip the sausage.  Leave room for the bevy of flank, pork, lamb, bacon wrapped stuff and parm crusted chicken.  The leg of lamb was a bit tough last time but the chop was very tender.  \n\nThe usuals are there at the salad bar.  Pick up some goat cheese, roasted garlic and chimichuri for your meats from there!  Standard fare not the worst Brazilian.  We first had it over a decade ago at Yollies.  Definitely better than them.  Give it shot.  Lunch is 30 bucks before 3.
