This is my new favorite little bakery!  I have driven by it for months and always wanted to stop in.  I finally had an opportunity to do so.  My Love is not much of a sweets eater and if it is too sweet forget it!  For his birthday I wanted to have a little mini celebration, just the two of us and you can't have a birthday celebration, or any celebration without cake, Honestly, I do not need a reason for cake!  So anyway... I stopped by and explained my \"not to sweet\" dilemma and was helped by a very nice and helpful.  I wish I had gotten his name.  He suggested  a  Strawberry Puff Pastry with whip cream and the only sweetness was the powder sugar that dusted it.  It was delicious and perfect. But scheduling conflicts delayed our celebration by one day.  Long story short, went back the next dayand they were out of the pastries, someone had come in earlier and bought them all, not shocked at all!  Same nice guy helped me,  I asked about the Frazier cake.  A lightly sweetened cake, whip cream, strawberries, and almonds.  OMG!!!  It was perfect and he loved it!  My birthday is coming up and I definitely see this cake making an appearance!
