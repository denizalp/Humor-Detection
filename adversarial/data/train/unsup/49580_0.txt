I love Thai Food. Like, a lot. And I'm super picky about my Thai. I moved to vegas about a year ago and tried a few places. They were all ok but none were really amazing that i had to go back. Then someone recommended Archi's. Since I'm giving it 5 stars (which honestly may not be enough stars), you can probably assume I love this place and go often. I have finally found my Vegas thai restaurant and will continue to go back. Pretty great deal on the lunch special with large portions. Can't go wrong.
