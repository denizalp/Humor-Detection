This is a tough one to review, mainly because the overall prices of swimming pool stuff is totally out of hand. This depressed economy seems to have the opposite effect on pool supply prices, because they seem to go up a good 5% annually. Even with their discount coupons, the prices are really high, but I suspect that it's the same at all pool places.\nHowever, this place is only a few blocks from my house, which makes it very convenient for bringing in pool water for them to test, etc.\nThe service there is very good (when they have more than one person working in there), and they offer free check-ups on anything that you bring in (automatic pool vacuums, etc.)\nThey have a huge selection, so I always find what I'm looking for in their store (although sometimes I can't afford everything that I need).
