It was absolutely superb from the moment we walked in. We were greeted with politeness and a lovely smiles. The decor is elegant and there is such a comforting vibe in the place. The food was absolutely delicious - we had the butter chicken and I had a vegetable korma curry. Both were full of the most succulent flavors I think I have ever put in my mouth! And... the sweet naan bread, I could've ate the whole basket! The absolute epic moment for me was the gulab jamun, so light and delicate in texture, it dissolves in your mouth and the sweetness was just right, sublime! I can't wait to return because I want to have my birthday party in their private party room that has a Beautiful balcony with the most spectacular Las Vegas view. I highly recommend! The cherry on top was when the chef personally came out to ensure that we were happy with his creations. Above all - was our server, Aman - he was very attentive and ensured that our every need was met  :)
