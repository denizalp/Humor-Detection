Our saving grace this summer! We had run through the gamete of HVAAC companies, who would either tell us they didn't work with mini-splits or just never showed up. Within a week of calling Blinson, Stan was able to give us a quote, hookup a brand new inside and outside unit, tested it and hauled all of the old stuff away. He also did this at the best rate. Stan is extremely personable and definitely has a long, extensive history working with HVAAC units. From now on he is our go-to company for both our mini-split and standard HVAAC in our home.
