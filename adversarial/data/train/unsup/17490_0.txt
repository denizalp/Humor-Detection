Average Food. Loud, Unprofessional & Brash Host\n\nThis place is highly rated and that is what drew me  and my friends here on Christmas Day. Here's what happened. This might be hard to believe but its true. I'm not a fan of writing lengthy negative yelp reviews. \n1. Host (heavy set Indian Punjabi guy) comes to take the order, writes all the items. We ordered a range of items from lamb, chicken, biriyani and pulao. Host asks for spice level.. My friend asks host if he is asking for any specific item, Host responds that he's referring to \"everything\" (At this point my friend and rest of us didnt like his tone) and not just one item. So we told him mild.. Till now everything was fine. \n\n2. During the course of our meal, he came up to our table 3 times asking the exact same questions(trying to make conversation)  a. how the food was(which was fine by us) b. how he is seeing so many people from california today visiting his restaurant \nc. tried to \"settle\" things with my friend that if they were \"good\"\n3. On the last two of the three occasions, he jokingly taunted my friend by telling my friend's wife \"she is with this man\". Even tried making a funny comment at his daughter. He jokingly asked us if we had been \"driven out of California that we were at that restaurant \". When we asked for the check he also said we could leave pay a couple of thousand dollars to which my friends wife said that he could give us a complementary meal. Following it he again mocked us. I don't think any sane host ever behaves like this\n4. He was rude to his staff (seemed mostly mexican) including yelling at them, talking to them in an undignified tone. He was also talking in a boisterous manner even with other customers trying to please them. Has no sense of customer service or class whatsoever. \n5. During the \"driven out of California\" comment I lost my cool and told him that we werent interested in making conversation with him and needed to get the check. As he walked away he said in a snide manner that \"It was my lucky day that he fed me\". \n6. He yelled at the waiter again asking them to ring us up and gave a paper check with extremely poor handwriting and added a 20%+ tip(87 dollars was inflated to 106). In order to avoid any further altercation, we just paid everything off and left. \nBy far the most uncultured unprofessional host i have seen till date. Owner: if you're reading this, please take note and fire him because of the way he behaves with your staff if not anything else. Host: If you happen to be the owner, may god save you and go learn the basics of customer service.
