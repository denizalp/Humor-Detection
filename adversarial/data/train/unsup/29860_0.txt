I just celebrated by 30th birthday here and we had a great time. The place was pretty empty and food was still on the tables around 10:30 when we came in, but it slowly filled up and we ended up having an intense dance party for the rest of the night.\n\nAs for the music? One of my friends said it reminded her of a high school dance, And it's true -- there were throw back songs like Nelly and Sean Paul that took me back to high school days and the first few years of university. The DJ was happy to play a latin track I requested, and kept us dancing all night with soca, hip hop and more. All in all a great night. Love the fact that there is no cover -- a perfect venue when you have a big group and you want to give people the freedom to drop by when they can.
