Third trip up the tower over the years, and it is always impressive! When you think about the people who did the construction though, that's the really impressive part.\n\nStayed up on the observation decks at least an hour and a half checking out the city, obviously an incredible view from roughly 900 ft up. Reasonably priced drinks at the highest bar in Vegas, and some good looking food at a little deli type place.\n\nThey also have a sit down restaurant at the top, think it is on the 106th floor. Looked at the menu which looked good, but decided not to eat there.\n\nLast trip out I rode the rollercoaster at the top the Stratosphere, since then they have removed it?? Was a great ride.\n\nThey now have the Sky Jump as a \"Thrill Ride.\" Basically they charge you $120, strap you into a harness, hook you to a cable,,, then tell you to jump off the building from the 108th floor. OK!\n\nI'm going to use the $120 as the reason I didn't jump off of the Stratosphere,,,yep, that's why I didn't do it!\n\nHave to go back at night at some point, especially after looking at others photos on Yelp.
