The selection of extensions and wigs here is mind boggling. The perimeter of the store is all counters where you have to get a clerk to help you. The center is filled with aisles of product and lesser expensive items.  The store is located in a run-down strip mall with a lot of people hanging around the church that's in one of the neighboring stores.\n\nI caught a little attitude from some of the other customers. There was a vibe of \"You-Ain't-From-Around-Here\" but the clerks were generally nice and helpful.\n\nI've been here a few times and will continue to come back for the selection and the reasonable prices.
