LAVO = Douche bag central \n\nIt was our first night in Vegas (Sunday). We walked by around midnight and saw the small line and decided to check it out. We were staying at the Venetian so we got in for free. Thank friggin god. I would not want to pay $10 and $20 for the boy to get in here. You'll see why... \n\nThe lounge was chill. Lots of loungy couches with hookahs on each table and plenty of seats at the bar. The decor was chic, dark and inviting. I enjoyed the music much more downstairs as they played the euro-house-trance type music. \n\nWe watched an abundance of Asian girls dressed in their skimpiest Forever 21 dresses (the faces did not match the outfits...hilarious) walk the line of 20+ running sinks to the upstairs club. The space was very small. \n\nThere was a small space on the perimeter of the dance floor for table service. There were TONS of douches here with what it appeared to be hired escorts. No joke. There was another group of euro douches who were standing on their table attempting to \"make it rain\". What friggin idiot posers. Ick! \n\nAfter I threw up in my mouth several times, I decided it was time to go. I would definitely return to the lounge area but I WOULD NOT pay to get in.
