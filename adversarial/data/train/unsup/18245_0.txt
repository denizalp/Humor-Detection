On my 2nd trip to Scottsdale, I made my rounds bar hopping in the Entertainment District and can say officially that I've been to every bar there. Among all the bars in the area, I think that The District is my favorite. My experience this time around was so much better than last year's, and I wouldn't have wanted to cap our night at any other place. The bouncers were cool and didn't stand around like robot douchebags. The music was just as good as I remembered with a mix of Top 40, hip hop, EDM, trap, etc. For a Saturday night on a holiday weekend (Martin Luther King), the place didn't feel so claustrophobic with people. The bathrooms were clean and maintained pretty well through the night. I had such a great time partying here, and I look forward to coming here again on my next trip to Scottsdale!
