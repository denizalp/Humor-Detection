I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough! I stayed for ten days recently to celebrate a wedding anniversary and the Delta was perfect in every single way! Before we arrived, my partner had been in touch with the hotel and we were upgraded on arrival to a magnificent corner room with views over the city, CN Tower, Rogers Centre and the Toronto Islands. The rooms themselves are a reason to choose the Delta alone. Modern, stylish and filled with all the mod-cons a traveller needs in this day and age. The basic (and free) wifi is fast enough for anyone wanting to browse social media sites. \nHowever, it is the staff who are the Delta's greatest asset. Nothing is too much trouble for them - from the greeters outside, to porters, to reception staff, to concierge staff. Everyone we met were exceptionally friendly and incredibly helpful. They are knowledgeable about their city and make good recommendations, call taxis, etc. David, in particular, treated us like VIPs! We returned to the room several times to lovely surprises to help celebrate our special day. This hotel is the very best I have stayed at and I am missing my glorious view already!  Stay at other hotels in Toronto at your peril!
