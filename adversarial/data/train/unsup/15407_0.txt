Andreoli, you disappoint me. Here's why...\nAfter not visiting you for nearly a year, I craved your food. Either you are resting on your laurels or stopped caring or both.\nWith crummy weather that we had today, a friend suggested your restaurant. Well other than the coffee that is consistently excellent, the pasta dish I ordered left everything to be desired...I ate because I was hungry but there was nothing in that dish worth recommending - dried pasta, uninteresting ragu - no sauce whatsoever....blah! \n\nSo much for driving 20 minutes to come see you, I'll stay home next time thinking of you and make my own meal and not spend $ 13 for a dish that's not even worth two bucks.\n\nOn top of that, you are too busy talking on the phone instead of taking care of your customers. Not even one person bothered to ask us how our food was.
