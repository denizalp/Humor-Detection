Oh Lordy...where to even begin? Like anyone else, we came here for the free breakfast and free show. Peter and I had been talking about timeshares, but we weren't informed. So we figured we'd reap the benefits of the breakfast and show as well as inform ourselves on what timeshares are all about. \n\nThe presentation was GREAT! It made so much sense! Why pay more to rent when we can save money by owning? I apply that type of logic to my daily life (I bought a house instead of renting one). Our rep, Jacob was really nice. He took us over to the resort...which was nice, but it felt more like a retirement home than anything else.\n\nWe were both up front with Jacob. We told him that we wouldn't be able to make a decision today. We likes the logic behind their sales pitch, but bottom line is we need more time to think about our finances. Jacob didn't like it. We just kept going around in circles. It turned from the mindset of \"let's get information\" into \"let's get out of here!\" \n\nWe finally were released from Wyndham's claws, and got our $40 deposit back. We got our free vouchers for Jubilee and a $50 American Express giftcard! Ultimately, we came up...but you pay for these incentives with your time and sanity. \n\nThe talk is NOT 120 minutes. We were there from 9:55am until around...2pm! CRAZY!!!!!!
