WARNING: DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! Their sales practices are unprofessional and suspicious. \n\nHORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! HORRIBLE POLICIES!! UNPROFESSIONAL!!\nWe felt ROBBED!!\n\nThey charged us almost $200 restocking fee for something that was their fault!!!! THE SALESMAN, MIKE, SOLD US FURNITURE THAT HE LATER CLAIMED WAS NOT AVAILABLE. \n\nWe asked him to just refund our whole order since we bought the coffee table set and the dining set TO MATCH EACH OTHER. But he refused, saying the policy states they cannot refund unless they charge the 25% restocking fee. BUT WHY ARE WE GETTING CHARGED RESTOCKING FEE IF IT WAS NOT EVEN OUR FAULT IN THE FIRST PLACE??? IT WAS THIER FAULT!! \n\nIt is the company's responsibility to communicate accurate information to their customers before selling anything. Before buying the item, MIKE told us there was more in the warehouse, placed an order for us, and CHARGED US for the whole purchase. Later, we were informed they did not in fact have it and would not refund us without restocking fees??! He denies telling us that they had more in stock but why did he charge us if he was not sure?? \n\nTHEY SOLD US AN ITEM THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND EXPECTS US TO PAY FOR IT OR PAY THE RESTOCKING FEE??! The items weren't even delivered to us and hasn't left their store!!!\n\nWOW!! We feel SCAMMED!!\n\nDO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!
