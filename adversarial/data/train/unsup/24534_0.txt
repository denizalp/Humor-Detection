I've been on a real bender lately...and this Fried Chicken was worth it!...I got the Betty Boop which is a huge fried chicken breast with a super fresh and tasty waffle...the chicken was juicy, moist and perfectly fried!  I smothered my waffle in the butter and syrup and need I say more...this was paradise!  I complimented my meal with a super sized mason jar of red koolaid and it was the perfect thing to wash this meal down with!  You have to get the Red Velvet cake it's a must have!!! This is a super fun place to go!
