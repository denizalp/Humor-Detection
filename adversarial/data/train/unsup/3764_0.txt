A return clerk who was a little less bossy could go a long way towards achieving a better rental experience. Know what I'm saying?\n\nWe dropped off our one-way rental here and had no idea what to expect. When they say \"off airport\", they don't mean that it's off the airport at the rental car center. No, not that. This is actually even more off than that. You'll take one bus from Fox to the rental center and then ANOTHER bus from the rental center to the airport. Yep, that's a pain in the ass when you have full size suitcases to maneuver. Ugh.\n\nAnd in at least a hundred different times I've returned a rental car, I can't remember anyone actually popping the hood and checking under there. Did I maybe steal the battery? WTH? But other than that, no hassle at all.
