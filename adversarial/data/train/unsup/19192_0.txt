We stayed on the third floor in one of the ateliers with the gable windows and sloped ceilings overlooking the street. It was very charming and felt like a Relais Chateaux property, while the hotel overall is very modern. \n\nThe bathroom has Le Labo Santal 33 toiletries. The roof has a spectacular view, and the bartender was awesome. He had long death metal rocker hair and eyeliner but was a sweetheart and made me off menu Hendricks Caesars. \n\nThe restaurant is like a brasserie overlooking the flea market scene of Place Jacques Cartier. I had an excellent 8 oz. grass fed skirt steak with chimichurri and two eggs over easy with saut√©ed vegetables and salad. Great beer selection, too. Lady Gaga was staying in the hotel while we were there, and she ordered pizza for her diehard \"monsters\" and serenaded them from her balcony. I'm glad no one pushed her off like in Paparazzi haha! You just can't get much cooler than this hotel. We loved it!
