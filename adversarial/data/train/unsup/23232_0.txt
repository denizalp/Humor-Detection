While every other salon in the area was booked for hours, this place was empty. The interior was very clean and pleasent looking.I went for a solar gel fill and was shocked that a fill and simple design came to $50. That's as much as a brand new set from the average salon. The girl went right up to my cuticles so the nails looked good at first but after several days of growth, there is a large, thick ridge which catches my hair, food and dirt. As a waitress, I'm in contact with food a lot and my nails make my hands look dirty. The design I chose was simple and should have been easy to do but ended up looking very messy.if you can't free hand a simple heart, you are in the wrong industry. The artist did not allow for amply drying time between coats so my nails remained wet and soft for hours after. I don't plan on wasting my time or money at this place again.
