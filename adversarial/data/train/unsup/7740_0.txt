Anyone who knows me will tell you that i LOVE the little hidden treasures that serve up good food with good pricing! This, my friends, is that little treasure nestled in a small corner on E Sahara right past Paradise. I love my Korean food, but most of all, the hearty soups that  make you feel all fuzzy all over, not to mention the home made kkakdogi and kim chi. The lady that runs this place is very nice, and the service was good. We had to keep asking for water refills, but it was no biggy. with your meal, you get the korean green chiles and its served up with a fermented soybean sauce mixture to dip it in. Its refreshing but hot when you get to those seeds!!! YIKES! I have been looking for a place that serves up good seollangtang here in Las Vegas, and thought I found one, but they stopped making it. Really? Ugh, so i was on the search again, and then WALLAH!!! E-JO came into the convo from a friend, and she said her fav soup was like a MILKY based soup. Ding Ding Ding, it was right on. Seollangtang!!! This is sort of a milky bone soup that served up with slices of brisket and somen noodles. Its not salty at all, so when you get your soup, you are given salt, green onions and chili pepper paste to put in the soup yourself to control the salt and spice level. SO ONO!I But on the menu, this is the #1 dish on the Menu, Beef Brisket Soup.  This place definitely does seollangtang right, not to mention the price is reasonable. I haven't tried any other dish from this place (sad i know) but I'll give other dishes a try when Im tired of this soup. BWAHAHA! Yea right. But in all seriousness, i will give the other dishes a shot too!
