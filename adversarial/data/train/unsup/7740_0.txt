Yelp and Fear Farm didn't disappoint tonight!  My party of four ended up with the most expensive admission available, which included fast passes, a haunted hayride, drinks and a cool souvenir photo.\n\nThank you Hailey.  You didn't know it, but tonight's outing was extra special... sad, but special.  It exceeded all our expectations, and will serve as the final memory whenever I think back on the wonderful times we shared.
