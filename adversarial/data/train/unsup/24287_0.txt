I absolutely adore this little shop. I have been in there 3 times and every time I've walked out with a better deal then the time before. I'm so proud of my finds. I haven't been in to consign anything yet, but I'm building up the courage to do so. I'm a bit intimidated by the process, not sure why I'm sure it's a lot of fun. Way to go Poor Little Rich Girl! \"Now lets go shopping\" ; )
