Will come here only if I have to, like tonight for EVE6 concert- I just read someone else's review for ovations- she said the mic's were bad.....I don't know when that was, but they still are. In general, any employee I had interaction with: they are less than helpful- if I elaborate this review will take me an hour. I don't like the idea of all these casinos everywhere except Las Vegas or Atlantic City. They aren't regulated like LV or AC and I'd never come to gamble here. Lucky I was on the guest list for the show- tickets are ridiculously high priced, I guess to make up for the comps. YAY EVE6\/BOO TO THE VENUE.
