I like the idea of gourmet pizza to go I think it's great because I love pizza. Walking into Red Brick Pizza I noticed they had tv's at almost every table and a few selection of beers so far so good. I already had a good impression of the place and was excited to place my order. I got a margherita pizza, a drink, a scoop on pistachio gelato, and an order of breadsticks for my friend. It didn't take long to get my pizza but they forgot the breadsticks and the guy making them asked if I wanted just oil on them? Uh no. Cheese please!  Who want's just oil on their breadsticks? Weird. I finished my gelato in the car on the way to work and it was pretty tasty but I don't think  you can mess up gelato. I was looking forward to having pizza for lunch but the pizza I got lacked flavor. Thank god I asked for a side of ranch because I needed that to eat the rest of  the pizza. I am not a picky eater by any means but  the pizza here sucks. A Totino's pizza would of tasted better then what I got from this place. The atmosphere is cool but the food is not.
