Horrible experience. I love my furniture but the nighmare it has been to get it and I still don't have it all was not worth it. I paid over $5000 for furniture and 3 pieces came very damaged. Then I was on hold for over 40 minutes for customer service. Then they couldn't even get me the pieces until next week and it is their fault not mine. The guys that delivered the furniture were very patient and helpful but the customer service is a nighmare. In the store they were polite and helpful for the sale but then they refuse to do anything and say you have to contact the customer service number which never answers. Three pieces of damaged furniture is not acceptable.
