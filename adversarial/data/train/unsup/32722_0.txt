this is an odd place you order breakfast at the counter and I have to say the service here is horrible there's like no one Smiles   every   one is very very dry people you know and as I was sitting waiting for my food gentleman walks in and he goes to the counter and I think it was the owner or an employee not sure was feeling bags and she looks turns around looks at him and turns right back around and then he  asked for help and then she said will be a few a minute very bad service  now for the waffle the flavor was pretty good but the texture of it was soft like a pancake not crispy   so was kind of a turnoff that way now the toppings on it  wonderful especially the the candy peanuts or some kind of nut not sure overall probably want to go back  I wish they would have better service least smile at you not what do you want and then walk away and the waffle was cook more
