I remember going to a park in elementary school on a field trip and thinking it was the bomb because it had a turtle and a whale that shot water.  Growing up with Vegas summers you learn to appreciate little watery oasises.  (Oases?  Oasi?)  I couldn't remember the name of the park or where it was and I mourned that I'd never find it.\n\nThen one day some friends invited me to Bob Baskin.   There they were.\n\nI was 7 again, pushing the button and playing in the spray.  It was probably kind of disturbing.\n\nAnyway, the park is nice for a Vegas park.  Lots of grassy areas, mature trees, tennis courts and creepy bathrooms.  And a turtle and a while that shoot water.  That just wins.
