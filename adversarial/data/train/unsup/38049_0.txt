This is by far the worst Burger King I've ever encountered! I went to the drive thru and ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon. As I was driving off I stopped to check it (to make sure everything was correct) and the bottom bun was extremely hard. I took it back into the store to get it switched out. As I get back into my car, I check it once again only to find that this time there's one tiny piece of bacon and not even two patties, but rather a patty and a half. Rather than wasting anymore of my time on such a disgraceful establishment, I tossed out the burger and just went across the street to Carl's Jr. Suffice to say I'll never be coming back to this place.
