Went in to have changes made to truck. Sean was my salesperson. He was very knowledgeable, friendly and patient ( a girl in a automotive store takes a little more research over buying a pair of shoes ). I dropped off my truck the day before and Sean had a car rental waiting $23.00 for the 1 day. Service was fast and efficient . Love my new wheels!! Would definitely recommend to people and would certainly go back to them again.
