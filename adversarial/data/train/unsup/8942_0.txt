Having already found our favorite authentic Italian restaurant in Huntersville, we decided to explore outside our norm and try Mama's Pizza Express. \n\nI get what \"express\" signifies, but this place is VERY small with zero accommodations! No bathrooms, no inside tables, and no bread with your ENTREES unless you pay extra. Almost every Italian place I've been to includes a soup or salad with your entree and definitely bread! Not at Mama's Pizza Express. \n\nThe prices seem fair except of course if you're a police officer in which case the owner will completely fall head over heels for you and nearly give you the meal for FREE! It was a little disturbing watching the strange, obsessive interaction between the owner and two cops that were ordering out. \n\nWe had to send our garlic rolls back because they were completely cold in the middle and at no time did anyone including the owner who was extremely occupied with the cops ask us how our meal was which I rate as subpar and most likely frozen. I would say this is solely a pizza joint, which we doubt we'll return to try. \n\nI think you should definitely give the same level of service and attention to ALL customers especially those who pay FULL price. I'm from Chicago and the Mafia image that the owner attempts to portray is unattractive and unacceptable. Customers don't wanna hear about who got \"pinched\" or who got \"wacked\" REAL Mafia don't talk like that.
