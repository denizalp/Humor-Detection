I went here for a new set of tires, and they tried convincing me to pay for repairs that weren't needed.  They waited until after putting on new tires to tell me that my tie rods were ceased-up, and they needed to be replaced for an alignment.  They wanted to start cutting off the tie rods immediately.  FYI, you can determine the condition of tie rods before ever taking off a tire.  This approach bordered on scare tactics to convince me to replace all of my tie rods (over $500).  I took my car to a reliable mechanic, who said my tie rods were not ceased-up.  He cleaned my tie rods, put anti-lock on them, and gave me an alignment for significantly less than what Big O quoted.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place for anything other than a good deal on tires.
