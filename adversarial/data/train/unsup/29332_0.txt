The place was packed and we actually almost left because it was so busy but ended up finding a table in the bar. The waitress was busy but at least came by and said she would be right back with us. She came back within 5 minutes and thanked us for our patience and thanked us for coming in! Her name was cameo! She took our order and while it took a little extra time, she was very attentive to our needs and had a smile on her face. Our food was great and the service from Cameo was exceptional!  5 stars because of the service!
