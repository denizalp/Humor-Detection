Guys I won't sugarcoat my experiences here. They have been varied and generally awful. For starters, the amount of time you will spend here depends on what you need to do. If it's related to license plates (AKA: tags) you're gonna have a decent time. There's a separate line for that and it moves quickly. I've never had to wait in it longer than 15 minutes.\n\nIf you're coming to do anything dealing with a title or paperwork: bring a book, you'll be here a while. I once stood in this line for 2.5 hours. The shortest time I've spent in it was 1 hour. Twice the DMV has turned me away because there was an issue with the electronic release of my title. (Not their fault; CarMax's.) One of those times was after the 2.5 hour wait. It seems like they have a systems failure too often. For it being a government organization, they really need to get it together. I have almost the same sympathies for the DMV as I do for the Post Office. At least for the Post Office privatization is perhaps a future possibility.\n\nThere are some things that could be done to fix the DMV. To start with would be a boost to employee morale and sense of purpose. I've never had a positive experience with employees here. I get to the counter and put on my best smile and my natural positive attitude but they are just never happy to see me. They seem to pick and choose who they're nice to... Perhaps a positive mood from the employees and better ability to communicate could seriously improve on the experience here. But hey, at least they sell coffee now!...
