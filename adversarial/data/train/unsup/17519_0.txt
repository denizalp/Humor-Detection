A place for disappointment. Tried so hard to like this place. Staff clearly instructed to ask if they can do anything to make your stay better, but ultimately unable to do anything to make your stay better. It would be funny if it were not so sad. Many chances, each one wasted.\n\nIn my room: \n* Disgusting food-stained glass with human hair, placed in the \"clean\" position on a coaster in the bathroom (photo included).\n* Potato chips on floor next to bed (photo included), that I told front desk about, even showed a photo of -- but the potato chips are still there now, 3 DAYS LATER. I would tell them again, but have completely given up on \"service\" here.\n* Brown stains on inside bowl sides of toilet on my initial arrival, no prizes for guessing.\n\nFront desk lady was incredibly courteous and offered me free breakfast for my poor experience, despite me telling her this would most likely be useless to me since I had to work early each morning. She was so very kind and professional, but again, a \"solution\" of zero value to me, even after I told her so.\n \nAnd the piece de resistance: an unexpected request for $400 in billing on something that I had asked THREE separate staff about with NONE of them mentioning such a charge. The short story of this follows, but it's not even worth mentioning. You don't need to read it to know to stay away.\n\nCalled weeks before arriving for a 4 night stay, asked if there was a room I could use to practice dance for ONE hour on ONE evening, along with a stereo or even an alarm clock for music. Was told this would be no problem, not to worry. No mention of any charge. Was even reassured I needn't have called long distance just to ask this, hotel would easily accommodate. On the day I needed the room for an hour, Maitre D' said he would take care of it. No mention of charges. I receive an email later saying I should pay $200 to use the room, and ANOTHER $200 for stereo rental. That's right: \"no problem\" had become \"no problem for $400.\"\n\nContacted the Catering Manager to decline the room\/charge. She told me I should have checked with someone other than front staff, since they did not know the cost of using hotel facilities. So... two hotel staff can tell you something is no problem, without mentioning any charges, but at the Sheraton it is still THE GUEST'S JOB to find someone ELSE to check with about something that is going to be billed at $400. Wow. Such customer service.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be back. Unless you like dirty glasses, food waste on the floor, stains from other waste in your toilet, and unexpected requests for billing, I strongly recommend you stay far, far away from here also.
