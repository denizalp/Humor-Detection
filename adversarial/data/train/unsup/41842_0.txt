Coffee was pretty strong.   The selection of pastries looked good, but overpriced.  There was good atmosphere and it as cool place to sit and just people watch.  I sat outside drinking my coffee w\/my e-reader.  Wi-fi was a bit spotty at times, but it generally worked.  Overall, nice place with rather average coffee.
