Back in 2007, I entrusted Alex Davis and 911 Keys & Sound with a valuable Peavey DPM C8 weighted 88 key MIDI controller that only needed a battery change.\n\nAfter close to six months of phone calls with a different excuse from Alex every time, and increased hostility with each exchange, I gave up in disgust and went out and bought a replacement unit. I left him a voice mail saying so, and received no reply.\n\nFIVE YEARS later, and only when they'd noticed my first negative review of 911 Keys & Sound online, I got an email from an individual named Marcy with 911 Keys & Sound saying it's ready, come pick it up. Several hundred dollars for a battery replacement, and they graciously said they wouldn't charge me a \"storage\" fee.  They also claimed they had been having trouble reaching me, even though I was still at the same address and with the same phone number as when I dropped the controller off with them.\n\nAs much as I'd love to have that wonderful unit back, I honestly don't feel that returning to Mr. Davis's place of business would be safe for me.  To say that his emails to me have been vitriolic would be an understatement.  The most recent one from Mr. Davis arrived within the last week.\n\nAt this point, the only action that can resolve this issue would be for anybody with 911 Keys & Sound other than Alex Davis to return the unit to my home at no charge.  Until then, I'm going to continue posting this to every relevant online music forum I can find, for Las Vegas and nationwide.\n\nI have never been treated so badly by a business in my life.
