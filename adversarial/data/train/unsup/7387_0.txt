Come on...who doesn't LOVE Mcdonalds, especially when it's open 24\/7? I love the school spirited interior decorations and the bathrooms are so fancy. \nMy only question is why do the fries taste so bad at this Mcdonalds? Out of all the Mcdonalds I've been to, something is wrong with the fries here. They're dry and kind of flavorless. Also how on Earth do you run out of soft serve??? I wanted to order ice cream and was told they ran out...how does that even happen? It's Mcdonalds...you never should run out of anything- it's like a huge endless fridge of food back there.
