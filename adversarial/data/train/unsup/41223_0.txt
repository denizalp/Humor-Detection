20 years I waited for this slop. Everything was lukewarm at best. Desserts that were supposed to be cold were warm. My 17 dollar cocktail gave me a good buzz for 5 minutes so 1 star for that. 2nd star is for service. Remember people...its a buffet. Lower your expectations or you will be slapped in the face by disappointment like myself.
