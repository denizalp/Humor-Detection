First off the communication with Jordan was \"A-1\".  Customer service is definitely his forte!  Preston was our tech who arrived as scheduled.  Very professional, thorough and ethical.  He couldn't identify the cause for our breaker burning out from our washing machine.  Even though he spent some time looking for a cause he said, \"no charge, seems wrong to charge for something when I wasn't able to find the reason for the original issue\".  Amazing in this day and age!   We won't hesitate to contact Dodge Electric again in the future.  \nBy the way....Preston whatever you did & maybe it was that screw that you tightened at the outlet....we've been able to run our washing machine without a glitch!
