When I was a kid, it was always a bonus when we got ice cream and it turned out to be soft serve.  It was my favorite!  I still love soft serve ice cream.  I have driven by Mr. K's and never had any inclination to stop.  I thought this is a Charlotte institution, I need to go get an ice cream.  I dropped in and got a small chocolate\/vanilla swirl cone. I sat outside the stoop of Leather & Lace, I could hear their music blaring.  I was imagining the haggard ladies working during the day and the beer gut men drooling.  South Blvd isn't just for breakfast anymore.
