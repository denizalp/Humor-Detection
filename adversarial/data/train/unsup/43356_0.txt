I'll start by saying I was totally impressed by the food and the service.  We were a party of 4 we all had something different but it was all delish.  We had the quac, the quesadilla,  a couple of different salads, a shrimp plate and even dessert.  The food and service r great but the prices r, I would say, I guess in line with Vegas expensive but oh well..it was a satisfying splurge.  Would highly recommend..enjoy!
