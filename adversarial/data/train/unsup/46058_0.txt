We decided to try it out for the first time yesterday 06-01-11. Prices were reasonable. \n\nI tried the chili verde burrito, and it was delicious. My co-worker tried a carnitas chimichanga and he loved it. I was really surprised, I been looking for a authentic joint around town and I finally found one down the street.
