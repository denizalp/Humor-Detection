My friend bought tickets and we were definitely looking forward to the show and were not disappointed. We didn't really know to much about the show so, when we got there I went to one of the casino's cashier to get singles because I though you had throw dollar bills at them lol. I asked for $100 singles and the cashier immediately asked if we were going to the Chippendale show and we said yes. She said it's not type of show and for us to save our money, a bit embarrassing but whatever. \nThe show itself was awesome, we loved it and it was done very tastefully. The drinks were great as well. I would definitely go again.
