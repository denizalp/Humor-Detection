Wow.  What a hair treatment, or rather scalp treatment!  This experience was educational, relaxing, fascinating and very reasonably priced.  \n\nThe place itself is tastefully designed so my first impression was immediately a good one.  I found the technology used for the scalp analysis incredibly interesting and informative.  I consider myself to have healthy hair but my before and after shots made me see how dirty my scalp was, and where the clogging and potential problem areas were forming.  The after shots showed a dramatic difference in the 'clean up'.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to learn that there are 3 different massages during the service (1 of which is ongoing) so you feel pretty relaxed the entire time.  Of course, had I read the description of the service on their website I would've known this : )  \n\nI walked out feeling like I had the cleanest scalp in existence but didn't think my hair looked any different (not that it was suppose to or that I expected it to).  What's interesting is that I  had 2 strangers compliment the colour of my hair shortly after I walked out of Kara's so I guess the treatment gave me more than I thought!\n\nI did buy the shampoo, conditioner and scalp tonic, but felt absolutely no pressure to.  I echo the same feelings as the other reviews and would describe the staff as very friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  \n\nSince I would like to maintain my healthy hair for as long as possible, I plan on incorporating these treatments into my beauty regime seasonally.
