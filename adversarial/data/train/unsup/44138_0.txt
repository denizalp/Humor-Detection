This is the only pet store I go to.  I love that they are NOT a chain and the staff is extremely knowledgeable about everything.  I have been going here for 5 years and they always remember who I am and how my dog is doing.  The homemade treats (the pizza slice is too cute!) they outsource in make my little guy go crazy! With recent recalls too I completely trust their products.
