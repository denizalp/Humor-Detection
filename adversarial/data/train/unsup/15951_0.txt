OldSkool Bowling Alley with Uncomfortable seats \n\n   5-Stars for $1.00 late night bowling  \n   (wish they had the lights dim every night - \n   boy does fluorescent lighting hurt at 3 am)\n\n   5-Stars for $10 cosmic bowling (Sat & Sun)\n   1-Star for the awful WEAK drinks you'll get at the bar  \n   Overall Average 3.5 Stars.\n\n\nThe lanes here are kept pretty clean.  Comfy shoes, tons of balls in lower weights, small bar, small snack area, and a handful of vending machines. The staff was kind and courteous.  The patrons seemed to keep to themselves, and a lot of them were a little rough around the edges.  Oddly enough it was around 1 am and I still saw kids running all over the place in here.  I wish my parents let me stay up that late when I was seven.\n\nTo be honest at a place like GCBC you're going to end up with a hodge podge of people from all over the world, hey it's Vegas anything goes.\n\nDate Rating: 7 (great place to go after dinner or a late night - no need to dragging people back to your place)\nPick up Scale: 1  (Not Recommended) \n\nStrong Suggestion: Be the party.  Bring the party. Close your eyes and repeat after me, \"There is no place like home...\"\n\nBest Advice - come here drunk and have some water.  Plenty of Lanes to go around.  The place is gigantic.  You won't feel like you're in Las Vegas that's for sure.
