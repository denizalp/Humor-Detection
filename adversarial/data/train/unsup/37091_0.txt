my food was late.when i recieved the ice had melted in the sodas making it nasty waterdown soda.the pizza was cold and soggy.my 4 year old didn't wanna eat it because of this.the wings were soggy instead of crisp.i was told that the manager would call me back and never did.i spent a lot of money on this food that no one in my family could eat
