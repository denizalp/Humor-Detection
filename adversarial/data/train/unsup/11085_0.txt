With the closing of the legendary Montreal Bistro and the great Top O the Senator, it's been too many years since Toronto has had a serious jazz destination (note: the Rex Hotel is still obviously a staple, but what I'm talking about is a club where the musicians don't have to compete, volume-wise, with the patrons).\n\nWell ladies and gentleman, the Top O the Senator has been re-imagined and reinvented as Toronto's latest and greatest jazz venue, the JAZZ BISTRO. The renovated space now features music downstairs but two-level seating, so you can also sit upstairs and view the music directly or watch the action on two large monitors. The new design is absolutely gorgeous, from the beautiful bar to the opulent chandeliers to the uniquely stunning red piano. Think: sexy, jazzy, cool.\n\nToronto: this is our Birdland, our Blue Note, our very best showcase for Canadian (and international) jazz talent, thanks to the bistro's veteran music booker (from the old Senator club) Sybil Walker.\n\nTues-Sat nights or Sun brunch, come here to see the who's-who of Canadian jazz music...and to enjoy the very best jazz you will hear anywhere across Canada, period.\n\nAs for the food, we did find it a little hit and miss (short ribs--hit! arctic char--miss; creme brulee--hit!)...but will be happy to try more of their menu items.\n\nEither way, I for one am ECSTATIC with the look, feel, acoustics and talent line-up of the Jazz Bistro and will certainly become a regular in the months and years ahead. You should too. Let's all bring friends, order lots of food\/drinks, and keep our local jazz venues in business!!!
