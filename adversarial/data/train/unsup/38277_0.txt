Nice staff. We received a lot of packages at the office during our stay of 3 weeks.  Not a lot of trees or anything but concrete.  Spaces pretty darn close together.  Ok pool area with small hot tub.  Public bathrooms and showers clean. Ditto the laundry room.  Wifi was really hit or miss...and that's with a booster!  Pretty basic place...the Motel 6 of RV Parks.  No real complaints, but absolutely to rave about either. Ho--hum!
