This place is a joke. When I went for my initial consultation I met with a \"nurse\" who went over a pamphlet with me, told me how much more she knew than the owner, who was a jerk, according to the nurse. Then she said that although the plan says to eat ONLY these items, she said I could add other things like cottage cheese and Melba toast. I should've heeded the red flags that were flying around in my head, but signed up for a full program. The next time I went in, first weigh in, not much success.  No sign of the nurse from last week, although she assured me I'd ONLY be seeing her. Got my shot, went home, followed the plan (the enhanced by the \"nurse\" plan). Went back next week. Another new person, who counseled me that I was \"doing it all wrong.\"  She gave me HER personal tweaks.  Yes, I was exercising. Nope, not cheating. So by the 3rd week, I saw yet another new person, who made further disparaging remarks about the owner, how it's all a sham, how her paychecks were always bouncing. Enough was enough. This place wasn't helping me, but stressing me out!  I don't care about the internal BS at your place of employment. Keep it to yourself. \n\nPS- As we all know, and now I'm successfully practicing:  a healthy diet is only going to take you so far without exercise. Down 44 pounds, 25 to go!
