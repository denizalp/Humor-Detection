This place almost makes me feel like cooking.\n\nThe woman at the counter is truly insufferable,  everyone at work knows her. (tattoos, jewelry and makeup mixed with arrogance and unkind customer service) \n\nThe food itself is not that bad, maybe $1 more per plate than Adonis,  but definitely better.\n\nJust know you can change the stock leafy salad for other options, like bean salad.\n\nThis place is super busy at lunch and they don't accept credit cards. They deliver in this sector as well, but it can then get pretty pricey.
