There's not a gym in the world that could ever make me want to give them a 5-star rating, I do not heart working out enough for that to happen, no matter how spectacular the facility.\n\nMoving right along, despite all of the negative comments regarding LVAC being overcrowded, I felt compelled to apply my input on the Eastern location.  \n\nLVAC offers top of the line equipment, massive amounts of space, along with unique and  interesting options for meeting your fitness needs. From classes at ungodly hours of the morning, to a 24-hour Olympic sized lap pool complete with sauna and steam rooms; LVAC is a fantastic place to reclaim your fitness.\n\nAs we discuss the topic of overcrowding, I would like to invite anyone who has never lived in Southern California, Los Angeles to be more specific, to add this experience to their list at some point.  LVAC will seem like a deserted island compared to trying to live a wait-free existence in L.A., just sayin.\n\nDespite the masses of people, and filled parking lots,  in over 4 years (on and off) with an LVAC membership I have yet to never find a parking space nor experience not being able to use the equipment I need due to overcrowding. Perhaps timing is everything, but either way, as annoying as working out can be,  I feel LVAC makes the chore as pleasurable and inviting as possible.
