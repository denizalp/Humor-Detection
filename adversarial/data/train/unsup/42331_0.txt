I dont expect much out of pizza places. Amongst the three on front street Domino's is hands down the best. Their menu is extensive and the alfredo sauce options make life worth living. \n\nToday after six months of no pizza diet I decided to cheat and order a pizza. Sadly it was really dry and not as I expected. I took it back and the employees were super nice about it and made me a new one. I didn't walk in expecting this...thought I'd have to fight for pizza but hey here I am waiting for a fresh new one  \n\nAll the pizza win.
