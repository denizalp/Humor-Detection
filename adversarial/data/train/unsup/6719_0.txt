\"Men's section always get shafted.\"\n\nInteresting comment by a couple young Men in their 20s as they walk within this Mens corner crawlspace.  Think of McDonald's and their corner Playground, it's the same situation here I believe as the Men get left there while the Women invade the other 90%(Womens) of the shop.\n\nThe shop does have that 21 year-old Flashy\/Cool appeal that H&M or GAP is missing.  The clothes aren't half bad, some are quite comfortable actually while giving you that Fashion sense that says you're old enough not to shop at GAP anymore with your Parents credit card.  Perfect for the 12+ year-olds growing out of the Jonas Brothers or Hannah Montana phase.\n\nI didn't even bother lining up at the Dressing Room with the Ladies.  Stood in front of one of the many mirrors, undressed and dressed, in and out.  I can't even imagine how it would be during Sales season.  Even without sales, it seemed to be as affordable priced as any GAP, Old Navy, H&M if you consider the styles they have here.\n\nCheapness has no age limit.  FYI, I'm not 21 anymore.  :P
