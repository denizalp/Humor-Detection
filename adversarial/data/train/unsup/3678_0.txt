Disappointed after visiting Joey. \n\nHe seemed unsure on how to cut curly hair,  and the result was a massive disappointment. He cut actress the curls and I am left with a limp and significantly lopsided mess.  When I expressed my dissatisfaction and requested if a more senior\/experienced stylist was available to fix I was told nothing was available until the new year. Also no apologies were given.  Note: this was late November. \n\nI will not return,  and am sad I wasted $100
