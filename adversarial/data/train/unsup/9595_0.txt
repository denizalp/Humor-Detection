I love Dr. Featherstone's office....well as much as I can love going to the dentist. I'm a dentist-phobic....one that has tummy pains and anxiety before and during the dental visit. I was recommended to Dr. Fountain who used to work with Dr. Featherstone and what better way to find a good dentist than by word of mouth?! When I first walked in the receptionist told me that I looked really cute....way to butter me up before having my mouth wide open. My Dental Hygentist is Christine. SHE is definitely the BEST! She remembered me from 6 months ago and she remembered stories that I told her about my life. I'm not sure how she could remember that, but that is definitely what I call one on one care. She will always be taking care of my teeth unless she's on vacation or sick. I think its a bit relieving to go back to someone who's seen me at my worst. I now have Dr. Featherstone whom I met today for the first time. He mentioned something about me wearing braces before and that whatever my braces left behind were cute (not sure what that means since I don't speak dental lingo). Cute again?! Sure I will take that...and he also noticed that my back molars weren't very worn down. He said obviously I'm a HAPPY person...since I don't grind my teeth down. Obviously, I still have panic attacks about going to the dentist, but this office sure makes it a lot less stressing.  BTW, you always get a goody bag filled with toothpaste, toothbrush, floss and chapstick and I actually was special enough to get a flosser today! I definitely will be returning here in 3 months....
