As you all know from my other reviews, my little pug princess is very important to me (she's even on my profile photo here!) and is considered a member of my family.  Naturally, I want the very best for her and I cannot say enough good things about TVEH.  \n\nI highly *highly* recommend TVEH.  My pug, LadyBug, had an unfortunate incident this past weekend, where she needed emergency surgery by a neurologist.  Needless to say, I was one stressed out doggy mom.  \n\nDr. Huska (the neurologist), the ER doctors (Dr. Donahoe, Dr. Cotter, and Dr. Fournier), and the RVTs and staff at TVEH were extremely professional and courteous and made me feel so much more at ease.  Dr. Huska is so good at what he does and he is a very understanding and kind individual.  I was so at ease that my LadyBug was in such good hands.  Dr. Porter, an orthopedic surgeon, has also treated one of my other pugs in the past and he is absolutely fantastic as well.  Finally, there's Dr. Edwards there who's absolutely fantastic with LadyBug and she does rehabilitation services - a really important form of therapy to ensure smooth and fast post-operative recovery.  \n\nALL the doctors & staff there are wonderful and while I hope that nothing scary ever happens to my pugs ever again, I would have no hesitations coming back if something ever did happen.  \n\n*Note that this is a referral & emergency hospital - so everything they do here is either after-hours or very specialized procedures (ie: orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, etc.).*
