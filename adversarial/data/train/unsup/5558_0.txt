In love with the Roasted Beet salad & Grill Charred Octopus that I had to start there again.  Douglas was our bartender who knows that I love spicy & had me try a few of his spicy specialities.  It is soo fun when a bartender trust your opinion on specialty drinks.  \n\nCeleste is the very best ever!  I always sit at the bar and after being here since day one with her I'm not just bias.  She knows her stuff in every way from knowledge of the menu to all kinds of high end bar etiquette, she is unreal.\n\nJavier the GM is the absolute best GM in the city.  He stops by to see if everyone is well, so personable, food genius, remembers details about your life... I love him!  He said as of August 28th they started brunch!  Ahh, soo exciting!  \n\nI have been eating at GVR for a decade and there's a very limited selection of breakfast lol unless you go to Grand Cafe or the District.  Finally something classy for a brunch.  I can't wait to check it out! \n \nI shared the Veal Parmigiana w\/ spaghetti & sauce, which was a very large portion split and still took home leftovers!  It was excellent.  Always the same excellent food & service.\n\nTonight, I wanted to ease mom and dad into Grilled Octopus cause it's melt in your mouth and not chewy as dad had had elsewhere before.  We started with a bottle of Santa Margarita Pinot Grigio, which is $22 a glass on the strip.  The bottle is $55 at Bottiglia!  Plus on Thursdays it's 50% off bottles under $100!  Whoa!  I also introduced them to my favorite beet salad which all they fell in love with.  I cannot wait to bring them in the beautiful sunlight and cooler temps so they can see the Hamptons type of style they have in decor and make hem regulars.  Hehe!  Blown away every time I dine w\/ Javier, Celeste, Douglas and Chef Patrick and his wife, actually the whole staff at Bottiglia.  I can compare them to the finest restaurants on the strip.  Excellent and consistent.
