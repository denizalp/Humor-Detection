This place is horrible. I had a pedi and a full set. The nails have grown out and lifted to the point that I had to go to another salon to have them fixed 6 days later. The suite is dilapidated and they don't offer any creature comforts... not even a towel to rest your feet on for the pedicure, just the hard plastic. Never again.
