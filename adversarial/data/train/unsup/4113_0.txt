Like every other middle of the road In-N-Out burger joint I've ever been to--this one was full of all the same things: way too long of a wait, a simple and perfectly satisfactory burger, and some of the nicest dang kids running the place.\n\nI was sent on an errand from someone else, which I don't mind. Sure, I'll pick you up a burger. What I didn't love, was the huge wait. I opted not to get in the drive-thru with 15+ cars ahead of me, and instead went in. I got my order in okay, but still sat there for the better part of a half hour to wait for two burgers and a shake.\n\nPrice isn't bad, but there are at least a dozen other places I'd go before In-N-Out that are more interesting. But hey brah, if it reminds you of your childhood, then go right ahead.
