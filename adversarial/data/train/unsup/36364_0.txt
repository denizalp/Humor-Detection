This is my third time at topgolf . During the cooler evenings in az they have heat lamps at every golf bay . Evenings are very busy so have patience . We have tried the food and it's been very good . Crowd is both after work groups and family's . They seem to control the idiot factor ( over serving , club throwing ) as much as possible . We will be back . Weekday mornings and afternoons are the perfect time for a less hectic visit .
