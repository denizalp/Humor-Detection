Went on a Sunday at 7p.m. most of the food was cold and old. Even though they close at 9:30 p.m. \nThe only fresh and hot item was the soup on wich I give them 1 Star. When I brought it to the waitress attention, she told her Supervisor. I was yelled at,  totally uncalled for, that is no way of treating a customer. $12.99 for the worst dinner ever!!\nNever coming back nor recommending this place.
