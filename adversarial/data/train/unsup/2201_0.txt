ROBBED IN 5-10 MINS BY THE CASINO EMPLOYEES WHILE CHECKING IN! \n\n\n\nSunday May 6th we checked in, bought the deal from GROUPON (I will be calling to update them as well, the Groupon needs to be TAKEN DOWN!) \n\nWe decided we were more interested in relaxing instead of walking the strip. Bad idea. \n\n\nWe arrived at about 4:15 p.m., babe went inside to check in while I was cleaning up the rental so we could relax and drive to the airport without having to make another stop. We already gassed the rental up as well, what a waste and bad idea. So I'm getting out of the car to dispose of the extra cups, napkins, trash or whatever. I'm dressed casual but to a thief, I'm dressed like the right kind of person to prey on.\n\n\nI'm cleaning out the car for maybe 10 mins and then nature calls, so I reach in, turn the car off, close the door and run inside. (I didn't realize that when I cleaned my purse out I didn't put the key back into my purse, had to be in the papers I was still sitting through, keyless entry is amazing usually but I failed myself there) \n\n\nSo by this time it's 4:20\/4:30 ish. Lots of people in the sitting area at the front, Bell-hopper (I think he knows who did this or he DID IT! Keep reading) security and other vehicles. We were the 3rd or 4th car back. This place isn't on the strip so there a large parking lot that surrounds the place, no one is walking up to the front basically. Way too far to do so. \n\n\nSo that only leaves the people who are working at the front or visiting the front. Since we're the 3rd or 4th car back, only the bell hopper who's station is on the right side would have been able to see me and KNOW what was going on. \n\n\nI go inside to use the Restroom, on the way back my husband says there's an issue with the Groupon reservation, they can't find it. The attendant says \"it's usually like this with all Groupon reservations, it takes a while, oh look there it goes !\" (Red flag, during this time our vehicle was stolen with EVERYTHING inside)\n\n\nWe walk out the doors, NO ONE IS THERE AT ALL. Not the security, not the bell hopper, not the guest in the sitting area, none of the cars. At 4:30 p.m. on a Sunday in Las Vegas, you know how insanely random this is. \n\n\nCar is gone, I say maybe they took it to valet (they took it, I'm just not sure where on the property it is. I bet it's still there honestly) so we talk with valet, they don't have it, We alert security, he stalls for 30 mins while trying to \"confirm our identity\" \n\nAfter he answers no question and neither does the head of security. I'll add their names once I find them. These people are shady and I'm not sure who's innocent and who's in on it ! \n\n\nThey don't answer these simple questions I kept asking, this is major red flags to me:\n\nWhen did this person get into the car?\nWhich exit did he or she leave the property from ? \nWhat is a description of what he or she looks like ?\n\nNO ANSWERS EVEN AFTER THE POLICE CAME. They didn't let us see the surveillance footage either, how odd. \n\n\nPolice officer is B. Neuhauser (she was nice, but she also was very casually chatting with the people from the hotel as if they personally know each other, not comforting for me to trust her) she is with the Convention Center Area Command. Hoping she's not in on this but this whole story is just way too coincidentally perfect. We were targeted. \n\n\nShe takes down the info, during this time I realize my work laptop and camera for my store was stolen, I breakdown. During this time she and the officers are casually laughing and chatting after I come back and my husband is comforting me. Clearly they didn't care to be sensitive, but bigger than that this is a casual day at Tuscany Suites and Casino. \n\n\nThe only things repeatedly said by the security was \"you should never leave your keys in the car, you probably won't get your stuff back, and this happens often everywhere else on the strip\"\n\nBull. MGM we had the windows down car running and no problems. The Venetian, and the Bellagio the same. Basically we were on vacation and had already saw that this is okay for check in, you park after but go figure it out for now. NOT THIS HOTEL! They all mysteriously disappear and get into your parked car to steal it. That's not something I would casually dismiss if I worked at this place, no consoling just \"you shouldn't have done that\" \n\n\nNow we've called the Risk Manager Cordeth Consing who has yet to return our calls. \n\nI've left a VM for the detective, haven't spoken to him so I will keep him off of here for now. But everyone has been very casual about this ordeal. \n\n\n\nWe WERE ROBBED OF EVERYTHING FROM SIMPLY STOPPING TO CHECK INTO THIS HOTEL DO NOT STAY HERE ! There's tons of reviews that say the same thing, but unfortunately you won't see them: FILTER STOLEN IN THE SEARCH BOX! Save yourself a major MAJOR HEADACHE !
