Has anyone ever written a bad review about this place? Can I just say ... Amazing. I was a little skeptical due to being a die-hard carnivore but wow. This is the first time I've ever had cashew cheese and it was delicious. The manicotti was phenomenal, especially with the tomato-basil marinara. I also got to taste my sister's pad Thai which was just as good. We will definitely be back. It's amazing how good healthy, raw food can taste. I'm about to order the lemon berry cheesecake and I'm so excited to see how they pull off vegan cheesecake!
