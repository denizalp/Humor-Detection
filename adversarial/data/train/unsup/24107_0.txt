If I could give no stars, I would.\n\nBunch of friggin' crooks and they are OUTRAGEOUSLY priced for tomatoes and other veggies. \n\nThey used to be cheap, but now I recommend everyone go to PA Supermarche just a few blocks west, nearer to Atwater \n\nTheir produce is going downhill, especially the fruit and vegetables. \n\nMost of all, they are unethical -- telling me that I don't know the laws of the province like with price matching policies (politique d'exactitude des prix or price scanning) and their cashiers are rude.\n\nHATE THEM.
