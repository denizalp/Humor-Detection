Not much of a fan of buffets except if it's at a casino.  \n\nRed Wok Buffet works only if you're glutton.  Yes, just keep stuffing your face.  I didn't think the food was good obviously.  The only thing I thought was decent was the Teriyaki chicken; nicely glazed with the sauce while fried with crispy edges.  Just the way I like it!  Everything else was bland.  This is what I consider \"stay alive\" food.  If I needed to survive I'll come eat this stuff, but overall not my favorite buffet place.  \n\nThe place itself is pretty similar to most Asian buffet restaurants.  Very basic Asian decors to make sure you know you're in an Asian restaurant buffet.  One highlight I guess would be the service was decent. - Enjoy!
