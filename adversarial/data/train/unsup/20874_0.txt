Better than average for mall court food.  My daughter had the chicken teriyaki with noodles and veggies and it was great.  I had the teriyaki beef with white rice and it came with mushrooms and veggies.  It was OK but the meat was super thin and reminded me of processed meat and wasn't near as good as the chicken.  The rice needed more sauce so I had to go back and ask for extra sauce and it was much better.  I did get annoyed because when they initially served my food the guy preparing it said \"sauce\" ( which my daughter had to interpret for me after he repeated it 3 times since  I could not understand what the heck he said).  It would be nice if he could learn enough English to say.  \"Would you like sauce?\" in the form of a complete sentence.  I recommend trying the chicken and skip the beef.  Just saying..................................
