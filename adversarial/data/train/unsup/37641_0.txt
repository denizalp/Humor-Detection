I tried their matcha crepe cakes for the first time and it definitely exceeded expectations!\n\nThis location is closer to King and Spadina and may be a bit hard to find since it is on a small road. They only have about four tables, however, the location wasn't too busy so I was able to secure a table no problem.\n\nI order their matcha crepe cake ($7.74) and it was so good! It is a bit pricey, however, it is a labour intensive process to make the cake. The cake had a thin layer of matcha on top so the bitterness of the matcha really help balance the sweetness. \n\nThey also offer tarts, gelatos and cream puffs so I'll have to come back and give these a try!
