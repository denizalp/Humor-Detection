Writing a review about XS is, for me, a lot like being asked to write a review about life itself.  How deep do you want to go on this?\n\nI remember it like it was yesterday, the first time I went to XS.  I remember because it was probably the greatest day of my life, and I would never be the same again.\n\nXS is like Chicken Soup for the Soul.  If it's been more than a few days since you were last there, you are inevitably going through some rough times in your life.  You're probably freaking out on people, ultra stressed and you just don't know why you look like hell all the time...  \n\nBut the moment you walk in, you're literally bathed in a holy light that cures you of all ailments and forgives you for your sins.  \n\nIf you are not already extremely hammered, that was probably a bad decision on your part for not pre-gaming, but there are plenty of $14-17 drinks available.\n\nGranted, some nights there are literally a sea of asian people there, but it's all fine by me.  If you look at the reviews on here you'll see that it's about 94% asian reviewers, but that's not necessarily representative of the club, it's more like 82% asian.  Nah just kidding, it used to be worse but these days it's a pretty well-rounded crowd.\n\nBottom line, what other club have you been to that cost $100 million to make?  Definitely not the lame ass club in your hometown. Go to XS.
