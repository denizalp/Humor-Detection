This restaurant serves a killer pho ap chao - it makes my taste buds dance in ecstasy, it is so good.  This place is tucked away in the recessed end segment of a long strip mall on Apache Blvd, so it's easy to miss if you're not looking out for it. Service is fast, and the food is relatively inexpensive - prices are just a tad over those of most Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley. Their pho is OK, though I find the flavor to be somewhat one-dimensional, without the herbal complexity of the pho in, say, Pho Thanh or Pho Avina. And I find the pho to be a bit on the salty side. A squeeze from the lime wedge served on the side helps cut the saltiness, while the fresh herbs served alongside the pho help to give the flavor a needed boost.
