Came here on a Friday night to have dinner with a friend. We were lucky and were able to get a table without waiting. It's a small restaurant, I would recommend reservations. We ordered their supreme sashimi set, mixed sashimi and sushi set, seaweed salads and miso soup. The sushi was good, not too much rice and their grilled eel was divine. I actually ordered four more because there was not enough in supreme set. My favorite part of the meal! The sashimi was fresh, plating was done well and everything tasted delicious. Their servers were warm and friendly as well. A great choice on Baldwin Street!
