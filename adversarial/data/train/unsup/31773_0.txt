Being new to the Valley I am continuing to see the beautiful places that Vegas has to offer. Attending the Vegas Loves Brazil event I had the pleasure to see the beautiful Amphitheater. The facility was incredible and I look forward to seeing whatever events they put on here. \n\nThe joy of outdoor open air events while sitting on the grass is my favorite type of events.
