Great hot pockets and beer!  I don't know what pasties are but the best way to describe them is gourmet hot pockets or calzone.  The menu offers many different kinds of pasties - steak, pork, lamb, Italian, meatball, Mexican, veggies, etc for about $10.  They also have soups, salads and sides.  This place was already busy around 5pm on a weeknight.  The place was big on the inside and very dark.  Service was friendly and fast.  There's happy hour daily between 3p-6p where you can save $1 off draft beer, wine and liquor.\n\nFour Peaks - $6 for 20oz local beer.  Light and refreshing.\nVindaloo Lamb $11 - Tasty and slightly spicy.\nOggie $9.25 - Delicious steaks and potatoes! I like the side of gravy that came with it.\n\nEasy parking in the strip mall parking lot.\n\n....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      \n...\/  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    \n..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .
