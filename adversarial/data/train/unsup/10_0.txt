Got food poison after dining here on Feb 14. Toronto Health gave them a conditional pass on Feb 13. which the sign was not posted with that condition at the time! My SO and I both got sick and missed several days of work. I will never return to this place!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/health\/dinesafe\/index.htm?show=detail&id=140464
