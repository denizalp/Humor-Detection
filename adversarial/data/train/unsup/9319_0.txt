I am not sure how long this Chick- fil-A has been at this location. But, I just discovered it in July 2017. In my opinion it is a great find.\nI really like the fact that if I am shopping, getting a Massage, or doing anything else in the area I can just pop in here and I know it will be great!\nMcDonald's is right next door if you are finding a hard time finding it in the shopping center.\nHowever, I would choose Chick-Fil-a any day over McDonald's.\nThe food is always cooked fresh here. So it is nice and hot and fresh. I have been here about 8 times now, and it has been good each time. We always get it to go because, it is always one of those days that I have 20 things to do.\nThey always ask you if you want any sauce and read your order back to you. Which is great because, I do not like pickles. So they come with the chicken Sandwich, they read it back and then I know if they got it right or not.\nI always place my order and then go to the rest room to wash my hands. Then when I come out, it is pretty much ready. It is a great setup.\n\nThey have a nice Play gym for children inside. We know in the Summer here in Phoenix, it is far too hot to be seated outside for any reason.Yes, it is . Next week it will be 97 degrees and we will be past the point of October. you just have to be inside all the time during the day,. So it is very nice that they have that indoor playground.\nLots of parking in the lot and they do have a drive through.But, I never use it, I prefer to go inside. The ladies room is nice and clean.
