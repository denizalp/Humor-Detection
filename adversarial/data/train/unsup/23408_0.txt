Now, THIS is the store all other antique stores on the block should aspire to be. I realize they all can't have the floor space this one does, but what makes this spot easy to navigate is their layout of product. Everything is presented in such a way that you can plainly see what they're selling. Now, I know that seems like an obvious tactic to draw in shoppers, but if you've been to other locations on this block you know it looks like a monster ate one of their stores and then vomited it back up in the same spot. \n\nTheir pricing is mostly reasonable, if not slightly higher than I'd like to be paying. Oddly enough, almost every cool, larger item we found was $800. That must be the magic number here. There is some really killer stuff in here, though. I found a retractable long-neck floor lamp that I almost insisted we buy until I noticed it was $1500. Since vintage is so hot these days, I would imagine some of these things may have been cheaper a few years ago when this nostalgic wave wasn't at such a high. \n\nIn the end, we walked out with a psychedelic mushroom serving tray for $15. It's certainly worth a visit to stop in here, just be prepared for a little sticker shock.
