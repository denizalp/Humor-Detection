Came here last night (Thursday) and it was decently packed. \n\nThe place itself was pretty small and cramped - I had to squeeze between tables to get into my seat. Also, the front window was broken so they put up a plastic sheet to replace it.\n\nBut that's where the negatives end.\n\nI ordered the Sashimi and Sushi ($18) which came with miso soup (oddly no salad). The fish tasted nice and fresh (I don't know how else to describe good-tasting fish).\n\nService was attentive and they regularly refilled waters and teas.\n\nOverall, it was a nice cozy atmosphere, fresh food, good service. I'll probably be back, but I want to try other japanese a la carte places in the area (Konichiwa and Daio) first.
