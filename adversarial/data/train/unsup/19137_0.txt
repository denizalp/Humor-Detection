This is by far one of my favorite places in Vegas and a required stop for any of my trips. Here's why:\n\n$1 blackjack during off hours, like 2am to 6am or something like thta, I can;t remember exactly. \n\nCoolest video poker machine I have ever played. They only have two of this type of machine and I've never been able to find it at other casinos. \n\nYea, its a little weird, dirty and whatnot, but I'd rather sit next to a 75 year-old chain smoking former felon than an Abrocrombie-clad weenie at the palms. \n\nhaven't eaten the food yet, but I'm going again this weekend and will probably try it. \n\nBasically if they offered a sports book I would probably spend ALL of my Vegas time there.
