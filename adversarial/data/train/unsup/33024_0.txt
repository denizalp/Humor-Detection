If you enjoy Cheesecake Factory food & ambiance, this is a good one. Popular Friday night spot in a fun area of town, folks were dressed in their good-doin' clothes - maybe it was the day of the week, but it felt more upscale than most CF's. \n\nThe lemon-dill salmon was amazing & I'm sure I could eat a big bowl of their mashed pots. Cheesecake (white chocolate raspberry truffle, this time) was amazing. \n\nExceptional service at a place that generally does food & service well; overall great experience.
