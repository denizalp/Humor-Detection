Traveling is my favorite thing in my life! \nI never  experienced such a unique tourists spot in the whole world like in our city, the Welcome to Las Vegas sign! Who would actually thought that people willing to wait in line to take pictures with a \"welcome \" sign? Only in Vegas ... ha, ha, ha\nWell, in the past few years it became so popular, the county or city decided to build an actual parking lot for the safety of picture taking people! This parking lot just got expanded recently for a bigger parking lot! Thank you! That was very thoughtful!\n\nDid you notice that taking pictures of the sign is pretty easy, but if you want your face in the same picture, it just doesn't work? (talking about night time)  The lightning is very important! So  ... if the sign shows pretty ... your face staying dark ... or your face shows pretty, then the sign staying dark!\n\nTonight we had a great experience here! Some professional photographers are hanging around and offer to take the picture of us. No charges what so ever, only for donations! So we thought it would be nice to have good pictures, and let them do the magic! \nLet me tell you something! This is the best kept secret in town! They have the camera and a talent to impress anyone! They are taking  amazing pictures!\nPlus, we got the photo instantly to our IPhones!\nWOW ... no tricks, nothing, just beautiful pictures!\nAmazing! Only in Vegas ...
