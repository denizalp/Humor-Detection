Such a great little place in Legacy Village!! This was the first time I could stop in for Macaroons since they are always sold out.  The flavors are both traditional and out of the box. I was really impressed with the classic raspberry but also blown away by the strawberry basil.  The cookies are light and melt away like they should.  We'll be back!
