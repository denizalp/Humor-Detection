Trampoline gyms have really taken off over the last 5 years or so, and I can understand why.  They provide indoor fun and lots of exercise for kids (and adults) of all ages.  Who doesn't love jumping around and getting a ton of air, bouncing, playing with balls, etc...\n\nI've taken my kids to Flip Dunk a couple of times for birthday parties, and they've been once with our nanny as well...  They love it here, but as a parent, i have some concerns...\n\n1 - The staff here are not as friendly as some of the competition in the Valley.\n2 - There are not separate areas for little kids, and you can't always trust bigger kids to stay away from the littles.  I've seen plenty of colliding going on here as a result -- luckily no major harm, but lots of tears.\n3 - There are vending machines here but no cafe, so either plan around meals or bring cash for snacks or bring your own!\n\nON a positive note, there are: \n1 - plenty of other games ie: air hockey to entertain the kids.\n2 - large spacious bathrooms\n\nFlip Dunk is pretty conveniently located off of 16th St and Bethany Home.  \n\nI'm sure we'll be back, whether it be for a birthday party, a rainy day, or an activity to escape the heat in the summer.  If you're looking to kill some time, wear your kid(s) out or get some exercise yourself, this place is a moderately priced option for sure... Just use caution and watch out for crazy jumpers ;)  Enjoy!
