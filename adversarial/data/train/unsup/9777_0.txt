Short story: the guy smeared the sole rubber all over the shaft of my boots, said he didn't do it, tried to clean it up and took out some of the leather's dye instead, and didn't give me a refund (I'd already paid).  Moral the story: if you risk this dude, only pay him at the end after you check for damages.  Long story below.\n\nOh, Groupon, you've steered me wrong yet again.  I have awful luck with service at places were I've used Groupons overall...hey, you put out a Groupon to bring in customers, not to be pissed when said customers show up for their discounts! basically, I think the cobbler screwed me because he was only making $5 for $40 worth of services.\n\nI dropped off two pairs of leather riding boots to get new heels.  I had called and been given a quote of $20 a pair and was told that they still do same day service.  I'd had a bad feeling about the place after I called for the quote and the guy I talked to the didn't know what riding boots looked like...He thought they had a spiked heel...but I had that magical Groupon to use, so I went anyway.\n\nSo, I went.  After some haggling (and after seeing I had a Groupon), the cobbler told me that my soles were \"bald tires\" and he had to replace those as well.  So now we're up to $40 a pair.  I said fine because I love these boots and they were quite expensive.  I was told to come back after 2pm.\n\nThree hours later, I return.  The cobbler finishes one boot immediately and hands it to me to look at.  I'm pleased and say so.  I pay.  I'd brought my own canvas tote so I start packing up the boots as they are done one by one.  And then I see it appearing on the remaining three boots...the brownish-black rubber from the soles is fingerprinted all over boot's shaft.  Oh, hell no.  Here's the play-by-play:\n\nMe: Uhhhh, I don't think this was on the boots before.  [points to blobs]\nFront Counter Lady: I don't know, but you don't understand the process.  It's not possible for that to happen.\nCobbler: [Not even looking]  Nope, I didn't do that.  That must have been there.  Looks like hair stuff.\nMe: [WHAT] Um, I'm pretty positive it wasn't there.  [Get out my phone for the photo I took of the boots before dropping them off.]\nC: Nope, wasn't me, but let me see if I can get it off.\nFCL: [begins rant about how people are never pleased, etc.]\nMe: If you look at the shaft where it hits the sole, you can see that there are smears and splatters right there.  So, it was not like this.\nC: What do you expect for same day service?\nMe: [now fuming]  For you not to damage my boots that I'm paying you to repair.\nFLC and C: [Talking over each other. Alternatively making excuses about no one else offers same day and blaming me somehow for the shoddy work.]\n[C grabs another boot to clean off and I see that whatever he's using is making it worse by taking off the dye.]\nMe: Just please give me that back.  I already paid and I don't want you to clean them anymore.\nC: You really should buy a de-salting and waterproofing treatment if you're going to wear them in the snow.\nMe: I don't wear them in the snow.  Please just give me the boot so I can leave.\nC: Okay, baby.  Have a nice day, baby.\n\nDon't advertise \"While-U-Wait\" if you're going to gripe and do a terrible job.\n\nWhat would have made me happy, you ask?  If the cobbler had admitted maybe he had made a mistake, voided the $40 dollar charge (the other $40 was the Groupon), and offered to clean them properly for free.  I would have even agreed to run the $40 charge again AFTER he'd restored the boot shafts.  But, instead, he was a total jerk.\n\nAdditionally, the woman \"working\" the counter had no clue about prices and had random friends using up all of the chairs for customers both times I was there.  And both times, she ignored me for a good two minutes before screeching, \"You need something?\"  Rude.\n\nFYI, previously both my mom and I had repairs at Ullrich's back when the older Calabrese gent was working and they were at the old location.  The repairs were about 75% cheaper and the service was excellent.  Honestly, I think my family started going here because of the Italian owner (I'm a quarter Calabrese myself), but I won't ever go back.\n\nResults: After applying a leather cleaning solution and using a leather shoe brush\/eraser, some of the marks are up but the rest appear to be permanent.  This is after 4 hours of scrubbing.  Ugh.  Pictures are posted of the damage for your viewing pleasure.
