DIRTY, UNSAFE, LOUD \n\nI lived here for 2 years and was happy to move out. Management was very inconsistent and the property was poorly maintained. Disgusting hallways lead to nice looking units, but don't let the units fool you. My bathroom smelled of sewage at least once a month and this was never addressed despite numerous complaints. \n\nThis is not a safe area and security was awful. Guards occasionally showed up at the main gate on Flamingo and were rarely seen at the Swenson gate. So if a car wanted to follow you in and into the parking garage, they could, which I witnessed often. My locked bicycle was stolen from the garage and my storage unit was burglarized with no sign of forced entry. I requested the management company change the lock and they did, however,  I was charged $30 without consent to replace it. \n\nThe location, albeit a dangerous one, is probably the only positive thing I can say about The Las Vegas Grand if you work on the strip. But even this great location comes at a cost...You can hear EVERY airplane landing at Mccarran Airport all day and night. My suggestion would be to stay far away and save yourself a big headache or worse.
