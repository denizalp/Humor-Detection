I was hit by a woman who totaled my car, I was REALY hurt and at the age of 36 had never been in an accident. I have 7 attorneys in my family and a judge, they choose Joe Wirth and Shannon to represent me. I couldn't have been happier. They made everything very simple on my end. Shannon even talked to me and helped me find out how to use my part time disability. They are very caring and exhausted every avenue to get me healthy and back on the road in a new car! Thank you!
