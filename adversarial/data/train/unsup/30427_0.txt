My experience have been great so far me and my kids all had to go and they treated my 3 year so kind he wasn't doing so good with the number colors and another girl came and took her time with him and was a little calmer for him to try to get it done even though he still wasn't able to cause the first girl felt annoyed by him not knowing the numbers and she didn't write anything down he did get right which kinda upset me but the doctor made my day by working with him and telling me it was ok he didn't do a lot of the vision test but he past the main one with the doctor 20\/20 baby and the only reason I did give this location a 3 is because the doctors and other associates saved the day my kids was very happy
