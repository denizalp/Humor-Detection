Tea was good and the place looks nice enough.  But when I walked in the door the smell hit me...the smell of a dirty rag that has been wet and dried way too many times between proper cleaning.  Every table reeked of the rag...it was bad.  The management needs to realize that that one small thing makes the entire place unpleasant.  Putting the damp rag in the microwave for one minute will kill the bacteria causing the odour.
