Worth the drive. Took in my daughters prom dress and when I picked it up it looked perfect. Hard to imagine since it had several different types of delicate fabric and sequins. Also amazed at the care of the wrapping and packing, showing a lot of care for the original shape and form of the garment.  Yes, it was on the pricey side, but well worth it when you want to hire experienced professionals caring for your one off garment. Highly recommended, and will definitely use again.\n\nUpdate: Have since frequented Elite with all manner of items from casual to custom suits, ties, dresses, uniforms, etc - never failing to impress - consistently excellent from the quality of work, to customer service, to the care of packaging. Best cleaner in Phoenix bar none. Cannot recommend highly enough!
