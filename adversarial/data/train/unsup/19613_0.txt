The good: the soup was tasty. Very sweet and savoury and everything a good soup should be. \n\nThe atmosphere is great. Cute custom woodwork, unique stained glass, strange yet wonderful wall treatments  and all set in the midst of a glass studio and art gallery. \n\nThe meh: the sandwiches were fine. We had a egg and peameal bacon on a kaiser and a crispy chicken wrap. The kaiser turned out to be a focaccia. That was weird, but I'll take it. It was fine. \n\nThe bad: We went in for lunch at just before 2 and weren't done until almost 3:30. Seriously slow service. I was amazed at how slow, actually. \n\nThe ugly: This is where it gets gross. My wife ordered a pumpkin cheesecake. It came in a little ramekin straight from a fridge. It was obviously left uncovered because the top layer was dry and stuck to the sides and tasted of fish. That's right, the pumpkin cheesecake tasted of raw fish. \n\nWe called over the waitress and asked if they stored their desserts with their raw fish and she said \"I'm not sure, it's my second day\". \n\nWhen we told her our experience she was shocked. She said she'd have it taken off our bill. Fair enough. No harm no foul. \n\nAside from the fishy taste in our mouths. \n\nMy wife watches over my shoulder as the manager tastes our cheesecake and declares it fine. He doesn't taste anything and he won't be comping anything. The waitress is sent back to inform us that this was the decision. \n\nYou read that right. A complaint was sent into the kitchen and the manager sent the server back to tell us to kick rocks. Why not face it yourself, coward!\n\nI inform the waitress that I'd love to discuss it with that manager directly and asked he be sent over. She comes back in a moment to tell us that that manager was too busy to speak with us, but a second manager has overridden the first and comped the fishy cheesecake. She apologizes. That's great. \n\nWhat I don't know until later is that the first manager is giving us the evil eye the whole time we're waiting for the bill. What a guy. \n\nWe won't be back. Hopefully this incarnation of the Copper Kettle doesn't last long. It's too cute a spot to deserve such rude, dishonest, unprofessional and unhygienic ownership.
