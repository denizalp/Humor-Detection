*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2018 menu ***\n\nEven though Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill has been in the neighborhood for almost three years, this was my first time eating here.  I looked at the RW menu and decided this would be a good way to test the food and service.\n\nThis was a $40 RW menu.  For the three courses, I chose the Baja shrimp ceviche with tostada crisps.  The ceviche had red pepper in it and on the rim of the glass.  There were pieces of avocado on the top of the ceviche.  After eating most of the ceviche, I lifted the glass and drank the remaining juices and got some good pepper taste.\n\nThe main I chose was the black pepper pappardelle with wild boar ragu and pecorino cheese.  The runner asked if I wanted pepper or parmesan and I asked for parmesan.  He came back with a small contained with freshly shredded cheese that I added to the pappardelle.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the salted caramel pretzel tart.  \n\nThe main course was the star of the dinner.  The ceviche was good but the glass was so packed it made it a bit difficult to eat.  I know I have some tomato to make sure is removed from my shirt when I do laundry.  The pretzel tart was OK but I expected more pretzel.  There were bits of pretzel sprinkled on top of the caramel tart and alongside the piece but that was it. \n\nService was excellent.
