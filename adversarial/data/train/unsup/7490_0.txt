Holidays for restaurants are their busiest times. That being said, waiting an hour to be seated is never a surprise and not the best of times. Just make sure you have good company to make the time go fast. Appreciate the text message updates of place in line. Now, waiting with Tokyo Teas (Think Long Island without the Coke, add Midori) in hand made the wait even more bearable. Appreciate the speed in which the bartender knocked out 2 Tokyo Teas, 1 Rum Punch, and an old fashioned. We had an accident with one of the Tokyo Teas when being seated, and management replaced it...with no issue and without having to ask them. The food was phenomenal, HOT, and well worth the wait to be seated. You won't get your food instantly, but good things come to those who wait. Recommend tag teaming dishes, because they are large...this will save you some money, but won't cheat you on the quantity of savory goodness.
