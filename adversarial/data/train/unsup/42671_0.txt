I have immense respect for Dr. Jay Holt and his entire staff. They are heroes. \nThe front desk staff are warm, personable and caring. The techs are compassionate, knowledgeable and capable. Dr. Holt is...well, I don't have words to describe him. He listens! He thinks! He recommends! He explains! \nHaving just moved to Las Vegas, across country, from Atlanta, my 10 year old labradoodle needed her urinary incontinence meds refilled. Doc suggested a BP check (meds cause high BP) and radiographs (to rule out stones and check kidneys). My vets in Atlanta never, ever ran these tests. \nDr. J found a splenic mass and we opted for surgery. I was thoroughly educated on my dog's surgery and her survival chances in a gentle, but \"no sugar-coating\" way. I was called immediately after surgery and given an update. Aftercare instructions were clear. The staff even helped me get my pup in my car. \nI was checked on the next day via telephone. Follow-up visits were quick and easy. Dr. Holt even filmed her amazing surgery. My dog, under incredible care from an incredible staff, made it. And, she no longer needs the urinary incontinence meds.\nI cannot thank them enough.
