Possibly the best Indian food I've had. They also have little bonuses like Masala Fries, which are a must eat. I haven't tasted a butter chicken as good as Masala Kitchen's. The curries are flavourful. I get dahl with every order. Their naan is great and they embed garlic into the garlic naan.\n\nThe employees are friendly and efficient. Don't be in a rush when you get here and expect to wait for your food to be prepared, depending on what you order. They don't have everything precooked and waiting under a heat lamp.\n\nThe best part about this place is that the food is priced right. I can order enough food for two people for $11.
