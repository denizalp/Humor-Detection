I was excited when a group of friends chose to meet at Mi Peru for dinner. The food and service didn't let us down.\n\nI had the anticucho combo - skewers with chicken or beef. The marinade was wonderful, and they were served hot from the grill. I saved some of the aji sauce for the meat, and it complemented the meat well.\n\nThe Lomo Saltado was a very popular dish at the long table, and I'm looking forward to try that next time.\n\nTry the Inka Cola! You'll thank me.
