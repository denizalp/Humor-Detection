I live in Lakewood and drive all the way to Avon Lake to patronize Gitta's Shop!  Gitta and her staff go out of the way to make sure you get what you want!  I attended a beer tasting over the summer and was introduced to some fabulous flavors I only now find at Gitta's...and will continue to return over and over!  Compliments and kudos on every aspect of the experience!
