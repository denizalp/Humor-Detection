My Letter to Fat Tuesday's Corporate Office:\n\nGood Afternoon,\n\nI am writing in regards to the horrible customer service that was given to us at your Las Vegas, MGM location this past Sunday-9\/8\/13.\n\nWe were treated horribly by one of your servers; I believe her name was Jennifer.\nThis was the first time we visited your location and we were very excited to try one of your infamous drinks on our vacation.\n\nJennifer was the server that day and it was pretty slow when we came by. Jennifer was the only server and there was another group of people there before us-4 young men. Jennifer was very hospitable to them, she had even been chatting with the gentleman when we arrived. My group and I waited patiently, chatting amongst ourselves while she assisted them. After about 5-7 minutes, she still had not acknowledged us and was still having conversation with the young men while she made their drinks.\n\nMy friends stayed waiting for her on one end of the bar, while I got up and walked over to her. I stood there waiting for a few minutes, and finally sat down right in front of Jennifer to get her attention-after all we just wanted to quickly grab our drinks and head on our way for our plans that day. Jennifer never looked up at me, or even said a word. The whole time I was sitting there, I started to grow very angry-I couldn't believe she was not even acknowledging that I was there. I even observed her get on her cell phone while making more drinks for the same 4 gentlemen and she just kept chatting away.\n\nAt this point my friends said forget it; they didn't want a drink from Fat Tuesday's anymore. Unfortunately, one gal we were with still wanted to try one of the Fat Tuesday specials...so I stayed waiting in front of Jennifer. After about 10-12 minutes of sitting in front of her, she finally came to me and asked what I wanted. I told her and she asked what flavor I would like, so I told her \"actually it is for the girl down there (I gestured to the other end of the bar), so I am not sure. I was just sitting here to get your help, but you can ask her.\" Jennifer still not moving from where the young men were, proceeded to tell me that she needs to see everyone's ID's and I said, \"sure, they (gestured again to where my friend's were-a few steps away at the other end of the bar) will show you their ID's\". I then walked to the other end of the bar where my friends were and thought Jennifer was following me. I was shocked when I looked up and saw she was still sitting there talking to the young men.\n\nFinally one of my friends yelled to her, \"hello, can we please get some help here?\", that is when Jennifer-your staff, shouted back to where we were sitting and said \"I NEED TO SEE YOUR ID's!\"\nThis made all of us so upset. \n\nWe all had no problem presenting our ID's, but Jennifer never even made the attempt to walk over to us to see our ID's or ask us what we would like.\n\nIs this the way you train your staff? \nThis was our first time there, and this is how we were treated...we felt awful. Not a great way to start our vacation.\n\nMy apologies if we were interrupting Jennifer's conversation with these gentlemen, but it is my experience that if you are working in the establishment-ALL of your customers should be assisted in a timely manner, not to mention with excellent customer service so they would be left with the great feeling of wanting to come back again.\nThis was not the case here and I am hoping that with my message, management would address this situation in a fair and reasonable manner.\n\nThank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.
