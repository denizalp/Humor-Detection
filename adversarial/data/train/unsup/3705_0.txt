This store in Shadyside is amazing! It goes beyond cards not to say they don't have them. They are all the way in the back of the store. They have virtually everything you name it. There's Tee shirts, books, coloring books, a children's area, ceramics, holiday ornaments and some things which I would label with foul language on it including socks.\n\nIt does hold a great variety of things that can have you wandering here for hours. They do warn you about touching breakables. I was intrigued with a Sgt Pepper drumhead ornament. Yes, they have the Yellow Submarine ornament but I've seen too much of that. They even have lunchboxes in that shape. I opted for the drumhead. The lady cut it down and properly boxed it for me.\n\nSpeaking of lunch boxes there's a bunch of Star Wars and other series available as well. Prices vary on what you want to spend. Since they have so much for you to choose from I asked about Hamilton merchandise. They carry the book \"Hamilton the revolution\" which I already own.\n\nThis is a great shop just to browse. The aisles can get a bit crowded so take you time and enjoy. They have things both above and below you. Located on Walnut St in Shadyside it is right in the heart of the business district.
