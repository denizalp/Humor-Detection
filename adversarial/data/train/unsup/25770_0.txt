One of the reasons I love escaping on Sunday mornings is to spend time with God. It's not about the building or the people. And this place will give you that. But it has to be noted that I love how the pastor has a thick accent so I feel like I'm getting a multi-cultural message. The crowd here is more blue haired but the sweetest souls that will love on you. Their smiles and faith just lift you up. I prefer to come here to do stations during Lent because it's never busy. In fact, their availability for mass times and confessions fits even the busiest of people. It's good to purge the soul so you can refill with goodness. I'll even hold your hand if you want.
