The food here is pretty decent, similar to the north location at Yonge and steeles buy some bowls have smaller portions. The menu is a little smaller and drinks menu limited. The only reason I would not return is because there's a funky smell in the furniture that will never raise it's calibre past 3 stars. Service pretty good.
