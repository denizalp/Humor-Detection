WARNING: They were featured on Dirty Dining recently. Yelp HQ decided to remove my original update, so I am editing my current review to include the new information. \n\n\n\nThis is one of better Chinese restaurants in town. We strolled in around 7:40pm and the sign on the door stated they close at 9pm. When we walked in, the hostess\/server looked at us and just said \"yes?\" in a borderline rude manner. We informed her we'd like a table for two. We were the only ones in the restaurant, but there were number of patrons who came in to pick up take out during our visit.\n\nOnce seated, the waitress' attitude changed completely for the better. She was conversational and offered suggestions. We opted for the appetizer sampler, Mongolian beef and roast duck. The roast duck is a must have! It was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with a maple glaze  adding to the incredible flavor. My Mongolian beef was one of the better ones I've had. The sauce was unique and delicious, portion plentiful and the meat fresh and perfectly cooked. \n\nOverall we left satisfied with every intention of coming back.
