Absolutely breath taking. With Military ID card you get in for free for the senic drive. I went to Calico Basin my first day, I just did the board walk and wished I had gone more prepared for the climbs. I guess I'll just have to go back.\n\nI did the senic drive my second day. It was gorgeous and I highly recommend it. Ive been to a lot if places but my trips to Red Rock left me feeling at awe and in connection with the world. My trips to RR helped me decide what to major in.\n\nMy tips.\nFull tank of gas\nPlenty of water, even in the winter\nKnow your physical limits\nWhat you pack in,pack it out\n\nAnd enjoy.
