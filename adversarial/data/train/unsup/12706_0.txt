Got a free lunch buffet here for two since we got a promotion while we booked the hotel. The food itself doesn't really stand out and with Vegas being synonyms with buffets this one gets rated a little on the lower end. I mean the food isn't bad, but it also isn't good. The service that was provided was excellent though. The waiter and the hostess were very friendly. I would probably say that the two best things about the buffet was that it was free....I mean who doesn't love a free meal and two the dessert was pretty good. They have cotton candy!\n\nSo would I pay the price of over $20 per person for this buffet? Ummm probably not, but if you do have a coupon for it then I say give it a try. If you are looking for a more high quality buffet then I would recommend checking out the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo hotel.
