This is the first ever yoga studio I visited before I start my yoga journey. So this studio always feel special for me.\n\nIt has excellent facilities! The facilities has all the things you ever think of you need: \n\n- 4 shower stalls with shampoo, conditioner and liquid soap\n- 2 washrooms\n- 3 hair dryers\n- hair gel\n- little plastic bags for your wet yoga clothes (yes they got all soaking wet after the class) ps not too environmental friendly option though\n- elastic and hair clips for your hair\n- lockers for your purses and valuables with keys\n- free use of cleaners and towels to spray clean your mat after class\n- Large big windows\nP.S, I can only comment on the ladies change room\n\nThere are tons of underground parking and elevators all the way up to the studio on the 2nd floor.\n\nThe price is excellent too. One of the best in the area.\n\nThe things that I wish that will make it my favourite studio:\n- More classes on the weekend and in the afternoon during the week\n- More varieties of classes (especially non heated classes) I know since it is call hot yoga..so I guess I should not expect too much\n-Less turnover with the teachers\n\nIt is one of the studio for Passport of Prana, if anyone interested in visiting!
