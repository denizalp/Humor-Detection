LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Me and my friends come here frequently (atleast 2 or 3 times a month).\n\n1. The fish is always really fresh!\n\n2. The maki has the perfect level of rice and toppings\n\n3. Their selection for maki isn't that big, but they've perfected what they have on the menu.\n\n4. THere is no limit for Tempura!!! \n\n5. Their other menu items too are amazing...our favourites are the baby mushroom beef rolls and the short ribs. Omg. JUST KEEP THEM COMING!\n\n6. My friend LOVES the Salmon Roe sushi, but i'm still a little queasy about it. That's not Hockey's fault, i'm just still icky about fish. But Hockey is the only place I'll go an eat raw fish..\n\n7. Service may seem rude at times, and the place is always packed to the brim. But that just means its amazing.\n\n\n\n\nI love Hockey!
