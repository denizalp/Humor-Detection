Long wait.  Ordered nutty pancakes,  Spied neighbor's great-looking omelette while waiting for said pancakes.  Tasted the cakes and wished I'd ordered the eggs.  Price-y menu made my mediocre dish even more disappointing.\n\nFelt out of place here with so many well-dressed, salon-bed tanned people. Breakfast is my favorite time of the day, and dining here brought my cheerful mood down fast.
