Show me the food! Buffets are fun and cool especially in Vegas. After researching top buffets my friends and I were off to see what the hype was. The price is not bad for the quality and amount of food served. There were a variety of items for the lunch buffet. It even included breakfast items. Bacon, eggs, shrimp, pasta, sushi, ribs, salad, chicken and much much more. Some of the food was tasty and other items were just okay. Overall not bad and worth a visit to the Belliago. So if you are not sure what food you are in the mood for a buffet will be a great choice!
