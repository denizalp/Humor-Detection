A while back I had a problem with my car, it was running poorly, shifting really hard, wouldn't always start, blah blah blah. I took it to a shop they told me I needed a new trans, which would be around 2k. I asked why would it run like crap if it was the trans, no explination was given. \n\nI go over to East Mesa Auto, they told me they would figure it out and guarantee the diagnosis. Got a call the next day that my car needed a new fuel pump and would recommend a new fuel filter....TOTAL COST $319.84....They fixed it, worked perfectly no BS no drama. It may just be a little repair shop in the suburbs of Phoenix but they did what they said and charged a great price for doing it. Everyplace should be this good and there would never be a need for these reviews.
