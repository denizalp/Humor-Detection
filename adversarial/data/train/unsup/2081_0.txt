Hey food is not bad at all ! I had Kimchi Jigae and when I wanted spicy, they gave me spicy alright ! The reason why I am giving them 3 stars because the service was iffy. My friend did not like her dish, so our waitress first offers her a new look in the menu and then adds in, \"Oh you need to pay for both\" then after my friend showed disatisfaction, she tells her \"Can we somehow change the way it tastes by taking it back in?\"\n\nAlso side dishes are not unlimited (I never been to a place that doesn't offer unlimited side dishes)\n\nPrices are a little high too. Oh and make sure to ask separate checks or else !
