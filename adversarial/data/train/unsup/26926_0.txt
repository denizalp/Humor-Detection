I love this place!!! I walked in and felt like I was a little kid again they have pretty much every candy you can imagine as well as a bulk candy section. Also they have an astoundingly large selection of soda I'm not talking Coke or Pepsi either I'm talking about good old fashion sodas cherry sodas, watermelon sodas, root beers, and many many more. So if someday you feel like being a kid again, this is place to go.
