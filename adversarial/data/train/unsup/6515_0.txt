What would I do without you, Aldi? I know one thing's for sure. I'd be a hell of a lot poorer paying those Giant Eagle prices. The deals here are phenomenal. I hear complaints about the off brands and the small selection, but hey, I'm a simple gal. What they have is all I need. Occasionally, when I want my fancy vegan food, I'll pop over to Whole Foods a block away, but all in all, Aldi's got me covered. Though I'm not exactly a fan of no grocery bags, if that means I get my groceries at a significantly lower price, then I will gladly carry my produce home in a Clancy's cardboard box. The employees don't exactly exude premier customer service, but they get the job done. Keep doing what you're doing, Aldi.
