Ok, I will give this place an honest 3.5 Yet I keep coming back even though I tell myself I wouldn't. Why? because when you get those sushi cravings, there is no other place in Charlotte, or let alone many parts of the US that is like this. Maybe in New York or like San Francisco...but definitely not in Charlotte. The LUNCH BUFFET that everyone else is raving about is the only thing I have tried. You have a good amount of sushi roll selections, raw, fried, vegetarian and sashimi!! I think the sashimi section is what makes it worth it, 4 plates, usually 2 tuna and 2 salmon. They used to just put out raw sashimi slices around a certain time but the past few times I've been, they stopped doing that (the sashimi is stuck to a a rice roll). That was a huuuge bummer. But oh well, I still come back. Their miso soup is terrible, too pasty and not flavorful at all, no tofu or seaweed it in just the soup. Their lo-mein is also really bad, drenched in sesame oil, which is VERY heavy. I LOOVE their fried rice though, it's quite fluffy mixed with diced carrots and peas. Their calamari is also pretty good. \n\nAlso to be fair, I have heard a good amount of sanitation problem with this place, but I think since their last incident a good 5 years or so back, they have really tried to step it up. Never heard about sexual harrassement but I wouldn't be surprised. \n\nTry to get here early for the lunch buffet otherwise you would have to wait and it is a PAIN!
