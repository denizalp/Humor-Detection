What are people smoking?!?!  4 1\/2 stars!  Again, WHAT?!?!  \n\nThis place is pretty bad.  From the service to the lackluster food.  \n\nService wise: condescending and the dude was barely looking at me directly when I was the one addressing him.  I was def chop liver for the evening.  Until I whipped out the camera and then the plastic.  LAME.  \n\nFood: Check the photos.  \n-The Spicy Caesar looked like a free side of salad from IHOP.  'Cept it was over $10.  WTF?!?!\n-Crabcakes were mushy.  Gotta have the crusty texture.  They were huge.  \n-Filet had no crust and again was mushy.  Color was off too, pink on the OUTSIDE.  \n-Berry bowl was MASSIVE.  Presentation sloppy just like the rest of the meal.\n\nGreat bottle prices for Pinot Noirs.  Oh the manager called me personally to thank me for my patronage the day after.  YAY.  I really don't get how this chain survives and where all the hype stems from.\n\nI know many other restos my $250 could have been spent better.\n\nOpenTable Bonus Point table currently.  Hooray for 1,000 pts!!!
