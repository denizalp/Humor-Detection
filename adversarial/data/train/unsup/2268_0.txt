I love their lunch menu! For $8.50 you get to pick a main dish, a side, and you also get a drink. \nI almost always get the same exact thing:\nMediterranean wrap with gyro meat and no tortilla wrap... Everything on it with yogurt dill sauce, a side Greek salad, and hot sauce on the side.\nThe wrap has rice in it and so \"naked\" it pretty much is like a Chipotle bowl but Mediterranean syle.. lol\nThe manager and cashiers are nice and they never complain or make a big deal about my special requests.\nThe gyro meat doesn't have any weird gamey taste and isn't oily. \nIf you like lemon then definitely try their avgolemono soup, which has chicken, rice, and lemon! \nFor lunch, you order at the counter and then they bring your food to the table (like Panera). \n\nLunch menu: http:\/\/www.marketgrillecafe.com\/#!lunch-menu\/c1oy0\n\nHOT TIP: Download the Epoxy App for the loyalty card. Every $10 you spend, gets you a stamp (they round up so you should get a stamp even for the lunch special) and every 10 stamps gets you a $10 credit.
