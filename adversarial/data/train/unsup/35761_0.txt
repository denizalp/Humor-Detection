Third time screw up and they are out! For some reason this location can't seem to get it right. Turkey sandwich, no mayo. Sounds simple, but every time I've ordered I either get no lettuce or no tomatoes. The last time it happened, I called and spoke to the manager who didn't care, all he said was \"oops.\" Never again!
