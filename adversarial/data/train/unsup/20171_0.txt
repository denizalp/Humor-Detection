Since posting my previous review, I have had some interaction with Spencers. The Store Manager from Scottsdale called me. Instead of hearing out my concern, acknowledging my concerns and then addressing it he just tried to justify what he could and had no response for those things that he couldn't make an excuse for. My issue was eventually resolved. \n\nPaul, my sales person, he should have received a message from me on Wednesday. He went on vacation on Saturday knowing that my issues were unresolved and he didn't bother calling me.\n\nSomeone by the name of Wayne did call and leave a message. I think he overseas all the operations. I tried calling him back yesterday morning. He has not bothered to return my call. \n\nI am in customer service and the number 1 rule for me is to call the customer immediately. Even if you don't have all the answers for them, at least call them, hear their concerns, acknowledge their concerns and then tell them about your action plan to bring them to resolution. This seems to be a very foreign concept.
