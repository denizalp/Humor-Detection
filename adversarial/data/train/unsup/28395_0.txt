On Sunday 2\/22\/15 I had some trouble starting my Ford Escape. Luckily I had jumper cables and got a quick jump from my friend and was on my way. Silly me, but I had some warning signs that I was having an electrical issue but since I am from San Diego I decided to try and wait until I got home to address the problem. Well my car had other plans and I had to stop at this Autozone to see what was going on. I had a free electrical assessment and found that my battery had gotten too low. I purchased a new one and, Ian, who was helping me, asked if I had ever changed a battery. While I had not, I felt I wouldn't have a problem but he kindly offered to help me anyways. He patiently walked me through the process while I asked questions, and took care of my problem within minutes. Ian was kind and helpful and went above and beyond to help me safely get back to San Diego and deserves extra recognition for his help. After the battery change my car started right up and I was on my way. Haven't had an issue since. Thanks Ian and auto-zone.
