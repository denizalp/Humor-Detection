If you're looking for a delicious meal made with all organic ingredients you've come to the right place! We came to eat here on Friday AND Saturday night and it was very good. The first night I had the Amish chicken which was a huge portion and the next night I tried the Perch. Not as big of a portion as the chicken but still very satisfying. The mussels appetizers is a good choice to start. They serve it with French fries which was a nice touch. The flavors were great in the mussels.\n\nThe service was okay but I have to say our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. Since it is newer it is very packed so I would suggest making a reservation. We had a reservation for 6 and they told us they were just waiting for a table to get up who had already paid the bill. We grabbed a drink at the bar while waiting and there was a couch to sit on while we had a drink. It was nice not to be standing around or in anyone's way while we had a drink.\n\nSince it was the old Pacers sports bar, I have to say they didn't do much with the d√©cor. Just added a fresh coat of paint which was the minimum. However, this place is more about the locally grown fresh food. The menu is a bit pricey ($80 for 2 of us) but you get what you pay for. Great new spot in Lakewood!
