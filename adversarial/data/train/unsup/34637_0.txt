Simple, fast, and delicious! There are two main menu items: soup noodles and mixed noodles. The neat part is you get to choose from various sizes and flat or round shapes for the noodles. If you're not sure what you want you can ask the waitstaff for recommendations based on your order. For those feeling voracious, the extra large is quite hefty!\n\nSoup noodles comes in soup with some beef slices and aromatic greens, whereas the mixed noodles comes with a ground meat sauce and cucumber strips. For folks who like strong flavours the mixed noodles is definitely heavier on taste.\n\nYou can make your order spicy but it's the same stuff as the container on the table. Even for a non-spicy eater like me it's pretty tolerable, so for those who are seasoned veterans I'm sure it's very mild. The sauce is pretty tasty so I recommend you at least try a dab!\n\nAll the noodles here have that freshly-made chewiness that I like! There's usually a line during lunch but it moves fairly quickly. With their reasonable prices I would consider GB Noodles a solid option.
