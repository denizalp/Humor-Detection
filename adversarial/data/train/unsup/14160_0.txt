I've visited the Purple Perk a few times, and have always enjoyed their homemade sandwiches and goodies. On this visit, we enjoyed the warm hummus dip with tortilla chips. The Chicken Caesar wrap needed work though. Did not taste of Caesar salad at all. In any event, this is a nice place to sit outside along 4th Street and watch the world go by.
