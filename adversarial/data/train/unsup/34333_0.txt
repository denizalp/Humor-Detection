Place was decorated pretty nicely. When we sat down they never offered water and kept talking amongst themselves even thought we've been ready to order for a good 8 min. Didn't have anything available that was on the menu so I went with just curry. I figured, you can't fuck up curry right? Man I was so wrong. The food tasted really bad. They probably just bought some packaged curry from the store and heat it up. You know what never mind packaged curry would've tasted better I would never come back again.
