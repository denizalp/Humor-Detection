This used to be one of our favorite Irish Pubs in Toronto. We recently went in for lunch & we were surprised that our regular portions of food were about 1\/2 the amount while remaining at the same price. While the food was still good, we were very disappointed in the significant decrease in portion size. We found out that it is now under new ownership and they are trying to make it more \"High Class.\" \n\nNeedless to say - we are very displeased with the new changes and won't be back. Regulars beware - this is not the old Grace you're used to.
