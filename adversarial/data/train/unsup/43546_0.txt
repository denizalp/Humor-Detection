Don't go there to wash your car!\nThey are not gentle with your car they don't care , I've got few scratches on my car since I used to go weekly (and it was BRAND NEW car so no previous scratches on it) !\nalso, each time I went there while I got home I had to clean after them , they don't know how to clean!! Never going back !
