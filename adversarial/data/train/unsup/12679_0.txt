Hostess day 2 on job, waiter (nice guy) day 1.  Dude this is Fat Tuesday!  Reserved table on Open Table looked forward to Fat Tuesday Madi Gras buffet to sample different dishes.  Told us that was for upstairs!  Asked to be seated upstairs with food and entertainment, hostess said she would check with manager to get us seated upstairs.  Never came back, order off menu.  Guess Sysco food, shrimp over cooked.  Served hurricanes in plastic cups!\nWaiter nice guy. This place is a disappointment, probably why they aren't open on regular basis.\nSpend the extra hit the strip, Emeril would not be happy.  Overall this place sucked.  Go elsewhere.  Other reviews must be relatives. If you can't get it right on Fat Tuesday forget about it.  Popeye does it better
