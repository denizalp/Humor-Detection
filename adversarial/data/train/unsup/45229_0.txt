Jack's has been competing with it's evil arch rival Corky and Lenny's for years. Both have either remodeled or moved in recent years. Both have lost their original owners to sickness or death. One has stood tall and kept what the original owner had. This is Jack's. Jack's move and remodel took nothing away from what it once was. A larger space allowed more customers and a larger deli and pastry section which Jack's was lacking compared to Corky's taking up half it's restaurant. The servers still are knowledgeable with Sass. The food while not amazing stands firm and consistent. Though the original owner may have had a reputation as being a grouch his restaurant stands tall in the battle with Corky's. The people who chose Corky's over Jack's have obviously not yet received the obligatory once in at least one lifetime food poisoning from Corky's. Just wait it will happen.
