Let me start by saying I'm not a vegan but I love the food they serve here. My co worker took me for lunch and I'm hooked. I had the samosas, eggless egg rolls, raspberry beret, and strawberry lemonade. It was all so flavorful and cooked just right. I was full and satisfied. \n\nThe service was surprisingly fast considering it was lunch time. To be honest I was hoping I didn't have to wait because I'm 7 months pregnant and I can get hangry at times. Luckily it ended well for everyone. \n\nI will be back and I'm taking my mom next time.
