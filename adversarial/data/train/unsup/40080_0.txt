We lived in Essex House for over 4 years and had a nightmarish time dealing with the management. The apartment was well located and the maintenance folks are a friendly bunch. However the experience with the management was horrible. While we were at the apartment, our carpets had been worn out while signing the lease and we were promised that the carpets would be changed soon; 3 years later and after severe allergies due to the bad carpet; we had to beg for carpet change and after visiting the management office every week for 4 months; our carpets were changed. My lease ran until end of April and unfortunately I had to leave Pittsburgh due to work situation in December. I informed the management of the new development and requested for early termination of the lease. Gina, the manager, said that there was nothing they could do to let us go in December but the best they could do was to let us go by end of March without paying a cancellation fee. I left the apartment accordingly and when I followed up with the management, I am told that no refund would be provided! Gina also mentioned that the discussion of letting us go in March had never happened. The best part of the story is here; when I ask to speak to her management or the owner of the property, she says \"I am the manager, there is no one above me to question what I do!\" For an incorporated company, having a single manager make decisions based on her whims and fancies is scary! All I can do now is to remind Gina that Karma is a b****!
