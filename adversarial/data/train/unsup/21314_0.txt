Ran into a promoter who offered out group of girls a free bottle and table. Had to send a picture of ourselves to him in order to be confirmed for the table. \n\nArrived at about 10:30 pm. Was able to reach the promoter right away and he took is directly into our table in the hip hop area. The place filled up quick. Glad we had a table or there wouldn't be a place to dance. Its a big club but gets quite crowded. \n\nTried to go to the trance area upstairs where tiesto was playing, but it was way too crowded. Ended up finishing our bottle and back to the casino for gambling.
