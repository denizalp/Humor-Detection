I understand why people would want to like Mary Coyle. They serve ice cream in every way imaginable. The nostalgia. They hand make\/pack the ice cream. They have a drive through. \n\nNow here is why you would not want to like Mary Coyle. It is overpriced. Your cholesterol will raise by at least fifteen points before you leave. Dimwit 16-year-olds work there. The bathrooms are gross. I have had better soft serve cones at McDonald's. \n\nHere is the deal: everyone should try out MC once just to say they have been there, but beware, make sure you wear your fat pants and make sure you know where the nearest hospital is just in case someone in your party gets a clogged artery.
