Wow - these people cannot get their act together. I emailed in a detailed timeline for the 5 different vehicles I need to transport my wedding guests around. I asked for a quote. Kerry sends me back a price list. Okay - so I add it up myself, no problem, and send it back to them with the list of the types of vehicles I want, asking to confirm the quote and include taxes, surcharges.  No reply for 4 days. So I decide to just call in for a quote. I tell the lady I need vehicles for a Friday and Sat. in Nov.  Lady, giggling around with the other girls nearby, tells me that \"she'll call me right back, sweetie,\"  and never does. So I follow up with another email.  Finally hear back, and Kerry wants to clarify that the vehicles I listed are the ones I want - YES, otherwise I wouldn't have written them down, and yes, I understand that a 55 pax bus is all forward seating! And then she asks for a time frame and dates - which were included in my initial detailed email! So whatever, I send her a very understandable breakdown with dates and times.  It's been 5 days since and still no response. I don't get it!  If this crew can't even pull a simple quote together in 10 days, there's no way I am going to trust them with handling my wedding weekend! This was not a one time limo thing - I'm looking to spend $$$$ for a professional job getting me and my 150 guests where they need to be on time. And now, reading the other Yelper's review of her wedding day disaster with this company, I am so glad that I am not booking with them.
