If you're looking for a break from chain restaurants and all their plastic cheerfulness, try Sokolowski's - which is authentic as it gets.  \n\nIt serves cafeteria food - but don't let that dissuade you, because if your middle school served what Sokolowski's did, you'd put on a hoodie and try to sneak back even now.  Every item of food on the line is handmade (right down to the root beer and the cream pies), served in a place that's comfortingly dark without being dank.  \n\nThis is THE place for comfort food.  Get your tray and wander down the line, folks.  \n\nIt looks, as others have noted, like your grandparents' basement, complete with an abundance of sports memorabilia on the walls, hand-drawn pictures from relatives, and portraits of the owners.  The heavy wooden tables are scarred but infinitely comfortable.  \n\nThe folks there are unfailingly friendly - I've been twice but they greeted me with a please hello every time, giving me suggestions and handing me free pierogies when they discovered it was my first time.   \n\nThe food?  Well, it's pure starch and meat.  The potatoes are hand-made, the corn is great, and every day they have honkin' meaty specials from salisbury steak to a rich, moist Yankee pot roast.  They have sausages of all sorts, and damn good sauerkraut.  I wouldn't trust the green beans, which looked overcooked to the point of being soggy.... But you're not here to eat healthy, goddammit.  \n\nThe food is what they call stick-to-your-ribs meals, and you'll like it if you're in the mood.   For that, it's five stars.  If you're in the mood for lighter fare, or you have a vegetarian in your party, you're out of luck.  \n\nBut you know, then you shouldn't be eating there.
