THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN MY LIFE. Our waitress Britney, with knuckle tattoos was so utterly rude to our table is was disgusting. From laughing in a girls face to talking back and bitchy looks, she was horrific. On top of that the manager would not serve a 23 year-old at our table with a license, and three other forms of id. She had made note multiple times that she had the right not to serve her and would not be. After embarrassment and disgust we decided to leave and grab dinner somewhere else. So disappointed in the experience they so rudely provided.
