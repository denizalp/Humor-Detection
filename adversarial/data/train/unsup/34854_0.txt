My family and I just got back from a lovely vegas vacation. \n\nPros:\nBeautiful! The whole hotel is gorgeous.  Our rooms were very snazzy!\nBathroom: It's huge! I love the glass shower and I love the huge tub.  Add in the White Basin store downstairs and I could have lived in the bath tub. \nCheck in and out was very easy and fast.  \nLots of choices for restaurants and shopping. \nI'm a pepsi girl so I was happy to find that a lot of the places served pepsi instead of coke. Unimportant to most people but it thrilled me.  \nThere's a remote that makes the blinds and curtains go open and closed and up and down.  So cool to play with!\nRoom service was fast and quite yummy!  \nTaxi line was fast. \nIt's close to Harrah's which is the closest monorail stop.  \n\nCons:\nTHE SMELL.  It smelled like an old lady who forgot she put on perfume about a thousand times and just kept spraying.  After unpacking, I can still smell it on all of our clothes.  Asthma or allergies or not, it's very off putting.  And unnecessary.  \nIt took forever to get drinks and one of the drink ladies took my MIL's coke order and then came back without a coke and when she asked again for one (just a plain little coke in a glass), the lady snapped that she had to be at a table.  We'd sat for half an hour at the slot machines and between the few of us lost quite a bundle so I found that to be pretty rude but she turned around and happily took a drink order (alcohol drink) from a skanky looking girl hanging on a guy at the black jack table. \nNone of the outlets in the bathroom worked and the power went off in our room one morning. \nNo prices for the mini bar any where in the room at all what so ever.  And seriously $9 for a tiny box of peanut M&Ms? \nThe doors in the rooms slam.  And I guess not many people understand that you have to close the door softly so there were slams up and down the hallway all hours of the day and night.  I heard security talk to the guys beside us about slamming their door and screaming things in the hallway.  \n\nAll in all, the only thing that would keep me from staying here again would be the smell.
