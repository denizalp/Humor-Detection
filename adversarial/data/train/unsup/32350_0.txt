We are so glad to have found this vet office! We recently had to take our cat in for the first time in years. She is generally healthy, but had started having symptoms of a urinary issue. Our experience, start to finish, was great. \n\nWe were able to make an appointment online and request a time. Within an hour, Family Vetcare had already contacted me back that unfortunately that time wouldn't work, but they suggested three alternatives that did. Before visiting, we found a coupon on their website for half off the exam fee for new clients. They were wonderful about taking the coupon (no judgment at all!). Everybody from the front office staff to our vet tech (Cindy, I believe) and doctor (Dr. Patrick) was friendly and kind. When our cat ended up needing an antibiotic, the tech did it so quickly and easily. I had been afraid our cat would lose it, and I truly believe she held it together because the tech was so good!\n\nAnother really impressive thing was how quick and responsive the office was. The day after our visit, preliminary lab results had already come back. Dr. Patrick left me a message explaining them in detail. When I called back to discuss what to do next, she had unfortunately already left for the day because it was pretty late, but the office took my number and had Dr. Richardson call me back the very same evening! It wasn't a huge emergency, but it was so nice of them to make us a priority. They really care at this office, and that matters so much. Thank you, Family Vetcare of Chandler!
