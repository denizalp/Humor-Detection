Zeke's staff has more ink than most Bic factories.  Their pierced faces are riddled with more holes than a box of cheerios.\n\nThey are also the friendliest, most knowledgeable, and passionately enthusiastic baristas of any cafe I've ever been to.  They know every facet of the menu, and make personalized recommendations to fit any discerning palette. \n\nThe inside is cozy, and all the drinks are the highest quality.  The premium snacks and indulgently sinful sweets are all delicious.  \n\nMost coffee shops staff and customers wouldn't have had the dedication to raise over $20K on IndieGoGo, but Zeke's community is different.  Don't be scared, come and taste the love!
