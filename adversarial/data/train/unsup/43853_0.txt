I went there to change my break pads. They asked me to do couple of more stuff, I chose to skip the break fluid change. The price was good. Bad part is that I had to wait for 2 hours and 30 minutes because they first got a spare that didn't fit and had to go back to find the right one again. Wish they gave a proper estimated wait time so I would have chosen to drop it off.
