Not unlike the young child who looks at all vegetables as \"icky,\" I too for the longest time was guilty of prejudging Rawlicious as \"just another hippie health nut place.\" However, I think we all know the saying about what happens when you ASS-U-ME things, am I right?\n\nLet's call this as it is, I, ever the overzealous carnivore, would not make this place my regular lunch spot, but that's not because the food was bad or I hate vegetables or Raw cuisine, I just generally enjoy the taste and texture of meat. On the contrary this was a flavourful meal that not only filled me past the point of wanting to POP, but made me feel actually good for days to come - literally my insides were whistling dixie! SO call me a converted because I can totally see the benefits of eating a raw\/vegan or raw\/vegetarian lifestyle.\n\nBeing that I've been doing my best at being on a health kick as of late (and yes I've had my stumbling blocks along the way), but I was so happy to know that all items are void of gluten, dairy and refined sugar on their menu. However, that in NO WAY implies that they are void of nutrients, flavour or YUM! Plenty of that to go around!\n\nI asked what their most popular item on the menu and the staff informed me to go for their Pad Thai option which was made of zucchini & kelp noodles, shredded romaine lettuce, carrots & bell peppers mixed in a Thai sauce for about $15. I knew my body would go into shock without a little protein so I paired that with their Chocolate Protein Power Shake  $9 - almond milk, banana, cacao, goji berries, maca, hemp protein, spinach, sunflower sprouts.\n\nThe Pad Thai was very surprising, certainly not a traditional PT in my opinion, more creamy in sauce but the flavours were there for the most part. Again, wouldn't be my regular menu item (sometimes you just cannot beat the real deal) but this was a delicious substitute. The smoothie on the other hand was excellent and I really enjoyed the dark chocolate tartness of this, would definitely switch to vegetarian protein shakes if they were more easily available. \n\nThe space here is really cool, they have an amazing backyard patio (for summer) and the whole restaurant is set up in an amazing historic home on Markham Main Street. I get that Rawlicious is an expanding Raw food chain of restaurants but I think for the occasional healthy change I would definitely return.\n\nEatcrest Out!
