Wandered into Frankie's around midnight on a Friday night. \n\nVery eclectic mix of clientele - lots of drunk underaged Asians (I'm sure this was random), a kooky local who was camped out at the back playing solitaire and a few normal looking types ordering drinks at the bar and eating late night burgers.\n\nMy date ordered a Greek burger (hyuk hyuk) with sweet potato fries. Fries were definitely tasty but I didn't try the burger. Although it seemed everyone around (drunk people) were really enjoying their burgers.\n\nFriendly waitress and prices were decent. Good spot to stop for a quick bite!
