The service is pretty good here but the food doesn't really stand out.  I had the pizza Calabrese which had sausage and hot peppers.  They serve thin crust pizzas here which is always my preferred style of pizza.  They also use a wood-burning oven which is a huge plus.  Overall though the pizza was way too salty.   For dessert I had the apple cobbler which once again was nothing spectacular.  It was also too big a serving for one person.  \n\nIf I'm in the area I'd go to Mozza but it's not a place I would go out of my way for.
