I decided to give Tott's another try. This time I had the lemon chicken and the pad sew ew. The lemon chicken was flavorful and crispy. However, it should be eaten quickly because the sauce quickly congeals if not eaten quick enough. Then, the pad sew ew was a bit light on the flavor, so I added some of the chili sauce from the container near the condiments section. The pad sew ew noodles were al dente, which I like, but some may not like their noodles that tough. The pad sew ew had carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, celery, green onions, and white onions in it.
