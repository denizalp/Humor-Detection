With so many good reviews, I had high hopes for Mochiko. However, the presentation and taste of our bowls were disappointing.\nThe Hawaiian Hen House was simply grilled chicken on dry, but sticky rice. Dry, but sticky as in dry American rice that they tried to make sticky by adding water- it doesn't work that way. The steamed veggies we added for $2 were just frozen, over steamed veggies. Don't bother adding the veggies. \nThe Mochiko Chicken bowl was better. It was fried chicken (I think I've tasted similar chicken at Panda Express) on a ton of dry, but sticky rice. There was not enough chicken to rice for the bowl to be worth $7.99. Double the chicken amount and maybe I would have been a little more satisfied. \nLychee lemonade was a good attempt, but fell short. It sounded a lot better than it turned out.
