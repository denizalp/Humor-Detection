I made my once-and-only-once trip to Arby's today. One time (and JUST one time) a year, I inexplicably find myself \"thinking Arby's\" despite all of my better judgement.  \n\nAfter picking up my car from the repair shop, I wanted to celebrate by torturing my insides with second-rate fast food. Arby's had a 2-for-$4 deal going on for breakfast and I was keenly intrigued with thoughts of \"What the hell would Arby's even offer for breakfast\"?\n\nIt was sort of like a car crash where you're so morbidly fascinated you can't look away.\n\nI ordered two \"bacon and egg\" breakfast sandwiches. The good: Real eggs.Real bacon - not that weird crap Subway tries to pass off as a pork product.\n\nThe bad: So greasy that the bun reflected sunlight. \n\nIn conclusion, go here for breakfast if you absolutely have to get Arby's out of your system. It's standard fast food fare - and as Yelp would put it, it was A-OK.
