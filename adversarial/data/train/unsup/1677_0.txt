This place at first blush is kind seedy but I can say the comedians are top notch ( been here at least 6 times).  The food is so-so and drinks a bit expensive but when you consider how cheap it is to get in its all ok. \n\nYou can feel safe in the front rows. These comedians are funny without having to resort to attacking the audience.
