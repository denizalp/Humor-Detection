If I could give this place no stars, I would. I came here to see \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and it was awful. First the seating was way too close to each other. There was literally no room at all. The person sitting in front of me was practically in my lap. She had to put her hair up because her hair was and in my drink.  \nSecond the music just kept getting louder and louder! I enjoy loud music, but many people in the audience, including myself were covering their ears. \nLastly the show started over an hour late. I don't think anyone is in charge. I would never come to this event center again.
