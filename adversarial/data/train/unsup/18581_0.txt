I would give this place a 3.5 if I could, but there's no option for it.  Upon entering this place, I did get more a crowded and intense fast paced feeling rather than a homey breakfast feeling.  The wait for a table was 5-10 mins which I thought was good, considering they were slammed with a bunch of families.  \n\nOnce being seated I read the menu thoroughly, just so I would get something I liked rather than something I'd hate.  After a good 5 mins our waitress came out and gave us our drinks, she then returned later to take our order.  I thought that her knowledge about the food was a little less than pleasing.  I asked about the holladaise sauce and she didn't know hot describe it other than it was yellow. Hmmmm, I wasn't too please there so I ordered something I was familiar with. \n\nOrders were: \n\nMonte Cristo - Turkey, ham, cheese, and bread dipped in french toast batter and fried to a crisp.  It was very interesting, it came with syrup and 2 sides of either hash browns or seasoned potatoes and eggs.  Although the concept was interesting, I thought it was ok.  It was a weird combination and it did go together, but it's something I probably wouldn't try again.  \n\nBiscuits and Gravy - Biscuits served with gravy, the name says it all.  The biscuits were really soft and the consistency of it with the gravy did compliment each other well. Oddly though, I prefer the biscuits and gravy at South Point's Coronado Cafe.  Now that says a lot, especially since that's not voted Best of Las Vegas.  The gravy was ok, there were meats here in there, but it did taste a little watered down.  \n\nThere were a lot of other things that I did want to try, but it didn't seem as interesting.  I'd probably return here cause the service was good, and the seating was fast.
