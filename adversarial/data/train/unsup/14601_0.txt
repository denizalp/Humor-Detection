A stylish and delicious option for lunch! We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of their patio, complete with a little fountain, on a beautiful sunny day, and the yummy food and lovely service added up to a great experience. At first glance this place strikes me as a bit corporate, but at the end of it I felt that they really provided a unique experience. \n\nTwo highlights of the meal: the delicious pesto that comes out with their free foccacia bread, which must have a wheel of parmesan in each bowl, because it's so rich and wonderful. I also adored the asparagus, mushroom and white truffle oil flatbread, which I shared with the table and immediately wished I had gotten just for myself. \n\nI also had the chopped chicken salad, which I found to be disappointing. First of all, there was WAY too much dressing on it, so everything felt drenched and a little wilted. Also, I was initially really curious about the granola that comes in it but I actually didn't feel that it added very much to the flavor and found myself picking around it. \n\nI'd definitely suggest this place to anyone who wants some pretty classic salads, sandwiches and flatbreads with a little fancied-up twist!
