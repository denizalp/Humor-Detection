I'm usually not a big fan of museums, but The Andy Warhol Museum is definitely one of my favorites now.\n\nAdmission is $20 which seems a little steep, but you get access to 7 floors of his art. If you go into the basement, you also get to create your own art! I made a silkscreen print as well as some water color art. I thought this was a very unique and awesome perk, and it's included with your admission.\n\nThere is also a little couch downstairs under the big Andy Warhol painting where you can pose like him and take a cute photo. \n\nOverall a great museum and a fun way to pass time in Pittsburgh.
