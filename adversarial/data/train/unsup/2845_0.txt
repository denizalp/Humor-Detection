I wanted to get some professional photos done and contacted Robbie with 3 Oceans Entertainment, my 1st contact with Robbie was many months ago. Robbie was willing to work with me and we set up a time and place, but then things happened on my end and was not able to keep the appointment. \n\nFew months went by and I was in touch with Robbie again and we talked about getting another appointment set up, so we did.\n\nI didn't have a special occasion, just wanted a nice head shot and some fun photos because I never have done this and wanted to do something outside of my box.\n\nI did let Robbie know that I'm not good at being in front of the camera and she assured me. Robbie was so thoughtful and fun, she did not let nerves get the best of me. Robbie was showing me as went along with the photos and man she is magical! \n\nMy photos are more than what I even though they could be. Robbie and 3 Oceans Entertainment are pretty amazing!\n\n I know if I have any other future events or photos I will be giving 3 Oceans Entertainment a call!  You should too!
