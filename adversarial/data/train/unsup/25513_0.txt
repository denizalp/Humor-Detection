I needed a large area rug for my bedroom and everywhere I looked they were so expensive and didn't have the dimensions that I was looking for. I went to remnant city and they had a huge selection of carpet remnants. I chose one that I liked and they cut it to my exact dimensions and bound the edges. 2 days later I was able to pick it up and had the perfect rug at half the cost of what the area rugs I looked at elsewhere. The employees were very helpful and friendly. Their inventory changes frequently so I am planning to go back soon to look at their area rug selection for another room in my house
