Smart Film's affable and knowledgeable staff did a great job installing a clear bra on my 2013 Hyundai Veloster using 3M clear film products. The front end of this vehicle has many complex compound curves and folds, yet the edges of the various film cuts and seams are almost invisible and the paint color is unchanged. The job included filming the door mounted rear view mirrors, door edges, door handle cups and rear bumper trunk opening.\nSmart Film also does FREE windshield chip repairs. These repairs really are free and no auto insurance information is required.\nOver all I had a great experience at Smart Film and I will receive a good value financial return at trade-in time.
