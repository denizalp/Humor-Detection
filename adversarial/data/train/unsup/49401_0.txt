I came at 12:00 and was about the 40th person in line. It was my first time so I took the line as a sign of good pizza. I was right. \n\nThe staff was super friendly and helped me through the process of building my pizza. It only took a few minutes in the pizza oven and my personal pie was ready. It was a great balance of toppings (it should be, I picked them out)! It was a good value for my dollar.\n\nI'm looking forward to my next trip.
