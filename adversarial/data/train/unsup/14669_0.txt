I wish I could give this place a 0. I took my son 2 a diff. Office in February of last year when he was 11. Of course u have to show up 30 min. Early which I did and the doctor was an hour and half late. I say what I'm here for and he looks at my son and basically calls him fat right in front of him makes him cry. Tells me if we were to do the surgery there's a list of things that need to be done complications everything. So I asked if he would write it down and he said didn't I listen to a thing he said? I asked his success rate and his credentials and he's getting all pissed off. First of all don't be an asshole I waited 2 hours for ur ass and than u make my son cry and than u be a smart ass to me and tell me ur not gonna write anything down and if I want to see ur credentials look it up. I said fuck u I want my money back ur not touching my son! Fast forward a 9-10 months later I look for a diff office. Found one that takes our insurance and will see my son. Make the app. A week before I'm about to take my son there I get a text saying if I want to keep the app. Type c so I did. 2 days before the app. I get a call saying that my son can't go there. I'm like what's going on? The nurse said u were seen here back in February. And the doctor don't want u as a patient, I said I never been here before she said that I have and it was a diff. Office. Totally forgot his name I'm like I don't want him to look at my son anyways what about a diff. Doctor???? She said that he talked with the other doctors and they agreed u can't come here. ISNT THIS AGAINST THE LAW???? Patient doctor confidentiality?????
