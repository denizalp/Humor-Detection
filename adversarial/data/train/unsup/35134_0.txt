Was involved in a fender bender and gave Select a call. I spoke with Bud, who was really professional. We scheduled a time to my liking to bring the car down and get an estimate. Bud was upfront, no bs when giving the estimate. I could tell that he had a passion for customer service because of the way he spoke to me, like I was his buddy and the job was going to get done right. They fixed my bumper and repainted it, matching the paint to a T! The car looks brand new! I got the car back in a weeks time, with no problems. I'm bringing it back to get my rear bumper repainted next week! If I could give 10 stars, I would. Professional, courteous and affordable! Definitely recommend going here! Bud is awesome!
