Was in for the week of PGA Tournaments, and Super Bowl.  Needed something to do on my first night and guess what ......I had a Great Alasken Bush dive. Highly recommend if you go. Looks like an Country Saloon inside and out, but most of the girls are hot and of course some are not. Have I seen better strip clubs? Hell yeah. BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO SEE SOME SNATCH.  Oh and by the way. NONE OF THE GIRLS HAD A BUSH.
