At first I wondered if we were going to get any Cheetos to go along with the show.  The venue is kind of disgusting, cramped and the Excalibur is a dirty place.  The show had the worst video quality and lighting ever. Lighting was mostly back lit and blinding.  Couldn't get a drink to save your life.  Show was half over by the time that happened.  The boys were all cute as usual and the show typical of a male revue show.  Same policeman, fireman, doctor...etc.  Moved to an inner table to avoid being spit on with beer or slobbered on by one of the guys.  No phones or pics allowed and no tipping. They charge 20.00 per person for a photo after the 1.5 hour show. It's cheesy quality and you get a free e-mail pic. Price was advertised at 53.00 but we ended up paying 73.00 for no reason.
