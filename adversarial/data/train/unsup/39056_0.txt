Bar Louie has a huge amount of space. There are some pool tables and dart board. Service is fine, drinks a little pricey, and the place doesn't get packed even on a Saturday night.\n\nIt's not really my idea of fun.  It's an upscale club feeling for people who are too mature to go out to a real club.  The music and the clientele saw their best days a few years ago.\n\nOn a nice day however, they have a big patio and a decent view of the city.
