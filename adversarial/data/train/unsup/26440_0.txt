I placed a service call with my Home Owners Warranty company regarding my pool heater and it was assigned to Aaron Pools.  The called me very quickly and were very professional on the phone.  AJ arrived at the scheduled time, and called ahead to let me know he was on his way.  He was very knowledgeable about my heater and determined quickly what was wrong.  I mentioned to him that I had guests coming for the weekend and hoped to heat the pool.  He took care of getting the parts and repairing the heater in time for me to have it working for the weekend.\n\nAJ was a pleasure to work with.  Very kind, professional, and explained exactly what was wrong with the heater.  \n\nThank You AJ and Aarons Pool for the Great Service!!!
