10\/25\/12\n\nCool-looking eatery!  Loved the artwork, especially the mosaic pieces, and I liked the twist taken by using recycled twine as a dividing line between the pathway and the tables.  Way too cool!  :)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/vovomeena-phoenix?select=lNWXre8YuohFjH0CE08kuA#lNWXre8YuohFjH0CE08kuA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/vovomeena-phoenix?select=zWLgge2mUuG7i232sb-BOA#zWLgge2mUuG7i232sb-BOA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/vovomeena-phoenix?select=x3WxOi5yqaNPJsVNdKLaJA#x3WxOi5yqaNPJsVNdKLaJA\n\nI've eaten here twice, once with a friend (see photos taken on 09\/30\/12).  The first time, we ordered a few items and shared, and we were both blown away by the very-high quality and big portions of the dishes we tried.  My favorites then were the Pain Perdu with Schreiner's sausage, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/vovomeena-phoenix?select=KF5Mrjny8RrmU1wkGEDBNw#KF5Mrjny8RrmU1wkGEDBNw and the B.M.O.C.-- a HUGE bone-in pork chop presented on a lovely waffle, topped with two fried eggs, with caramelized apples in whiskey sauce to garnish.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/vovomeena-phoenix?select=9BLumlsGZoBPrBvWRvQDTQ#9BLumlsGZoBPrBvWRvQDTQ  We tried two other items, the Banging Pocket (didn't impress me) and Boxty (I found it too greasy).  On my October visit, I was disappointed in the much-smaller portioned Pain Perdu I received, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/vovomeena-phoenix?select=5Jbb8gMJPv1WlkyySATCNg#5Jbb8gMJPv1WlkyySATCNg and the pieces were so dense, they weren't much fun to eat. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/vovomeena-phoenix?select=DDmVrbDoa7yz2OGsznjbjg#DDmVrbDoa7yz2OGsznjbjg  The coffee was still very good, however.\n\nFive stars for the first visit, and 1 star for the second- great coffee, and free refills to boot, so what's not to love?, so an average of 3 stars.  Will return to try the B.M.O.C. again.  Hope to bump it up to four stars, which is a good review from me, as I'm assuming this isn't a GMO-free establishment...
