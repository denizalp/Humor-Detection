The market has really filled in and I think that most of the vendor spaces are now taken, including Pure Pizza and Not Just Coffee. Now there's a small beer spot with local brews. And a bakery. And of course, the farmer's market and local butcher. And a wine seller. Gosh, so much yumminess.\n\nNot much for street parking nearby but there is a machine that will validate your parking that gives you a free 90 minutes in the Seventh Street Parking Deck. Awesomesauce. Of if you you don't want to drive, the LYNX light rail line stops right here.\n\nGet yourself a Not Just Coffee. They're truly amazing.
