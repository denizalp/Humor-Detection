On a trip to Arizona, my niece and I booked hot stone pedicures through Groupon. I've been getting pedicures every 2 or 3 weeks for more than 20 years and theirs are the BEST. Amazing leg and feet massages were included by Henry and Eric. Megan was the receptionist and was so sweet and helpful. Check them out (in Gilbert)!
