We had three burgers, two were regular burgers with the basic toppings and cheese each wanted, one with the potato bun and one with the lettuce bun. Both of these burgers were tasty to be sure! The third burger is the famous fried onion topped burger which is actually the reason we came! My mom said the burger was good, but the pictures of the burger displayed everywhere at the restaurant display a burger topped high with friend onion straws which is not even close to what we received. There were maybe 4 little pieces and that was it. It was so disappointing because over and over my mom said \"that was the whole reason I got this burger and wanted to come here!\" The regular fans sweet potato fries were great and the servers were all super friendly!! Only complaint was the false advertising of what one of their best burgers actually was!
