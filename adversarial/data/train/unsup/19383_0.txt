The blue ride is horrible. The employees never warn you about holding on to your dear life. The water pressure was so strong my mom and sister fell off and ended up at the ER that day. I don't usually put reviews on yelp, but I am very upset of how this ride is structured. Some changes need to be done or more people will get hurt.
