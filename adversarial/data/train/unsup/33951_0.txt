They are really great with watch battery replacements and jewelry repair. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars it that recently one of the employees wanted to charge me an extra $15 to get the tangle out of my 14k gold chain in addition to the $15 to repair the clasp. I have always gone here because of their reasonable prices and exceptional service.
