We come to Madison for an annual business meeting and drop thousands at this bar every year.  The owner's daughter-in-law is awesome but she has a baby now and didn't work much this year. Instead we were treated to the worst group of \"bartenders\" I've ever been witness to. I use quotations as there are real bartenders in Madison who are serious about their craft, just not any in here.  The service got progressively worse each night until reaching a crescendo on Friday night (8\/26\/16) as we waited ridiculous amounts of time for service while the \"bartenders\" washed dishes, took shots and visited with their friends and then the event with Ron C. took place.  I think it was the owner's son who acted like a psychopath as he yelled at Ron for what was his inability to run a bar.  I'm all for bartenders having fun as it makes for a better environment but they went right past fun to being absolute assholes. The owner needs to put his boy in check, fire his staff and hire a nanny for his daughter-in-law as she is the only one in this place who is worthy of your patronage. If you aren't from here don't waste your time at the 'dise, they apparently don't like outsiders or money.
