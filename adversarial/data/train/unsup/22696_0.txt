Dave goes to New Mexico part 12.\n\nWell, here is the last of the reviews for my trip to New Mexico.  I had a connecting flight here on my way from Albuquerque back home.  I'd been to McCarran before, but it has been a few years.\n\nFlying in to Las Vegas is always an adventure.  It was petty bumpy.  When we landed, someone yelled \"Yeah, we're in Vegas!\"  Everyone started clapping.  I am not sure if they were clapping because we were in Vegas or because we landed safely.\n\nMcCarran just keeps getting bigger and busier.  I flew on Southwest.  Southwest seems to now occupy most, if not all, of the terminal B and C gates.  I think the C terminal is new.  It is huge.  We had to walk from C terminal to B terminal, and it took us a good 20 minutes.  There is a lot of shopping and dining choices in the C terminal.  However, if you get to the B side and want something to eat, you might as well just turn around and go back to C.  B is a wasteland.\n\nI lost $20 on the airport slots.  Stood around.  Boarded my flight and was gone.
