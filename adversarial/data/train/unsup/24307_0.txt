Clark Howard recommends credit unions over banks. However I would not recommend this credit union over most banks. My problems with them:\n\n1) They charge you $3\/month to each and every member, no matter what. With my current bank, all monthly fees are waived since I have direct deposit. Not so with AZFCU. $3\/month, regardless.\n2) After seven ATM withdrawals in a month, you're charged a hefty fee for each additional ATM transaction. I found this out the hard way when I visited Europe and would withdraw relatively small amounts each time, so that I wasn't carrying too much cash on me. I get home and what do I find? Fees out the wazoo. My current bank has no such limit.\n3) Their loan rates are noncompetitive. Even as a member I was always able to get better loan rates at other banks. And I'm talking a couple of house refis, a home equity line of credit, and a car loan. I always did better going outside the credit union.\n\nMaybe Clark Howard has other credit unions in mind when he recommends them over the \"big monster mega-banks.\" This isn't one of them.
