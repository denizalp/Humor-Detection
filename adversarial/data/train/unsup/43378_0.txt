I just went there for the lunch buffet.\n\nThe selection is severely limited and there isn't much meat in any of the dishes. The waiter was absent most of the time and I had to specifically ask for naan otherwise they don't even make it.\n\nI've had way better Indian food elsewhere and wouldn't recommend anybody going to this place.
