Lard alert fatso!\n\nCan you say oil-soaked fries? WOW! I'm not from Chicago but if the fries here are an indication we can probably guess they played a crucial role in Chris Farley's diet. Enough about the french heart attack. The dogs are what I come here for and they are delicious. I've also had the gyro here and it's pretty good. The place is a little hole in the wall but it's authentic and serves up some decent food. I love the Chicago memorabilia on the wall. The staff there is always friendly and nice. If you're in the mood for some yummy dogs (or a random heart attack) head on over to CTD and get yer fix.
