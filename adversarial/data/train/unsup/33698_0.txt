My sister and I were in town last week to see family, and being new to the area, stumbled upon Naya and, boy, was I glad.\n\nI had a delicious salad with tea smoked chicken (never had before) and a light, delicious salad dressing.  It was so good, I was sorry not to have more time to stop there again.  Do yourself a big favor and enjoy a meal there soon.
