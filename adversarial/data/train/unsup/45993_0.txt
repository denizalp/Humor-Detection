I have a pass to get my car washed monthly and it's ok most of the time. Quite often though the soap dispensers in the wash are empty or clogged because limited amount gets on the car itself. \n\nI just took my car there for a full resale detail, engine, interior, exterior and head light renewal. Upon receiving my car there were new \"soap\" spots on the inside( my car was well kept before this detail). It looked as though they just sent it through the wash, the wiped down the dash and washed the floor mats. This did not look like a few hundred dollar detail. The engine looked better but there was plenty of dirt still under the hood. Headlights were better but still missed spots. As for exterior detail and wax , not even close to what you would expect for the price. Lots of dirt in door jams and areas easily visible to the eye. \n\nWhen I told the detail manager he said \" i was right, and to bring it back tomorrow. They would redo it\"\n\nI felt this was fair to make it up to me. After returning and expressing my concerns. I was told all would be made right and I could pick it up later. After 6 hrs or so I called to see if it was done and was told to come get my car. \nWhen I inspected the car the engine looked Better and the lights, but there was still dirt build up in and around the doors and trunk, which I was told would be taken care of, and still \"soap\" stains on the inside. When I asked the attendant about cleaning inside, he tile me \" we were only told to do the outside.\" \n\nI am really disappointed being that I am a customer on their month pass and frequent here often and recommend to friend and family to sign up. I don't know if this will be the case any more.  I do appreciate the staff attempting to fix the problems, but this was not the case in the end, and I do not have time to be bringing my car back every day for hour, especially since I am on a time crunch to sell it.
