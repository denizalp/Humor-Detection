This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix!  The ambiance and decor is amazing.  There is a lovely patio with large trees and lights all around.  It is very intimate and romantic.  The pizza is scrumptious.  My favorites are the Di Notte and Rustica with red sauce.  I would eat here every night if I wasn't worried about my girlish figure!\n\nLast night, Paul and I tried the crepes with nutella and bananas with ice cream.  I don't normally eat a lot of desserts, but I polished this one off!  Sorry Paul! \n\nYou can't go wrong with this place!!
