Phenomenal place - beautiful inside & out coupled with spectacular service. I can't believe I waited so long to stay here. I highly recommend the room service as it is top notch quality. Although I do not usually consume alcohol, even the drinks looked inviting! Can't wait to come back again to stay here again. \nThank you Mr. President! Lol
