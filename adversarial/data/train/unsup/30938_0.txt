I have been here with colleagues several times, and every time we have eaten here, we have had a good experience.\n\nAlmost every dish I have had here has been very well prepared and tasty. The portions are definitely more generous than you'd think (or than they tell you)!\n\nGreat spot for casual dinner and drinks, not bad for groups as well. A definite Uptown favorite.
