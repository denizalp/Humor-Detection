One of my favorite places in downtown Calgary to grab a pint or some food after work. \nService is always great.  The beer is always cold and the food is even better.  Recommend just about everything but my favorites are the ribs, chicken wings, Mac and cheese and deep fried pickles.  \nMy only complaint is the wine.  Poor selections poured in an odd glass. But I don't expect a large wine list at a place like this.
