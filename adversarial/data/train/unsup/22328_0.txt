Go for the incredible nail art. Say you'll never come back because of the horrible service. Come back anyway because there is no where else that does nail art as good in the area. Never come back because fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Realize you actually bought a membership so come back once a month and hate yourself every time. PS you have to book an appointment. PPS make sure you tell them you want glitter\/nail art so you put extra time on your appointment. PPPS they don't give referral gifts but they should.
