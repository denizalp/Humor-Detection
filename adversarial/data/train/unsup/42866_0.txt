Rush!! What to say about Rush! I have been there twice but my most recent visit was Saturday night. I went there on a date and it was pretty much perfect! It is the definition of what service should be like (and was like at one point in time..) \nWhen we arrived, they had free valet service. I know this is only a weekend thing, but boy is it convenient. Parking downtown on a Saturday night is nearly impossible at times. \nThe hostess took us to our table and laid our napkins on our nap (Major brownie points there!!) She also took my jacket and gave me a purse hook for the table. More restaurants should get into this!\n\nWe skipped appies and went straight for the meal. I had a lobster pasta dish and it was delicious! It looks like nothing when you get it but it's so filling. My date got the pork chop. I'm not a big pork person because we had pork chops a lot when I was a kid but it was delicious. It was huge! Speaking of which, their prices are pretty fantastic considering they are in the heart of downtown. I was really impressed with that. \n\nOur waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. He wasn't too pushy and he wasn't distant either. He was perfect. For dessert I order Les pots de chocolats. One of them was a coffee one, the other a white chocolate green tea one and the last a grand marnier one. SOOOO delicious!!! I think i liked the white chocolate green tea one the best. The flavors work surprisingly well and they are a pairing you wouldn't usually put together. \n\nI will be going there again, certainly sooner than later. I wasn't a fan of all the turquoise decor in the dining room and actually prefer the lounge, however it does suit the restaurant. \n\nRecommended for sure!!!
