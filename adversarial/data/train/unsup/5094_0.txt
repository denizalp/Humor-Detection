I have trained in a few different arts and in a few different studios. The Dojang is GREAT, the instructors are all very competent and patient. The students range in age and ability levels, there are plenty of classes and disciplines to choose from. They also offer private sessions, which I can't wait to start. This a wonderful dojo and I would not hesitate to recommend them to a family member or friend.
