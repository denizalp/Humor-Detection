This is definitely a spa fit for a queen, so obviously I had to go.\n\nI saw on Facebook from a friend that they were offering $9.00 Pedicures, Gel Applications, or a full set since it's their grand opening week if you were a first time guest. I decided to set up an appointment for myself and my mother in-law today at 3:00PM to take advantage and try them out!\n\nI was totally not let down.\n\nThe hype is real guys. This place is beyond beautiful and I had the most amazing, relaxing spa pedicure by Calvin!\n\nEven if I was paying full price (which is totally reasonable given the services you receive) my mind would've been blown but to be able to experience this spa at the price I payed I almost feel I robbed them!\n\nI cannot wait for two weeks to see Calvin again, and I cannot wait to bring my bridal party here when they're in town to get the pampering they deserve!
