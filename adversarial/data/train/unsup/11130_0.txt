This ain't no vegan nonsense. \n\nI love the filling and eye-pleasing Cauliflower Tahini bowl: organic quinoa, house-made hummus, roasted cauliflower, za'atar salsa, carrots, cabbage, beets, mint, pomegranate, organic arugula, radish, sesame seeds, seed flatbread with lemon tahini sauce. \n\nThe meal is reasonably priced (11.73), especially given that cauliflowers are so expensive at the moment. All ingredients are sustainable, organic and local where possible\n\nThis is basic, but not boring fruit and veg and you won't leave hungry! I'm sure that they will continue to thrive because the owners know what their customers are looking for in a plant-based experience. \n\nThey are doing well in the drinks department as well. Kombucha on tap, smoothies, cold pressed juices, yerba mate, coldbrew etc...apparently cocktails, beer, cider and biodynamic wines are on the way.\n\nCome and taste the rainbow at K&K.
