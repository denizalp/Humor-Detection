Came here because they had been advertising wing night and although we have our usual wing spot, we decided to give this place a try. \n\nShowed up at about 830 and I guess it was seat your self? I'm not sure? There weren't any signs. Sat at a table for about 15-20 mins and no one payed us any mind. Was anyone even working? I'm not sure. We saw one or maybe two people working the bar but no one taking care of the section of tables that were off to the side. So we left. I wish we could have tried the food but no one was interested in serving us any.
