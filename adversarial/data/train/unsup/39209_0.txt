Food here is tasty while being on the more healthier side. Customer service definitely needs work. Never encountered any nice or pleasant staff here. If you greet the staff here a \"hello how are you\" they just ignore & just want to know your order. I agree with another Yelper who also reviewed this place that they all have a \"well what do you want\" type of attitude. When I went during lunch time , they had a semi-busy line - woman giving me toppings for my chicken sharwma bowl just looked at me , made it seem like everything you see behind the glass you can put in your bowl. At cash register , cashier wanted to charged me extra for feta cheese & referred me to the glass print when the lady who was handling my food shouldve told me what I want is extra before putting in my bowl & refer me to the side glass menu at that exact moment. I don't look at that glass print (I'm looking at the food behind glass lol) esp when line is moving fast & I already chose what entree\/meat I want. I just know avocado is extra anywhere you go. No matter how busy it is or how fast you want line to go , staff should always communicate with customers.
