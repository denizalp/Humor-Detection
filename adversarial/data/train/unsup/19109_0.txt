I finally made my way over here! \nAs far as tea flavors and such, they are good. They have samples of their milk teas and specialty (fruit) teas. I tried:\n-Honey Green milk tea - not overly sweet, good tea flavor (4\/5)\n-The Taro Milk tea - Not overly sweet as well, and the taste is great. I'm very 50\/50 when it comes to taro milk tea and this one is not TOO artificial. I ordered this with custard pudding and it was PERF.(5\/5)\n-Fruit tea with pineapple, mango, and peach. Despite all the flavors I could still enjoy the taste of the tea. THe pineapple flavor is not one of my favorites, but another combination of fruit flavors would be great and refreshing (4\/5).\n-Green Thai Tea (Matcha thai tea?) It was hard for me to taste the flavor. We got this with boba and the boba ruins the drink completely. The BOBA was Hard chewy in a gross way. I do NOT recommend this topping. \n\nCosts: $3.95 for a 16 oz plastic bottle. With toppings 50cents each, you quickly are paying almost $5.00 for a small drink. If you want a 32 oz (which they were sold out of), it's about $7.00. Twice the volume for a little less than twice the price. If I'm paying $7.00 for a drink, I better be sharing it with someone because that's the cost of a meal. It's a good deal if you are sharing, or want to save some for later. I wouldn't get the large size myself. The 16 oz APPEARS small, but it's actually considered a standard drink size. However, spending $4.00 + I can get a 24 oz drink somewhere else. So is it REALLLY worth it?\n\nInterior- It's a small place. There are benches to sit, but it's not the best place to chill with a group. I guess it's meant to grab and go or be as simplistic as possible. the decor is very pretty.\n\nWould I come back here? Probably. Does this place AMAZE me? no. So I won't be going out of my way to come here, but I do recommend it for decent tea quality and flavor. solid 3.5, rounding up to 4 stars.
