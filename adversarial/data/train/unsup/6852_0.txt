Cool indoor mini-golf. I thought the 8 dollar fee was a fair price for the time you're able to spend here. The fluorescent lighting was a neat trick and I really thought the animal\/safari theme was nice. Great place for kids, they had an area for birthday & pizza party's. Could get hectic if it was busy. I'd go back.
