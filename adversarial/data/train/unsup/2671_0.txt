Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ for short) reminds me of LAX in some regard but the ONLY difference between the two is that YYZ has and UP train that will take you downtown in 25 minutes which is better that renting a car since the public transit in Toronto is so good.  Occasionally there will be delays and cancellations due to the infamous cold weather.  There is free Wi-Fi (a hit or miss at times) and the payphones have a keyboard for TTY purposes.  Going through customs is a multi-step process.  Navigating the airport can be confusing at times, especially for first time visitors.  YYZ has U.S. Border Pre-Clearance.  However this airport lack a central rental car facility which requires waiting for a shuttle or a taxi.  Toronto Pearson is ok for being the International gateway to Canada but should catch up with the times in order to remain relevant.
