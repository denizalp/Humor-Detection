Today was the second time I have visited Thai House and it was from a friends recommendation.  Turns out I had eaten there before on a previous trip to Charlotte and enjoyed it then as well.\n\nThe soup served with lunch was very good chicken stock based soup with noodles and small bits of chicken and was a very pleasant surprise.  The Green Curry which was the Thursday lunch special also had a nice deep flavor.  I ordered medium spicy and was hoping for a bit more of a burn but suspect that if I ate there regularly I'd be rewarded.\n\nI'd say a good solid reliable Thai place.
