This place is a joke. It is so hot inside it's ridiculous. I'm literally sweating at the table just waiting for my food. Very stuffy inside with little to no air flow, they only have 3 ceiling fans from the 80's cooling the place off, no AC what so ever. \n\nI left before even ordering based on the fact it was so hot inside. Living in the desert you wanna get away from the heat when you go to dinner, not sweat at the dinner table. I will not be returning here ever again.
