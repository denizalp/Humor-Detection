Where do I start? I have been to an orginal pancake house in California which was nice and had very good food. This one however I think was the very first original pancake house because the decor was horrible and dirty. We decided to still try it and the food was not good at all. I don't know how u really can really manage to mess u breakfast entrees but they did.
