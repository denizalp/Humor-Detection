ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW :\n\nLechon Belly de Cebu ($8 per 1\/2lb): Slow Roasted & Seasoned Boneless Pork Belly. THIS WAS AWESOME! Extremely flavorful, with a very thin and crispy skin. My mouth waters thinking about it!  Seriously, order this!  They must smoke this thing for hours!!\n\nOk, now that we have that outta the way, how was the rest of the food??\n\nSinigang Na Lechon ($8.99). Essentially a Sweet and Sour Pork Soup. The soup broth was far too SOUR for my tastes and very little broth was eaten personally. The Pork was good though, very tender and flavorful, although this particular dish is just not for me.\n\nWe added the Garlic Rice ($1 add). Good version here...garlic rice is my favorite!  WELL worth the extra buck! \n\nHalo Halo ($5.99). Good version and large size, but it's on the \"ICY\" end. Ube is my favorite ice cream though :)\n\nTuron with Ube Ice Cream ($3.99). This was great! The turon comes out piping HOT and melts the ice cream on top...very good!\n\nFYI, they do NOT serve ice water here...we ordered the Coconut Juice...sweet enough for my tastes and comes in a large can.\n\nI'll be back for MORE Lechon Belly de Cebu!!!
