Yesterday I was fortunate enough to snag some Mystere tickets, I was ecstatic as I have been wanting to watch this show for awhile now. This by far is the best of the 3 I have seen! It incorporates all the elements one would expect when watching a Cirque du Soleil production: astounding circus skills, elaborate sets and costumes and of course humor.\n\nThere wasn't a dull moment for me unlike with Zarkana and KA, I was mesmerized with all the color and stunning visual effects. There were a lot of notable acts, my favorite are the ones involving aerial acrobats like the flying trapeze, Chinese poles, trampolines and the Korean plank. To me that is the epitome of what a Cirque show should be. The aerial cube was spellbinding and the Taiko drummers put on one hell of a show also. You can't leave the old man out, there's something lovable about him and definitely offers comedic relief.\n\nI can go on and on but I think it's best if you just catch this show, I would definitely recommend watching this over the two I mentioned above.
