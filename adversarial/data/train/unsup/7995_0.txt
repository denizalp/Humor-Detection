Okay, I get it. I'm not suppose to like this Yard House because 1) it's located in the chichi, pretentious mall better known as Scottsdale Fashion Square and 2) the patrons are mostly chichi, pretentious folks who shop at the chichi, pretentious mall. But seriously, if you're jonesing for some beer and grub and the need to watch a few of the Sweet Sixteen match-ups, there's no better place than the Yard House.\n\nFrom 3-6 every day, they have Happy Hour with $3.25 pints (they claim to have over 200 types of beer) and half priced appetizers. The best thing is that you don't even need to sit at the bar to enjoy this deal.\n\nThe only beef I had with this place was our waiter who insisted on calling us \"girls.\" \"Hey girls, how are you doing?\" \"Hey girls, what are you having today?\" But as that was followed up with, \"Hey girls, I'll need to see some ID,\" I guess he's not so bad.
