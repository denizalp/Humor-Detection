I moved from Florida recently and was looking for a nail salon when a coworker told me about Harmony Salon and Spa. I felt in love with the place from the first time, it's so clean, the customer service so great and my nails looked amazing. I highly recommend it, everyone is wonderful and super nice!!!!!
