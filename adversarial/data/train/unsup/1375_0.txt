Poor service. \nUnprofessional cashiers. \nInappropriate employees. \n\nThe lady ringing me out was so into her conversation with her friend at the register next to her that she failed to acknowledge me and even stopped ringing out my stuff to continue talking!!! \n\nAnd not to mention the guy bagging my goods questioned me about why I was purchasing Epsom Salts (which by the way, I use for baths) and even added, \"I hope you're not going to go smoke this\" then laughed about it.\n\nAnyway, on brighter terms, I did save $33 on a $33 purchase all together by buying some raw chicken that was on sale, buy 1 get 2 free! Heck yeah!
