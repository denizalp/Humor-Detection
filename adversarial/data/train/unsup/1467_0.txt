I tried to give this place not a second but third chance. I wish this place was good because I like the idea of prepped meals, because I do that myself. \n\nI honestly think that the prepared foods are made cheap, low quality and they overprice them. I bought 3 meals and the coconut chocolate cookies as well as the black bean brownies. \n\nThe coconut cookies were EXTREMELY DRY. It was so hard for me to eat it because they were so dang dry. There was flavor but I could not get past it being so dehydrated. I couldn't finish the 3-pack it came in. \n\nThe black bean brownies were okay, they had the consistency of a red bean or taro pastry. The presentation though was not there. These brownies look like they weren't carefully poured into the little cupcake liners. \n\nFor the 3 meals I got  I TRIED to eat them the day they were written to be best eaten by and it was still not good- the vegetarian summer rolls (similar to Vietnamese spring rolls), these did not hold up and were pretty much falling apart the wrap became stale and hard and the sauce had separated to 1\/2 water 1\/2 sauce. I couldn't eat this.\n\nThe second meal was the egg white with broccoli. I wanted to eat it for breakfast and it was bad. The food smelled horrible and when I bit into it, it had a pungent taste. I quickly threw this away. \n\nI then tried the almond crusted chicken fingers with broccoli (this was my salvation as it was the last meal)- the broccoli was over boiled and it was army green colored, not the vibrant broccoli color. The chicken fingers were SOO DRY. \n\nI'm over this place. No more chances. I can't expect that they will change.
