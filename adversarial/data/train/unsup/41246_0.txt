We went here on a Thursday night. It was busy in both the bar and the dining room. The service was attentive, but the food was terrible. The water, too.\n\nThe water was absolutely disgusting. We know Phoenix's water is gross, but there is something extra specially disgusting in the water in that neighborhood. For a restaurant to serve water that bad leaves me speechless. \n\nI started with a side salad. It was a bed of lettuce and some grated cheese. For $8, I expected more. Onion or tomato, maybe? A mushroom? \n\nI ordered the Chicken Alfredo. I was completely perplexed by my dish. The first thing I noticed was that it looked like it had sat under the lamps too long. But we ordered it 5 or 6 minute prior. The dish was hot, but the top of the food was lukewarm. Under the film that had developed on the top of the lukewarm-ish-ness of the dish it was warm, but not hot. Again, it was perplexing. It looked like the Costco Chicken Parmesan was served on my plate, but it wasn't as good. It was bland, and flat, and had no flavor. \n\nMy gf ordered the Fish & Chips. She said that they were \"mediocre\". The fish was average, and bland. The breading was bland, and too greasy. Nothing at all like the Fish & Chips at Four Peaks. I had a bite of the Cole Slaw, and liked it, though.\n\nMy gf's son ordered the mini burgers from the Kids' Menu. When I looked at the burger, it looked like something was amiss. I opened the bun, and looked at the burger. The cheese looked like the burger had been cooled, and re-heated. It was gross. The burger was like a rock. Bland. Overcooked. No texture. No condiments with the burger. He's 6, but even he knows that a burger should have some condiments with it. He ate 2 bites, and gave me the, \"Really? Do I have to eat this?\" look. \n\nThe only reason this place is a 2 is because we were in a hurry, and they worked to accomodate our schedule. I wouldn't even call the service particularly \"GOOD\", it was good enough to get us in and out in a timely fashion. \n\nA decent family restaurant in the West Valley still eludes us. It's a shame that there are so many lazy, uninspired, unmotivated chefs in the industry. Are they even Chefs at this level, or do the owners throw a hodge podge of illegals into the back and call it good? \n\nWe will not go back.
