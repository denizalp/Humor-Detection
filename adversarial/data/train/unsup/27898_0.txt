This is a mixed review. I ordered the Cobia because I remembered catching and cooking it growing up in Florida. It was disappointing. It was overcooked and had no seasoning at all. I asked for some lime and added a lot of salt and pepper to make it and the succotash palatable. The bright spots, the bread pudding was fantastic. Our servers helper, Krystina, should be made a server. She was great and would be a terrific server.
