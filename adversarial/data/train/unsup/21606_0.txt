Okay. I was in Las Vegas. It was my first night there. It was about ten O'clock, and I was exploring Fremont Street. I had JUST had a slice of pizza and beer at Evel Pie down the street. As I was walking back, my eyes caught sight of a huge banner that read \"10.99 Prime Rib!\" And for some inexplicable reason. I suddenly really wanted prime rib.  I guess I'm just a sucker for advertising.\n    I got sucked into the casino. The El Cortez? I think? I meandered around looking for the restaurant. I found one of the bars, and moved on. No signs for Prime Rib there. I passed the pizza joint. Nope. No Prime Rib there either. Then I got to Siegel's. It seemed fancy. It seemed pretty upscale. It seemed really nice. No way this is the place? \n      \"Is this the place?\" \n      \"Yes. This is the place.\" \n      \"Okay. One please!\"\n   I was quickly lead to a table and a cute waitress swung by for my order. I let her know I wanted $10.99 Prime Rib. Not quite still fully believing it myself. She smiled, nodded and asked about my drink. I hadn't had water all day, and I figured it was a good a time as any to keep up the hydration. Plus, I just really wanted to pay $10.99 for the Prime Rib. But cute waitress got a tip too. Nowhere on the menu does it say '$10.99 Prime Rib\" Hence my confusion. But if you ask for it....they've got it.\n    On the TV's were playing I think the original Ocean's 11.  (No, not that one.  The actual 1960's original one) That somehow seemed appropriate here. After a lil while of trying to figure out what the heck I was watching, the prime rib showed up. Holy Crap! $10.99 Prime Rib is awesome! I was starved all of a sudden.\n     Thick juicy tender steak. Mound of french fries. Bowl of carrots, and two different ramekins of sauce to dip things into? I think I love you $10.99 Prime Rib Special. I tore into the steak and ate it as lovingly as I could.  I tried to save it. Enjoy it as long as I could. But it was gone before too long. I used the horseradish and au jus sauce with the fries. (So very Good.) \n  \n\n    So ya. Total was about $15. So a pretty cheap second dinner. Thanks Siegel's for $10.99 Prime Rib Special. It was magical. I'll definitely stop in on my next trip out your way for it.
