First timer... I've noticed this place for a while but never gave it a second glance til I was jonesing for tempura shrimp in a bento box. Yelp led me here and I'm glad it did. Quick service, I took the food to go. The shrimp were plump, crisp, and yummy. I also tried the teriyaki and honey chicken with white rice and a cabbage salad, both were good but I preferred the honey chicken. I paid 20$ and it made 2 meals. I won't mind stopping in again.
