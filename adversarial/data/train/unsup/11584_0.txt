Stayed here for 5 days in Dec. '13 during high season. \n1.  Room:  \n\n- Corner suite felt incredibly small compared to the Venetian, Caesars, or even condo-converted units e.g. Trump.  ARIA's next level up from the Deluxe room is the Corner suite, a mere 920 sq. ft.  In comparison with the Wynn's Tower Suite (1,280 sq. ft.) or the Encore's Parlour Suite (2,000 sq. ft.), one would have to wonder why anyone with a similar budget would choose the ARIA.\n\n- Deluxe room felt cramped, albeit modern.  ARIA's Deluxe room (even with an \"upgrade\" to city view) is 520 sq. ft.  Compared to a room at a hotel of equal price point on the Strip such as the Venetian (smallest room: 650 sq. ft) or the Encore (smallest room: 745 sq. ft), the ARIA's most basic room doesn't match up to the value of rooms at other 5-star hotels on the Strip. \n\n- Room design\nRooms at the ARIA certainly attract guests who prefer an ultra-modern style but the spatial design of the room is just horrendous.  Deluxe room fridge\/countertop faces the bed (as opposed to being closer to the closet near the door\/entryway), bathroom doesn't have a real door (it's a sliding door that slides into the wall),  toilet is divided by a glass door to the sink (not a real separate toilet room), and bathtub is right next to the shower so when you shower, the bathtub and the entire floor gets wet.  \n\nWalkway could have been designed to feel more spacious by placing the headboard of the bed away from view (Deluxe room:  one could see the end of the bed from the door so it feels less private; in comparison to rooms at the Encore where the bed is only seen when you walk all the way into the room -- this can be fixed by simply rotating the position of the bed).  \n\nAlong with a lack of lights in the room and dim existing lighting placed in only areas above the bed and near the bar countertop, the room felt dark and depressing.  Poor lighting made it difficult to enjoy the modern design of the room.  \n\n- Technology-enabled room does not work seamlessly\nIndeed the ARIA's lighting control system is more sophisticated than that of the Encore, but why would one want to control every single light, sheet of curtain, door lock, iPod\/auxiliary, room service, clock\/alarm, phone, and billing information from the TV remote control?  The ARIA's in-room digital controls are redundant, frustrating, and lack insight into how to truly integrate technology into modern architecture.\n\n-  \"5-star hotel\" with 3-star hotel amenities\n    - Two light bulbs went out of order on the first night of my stay.  Shampoo and lotion bottles were of low-grade sulfate washing ingredients.  Towels were low-absorbency and a few were even stained \/ dirty.   Lack of coffee-maker device in the room (ridiculous for a 5-star rated hotel).  Fee for in-room bottled water (absurd considering that even 4-star hotels offer free bottles of water as a baseline, and let's not even discuss the non-working WIFI).  Bed -- extremely uncomfortable, mattress way too soft (back killer!), and I couldn't even sit on my bed without \"sinking in\" quicksand.  Lack of trash cans in the room required me to improvise and construct my own trash cans out of shopping bags.\n\n2.  Service:  Satisfactory overall but room was not clean upon check-in.  Wine stains on the countertop, dust all over the desk and bedding, and dirty windows.\n\n3.  Dining:   Lemongrass: way too salty, over-seasoned, service attentive.  ARIA Cafe:  wide-selection, absurd pricing (only reason I went - I had a voucher).  Jean Philippe Patisserie: good quiche, salads, gelato.  Nothing spectacular.\n\n4.  Casino:   I'm a regular player at the Wynn\/Encore and Caesar's Entertainment hotels and haven't really made effort to increase status in M-Life.  During my stay, the casino didn't look like it had much action (players looked solemn\/bored, dealers looked miserable).  \n\nThe clientele: mostly (Indian, Chinese, Iranian) foreigners who have a lot of money to spend but didn't know how to play, drunk posers returning from Marquee, frat-boy types, and families with kids who chose the ARIA because they really didn't know any better (Excalibur is too old, Circus Circus is too ghetto, or MGM Grand no longer had the lion exhibit?  Who knows.).\n\n5.  Concierge:  I had called the concierge to find out if I could arrange a casino rate and they transferred me to a booking agent who really wasn't able to answer my questions about what's offered on the casino floor.  \n\nIt may seem like my review of ARIA is entirely negative -- but it is not.  There are good reasons to stay here.  City Center is a great location in the middle of the Strip, the front desk personnel at ARIA met my needs as a guest, and the food wasn't horrible.  \n\nBottom line:   Not recommended for those who have experienced truly impeccable service and know 5-star quality accommodations.  Probably OK for first-timers, younger crowds 21-30, foodies, shopaholics, and non-serious gambler.
