I didn't run into the long lines that other reviewers wrote about, but I got to Eggslut around 8 in the morning.  Still, it took about 20 minutes to get my food.\n\nThe breakfast sandwich was good and the egg was cooked perfectly. The biscuit was also awesome, but the coffee was terrible.\n\nThere were a couple of big downsides here. The seating area was small and filthy, they should have somebody to clean up. I cannot imagine how bad it must be later in the day. Also, the food and drinks are really expensive: $8 for a small breakfast sandwich, $5 for a biscuit, and $5 for crummy coffee.  \n\nIt was ok, I won't be back, and don't think I'll be visiting their Los Angeles location either.
