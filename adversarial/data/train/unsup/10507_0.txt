It's like a black hole! I go in for one or two specific things and come out $100 poorer. How do they always get me?!? I suppose that just means they have a really great selection. Decent prices, too. I've found lots of favorites here -- shoes, clothes, kitchen accessories, art for my walls, journals, toys... The list goes on and on. The only thing I have the will power to resist are the food items. I don't know what it is but I just can't bring myself to buy edible items from a store like Marshalls, especially when Harris Teeter is just a couple doors down!
