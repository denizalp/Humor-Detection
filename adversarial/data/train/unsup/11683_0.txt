This place symbolizes overrated businesses glamorized by the media for no justifiable reason:\n\n-The Lobster Tail people are \"raving\" about? = It was completely stale with tasteless cream. This is just a cream roll that you can get for cheaper and better in a Chinatown bakery.\n-Strawberry Shortcake - average. Cream could have used more flavor and tasted less commercial and fattening.\n-Cookies - we tried one of each and none of them were good. I literally took a bite and threw the rest away. How is it possible to make cookies that aren't good?\n\nAt this point you might think I sound like a negative snob and I attribute that to the amazing bakeries of San Francisco - so I apologize for having standards. The icing to this cake was that we waited 1+ hour to order & receive and most of the shelves were empty because they were selling faster than they could bake. \n\nI'm still mad over the stale lobster tail - especially for the price we paid. Why would you come here?
