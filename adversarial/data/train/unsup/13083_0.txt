This place is the lowest down Nasty place I have EVER been too. I brought my sister here for her 24rth birthday and she was bombarded with terrible looking women. Then kicked in the face, on accident, but it left a big welt on her face.. After we notified the managers they explained that it was a accident and started to insult our group. The manager was a man and actually got violent with us and in our face. I've never been anywhere where I felt so threatened and scared in my life. I get the women didn't intentionally kick my sister in the face, but it happened and a manager is supposed to be there for his paying customers.
