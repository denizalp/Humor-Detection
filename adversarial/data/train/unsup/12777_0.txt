A bunch of us came here for lunch to celebrate a coworker's birthday.  This was one of the coworker most favourite place.  So we decided to come here. \n\nThe experience here was pretty awesome for an Olive Garden.  The restaurant was clean, and look like most other Olive Gardens I been too.  The server Joanne was super friendly, efficient and attentive.  Some of my coworkers worked her to death but she took it like a trooper.  She was definitely brilliant.  The food was okay, exactly like the other Olive Gardens I been too.  I always order the same thing a bowl of spaghetti w\/ meat sauce.  Can't possibly go wrong with the basic.  \n\nOverall a good experience and we had a blast.  This maybe my last time to this location since I'll be moving to a different work office.
