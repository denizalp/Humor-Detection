I love breakfast\/brunch, and I've gotta say I found a place that really fits me! Scramble was everything I was looking for! \n\nThe food is great, the people are nice, the location is adorable, and decor is fun\/modern.  \n\nI also like the way you order, there isn't pressure to wait for a server to come to you, you can get your refills as needed, and enjoy your experience without hoping that you get a good person and not a server having a bad day.
