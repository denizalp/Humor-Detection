I am torn. We didn't come here for the club, just for dinner. I felt like the italian dishes were probably \"meh\" and nothing special but... \n\nif I could sum it up, high roller, big baller:  I hope you like balls. Don't leave here without putting some balls in your mouth.\n\nGET THE MEATBALL. Get the meatball. Get one. Get two. Get more. But really, taste the meatballs, because it's really what you should come to LAVO for. \n\nJokes aside. I had intense ordering regret when I had one taste of my friend's meatball (hah, hah).  Because I didn't order one, and so all I could think about while I ate my so-so bolognese was... I want more of his meatball! \n\n\nWe were seated outside on the balcony facing the Treasure Island show. Our waiter was hilarious- he claimed to be able to perform the whole thing, and I called him on it, so he lip synced perfectly to most of it. The drinks were good. \n\nOverall message: get the balls.
