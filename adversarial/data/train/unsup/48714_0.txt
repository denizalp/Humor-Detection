Huuuuu... I just remembered why I don't visit chain sit down restaurants. I don't know what kind of world I was living in back in the day. Maybe it was because I was a broke college student? Maybe the food was better back in the day and they're slacking now? Maybe my pallet is a bit more refined? I don't know. \n\nThe salad is like eating water and the dressing is aight. The combination of that and the bread sticks was okay. \n\nMy food??? Huuuu... no bueno. We paid all this money for food that was Meh. \n\nMy margarita was good though. I'm glad there was more mango than strawberry. The strawberry was too sweet. \n\nMaybe Carrabas would have been the better choice for chain Italian.
