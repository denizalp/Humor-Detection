This place really hits all the bases.  Perfect for dinner with clients or drinks with friends.  Food is great.  The kale salad and the short rib are some of my favorites.  The ambiance is perfect during the day and switches to an upscale night club which I equally enjoy.  If you are in old town and want something I step up from the rest I would certainly recommend Dakota!!
