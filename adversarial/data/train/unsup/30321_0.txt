Le Thai : Hip, Downtown Eatery :: Pan Asian : Made with Love, Family Kitchen\n\nI heard good things about Pan Asian and finally got to try it out when I was on this side of town.  It's in a little strip of buildings, next to nothing in particular and we almost drove past it.  When we got inside we knew it was our kind of place: small, homey feel with super friendly owners.  I don't need some stuffy restaurant on The Strip- give me a place like this any day!\n\nAfter being told they could make many of their menu items vegetarian, we decided to let them call the shots.  I wanted a curry and a noodle so David (I think that was his name) said we should get the Massaman Curry and the Stir Fried Linguini.  \n\nThe curry was made with veggies and tofu and had a nice flavor to it.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I only wish that it had a little more spice (we ordered medium) and some more veggies (it looked a little soupy, even for a curry).  The noodles had a good amount of heat (also medium), lots of flavor, and were packed full of fresh vegetables.  I was actually pretty surprised at the amount and quality of veggies I was given.  This was my favorite dish of the two.  \n\nWe also ordered a Thai Tea and Fried Ice Cream.  Both were good, but I have favorites elsewhere.\n\nIn all, I felt like I was invited to someone's home for dinner when I was here.  The owners are very warm and want to make you are as happy as possible while providing great-tasting and comforting food.
