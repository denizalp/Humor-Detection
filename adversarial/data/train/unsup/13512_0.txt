Originally I was going to give Sun Devil Stadium a 3-star, but as I gathered my thoughts, I decided to break my rule of not giving any other college football stadium a 5-star, but this was an extraordinary circumstances (Hurricane Katrina).  In addition, to this day, my buddy and I constantly rate this as our favorite LSU road game of all time, and we've been to almost all of the stadiums in the SEC and i've been to few Pac 10 stadiums when I lived in Cali.\n\nThe game I attended was LSU vs Arizona St game in 2005.\n\nThe game was originally supposed to be played in Tiger Stadium but was moved to Sun Devil Stadium the Monday before the game because LSU's basketball stadium, across the street from Tiger Stadium, was being used as a makeshift hospital in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nOfficially the logistics of holding such a big event are not easily planned.  You have police needing to coordinate game day traffic, stadium security, concessions, volunteers to work the stadium, etc.  Given the time to get ready, 4 days, I think the staff at Sun Devil Stadium\/Arizona State did an incredible job of hosting this game.  Not only that, they had volunteers collecting money for Hurricane relief.  \n\nAnother plus feature of Sun Devil Stadium.  They painted the endzones to dedicate the state of Louisiana, they played LSU's pregame video, and they flew out The Golden Band from Tigerland.  To top it all off, Arizona St, donated the proceeds of the game for Hurricane Relief specifically towards student relief. \n\nThe game ended up being decided late in the 4th qtr, a FG block return for a TD, a punt block return for a TD, and a 60+ yd bomb from JaMarcus Russell (bless his NFL career) on a 4th and 12 were the differences in the game.\n\nBest part of the trip though, Friday night in Tempe.  Friendly and HOTTTTTTTT coeds of Arizona State.  A lot of people think UGA girls are hot, but damnnnnnnnn Arizona State girls are tops in the US.  (I would have loved to attend the 2008 UGA vs ASU game in Tempe).\n\nThat Friday night was easily Top 10 nights ever for my life.\n\nWe were sad to find out that LSU\/ASU postponed the series, and the fact LSU isn't scheduled to play in Tempe until the 2016 season, which would put me at 35 years of age.  \n\nCan't wait to do \"The Creep\", in Tempe, in 5 years ( http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tLPZmPaHme0 )
