I normally don't like writing reviews for places that obviously don't need another one when it has 4.5 out of ~1500 reviews, but this tiny bar is truly special. Even when the wait is on average 1.5-2 hours, no matter when you come. My tip is eat a snack while you stand in line, and take turns w\/ your friends. Oyster Bar made me appreciate and fall in love w\/ oysters. It took me 24 long years to acquire the taste for them. But this hidden (or maybe not no hidden bar now) did the trick. The MOST AMAZINGLY FRESH oysters....add a hint of horseradish, cocktail sauce, and lemon juice... Wabam! You have the most  mouthwatering, orgasmic blend of gooeyness. I know that doesn't sound nearly as pleasant as it tastes. The combo pan roast and linguini and clams are to die for. Everything else like the gumbos, chowders, and pan roasts are good, but these are by far the standouts. This little bar is the only reason the Palace Station hotel attracts people younger than 60.\n\nWarning: Don't come when you're famished. Be prepared to always wait in line since there's only about 16 chairs. But you will enjoy one of the most delightful seafood meals ever.
