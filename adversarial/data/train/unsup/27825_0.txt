I play softball here and it's a great park. Clean for the most part, batting cages, indoor soccer, kids play ground, and two buildings that have bars and a little food place. Usually the normally park fair with hotdogs, burgers, pretzels, fries, and drinks. Although a little expensive for food, it's actually not bad and with those dollar off coins they give you it can be a treat if you save up those coins as you can used as many of the coins as you have. The batting cages are great, my only concern is that sometimes the balls don't roll back to the hopper and you won't get any balls pitched to you, but if you let the park know they Will return the balls to the hopper and get you another round of pitches. Usually 20 pitches per coin which are a dollar each. Playing is fun and players are there to have fun and just have a good time. There are some bogus calls from the umps but hey it's a game and nothing's perfect. All in all I come here every week to play games and love it here.
