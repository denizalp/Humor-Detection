Rip Off Alert! I asked the salesperson if they could bring back the new shine on my headlights. The lights had become faded and a there was a very faint yellowish hue. She told me they could do it for $60. Sounded like a decent deal considering my mechanic explained it would be $200. When my car was finished the headlights looked basically the same. They were shiny but still slightly yellow. I asked to speak to the salesperson from earlier. She came over and I explained how the lights looked the same. She called one of the detailers over and talked to him about it. He raced off and quickly returned with a rag and a tube of some impressive looking cleaning substance. He began scrubbing away. He was rubbing those lights at 100 miles an hour and he two of us were just standing there watching him. It was so demeaning. I felt terribly uncomfortable watching this poor guy slave away in the hot sun. He kept looking up at us as if he was looking for our approval of his hard work. She said to me \"it's looking better right\"? At this point what am I supposed to say? She then explained how the only way to really get rid of that yellow haze was to open up the headlight casing and clean it out from the inside. And how I would have to take it to a mechanic for that. I finally had enough and just wanted to go home.  All in all, a miserable experience. On a positive note - at least I managed to avoid the windshield repair guys and several years of hard sell phone calls from their miserable company.
