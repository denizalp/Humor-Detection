Very rude staff. Slow little to no communication between the team. Very grumpy short responses from multiple staff. \n\nThen they kept getting orders wrong and had the nerve to argue with a lady about it. Causing the line to go slower...don't argue make it right. \n\nStarbucks NYNY was very disappointing today. Wouldn't recommend coming back to this one.
