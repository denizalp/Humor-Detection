OHH MYYYY GAWWWWW - I might be in love. When Gallo Blanco moved out of the Claredon, my heart broke a little as flavor left downtown. Ocotillo filled that empty spot and I have no doubt that I will visit their establishment with a frequency that might border on stalking. The space is amazing, the food (I ordered the Thai Chicken) was an explosion of flavor. I can't wait to do Happy Hour as the drink menu looked great. All in all, I pondered giving a 1 star review just so I can keep the goodness of this place all to myself. But alas, that wouldn't be fair. So, do it - go there and bask in the glory of flavor.
