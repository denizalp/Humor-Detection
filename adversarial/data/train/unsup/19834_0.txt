New to the area and was in search of an AYCE sushi spot. Their website looked good. Mmmm, sashimi, rolls, tempura?! YES!!\n\nNO!!! This \"buffet\" was absolutely FOUL. Way smaller than an average buffet and it reminded me of a wannabe Sizzler. The \"sashimi\" consisted of salmon and tuna which were hard and visibly old. Cut \"rolls\" were a bunch of miniscule ingredients stuffed in a tiny round wheel of hard ass rice. One even had a hair in it! So fucking nasty. I tried the ceaser salad, overcooked green beans and a sliver of pork loin. Crap, crap, crap! \n\nWhat a waste of money. I've never felt so dupped in my life!! \n\n*************FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!***********
