I am one of those unlucky types with phones... \nglad Josh thought my phone was in pretty good shape despite its messed up, almost coming-off screen and that the screen is repairable\/replaceable! Alleluia! It was back to new in less than two hrs-promised time with not even a long wait. I am thankful to the guys back there having the best times of their lives making other people happy by fixing one of the major necessities of life.
