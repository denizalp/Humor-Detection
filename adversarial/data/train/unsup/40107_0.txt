I order from this location twice a week for my family dinners with wife and kids \nFood is delicious \nservice is great\nSchnitzel dinner I highly recommend my family loves the chicken and beef kebabs. \nTheir sandwiches have a lot more meat then all the other shawarma\/kebab restaurants in the area \nThey deliver as well which most restaurant in the area don't \nOverall I'd rate this place #1 in Thornhil and north York
