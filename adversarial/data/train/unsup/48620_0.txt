It has now been another 3 months for a total of 6 months that I have lived ere and have yet to have my patio ceiling fixed, and my bedroom cracks fixed...add to it now I have water spots in my ceiling. \n\nI am beyond frustrated, I've put in numerous work orders, about this and apparently a contractor has to come to my apartment.\n\nOn the plus they did fix my dishwasher, after which they merely looked at the damages in my ceiling and told me about the contractor who was on site that day, well I never got a visit about my ceiling.\n\nIf I could leave a half a star I would.
