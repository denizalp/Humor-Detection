This is my first time here. I wanted a good breakfast that was actually cooked and not just thrown together. I found this place on Yelp and decided to take a very short trip off the strip. This place is truly the best breakfast I have had in all of my trips to Vegas. \nI had the Curtis which is a pleather of hash browns then two fluffy biscuits go on top of that. The gravy is poured on top and then two scrambled eggs make this the bomb! The sausage patties on the side are like icing on a cake. This place works hard on making sure you are satisfied and that the food is done right. \nAnd when you think you are done, they have a cinnamon roll that is worthy of being on a page by itself. They mix the cinnamon in into the flour to make it so that the cinnamon doesn't over power you like most when the put it on the outside of the cinnamon roll. The icing is so creamy and has just the right sweetness. \nI definitely will be back on my next visit.
