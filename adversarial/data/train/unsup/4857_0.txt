The trick is to get here at odd hours to avoid waiting in line.  For instance, on new years day around 11:30 am for brunch when the rest of Vegas is still sleeping or just going to bed. Who knew you could have prime rib for breakfast?  and crab legs and cocktail shrimp!  Yum.  I tried hot chocolate there for the first time too and it was really good.  Hot chocolate with crab?  yeah... that's my new brunch combo... \n\nAnyway, I've been here several times, meaning everytime I go to Vegas, we end up eating here.  Once I think I waited two hours to eat dinner and didn't get in until 10 pm!  That was on my birthday so it was a bit dissappointing and I was faint before we got in.\n\nThe food is usually good when I go.  Desserts are good.  Prime rib - ah.. I love prime rib.  Well I still don't know why we bother paying so much money to stuff ourselves.  I end up running to the gym (or the bathroom) after eating so much....
