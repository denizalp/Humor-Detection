Hands down best soul food joint I've had yet. There are still a couple I haven't tried in Vegas. So as of now this place takes the lead!\n\nThey are voted \"Best soul food restaurant in Las Vegas\" and they do live up to that reputation. When you first walk in, it's kind of small but had a homey comfy feel. The ladies there were very warm and welcoming. Advising us we can take a seat where ever we feel comfortable. Service was excellent. Someone came and got our drinks and order real quick.\n\nI ordered the smothered chicken, white meat. It comes with 3 sides & also cornbread. I got -- mashed potatoes, greens, & Mac n cheese. And oh my goodness. The mashed potatoes were one of the best I ever had. Idk what they put in it but it was so creamy and the gravy accented the mashed potatoes just right. The greens were pretty alright, nothing special about them though. Mac n cheese was da bomb! It had just the right amount of cheesiness. Now let me tell you about the chicken! The chicken was perfection. Even tho it was fried, it wasn't dry, it was so moist! I do recommend getting the white meat instead of dark because it does make a difference on the taste. \n\nThe beau got the chicken and waffles. It doesn't come with sides but it does come with 3 chicken wings, eggs (your choice of how it's cooked) & comes with corn bread as well. The portions are large so he could barely finish his 3rd chicken. He loved and thought the chicken was delicious as well. \n\nI'm impressed with this restaurant & will probably return when I need a little Soul in me. Lol
