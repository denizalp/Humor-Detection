Seriously, South Side?! Your chicken caesar salad has exactly three components: Salad, chicken, and dressing. (Well, ok, five if you count croutons and parmesan cheese). On TWO different occasions, you left out one of the main components. Keep in mind, this was done with takeout orders, where you want to have an easy experience with no hassle. Instead you caused me more hassle.\n\nThe first time you left out the chicken. Fail! I called and luckily I live right down the street so I came back and you gave it to me. Damn straight I got my chicken! I didn't pay $8.50 for romaine lettuce.\n\nThe second time was last night. You forgot the dressing! And I didn't want to be a total bitch and come back demanding it. But that dressing is frickin' good, and by the way, it's not a caesar salad without that dressing.\n\nNext time I'm half-expecting you to forget the lettuce.\n\nSo, I'm torn. It's cheap and fast to order takeout from you guys, and the food tastes good, but half the time you get the order wrong (and one time you'd forgotten to make it and started it when I got there). Don't take advantage of those people who live down the block and can come back for the shit you forgot! A more demanding person would have made you come to my house to give me what you forgot. Or given me something for free.\n\nSomebody just needs to get their act together over there.
