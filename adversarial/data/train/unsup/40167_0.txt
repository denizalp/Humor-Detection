it's ok. i like that barre3 is central in the city and the studio is bright and spacious. the instructors are nice and they encourage people to work at their own level vs. pushing you too hard to do the moves exactly as they should be done. \n\ni have a personal issue with feet and i find them disgusting. barre3 doesn't have a mandatory sock policy and i'm not sure how often the disinfect their balls, but people put their feet on the balls in every class and tbh i'm probably never going to come back here because of my personal neurosis. \n\nalso as a general note about their workout- it's definitely LESS ballet than what i prefer when it comes to barre. i feel like a lot of their workout you can just get from an online YouTube video vs. paying for the class.
