Absolutely horrible experience I wouldn't wish on any child or any parent. Lazy staff, uncaring, not loving and incompetent. There seems to be something off about the director as well. Very cold.\nI enrolled my son and he attended a total of 2 days before I ultimately removed him. One of the teachers accidentally voice recorded herself yelling and speaking very aggressively to my 18 month old son on day 2. Apparently he has spit up on himself and she was scolding him, yelling and using profanity. She texted me the voice recording by accident and when I opens the voice text and heard the way my son was being treated my heart sank and I felt physically il from disgust. The schools director refunded my money and we removed my son. To the best of my knowledge the teacher was not fired. This was over a year ago and we've since found a loving and wonderful school for my son. It still bothers me to this day thinking back to the experience. It feel it's my due diligence to warn others about this place. Stay away!
