Ordered Curbside TOGO for an Oreo cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, key lime cheesecake, and a Snickers bar cheesecake. Yummy!!!! They are open on Saturdays despite what it says here on the app! Curbside quoted me about 25 minutes, However it took longer than 25 minutes for my order to be delivered to my car, almost an hour. Ordered at approximately 8:24pm and finally received my cheesecakes at 9:15pm. The curbside waitress was polite and explained to us that the dessert orders were insane tonight so we understood! Cheesecakes were yummy though! :)
