Don't get your heart set on any one dish here, because chances are, they'll be out of it. I have come by more than once when my first choice dish was unavailable. Perhaps they don't stock certain meats because they don't get much business, but I haven't noticed a consistent trend as to which items are out.\n\nThe fried catfish was just okay- lots of peppers and onions, good amount of basil, but spicier than expected. The three-color curry is hyped as being \"only available here!\", but the version at Le Thai is a bit better, this one was watery. I keep wanting to try their green curry fried rice, but it has been out twice now- which is baffling, considering they still obviously serve both rice and curry.\n\nHeads up, the spice scale is wonky- it's one to four, and a two is hotter than expected. I guess the choice is none or too much? No clue.
