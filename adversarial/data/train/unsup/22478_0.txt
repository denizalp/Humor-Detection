One of the rare times I indulge in restaurant food is for breakfast, and I wanted to try Taco Bell's new breakfast menu. I pulled into the drive-thru at 7:20 a.m., and all the inside and outside lights were on, including the drive-thru menu's, but the only person working was the guy power-washing the sidewalks--nobody home even though there were signs everywhere advertising that the place was now open for breakfast! I headed to my office dejectedly and checked the website to find out this location doesn't open until 9 a.m. If you're going to serve a breakfast menu, please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater, especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours. I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years, and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food, but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows, this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner, either, unless you're in a real time crunch.
