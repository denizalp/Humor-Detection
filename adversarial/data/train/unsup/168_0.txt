Yeah. It's a solid asteroid of a star. Would give a half star - but Yelp sezs I have to leave a review. \nThey look like they are trying to revamp the airport--for over a year -- but nothing has changed since the last time I was here. Heck of a contractor - like to see how they pulled the contract over Skyharbor's already blind eyes. Just milking these guys. \nBig low score for TSA. Lines like Newark. The best part: they have TSA precheck - in fact, you can sign up for this premium service at the airport. They will take you information, your money ..... O yeah, just informed by the TSA agents that there is no such thing as TSA precheck in Phoenix.  Yup. They got the signs, they got the guy just took your money - but there is no precheck line. As a result - the lines just build and build.\nReturning a rental car is the worst. The rental agency is located far off the airport campus - I think it is near an oasis of some sort. But no matter, it will take you an extremely long time to return the car due to poor signage (especially if traveling from Tuscon), then you have to wait for the bus, then get the grand surprise of waiting in line for TSA....followed by the sight of non-existent construction. I think Phoenix never rose from the ashes - instead their airport never got out of the mud of this pigsty. This place reminds me of Detroit's old airport or Philly - everything is old, dank, and sticky.
