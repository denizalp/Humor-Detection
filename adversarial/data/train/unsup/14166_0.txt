If I could give this business ZERO stars I would. I have an account here and have faithfully been paying on my debt. My payment was due on 8\/30 with a 5 day grace period, well they did not take the holiday on Monday into consideration (which is bullshit). The payment was due by yesterday 9\/4 I was thinking I would be fine, due to the holiday to make it today 9\/5. But no, apparently the account has already been sent to an attorney for review and they say they can garnish my wages. Then my boyfriend calls to find out the \"real story\" of what happened and they disclosed all information on my account. They have violated the FDCPA and I am not too happy about this. It is a good thing I work for a man that has been in the collection business for a very long time and knows exactly what to do and knows of attorneys who can help me with this situation. I will be working with him and suing this company for violating my rights as a debtor. This company is the worst company I have ever had to deal with.
