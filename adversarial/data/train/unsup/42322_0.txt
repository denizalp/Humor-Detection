Sometimes getting lost is the best way to find amazing treasures hidden in a city. I'm still new here so finding cute little ice cream shops like Melt is fantastic. Though it was $3 for a miniscoop, the ice cream I tried was really creamy & tasted fresh. Which is a lot to say considering most ice cream shops tend to keep theirs frozen for a minute. \n\nI recommend the Chop Suey. It had walnuts & berries in vanilla cream. I'm not a sweet tooth type of person so this was a perfect blend for me. They come in these cute little fortune cups!
