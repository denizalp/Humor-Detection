Came here for Encore beach club night swim. This place is a SCAM!!! Stay away. $100 admission for guys, $75 to rent a locker, $10 tiny Fiji waters... Way to take care of your customers that make this place mildly successful. Not to mention EXTREMELY rude and disrespectful male staff members. Talking and treating women so rudely while holding us in line for over an hour. Teach your employees some respect, Wynn. You sure as hell are making enough money to hire decent human beings.
