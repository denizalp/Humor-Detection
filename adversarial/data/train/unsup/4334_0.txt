Wish we could give negative stars. It is what this spa should be rated for! I bought groupon for this place. First, most time you call, you get message. After I finally made the appointments, they cancalled them twice in a role and both times, they called Friday afternoon when the appointments were Saturday. It is impossible at the time for us to make appointment with other places. When I finally got the massage last week, it was such a disappointment. The total hands on time was less than 30 minutes. The therapist spent most of her time stretching sheets, walking around the table and who knows what. To top all these, the owner Jim Lankes is the most rude and unprofessional business owner I have ever encountered. The front desk gave me his email so I email him to let him know about my experience. He must really hate it when customer complains because he immediately cancelled all my scheduled appointments by email with no reasons explained at all. When I read other reviews, I realized I was not the only one. Do not buy their groupons and do not go there!!!! There are so many good places you can spend your hard making money to enjoy a good massage. Avoid this place at all cost!!!!
