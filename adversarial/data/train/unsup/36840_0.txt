Very delicious. Large plates. I ordered the chicken and spinach cannelloni. We also ordered Caesar salads. My food and everyone's was delicious.  Very fast service as well.  We were in a time crunch to get to our shared ride in 12 minutes and were able to finish her food, get our check, and then proceed to the Uber stand!  Even though it says it's only 2 $'s it's a little closer to the three $'s. With all that in mind remember it's enough to feed two people.
