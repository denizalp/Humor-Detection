OK, OK... I finally went and ate at a Hooters while I was on a business trip.  Their supposedly best hot wings aren't even close to being the best.  The food wasn't all that either...  Sure, there's pretty girls prancing around with their old school bright orange old school NBA short shorts, but it doesn't make the food taste any better. Then again, I guess you don't really go to Hooters for the food. =P\n\nRecommendations: N\/A
