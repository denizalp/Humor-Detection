My family and I had a fabulous dinner at Grotto!  It was my birthday and we received excellent service!  Our waiter, Steven, couldn't have been any nicer and was very attentive!  I ordered the Herb Roasted Chicken Pizza and a mixed green salad!  Both were very yummy!!!  The rest of my party were very happy with their selections as well!  The night was topped off by a wonderful, huge slice of cheesecake!  We will definitely be back on our next visit to Las Vegas!!!
