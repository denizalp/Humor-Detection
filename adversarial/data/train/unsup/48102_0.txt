I was really excited to check this place out based on their perfect reviews. I didn't have to wait since I came on a Monday, which was really nice for a change. The gentleman that did my gel manicure was great. He was very detail oriented and took his time taking care of me. He didn't get frustrated at all when I asked him to round out my nails a little more or fix the polish job on a couple nails.  I love my gel mani go see Joe! \n\nI was eager to get my pedicure done as I was in need of a good foot massage after moving all weekend. I asked for the #2 pedicure. The description says 10 min massage and then hot stone after. The lady massaged me for 5 min, and then did hot stones for 2.5 min.  Yes I timed it.  The way I read the pedicure description I was expecting 10 min massage & then hot stones after. Maybe I caught her on an off day, I don't think all of the nail techs do this.  Just like any paying customer we expect to receive what we order from the menu. :(\n\nOverall the quality of the polish job and mani\/pedi was good and everyone was very friendly! I was just bummed about my shortened massage during my pedicure.
