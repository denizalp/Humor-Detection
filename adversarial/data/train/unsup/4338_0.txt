Shocking news... Joi B is giving an airport a 4-star review (is this a first? Possibly). Well, it *is* tooted as \"America's Friendliest Airport\" and they don't lie! I like friendly airports!\n\nOh yeah, I like this airport a whole hell of a lot. \n\n-extremely easy to navigate between gates in the terminal \n-super fast check in (just about as fast as Kansas City, which is a much smaller airport) \n-courteous security personal and getting past it is a breeze. I didn't even mind them throwing out my open bottle of water that I stupidly forgot to take out of my bag (I guess they are trained so that this airport lives up to its reputation. St. Louis Airport: you need to send your security personnel to train in Phoenix).\n-adequate food and beverage choices pre- and post security gate \n-bright and sparkling clean environs (Yeah, so it's dated. At least it's not dated and dingy. It also seems in keeping with a lot of the design styles I've encountered in my 5 days in Phoenix).\n-good amount of bathrooms, clean and no lines\n-gate\/flight info is easy to find anywhere\n-stunning view of the landscape from the wall of windows at the end of Gate D\n-baggage area is clearly labeled and easy to navigate \n-good signage all over\n-there are tiny finches instead of rats hopping along on the floor looking for food (At LaGuardia, you're far more likely to find the latter...oh and btw I mention this because one just ran past my feet and my instinct was to jump up out of my seat. But imagine my delight upon seeing a cute bird instead of a filthy rodent! Woohoo!!)\n\nSpending time airports is a regular occurrence for me and I dare say that this time has been a pleasurable experience.\n\nOnly negatives: Not enough outlets (as is typical, SWA provides those uncomfortable bars you can sit at to plug in). Internet may be free but it's hella slow. At least it was today.\n\nReading what some other people say about having to connect here and navigate the terminals, I'll hold back a star in case I ever have to deal with this inconvenience (and knowing my luck and past experience with airports, it's bound to happen).
