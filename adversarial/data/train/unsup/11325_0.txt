I can't tell if Fred's Not Here or there is simply an absence of a head chef and customer service. \n\nUpon sitting down with our large party, we were rushed the whole time. We were told it was going to be a busy night since its Winterlicious and they were having two dinner time slots. Reasonable explanation had the restaurant been not half empty. \n\nFirst course was the famous Baked crab and lobster bisque. It contained no meat. My puff pastry was deflated like Pamela Anderson's implants. The bisque was completely overpowered with hot sauce and continues to burn my stomach as I write this scathing review. \n\nThe steak frites had been over cooked well done steak as did every person at my table. I am going to speculate they pre-cooked every steak up to a certain point and reheat the steaks. My sides included exactly 4 green beans and 3 sliced mushrooms. \n\nThey re-cooked my steak that I ordered Medium Rare and this time instead of well done was Medium Well. I let this slide. \n\nThe whole 2 hours, water was never refilled once. At about 8pm we were told that we needed to go and that other diners have been waiting 10 minutes. \n\nAs we were walking out, we did not see a single soul in sight. I guess the people waiting were all named Fred. The restaurant was 30% full at this point, on a Saturday night. I guess our waiter got his 18% gratuity for a large party and really didn't care if he provided excellent service or not.\n\nDo not come here. Do not recommend. \n\nService 1\/10 \nFood 2\/10\nRestaurant Name 10\/10
