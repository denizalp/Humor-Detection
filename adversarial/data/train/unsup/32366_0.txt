We took our son to this ER for a simple stomach virus. They did such a thorough job that they found a tumor in his chest. The radiologist saw an enlarged thymus from the X-ray. If she had not done such an amazing job we may have found it too late. I will forever be thankful to the Doctors that did their job that day. We have a huge scar as a reminder but also a beautiful, sweet boy still with us.
