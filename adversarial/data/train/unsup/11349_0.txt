The only reason why I came here was because 1 of my friends was dying to go and DJ AM was spinning. I had an ok time but I'm sure it could've been better. The line was HUGE but luckily my friend is a local and got us in quick. Cover is $30. Drinks start at $12. Bartenders not so nice, at least not on the first floor. I recommend to get a spot upstairs with either bottle service or if you can't afford that then they have a bar up there. You get a good view of the whole club. I really enjoyed being up there because it's a lot more private and you can dance with your group instead of drunk and sweaty people downstairs. We got there very very late about 2am so of course everyone was wasted so people were throwing up left and right. Ughh GROSS! But then my friend threw up so he got escorted out and of course we had to follow. Good Times!
