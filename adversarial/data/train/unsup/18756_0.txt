Downtown LV is trying so hard to be Hipster central....and it's working!  Joining the neighborhood is the new hipster ramen shop, Itsy Bitsy :) \n\nWith modern decor and somewhat uncomfortable\/disturbing artwork, but also a slew of punny and well-named cocktails and cute brass colored bar chairs, this place fits right in to the DTLV scene. Service was friendly, and the staff were all very young and enthusiastic! \n\nHowever, the ramen was just mehhhhhhh. The soy egg it came with was way too salty, and the toppings were stingy. The noodles were ok, not as bouncy as I usually like them, and the broth was overall just ok. I got the thick noodles with tonkatsu broth plus spicy meat. The spicy ground pork was nice, but the char sui pork was almost all fat and had little flavor. \n\nWe did order the pork potstickers to share, which was probably the highlight of the meal. The skin had nice texture and the bottoms were nice and crispy. However the filling wasn't anything to be excited about. \n\nAlso, weird thing...the sinks for the bathrooms are outside? \n\nOverall, I would NOT drive into downtown just for this ramen, but if I was already here, I wouldn't mind coming again.
