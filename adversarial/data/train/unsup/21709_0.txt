Excellent products, friendly front desk staff & inexpensive pricing. You see results the following day! It was incredibly tempting to purchase the 10 session package, where you can mix and match different treatments. However, the professionalism of the esthetician\/ massage therapist (whatever she was) was incredibly lacking. I don't think I can step foot here again.
