I'm still not completely sold on this place, but it is definitely growing on me. And that has everything to do with dogs. I love that this place is dog friendly. They even have Yappy Hour - happy hour for you and your four-legged BFF! Yappy Hour is a really fun event and a great way to spend some time benefiting from happy hour deals while also spending quality time with my little critter - and mixing and mingling with other doggies and their owners. I so wish more places in Vegas would do similar events.
