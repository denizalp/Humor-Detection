I haven't had Indian food in years. Although I've never been to the other location, I can say this location is pretty new and cozy. We got seated pretty quickly on a Sunday evening and server was very attentive. \n\nSince I haven't had Indian food in such a long time, I had my friend recommend me some dishes. I ordered the buttered chicken masala and garlic naan bread, which was very delicious! Especially dipping that naan bread in the masala! I ordered a spice level of 6 but it wasn't too spicy, so maybe next time I'll keep that in mind and go up to a 7 or 8 spice. The wrong order came out for mine an the server took care of it quickly and gave me the correct order which I really appreciated. At the end of our meal, we all ordered lassi togo! All my friends ordered the mango lassi and I decided to try to rose lassi. The rose flavor wasn't too strong, it almost just tasted like plain yogurt, but I didn't mind! I tried the mango which is what I'll probably be ordering next time. But be aware, the lassi is extremely filling! That's why my friend recommended to order it last and take it togo so that we didn't get full in the middle of our meal.\n\nI can't wait to come back and try their lunch buffet as I've heard many good things about it!
