It has been said to put \"Eat Chocolate\" on a list of things to do today, that way you will at least be able to cross one thing your list. I would like to tell you to make it JinJu. Best chocolate game in town.\n\nJin Caldwell is a master chocolatier who has paid her dues and learned from some of the best...now Las Vegas gets to benefit from that hard work! She maintains the old school European chocolate quality but also supplies a beautiful variety of novel combinations. Her original creations range from whimsical to bold and are nearly always tasty. I am a stuck-in-my-ways dark chocolate fan, but Jin even makes me slow down and sample her milk chocolate options simply because her work is that good.  And speaking of dark chocolate, JinJu is the only place in Nevada where you can purchase the single source Fortunato 4 series. This series is one of the better single source dark chocolates I've had the pleasure to taste.\n\nJinJu's peanut butter cups are one of the more popular items in the store.  They are certainly a great option.  I can also confidently recommend the following truffles and bonbons:\nHoney \nFleur de Sel Caramel Truffle\nTahitian Cream\nVanilla Dream\nFig-Red Wine\n72% Dark\n...and the following items:\nGluten Free Brownie\nMilk Toffee Almonds\nWhite Chocolate Raspberry Rocher\nChocolate Covered Almonds\n\nI read that, \"There's nothing better than a friend...unless it's a friend with chocolate.\"  So do you part to make the world a better place and share some chocolate today!
