I had the pleasure of attending the YEE here recently.  I enjoyed the food and made plans then to come back.  I brought the wife along as like me she lives Asian cuisine.\n    We started out with the Siu Mai and Szechuan Dumplings.  The Siu Mai were tasty and seemed much larger than other places.  The dumplings were perfect and not too spicy.\n  For the main course we had the Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef and Wuhu Beef Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai was the least favorite thing we ordered.  The noodles were stuck together and it had a sour taste.  The Beef Fried Rice was very good.  Lots of great tasting beef paired with the tasty fried rice.  The Mongolian Beef was well prepared with tensor beef and veggies.  The sauce was a great compliment to the delicious dish.  \n   We had some leftovers and added a few item for our daughter.   Got her the Tonkotsu Ramen, Walnut Shrimp and Pot Stickers.  She loved the Walnut Shrimp and Pit Stickers.  The Ramen was very good also as I gave it a try.  She didn't share the shrimp or pot stickers! \n    Being in a casino is kind of a problem for me as I don't care for the smoke walk to get to a restaurant.  The good thing is the Silverton is not that bad compared to many casinos.  The prices at Wuhu are very good and what you get will please your Asian food cravings.  They have a variety of food from all over Asia.  It is well prepared with fresh ingredients.  This is not a high end place but you get good food and it comes to your table pretty fast.  If I am in the area I will definitely come back.
