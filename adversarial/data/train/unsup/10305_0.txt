Brunch is a disgusting cultural fetish and I hate people who go to brunch, and I also love brunch. So I usually hate the people in the restaurant, resent the decor, nitpick about the food, and go home in a epidermal stew of self-loathing.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe Federal brunch is so good I didn't hate myself or anyone\/thing even a little. Smoked trout and eggs benedict shared - hooray! I love my friends I love hollandaise sauce let's just *drink caesars and gab*.
