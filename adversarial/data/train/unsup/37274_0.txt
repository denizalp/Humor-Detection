I really need to visit these guys sometime.  I usually order breakfast from work from Eat24.com.\n\nLove it, always straight up legit good food.  Their breakfast sliders are awesome, one of the guys at work doesn't order anything else besides the Sourdough breakfast sandwich (with bacon and pepperjack cheese, the pepperjack really pulls it together).  And their homefries are awesome.\n\nWe tried the smoothies the other day, and besides a few cases of brain freeze, they were pretty good.
