If you are even THINKING about shopping here, please read some of the \"38 reviews for Vistek Toronto that are not currently recommended\" near the bottom of the page.  If ANY other place in the world has what you want, why would you buy from Vistek?\n\n......................\n\nThey've got some high end stuff that you can't get elsewhere - and they treat you like they've got you over a barrel.\n\nI walked in there with $3,000.00 cash in hand to buy a lens and I got spoken to (by the assistant manager) like I was a piece of crap that you would wipe off the bottom of your shoe.\n\nI've NEVER been treated that way by ANY other staff at ANY other camera store.\n\nI gave them my money that day after requesting a discount because of their disrespect (and because they had a sale on that took their price below their competition), but they will never get any more of my business (unless they are the ONLY choice).\n\nPS:  I repeat - If you are even thinking about shopping here, PLEASE, do yourself a favor and read all the 1 and 2 star reviews at the bottom of the page under \"38 reviews for Vistek that are not currently recommended\"\n\nPSS:  I think ONE of the reasons why their staff is SO appalling is that (I'm pretty sure) they work on commission.
