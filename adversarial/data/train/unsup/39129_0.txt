I have been frequenting Senza Pelo Med Spa for the past few months strictly for hair removal services so that is the only item I will be reviewing. Stephanie has done my laser treatments on my under arms a couple of times. She is really friendly and knows what she is talking about. All of the girls do in the salon. Its run by Stephanie's mother, Maria I believe, who is a fun character who is seems very well experienced in the field. \n\nI did a lot of research before choosing the spa for my treatments because I wanted results if I was going to spend the money. I'm glad I chose who I did because the results have been great! And I have dark thick hair that grows back quick. After even the first under arm treatment the hair singed off a few days later and has not grown back the same ever sense. It's far and few between. Now four treatments in I shave my under arms maybe once a week and that's rare. So I highly reccomend this treatment for those seeking comfort for their under arms. \n\nI really like the location of the spa it's right in the middle of my work and my home on 19th ave however their parking is limited and difficult to get into. They have parking on the side but its often full as well. Although the girls inside are nice and helpful. There have been a few times Steph was running behind and I had to wait 15-20 minutes extra to be taken back. I don't like to be a difficult client for people so I've always been understanding though I would like timely service especially when coming from work and want to get home. There has been two appointments where Steph even had to have another technician do my treatments so she could catch up but both turned out totally fine. One occasion I was even given a discount for waiting so long. \n\nSo there have been a few things maybe not so great in my experience with them but over all I'm very happy with my results in my underarms I am so glad to have gotten it done. I would reccomend it to anyone!
