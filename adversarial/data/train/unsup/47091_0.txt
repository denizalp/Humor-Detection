Food is great! The patio is one of the nicest parts to the place. Certain nights they have music outdoors. Chimnea fireplaces lit. Very dark. Great place to take out of town guests, or for date night. Inside it looks like an old Spanish hacienda. Have had steak, shortribs, gazbacho. All great. Good wine list.
