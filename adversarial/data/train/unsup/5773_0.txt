I came here to study. Thinking a library would be peaceful & quiet enough to concentrate. This library is rather unique..... out of all the people in here (mind you school just got out so there's a ton of kids) the ONLY people that are talking aloud (going on 20min straight now) are the damn librarians!!!!! Seriously guys? There's 2 up front just flapping away like a normal convo at a loud restraunt and 1 guy who keeps coming in and out of a door that leads to the back and letting it SLAM every time he passes through it. \nI expect this stuff from I'll behaved small children but for the librarians ?!?!??
