I work across the street from this place, it serves very consistent, tasty Chinese Food. I usually call in for takeout, but the dining in experience is very enjoyable. \n\nThey have very gracious hostesses\/cashier's. \n\nYou can't go wrong with their Chicken Fried Rice or Black Pepper Steak, those are my favorites. \n\nThey have your standard Chinese Food menu and it is nothing like a Panda Queen located in a strip mall, MUCH better than that nonsense. \n\nSide Note: If you want to see efficiency at its finest, go during lunch time and watch the two cashier's work their magic, they can do so many things at once it will seriously impress you.
