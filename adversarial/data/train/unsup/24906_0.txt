Ughhhhh, what a hot mess. I have only been to one other place so maybe this is typical for a recycle place but I will not be returning here.  The place has a dangerous in and out alley that barely fits one car. People have to park on the street and walk their cans in. I felt rushed and yelled at the whole time I was here, which was not that long. I was not paid appropriately with no receipt given to prove my trade. The workers did not speak english nor respond to my questions when I did speak their primary language. It just was not a good experience. The place 2 blocks away paid me more and did not have these issues, so no thanks.
