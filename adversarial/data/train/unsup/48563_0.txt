This was our first visit to Dolce. Upon arrival, we had to wait a few minutes before we were acknowledged though not a big deal as we could see that they were extremely busy. While we were waiting at the front desk, I overheard who the lady, was sorting out someones payment, saying \"this better not be a groupon thing - grrrrr\". \n\nOur waiter was extremely pleasant and patient while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive. He was also very knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu. The menu is quite different from other Italian restaurants we've been to - plenty of exciting dishes even for vegetarians... or so I thought until the waiter pointed out that almost all the dishes are cooked with chicken stock so VEGETARIANS BE AWARE of this. He said he'd ask the chefs to cook the pasta in water but I couldn't have the risotto as it was cooked in chicken stock. I had the Rotolini which is eggplant stuffed with ricotta and my husband had the spaghetti. The portions are generous but we found the food over salted & hence couldn't finish our food because of this. The rest in our group said their food was excellent and they thoroughly enjoyed their meal. \n\nI think this place is over priced and over crowded; my husband and I would have enjoyed the food if it wasn't over-salted. We may try it again, this time with a groupon coupon....let's see if we have a better dining experience then.
