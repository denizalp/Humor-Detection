The reason this buffet is so cheap is because it is understaffed, nearly unstaffed. I wouldn't be surprised to get food poisoning here. It is a ridiculous maze through the casino to reach the buffet, whereupon you're anti-greeted, especially if you don't have a players card. My drink server accused me of sneaking in, then served me drinks that had interesting bubble patterns...
