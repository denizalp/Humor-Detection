Recommended by a teammate because she knows I love South Indian food.  Trying the vuffet on my day off.  Parking is great..and easy to get to from highway.  restaurant is quiet because it is 30 mins before lunch buffet closing.  Nice greeting by hostess.  Buffet is very small....but restaurant is open just 2 days.  Trying everything on buffet.   Flavors are great.
