Fremont Street Experience is one of those 'you gotta do this before you leave Vegas' things in my opinion. It's old Vegas, pretty tacky but lots of history.... And everything is either free or crazy cheap. \n\nThere is an abundance of inexpensive booze, often sold in plastic footballs or yard glasses, lots of vendors selling everything from cheap Vegas souvenirs to spray paint artwork to your name on a piece of rice. And the people watching can not be beat. Drunk tourists face-planting on the sidewalk... religious freaks with huge signs... unsuspecting men trying to score with working girls... And that's just on a typical night! A lot of different events are held down on Fremont, from free concerts to holiday parties (St. Patrick's Day is a blast).\n\nA free light show displayed every hour or so on the canopy that covers the few blacks that make up the FSE. The show itself is pretty lame, older classic rock and cheesy graphics. Bands perform on the stages that are under the canopy most weekends, those shows tend to be far more entertaining.  \n\nIt's been a while since I have been down to Fremont, I hope to make it down there again soon to try out the ziplines!
