This place is a bit of a whole in the wall but I love it! The reason why I like it so much is because they have combo plates and they have bottomless Thai Iced tea. I hate ordering ala carte . I think if I order meat rice should come with it ..I just hate being nickle and dimed for everything. Whenever I eat here my Thai Tea never goes empty. Which \nI deeply appreciate after the service that I received at Basil n Lime the prior night. I'd much rather eat here even though it's not the fanciest place in town. They did upgrade their chairs from last time though ...looks much better! \n\nI started off with Tom Kar Kai ( Spicy Chicken Coconut Soup). It had chicken with coconut and mushrooms in a hot and sour soup with a touch of lemon grass. It was really good and it also got rid of my sore throat! Then I had their Sa-Te dinner combo which was served with cucumber salad, beef skewers, and shrimp fried rice. It was very tasty and the beef was tender. \n\nMy husband had a side of their Cucumber salad because he can't eat Thai food two times in a row. (We had to stop at Burger King for him before we came here.) I felt abnormal as he watched me eat but I'm sorry I needed my Thai fix satisfied! \n\nI like this Thai BBQ the best because I tried this other Thai BBQ on Flamingo but they didn't offer the bottomless Thai Tea. I'd rather drive further down the road to eat here!
