My friends and I had a great time on the 'old Montreal' walking tours.  We did both the east and west tours and found them enjoyable and informative.  Our guide JoAnn was extremely knowledgeable,sharing information on both historical as well as more recent events.  A few times she gave us a choice of what what we wanted to see - choosing between a couple of options.  The tour price was very reasonable.  A great value for the money!  Definitely recommend.
