I went here for the first time on a Sunday late morning.   Very cute place in historic downtown Chandler.  Very cool place to hang out and grab a coffee or another hot or cold drink.  They do have a lot of options here.  This place is laptop  friendly!  Saw many with theirs open working on whatever they were working on.   They have a selection of scones, muffins and quiche.  I got to try a bite of a muffin which was very good.  I think I was most impressed how fast they make the drinks.  The place got busy but the line was never very long which is great because some coffee places have only one line and the wait can be a while.  I was in line with two other and a second staff member came to take orders.   Julia Peixoto herself came over to check on our table so that was nice to meet the owner.  Very nice lady!
