My girlfriend and I had an amazing pre-show dinner experience here. Things started off great by being able to get a reservation morning of dinner plans. Followed by our wonderful server who was very knowledgeable about the menu items and very helpful by suggesting some of her favorite items. The bus staff was also amazing -- I never seemed to be able to have anything other than a full water glass, and used dishes were promptly removed.\n\nAt first glance this restaurant seems a bit pricey, but if you realize its a big name restaurant and its in a strip casino, prices aren't out of line. We enjoyed our food, cocktails, and loved the delicious dessert. I will definitely be returning!
