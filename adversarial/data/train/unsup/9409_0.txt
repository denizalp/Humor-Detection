The menu is extensive and I'm sure any vegan you take here will be happy and impressed with the options. However, the sandwiches are mostly lettuce and cost more than $11 - so that is never my order. I usually go for the dragon bowl or the veggie burger or the \"soul food\" mumbai plate - all of which I think are delicious.\n\nI've taken out of town visitors here who have been impressed with the menu - and they've enjoyed their meal! There is a nice terrace out the back for the summer months.\n\nI did have one ridiculous experience where I ordered the Chana Paratha, described in the menu as: spiced Indian flatbread topped with chana, sour cream, cilantro [now it seems to have changed to mint] & tamarind chutney. When it arrived with 2 cilantro leaves, I asked for a little more and they said they'd have to charge me .75cents. Sure, whatever. A plate arrived with one sprig of cilantro and another 2 leaves. At the same meal, they also charged us for extra dressing. The whole thing struck me as a little classless and a bit ridiculous; and having been a regular, kinda pissed me off. One star docked.\n\nThe food is good and creative but if you've been going here for a few years, then you may remember when the staff were friendlier, the portions more generous and the prices lower...\nSecond star docked.
