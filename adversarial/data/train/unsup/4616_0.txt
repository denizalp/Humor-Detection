I hate The Hub. It is just obnoxious. It all like \"I wanna look like I have nothing, but wanna pay through the nose for it!\". I mean the brand Deisel alone makes me irritated. It so \"I hate my life! Its so hard!\". Also the staff prertend to know the product, but if you ask enough good questions you'll find they know nothing more than you could have deduced. Eww. Yuck. gag.
