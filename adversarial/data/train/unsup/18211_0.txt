Dim Sum yum yum!! \n\nI always expect to spend about $60 when theres at least 3 people in the party. There's just so much to try. \n\nSugar cane shrimp ball, tendon, shumai, pork bun, sticky pork bun, roast duck, crispy noodles, bellpepper shrimp, etc etc. There's just too much sometimes! I mean, its like a dream! People pushing carts with delicious food! CMON! \n\nMy friends and family and, of course, my self love dim sum! This is one of our usual spots.\n\nDownfall of dim dum, you fight for that dumpling. Why? Cus is insanely delicious!, OK?\n\nBut hey, bad thing about this place....the girls seem to have a rod up their you know what. Every time I'm here, there is always tude. Not all, but the main faces seem to have that \"leave me the eff alone or I will send my stubbly scarred up men after you\" look while petting her ugly fat cat. \n\n4 stars for food, but 3 stars for the tude's and mean faces.\n\n\nOHOH, FYI!! Don't come here after 8pm like we did one night. It's super limited and there was no more tendon! *cries*
