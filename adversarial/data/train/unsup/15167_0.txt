Sunday brunch is BUSY!  We waited 25 mins for a table for 5.  This is the new location.  The place is packed and LOUD inside.  We were seated in the back.  \n\nThe table was a little sticky and the laminated menus were wet.  Our server greeted us immediately and took our drink orders.  The menu is simple and short, love it.  But I am with indecisive people.  The server had to come back twice before everyone decided on what to order.  \n\nI ordered the The Crying Pig omelet (Bacon, Sausage & Swiss cheese) and hash browns.  The omelet was a little over done on the edges but perfect in the middle.  The hash browns were good and greasy!  I ordered a 1\/2 order of the french toast to share with other person.  The 1\/2 piece I got tasted kind of burnt but the part that was not tasted great.  \n\nI am with Michael F. on this place 3 for the food and 4 for the service.  Overall 3.5 stars.
