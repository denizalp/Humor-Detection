Do NOT spend your money eating at Sura BBQ (corner of Spring Mtn and Arville).\n\n(Just so you know, I've never left a review on Yelp. This goes to show just how bad this experience was, enough for me to actually write this.)\n\nWe went there as our final meal together before flying back to NYC on a red-eye flight tonight. We've been pretty loyal customers, as that has been our go-to Korean BBQ buffet in Vegas ever since they opened nearly a decade ago.\n\nWe were happily eating as my mom was cutting our galbi\/short-ribs (yes, in Vegas you cut your own meat). She has been cutting them into pieces the same exact way all my life, where you cut around the bone, without wasting the crucial parts of the meat. It's just easier to eat that way, you know?\n\nAll of a sudden, one of the waitresses, who claimed she had been spying on our meal, came over and threatened to add charges to our meal for \"wasting food\" and cutting our kbbq improperly. She then proceeded to show my mom how it should be done.\n\nThe waitress was essentially expecting us to eat every bit so that each bone is left lickin' clean. That's like going to an AYCE sushi place and getting charged for not eating every bit of rice on your plate.\n\nSo...\nMy parents are not the quiet type, lol. The waitress wouldn't leave us alone so my parents searched for the manager themselves since the waitress wouldn't grab the manager after my parents had requested.\n\nTo our utter surprise, the manager sided with the waitress and basically kicked us out. In a nutshell (minus all the other crap he told us), he tells my parents, \"Just get out if you don't want to eat here.\"\n\nHe also questioned us why we would only eat galbi and not the other types of meat provided. Hmm, well, the last time I checked, Sura BBQ is a BUFFET, where customers have the freedom to choose whatever they want to eat. And for the record, we were eating some of the other food selections, so his statement is inaccurate. If you're going to issue a limit on what we can or cannot eat, then why would you even call yourself a buffet?\n\nI am appalled at the customer service that we experienced tonight. It really was a traumatizing event, and you can be sure we are never going back.
