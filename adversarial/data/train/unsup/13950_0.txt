I had always loved In n Out, in fact, when I lived in Reno years ago, before they had In n Out, my friends and I would drive 2 hours to Sacramento on a Friday night JUST to get In n Out... \n\nBut, since moving to Phoenix, I have to say that Five Guys is really awesome. They take a little time to get your order ready, BECAUSE THEY COOK IT FRESH WHEN YOU ORDER IT. In n Out also takes pretty much that long... I don't know what kind of grill you work on that defies the laws of physics, but it takes a certain amount of time to properly cook meat...\n\nI would give Five Guys a leg up on In n Out BECAUSE they let you decide what's on the burger to a greater extent, they have mushrooms, A-1, and BACON! and the beef just tastes better IMHO. The grease is what makes it great! If you don't want a burger with grease, go buy a Boca burger and choke on it... seriously, because you don't love food if you think that and certainly don't know what you're talking about.\n\nTheir fries are pretty damn good and actually TASTE like you're eating a potato! Which is few and far between, TBH. \n\nSo, next time you are in the mood for a burger... THIS is the spot.. it's hearty, filling, perfect amount of a juicy, mouthwatering, foodgasm... :-)
