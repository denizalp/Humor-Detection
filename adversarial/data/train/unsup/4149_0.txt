Fantastic bar! All the arcades are free and they have a great selection. Was awesome getting down on some Area 51.\n\nThe craft beers were great and so are the cocktails. \nPersonally liked the Moxie's Mule the most out of them but haven't tried them all.\n\nThe food was also really good! Perfect hand to mouth food where you either can have one hand on a joystick or your drink and the other just snacking. The toasted ravioli was great, especially.\n\nWould definitely come back and can't wait till my next weekend to do so!
