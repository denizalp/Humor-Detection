Took my lil one here and got our game on.  It was happy hr so the 5 draft beers were all 3 bux which is nice.  Would like to see a better variety of style and ABV but it did the trick.  Select apps were discounted too but I didn't try any.  Next time.  Its 5.00 and you can play your ass off all day if ya want.  Pretty much every game I have ever heard of.  The place is decorated cool too.  Not hip and douchy like the rest of 25th now.  Only thing is I wish the 5.00 was discounted at happy hr too because that was most of the cost of the bill.  There were only 2 other people playing games in there when we were there.  I would go more often but 10.00 to walk in the door seems a tad high when the place is empty...
