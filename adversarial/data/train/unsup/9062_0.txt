I'm going to really show my age here and admit that I went to this show and liked it! Celine is still gorgeous and she can belt it out with the best of 'em. Easily one of the best female singers to see live. Unlike many other live performers, she can carry the show with just her voice. There's no need for gimmicks like stage pyrotechnics or a synchronize dance posse. If you want to see that go see Britney lip sync instead.\n\nTo me, the beginning portion of the show was the best part with her top hits from the early 90's (you know, her oldies but goodies that we can all sing the chorus to--The power of love, If you ask me to, It's all coming back to me now, Because you love me, etc). The middle was a bit of a sleeper with B-side filler stuff that I've never heard before followed by some miscellaneous cover songs from Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and others which were only ok. I would have rather hear her old hits though. During the short breaks for outfit changes and whatnots, there were pretty good filler acts. The live orchestra and cool stage effects throughout made the show even better.\n\nKnocking off 1 star cuz it was pretty pricey. Got the tickets about a month in advance and all the cheaper seats were already sold out. Paid $175 + $21 ticket masters service fee per person for seats in Orchestra 6. I think she had a tendency to go more towards the left side of the stage though (By left side, I mean HER left side as in her left when facing the audience), so tickets on the side of Orchestra 2 might have been slightly better for the same price. Although I loved the show, husband wasn't that into it but he's a dude. He started counting the number of bald people sitting in the audience in front of us. =P
