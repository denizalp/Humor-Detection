Indulge Burger is a fun place to stop & grab a bite.\n\nThey are a dog friendly place, with water bowls outside in the patio area.  We first started coming here when a coupon appeared in our mail box, and we've been back every few months.  \n\nThe food is generally good and they have a wide degree of choices.  The sweet potato fries, onion strings, and the garlic chips are great.  The burgers are in the $10 to $14 dollar range.  But they are very large one half of pound burgers.  That's why it important to remember to check for coupons before you come.  \n\nI just noticed after posting the above review that there is a current \"Yelp Deals -- $15 for $30 Deal at Indulge Burgers & More\"
