I used to have a difficult time sticking with a fitness program when going to a gym, then someone referred me take one of Debbie's classes at Dance Amor Fitness Total Body 3D.  I have been hooked ever since.  She has an energy about about her that just makes you feel welcome and have so much fun, regardless of how you look or your fitness level.  She has created something unique that cannot be experienced at a gym, she truly understands how to help people reach there health\/fitness goals in a safe manner with an awesome team of fitness experts behind her.  She offers a range of group fitness classes including R.I.P.P.E.D, Zumba, Zumba Kids, Zumba Kids Junior, Yoga, Urban Flow and Groove, TRX, Hip Hop.  It is honestly the best experience I have ever had and actually look forward to exercising now and actually stick with it.  I have personally had success with these classes.
