I'm not hipster enough to like this place. \n\nI get it. I'm a suburbanite. I'm not wearing vintage threads. Barista ladies and gents, I know you're cooler than me. But is my money not green enough for you?\n\nI stopped in to see what all the hype was about and after being treated very rudely, I ended up not ordering a darn thing. I don't expect Starbucks-like, corporate forced customer service, but a little eye contact would go a long way. I'm more like you hipster kids than you might think!\n\nMy fiance ordered a macchiato. He thought it was ok. But we were really made to feel so uncomfortable, we'll never go back. \n\nI had really high hopes for Rising Star so I was really let down. I guess I'll spend my money elsewhere.
