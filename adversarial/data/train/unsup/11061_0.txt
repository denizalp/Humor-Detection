Do yourself a favor and find another place to eat. This place is awful! Our experience started out bad and got worse-I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews. \n\nMy wife and I went there on a Sunday morning and were greeted with \"2?\" at the door, not \"good morning\", \"welcome\"...nothing. That would have required some interest from the two geniuses at the entry. \n\nAfter being seated at a table, which had crumbs all over the seats and table, we knew this was not going to go well. We sat for nearly 10 minutes, all the time watching the completely disinterested staff chat with each other....we left. \n\nThe best thing that could happen to this place is fire the staff and start over. If that doesn't work..close.
