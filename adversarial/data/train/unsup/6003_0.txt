Everything we need for home products,yard improvements, upscaping, making chicken coops and doggy doors.\n The staff is hit or miss. Either friendly and helpful or stupid and lazy, no in between.\n They sell outdoor plants, great selection, well cared for, and usually clearly marked for care.\n They sell indoor plants, seems like the same selection every time, every store.\n Most have a good selection of parts, this one included. Only a couple of kinds of soil though.\n There is a rental area for pricey tools, so you don't have to buy it ton use just once.\n Snacks and cold drinks next to every register.\n It's like Disneyland for lesbians. They should put a Starbucks in on weekdays, we could all meet, discuss our next project?  :D
