I'm a Top Chef groupie. I'll own it. I watch the show religiously and when I get the chance, I will dine at Top Chef contestants' restaurants.\n  So, when I heard that Tom Colicchio's sandwich place was just a short walk from our hotel, you better believe I went.\n  The name was cute, and the sign kept reminding me of Wicked!,  and it was big Tom's restaurant, so all signs indicated that this would be a success. Oh how wrong I was.\n    I ordered the roasted pork sandwich with red cabbage and mustard. The pork was SERIOUSLY lacking in flavor, as was the cabbage (a little vinegarette would have helped). I even picked out a bone from the sandwich...yuck. For close to $10 for a sandwich, I expected better, especially since it's owned by a judge on Top Chef. I also tried a peanut butter chocolate cupcake (because it's my weakness) and it just didn't deliver at all. Disappointment all around. Inevitably, the meal was only good for absorbing the copious amounts of alcohol I'd put into my body by that time in Vegas, nothing more.\n\nIf Padma were to try the sandwiches here, I'm sure she'd tell Tom to \"pack his knives and go.\" True story.
