From the moment I walked through the door, I was swept off my feet. The walls are a muted, warm olive and the natural wood furniture a comforting touch, and the jazz wafting softly through the shop is just enough to plaster a smile across your face while you give your order to which ever friendly face greets you at the cashier. The woman who owns the place is simply delightful and will ensure you enjoy your meal. \nI had a smoked chicken with tomato, bacon, onion marmalade, and arugula on an everything bagel, which came with a small side salad, and a small coffee. Since the chicken was smoked and not really 'cooked' per se, some bits were pinkish. I was assured, however, that it was perfectly safe for consumption. Although I was skeptical, I gave it a try and ohmygoodness. Amazing. I will for sure be a regular! It's a nice oasis in the heart of Kensington.
