You along with Metro police have lost contrail of Fremont Street tonight I saw a guy come into Fremont Street  holding a case of Bud Light. Two FSE walked by him and never said a word. I called in a couple weeks gag order for performers not displaying permits. I was told by person on phone at FSE Security that they only need to show they when asked. Per the Mayors office and to\nOrdinance they need to display all the time. Come on\nFSE enforce to rules as the city requested? Maybe we need another agency to over see your duties? I have picture it you want to see them. OMG look at picture
