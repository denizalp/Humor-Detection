Best primary care dr I have had. I moved here a few years ago and I have multiple medical problems and Dr. C took me on as a patient with no problem taking care of my conditions. He is very smart and knowledgeable. I've never had to wait to see him and he is always available, even seeing me on a holiday! The office staff are also super friendly.
