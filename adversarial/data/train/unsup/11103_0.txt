I want to like this place! The premise of a pizza place that operates like other successful \"build-your-own\" meal franchises, and the promotion of grown in-store greens really sounds great! \n\nIt took about 40 minutes (line, register and pickup) for a pizza that takes 3 minutes to cook. And the result is a thin personal pan style pizza for around $8-9. If I didn't have a $5 off coupon, it wouldn't have been worth it.\n\nThe service in-store just isn't up to the task. I think this is either because the store is still new and the employees are still figuring out a system, or the existing training system is poor. \n\nMy positive criticism: \nI used to work at a Subway store. Pizza Fire Parma should try having each employee on the line take a customer from start to finish, so the slower customers with bigger orders don't hold down the line, and there aren't employees standing around waiting at the register while a line wraps out the door.
