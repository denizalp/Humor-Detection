Whatever you do, do not choose this shuttle service!  This is by far the worst you can experience in Las Vegas. \nWe arrived late at night on a Friday night.  There was a 30 minute way for the taxis, so we thought a shuttle service may be faster.  Showtime looked as though they had the most shuttles so we decided to go with them. We first inquired about their limo\/car service but the lady said she couldn't give us pricing on that because they don't take care of that at her station. Yet they advertise it right at the front of her booth?!?!?! It was late, we didn't want to argue so we went with the shuttle.  As we were walking up to the line, the shuttle that we were supposed ride leaves.  We had to wait an hour for the next one.  You got us this time Showtime, but never again!!
