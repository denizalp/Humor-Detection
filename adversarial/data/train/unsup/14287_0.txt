During my short phase of wedding planning I had really scrambled to find a cake. It was the one thing I felt I needed. Who cares about dancing and toasts? Give me the cake. Anyway, it turned out that Freed's was partnered with my venue to provide cakes and desserts, so I took the path of least resistance. \n\nI chose the amaretto cake and it was delicious and extremely decadent. The almondy-alcohol flavoring was not overpowering and the cake itself was moist and fluffy. The cake was delivered on time to my venue with no issues, and the online ordering process was quick and painless.\n\nIf you're planning a wedding from afar I definitely recommend this bakery. The quality is good and they will work with out of towners to make sure everything goes smoothly. I'd love to get my hands on some more sweets from here, but I guess it will have to wait for my next Vegas trip.
