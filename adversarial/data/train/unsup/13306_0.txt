Frederick's is the OG of hakka cuisine restaurants. It seems as if this place has been there forever! Though there have been a ton of knock offs open up in the last 5 years or so, I don't think any other place will take over as the most successful hakka restaurant in the tdot. \n\nThey have an entirely separate take out window, which is always packed with people waiting for their orders. There is often a lineup for the restaurant itself on weekends, and on long weekends, forget about it.\n\nWhat's good? Oh man, what's not good? My traditional orders are chilli chicken, crispy beef, sweet and sour chicken balls, vegetable chow mein, beef fried rice, chicken fried rice, chicken pakoras, and my favourite is the chicken corn soup which I must deem essential.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and helpful, and the food is always stellar. The only downside I would say about this restaurant would be the wait times since I despise waiting in line. \n\nFrederick Restaurant - 5\/5 stars. If you don't know what this place is about, you're really missing out.
