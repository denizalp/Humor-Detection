BEWARE IF YOU ORDER FOOD THEY WILL CHARGE YOU  Gratuity! They charge me gratuity, I had to talk to a manager because I needed to know where does it says gratuity will be automatically added and why was it added for a party of 2?? And it was me and my husband! The manager said (something that does not made sense) \"because it's a busy place and sometimes people don't pay their tab but you can say you don't want gratuity to your servicer\". So question was WHY WAS IT ADDED IN THE FIRST PLACE?? No I was  NOT DRUNK yes I ALWAYS look to see what I'm getting charged for.  I feel that for those whom been drinking heavy, might not have noticed or paid it any attention. It's like taking advantage of someone. YOU CAN NOT CHARGE GRATUITY IF ITS NOT LISTED ANYWHERE!! Point black period!! \n\nNice Atmosphere. The food was good. I would go back now I know what to look for. Great vibes. The only down side was that gratuity issues. Yes I would go back.
