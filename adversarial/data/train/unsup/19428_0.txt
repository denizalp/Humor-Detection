When I was 15 my dad bought me my first car here (new '05 dodge neon). Now I came back to buy my family a small SUV ('12 dodge journey). I am happy with my purchase and the on going customer service. I was fortunate enough to have Antonio Magana as my car salesman. He's awesome! He was so patient with me and seriously gave me the best deal on my car. After I pay this car off and give to my mom, I am coming back to buy my next car.\nOh and PS. Steve from finance is super cool too. Explains every single thing to you thoroughly and doesn't hesitate to return a phone call. And Curtis from service is soooooo effing awesome! He had my free window tint ready at the time I needed it and is also super friendly.\nPretty much everyone here is super nice!
