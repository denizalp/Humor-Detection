I hate to ruin a five-star rating but as a repeat customer I was very disappointed with the customer service I received here.  I came in for an estimate.  After 3 days I called I see if estimate had been submitted and was told they were having trouble with the insurance company's website. 8 days later insurance still had not received the quote from KK and when I called to find out why, I was told my rep was at lunch and would return my call.  That was 2 weeks ago. Never called me back. No worries. I guess they didn't need my business.  I took it elsewhere.
