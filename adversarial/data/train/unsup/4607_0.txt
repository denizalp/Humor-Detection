Loved it. I got the regular Belgium frites with samurai sauce, which is sort of like a spicy chipolte Southwest. But the spicy isn't unbearable but there so you explained spicy but without the burning heat. The frites are definitely not fries. They are like rectangular wedges with the most rustic hard crisp fry and steamy fluffy-ish potato goodness. It's so simple but so great. I don't know if the put and salt but it really isn't needed. The regular is like a McDonald's medium for around $4. So great and I will definitely make myself a regular at this place and try all the sauces and specialty frites.
