We went here because we had a 25$ off a 50$ meal coupon. Big Mistake. We went at around 3 am after hitting up some clubs\/bars. \nThe Order: \nCalamari\nFries\nClub Sandwich \nCuban Sandwich\n \nThe calamari was decent. It came with some fried thinly slices lemon and spinach. The fries were good too but the sandwiches were worst that what you would get at a Denny's. Do not eat here if you enjoy fine cuisine.
