A margherita at Stone runs $6.35.  Six dollars and thirty-five cents for a bona fide Neapolitan pie.  For your reference, a Tombstone is $4.99.  So for as little as $1.36 you can upgrade from the unfathomable frozen abyss to life-affirming pizza glory.\n\nMy only gripe is location. It's a great lunch spot but as much as I love the pizza I never think to come for dinner since it's not really on the way to or from anywhere except the Point.  That said, if they ever open a 2nd location (please come to the east end!), there is no reason to go anywhere else.
