Honey Salt is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!! I love how delicious all of the food is here and the service is incredible! I ate here for lunch and started with the ahi which was SO fresh and tasty then had the fish with cauliflower couscous which was mouthwatering delicious with a glass of wine which was recommended by my wonderful server Fatima! I love coming here not only for the amazing food but the vibe is so awesome you just want to hang out! I highly recommned Honey Salt for a tasty meal, amazing service and a cool vibe!
