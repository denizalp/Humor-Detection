Fiddler on the Main.\n\n     Moishe's has always been one of the best steakhouses in town but in the past year it has become one of the best deals in town as well. If you are ever looking for exquisite cuts of meat, some of the worlds best slaw\/pickles and a warm environment with a welcoming feel, on The Main, this is the place.\n\n    It is as old as the hills but that is not the vibe. Newly appointed Chef Josh Fiddler has put a great spin on a classic menu with new presentations to their staples and additions that are critical in 'keeping up with the times'. Moreover, the 9-midnight menu, which is teetering on being the best deal in town, has the place busy till close Thursday through Saturday. Anytime you can get two courses, one being a steak, for $25, it is a good bet. To top it off, it is Moishe's beef and you can grab one at 11:15pm if you are so inclined...then paint the town...\n\n    I've hit up the 9-12 a few times and have never been disappointed, the Lobster roll was feckin' fantastic as are the tartars. Bottom line, you can go Moishe's whenever with whoever and have a excellent dining experience.\n \nWaka Waka
