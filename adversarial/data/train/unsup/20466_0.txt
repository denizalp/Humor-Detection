When I think of chicken & waffles, I think of Roscoe's but when a place has it on their menu, I HAVE to order it. When we were trying to figure out where to eat in Vegas, I couldn't help but come across all of the great reviews at Yardbird. Heck, why not right ?!\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and it's located in between the Venetian and Palazzo. If you're at the cashier at the Venetian, it's right around there. The staff was terrific and my water was never empty. Our waitress made sure we were treated right and was very helpful\/friendly.\n\nWe got a bunch of orders and decided to do family style. The chicken and waffles were DELICIOUS. I loved the waffles which I think are better than the waffles at Roscoe's. The waffles here had a better consistency and didn't get too soggy after pouring the bourbon syrup over it. It had a nice crispy crunch to it. The chicken was also juicy. I loved the crispy chicken skin and appreciated how moist the chicken was. It's nice how they include watermelon in the dish. What more can you ask for?! We also got a side of mac n' cheese and it was phenomenal. The macaroni was cooked perfectly -- al dente -- and was chewy. SO GOOD. It wasn't overly cheesy and I could eat that all day long! Another entree that I got to try was the peppered gnocchi pot pie. I thought it was perfectly creamy and the biscuit blended beautifully in the dish. \n\nI was disappointed to not see lobster mac n' cheese on the menu. My friend went to the Yardbird in LA and they got lobster mac n' cheese. I guess the menu differs based on location.\n\nI'm so glad we went to Yardbird and I can't wait to check out their location in LA.
