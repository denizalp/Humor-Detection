I love this place. I love their pub food. I always order their Moulin Rouge Flammekueche and my bf loves their pulled pork sandwich. I have tried other things here but those are the mains I always go back to. We always like their fries\/poutine and their creme brulee. \n\nDon't come here expecting a quiet night out, it's really busy and can get quite loud...what did you expect? it's a bar atmosphere. \n\nOverall, one of my go to places.
