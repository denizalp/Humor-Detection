Yes, I have read most others feedback before I decided to give this Five star. \n\n1) I'm property owner. \n2) I have only spoke with KIRA MCCLERKIN and other lady I forgot her name. \n3) Been to office once and took care everything after I bought the house. \n4) Mostly paper work could be taken care by email. \n\nTheir phone system is easy to use for owner, they will tell you if there is any HOA balance outstanding. You get to speak with a person by just one click, and they are fast. Most representative is fast to response to any question that I had. If they can not handle the problem, they will have a manager contact you shorty, which for my case was within one hour. \n\nI was happy that KIRA could solve my gate code problem right the way. \n\nI have fought many rental company and house owner before I own this house, I understand some of the reviewer's situation, I just like to take my anger to the right person. \n\nPS: How many company really care of our reviews and give a response? The fact is they do care. At least that's my opinion \n\nThanks for reading.
