\"Hurts so good - come'on baby make it hurt so good...\"\n------------------------\n\nFirst of all, thanks to S.B. and Mr. K for joining me for day of beautiful weather and damn good Vietnamese food. It was everything I was hoping to achieve and for the full table of food - we each paid less than $12\/each. Craziness.\n\nI am going to have to let the men speak for themselves and ask that they share their meal with everyone, but I can tell you from my perspective - lunch was damn good and worth the three-hour-nap that I took afterwards. \n\nI had saved my daily java for the Vietnamese hot stuff that I knew would be at the restaurant - and it had more sweetened condensed milk in it than I expected - but I 'suffered' through it. It was good.\n\nWe had Shrimp Spring Rolls and a Vietnamese Crepe Appetizer that had a plate of accompaniments such as mint, lettuce, and cucumber. We devoured both - and I'm pretty sure that it was because they were good, not just because of our hunger pangs - but again, I'll leave it to the men to discuss.\n\nThen they started bringing the additions for my Pho - I ordered the 2A - Beef Pho. I had a plate full of bean sprouts, jalapenos, and purple Thai basil. When the Pho came I filled it with all the jalapenos, most of the basil, and a strong hand-full of bean sprouts and a good spray of Siracha sauce. Damn. It is so good.\n\nI start with chopsticks and am working through very methodical bites of jalapeno, basil and pieces of meat. Oh crap. I don't know these guys and I ams starting to search in my food. What are they saying, crap...we're having a conversation...and it's a good one. Focus, I have to stay focused! Okay, I am out of beef - there's lots of broth and a ton of rice noodles left - I need to get busy - loose the chopsticks this is a job for a fork and spoon! I dig in Italian style. \n\nI, then, initiate the fork\/spoon twirl and soon find that the prep cook never split the noodles - this is a bowl of fully connected, never-ending rice noodles. Crap. I am going to have to try to bite in and not be too obvious - SSSSSLLLLLLLUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPPPPP! And, there it is. I slurped in front of strangers and not just once, it was more like five, ten or fifteen times. I knew I was getting full and wasn't making so much as a dent in my Pho - and I was starting to embarrass myself - so I held back. Not to mention, just as when you eat ice cream too fast, you get a cold brain; when I eat too much Pho too fast, I get \"fat, fuzzy, MSG head.\"\n\nMr. K., and S.B., thanks for joining me and I'm still singing....\n\"Hurts so good, come'on baby make it hurt so good.\"
