Okay, I admit, I was hesitant at first with the idea of hitting up Kabuki.  But since I've been making my rounds for happy hour, I was told that I have to check this place out!\n\nTheir happy hour is Monday through Friday, from 3 pm to 6 pm; includes discounted drinks and food.\n\nDrinks are hard to miss on their menu because it dominates the first few pages.\n\nI started off with:\n\n* Tokyo Mojitos \"Made from Asian Vodka \"Shochu\" and Sake\" (HH $4.95 \/ $7.95 reg), the Berry flavor.  When I took a sip, oh my goodness, wow!  This was one damn good mojito!  I had the Husband and another friend try it, and they were sold immediately!  The Husband got the Grapefruit variety, while our friend got a Berry one too.  I also tried the Lychee one later on.  I'm not usually a fan of fresh grapefruit, but it reminded me more of grapefruit soda and I liked it too, better than the Lychee one.\n\n* Draft beer (Kirin Ichiban) (HH $1.95 \/ reg $3.50) - The guys did get beer to start, but soon moved on to mojitos!\n\nI had planned on trying one of their Chu-Hi \"Made from Asian Vodka 'Shochu' with Refreshing Fruit Flavor\" drinks, specifically the Blueberry flavor (HH $4.95 \/ reg $6.95), but got stuck on the mojitos!  Oh well, next time!\n\nFoodwise: \nI had to ask first, do they use sriracha in their hot sauce?  (I'm not a fan of it in my sushi.)  And thank goodness, no!  I was all aboard!\n\n* Spicy Tuna Roll (HH $2.95 \/ reg $4.75) - My staple, as long as I like the hot sauce and I like it here.  Yum.\n\n* Lotus on Fire Roll \"Spicy Tuna, Lotus Root, and Jalapeno on top of California roll\" (HH $5.95 \/ reg $9.95) - This was beautifully presented with a deep-fried lotus root sitting on each piece, complete with a jalapeno slice.  There's also some spicy crunchy things on one side and more hot sauce on the other side.  It's a pretty tasty roll with a lot of heat, so good that we ordered another roll!\n\n* Salmon Skin Roll (HH $2.95 \/ reg $3.95) - Served with six pieces, the bonito flakes add a nice smokey taste to it.  It was good.\n\n* Aladdin Roll \"Spicy Albacore and Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura\" (HH $5.95 \/ reg $7.95) - Another tasty roll with a bit less heat and a nice subtle crunch from the masago.\n\n* Rose Roll (HH $5.95 \/ reg $8.95) \"Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura, A-Grade Avocado and Spicy Tuna\" - We're all liking the spicy tuna, so how could this go wrong?\n\nOverall, we were all pleasantly surprised with the drinks and food offered, even at the happy hour.  Service was good, our waitress Briana, was always checking up on us and making sure we had enough food and drink.  We'd definitely go back for more happy hour action now!\n\nThey also have a Red Mask Club so you can earn points when you dine.
