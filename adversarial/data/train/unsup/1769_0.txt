The Thumb has the Best Beef Brisket & ribs in Arizona! The Brisket Sandwich is delicious! Order your brisket \"moist\"! The mac & cheese is scrumptuous! This place tops Tom's BBQ, Rudy's, Dickey's and all the rest.. SERIOUSLY!!! I drive up from South Tempe! I've brought in 10 different friends and no one is ever disappointed!!
