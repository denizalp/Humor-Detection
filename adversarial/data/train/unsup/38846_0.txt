On August 4th we went to Hooleys for dinner.  It's a very nice patio - they are dog friendly!  The food and service are always great and the servers are friendly.  On the way out we ran into an old friend who worked in the court system - great to see her, hadn't seen her in a long time.  When her sister asked what I thought of Trump, I responded he's the greatest president we've had in a long time - this started a heated discussion and she left the patio to go inside the restaurant.  (When she came out she was loud and using foul language).  We left the restaurant and then a server told us we had to leave because we were disrupting patrons eating dinner.  There was no disruption - it was a private conversation.  Unbelievable that we were asked to leave - for what, because we support our president?  We are definitely taking Hooleys off the list of businesses to patronize and support.  I'm sure Hooleys will continue to do fine as long as they continue walking the Democratic Party line.
