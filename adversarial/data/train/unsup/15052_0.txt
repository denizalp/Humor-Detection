I have been driving my Cardenas for years and never stopped.  I was in the neighborhood and decided it was about time I stopped in to see what my friends had praised so highly.\n\nImmediately, I saw the bakery area on the right and I was hooked.  There was a table of Pan de Muerto for the upcoming Day of the Dead.  Had it not been so large, I might have gotten one but much would have gone to waste.  Instead, I got some tres leches cake and a few cookies.\n\nI walked around the store and saw where I'd be stopping the next time.  The variety of meats will make doing some Mexican food at home very easy.\n\nI enjoyed walking around the store and soaking up all they had.
