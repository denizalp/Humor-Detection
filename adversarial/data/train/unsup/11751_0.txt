I love NY! And NyNy hotel & casino ! \nMy husband surprised me with the Regency Penthouse suite and what an amazing place it was! It takes up the entire 35 th floor ( with the exception of one small room ) \n\nHe made me go up myself to check it out and wow ! I walked in and was blown away. It was HUGE! Like perfect for a cocktail party entertaining huge. \n\nThe living room \/ bar \/ kitchen  \/ dining area was all open concept. There was a large island with bar stools, hardwood floors, stereo system, sofa, dining table, arm chairs - there was enough seating for 17 people in that area alone !\n\nJust off that area was a half bath with separate sink and mirror ( a perfect place for guests to go powder their nose ) The bedroom was also separate on the opposite side. \n\nUpscale decor with lots of glass tiles in the walls , It had a super comfy king size bed. ( Second only to the Aria sky-suites bed )  it also had a huge dresser, TV, end tables,\nSeparate  huge mirrored closet, plush carpeting, and another awesome bathroom. \n\nI love hotel bathrooms ! This one did not disappoint. It featured a raised jacuzzi tub, separate shower, deluxe toiletries, his and her sinks on either side of the room. The toilet was closed off and had a bidet. There was tasteful artwork including a cool sculpture right beside the jacuzzi. \n\nThe entire suite was so luxurious and I felt so comfy there. After staying at the penthouse suite at Aria skysuites the previous week, it would of been hard to impress me - but this certainly did ! \n\nBesides the awesome room, NYNY had a great casino, wonderful \nPlaces to eat ( Mexican, Italian, Steakhouses, the 24 hr Cafe, just too many to name ! ) \n\nThe location is ideal for getting to other resorts from ( Monte Carlo, MGM, Excalibur, Luxor, ect ) as well there are Marshals and Ross stores right across the street. \n\nThe VIP lounge was one of the better ones. They had wine and beer as well as snacks, and the girls who worked there were excellent. \n\nI really didn't know what to expect from this place, but with lower expectations I was sure happily surprised ! \n\n* on a separate note, I did see a basic room and it looked pretty dreary and depressing VERY basic. I also saw one of their other spa suites which was nice, but by no means any comparison to The Regency ! Not sure how much it would cost as it was through my husbands Mlife platinum but if you get the opportunity to stay there ( or even just party there ) totally do it !
