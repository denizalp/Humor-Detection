Came here on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was great and the waitress did a great job serving us. I was disappointed in the food however. We started with the corn and it lacked any real flavor. I had the California burrito and again the flavor was really weak. My sister commented on the lack of any flavor on her black beans and I didn't get much in the way of flavor from the skirt steak or the pinto beans either. I had to add copious amounts of hot sauce just to get some flavor.  However, my sister did like her cod taco that was served Baja style I believe.  She did comment that her margarita was weak on the tequila. For a Mexican place I tend to think you should get the beans, flavor and tequila right. They definitely missed it on all three.
