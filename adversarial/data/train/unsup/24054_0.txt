This will probably get cycled off the first page in a matter of days, but regardless here are some tips for XS, because if you've never been to Vegas or never been to a club you may be intimidated coming in.  I was here for Tiesto on New Years weekend, so I assume about as hard a night to enter as any.\n\n- Buy tickets ahead of time if available.  I bought thru Wantickets thru the XS website and they had a separate entrance set up where I walked right in despite arriving at XS around 12:30AM (my plane landed that night at 11:15PM).  Didn't even have to grease the guy at the door, which I fully expected to have to do since I got there kinda late and this is standard practice at some NYC clubs, even if you have a ticket.\n\n- Dress nice.  Really nice.  But leave the $500 loafers at home.  Wear the $150 ones.\n\n- Forget bottle service.  Drink prices aren't THAT bad (under $15 for Tanqueray and tonic) and you can get service quickly enough in the outside bars.\n\nBesides that it's your standard high-end club experience.  Lots of people, some more banged up than others, close quarters, lots of rich Asians (not a bad thing), but as XS you don't have the college crowd\/mindset of wearing as much neon as possible and acting like a complete a-hole like you do in the majority of big clubs, festivals these days.  So HUGE ups for that.
