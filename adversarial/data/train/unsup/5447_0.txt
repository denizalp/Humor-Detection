Not a huge selection but great prices! I just bought a Smok Prince stick for $43. They happened to have my rainbow in stock last one. They have a gold one left. Good customer service but strange atmosphere. Great for the convenience. I just broke my vape and was near by meeting a friend at Starbucks in the same shopping center so everything worked out! I didn't buy any juice so I don't know the prices in those. We bought a couple Smok coils for my hubbies baby beast $10 for 2. I have my regular places for vaping but can't beat this price for a Prince stick.
