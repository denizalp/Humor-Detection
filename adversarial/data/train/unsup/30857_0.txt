Dinner with friends here on a trip to Upper St. Clair.  Loved it - excellent. I had the duck Breast with fingerling potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts.  Mary had a Chilean sea bass with sauce- she said that the sauce was a bit sweet for her taste. We also shared some appetizers: the veggie ragout tower, a roasted Brussels sprout salad with sea scallop (highly recommended).  All good.\nSmall restaurant! Reservations recommended.
