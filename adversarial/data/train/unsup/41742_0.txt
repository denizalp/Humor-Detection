I found a Groupon for a month of unlimited spinning for Studio 360 and so far I love it.  I didn't know how much I would like the \"drop saddle\" (standing most of the time) style but it works. Even though it will be awhile before I can even begin to keep up with the instructors (who are great) and sort of have to go at my own pace, each time I wind up completely drenched in sweat by the end and my fitness tracker said I'd burned 500-600 calories in an hour.  GREAT workout!  If I can do it, anyone can do it!
