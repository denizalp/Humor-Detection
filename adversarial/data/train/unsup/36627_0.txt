Great little coffee shop downtown, delicious coffee, wonderful sandwiches, fresh salads and homemade soups, although they tend to run out especially of their incredible clam chowder. They also have tempting looking desserts, but I've never partaken. Lovely comfy cozy rooms with ample light, a main room with overstuffed chairs & sofa, others with wooden chairs, even a picnic style, & all with delightful artwork & handmade crafts - for sale. Nouveau riche boutique, pricey but nice. They also have umbrella shaded tables outside. Live acoustic music some evenings otherwise fairly quiet as rooms are sectioned off like a home with the glass counter where you place your order at the heart. The only downside is the parking is scarce. Very. As there have been too many times I really wanted to stop in, but could find nowhere near enough to park, I haven't been as much. In fact it's been a while but good enough an experience I wanted to share my more positive memories.
