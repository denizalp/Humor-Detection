Wow- is the word.  The food here was amazing.  We had a tasting menu - from the start was great.  My favorites were the risoto with lobster, the chestnut soup (which was served so elegantly) and the desserts of banana foster cake with cream cheese ice cream and butterscotch pudding.  When we were there we were treated wonderfully- service was impecable.  Truly a memorable experience!!!
