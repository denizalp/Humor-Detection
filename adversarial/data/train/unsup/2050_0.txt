This place is just as good if not better than what I remember when I first visited about 6 years ago and they have expanded and opened another location on the West side of Cleveland to boot!!!! \n\nOh, if only they'd expand further and open a location in Phoenix then I'd be in heaven......a girl can dream can't she?\n\nThe item that caught my fancy when I first patronaged this little restaurant is the sweet potato burrito which comes black beans and with alfalfa sprouts. \n\\(o.O)\/. Don't overthink it. Just try it and you will fall in love with :} Taco Tontos too!\n\nAs for seating granted the inside is tight. I think a max of 10-12 maybe can sit inside, but on days the shared patio is open there's plenty more seating.
