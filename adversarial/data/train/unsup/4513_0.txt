I have tried them 2 times on yelp delivery and every time the wings have been average. The wing sizes and portion are about the same compared to their competitors. \n\nThe flavor variety offered here is limited. I typically like to go for lemon pepper and a spicy sweet flavor but I have not found one I love here yet. Also the super spicy option has no love in it. It just burns like hell but not in a good way. The flavor is muted, so not really edible or enjoyable at all. \n\nThe curly fries here aren't that great either, they are always packaged them in such a way that they arrive sogged beyond repair and the seasoning is basic. Go for the fried pickles, they do them well here. \n\nBut I do have to say their ranch is good, which is hard to come by.
