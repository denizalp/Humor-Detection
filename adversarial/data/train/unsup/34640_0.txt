Visited Tender 05\/22 to celebrate a friends birthday. The decor is quite nice and sexy great lightining and not too stuck up for my taste. We started with the kobe meatloaf sliders pretty yummy except for the seaweed spread didnt work at all with the sliders. Next I had the Hawaiian Blue Prawns with risotto it was OK nothing spectacular. The mashed potatoes were delicious but its really hard to go wrong there. My friend had the hawaiian blue tuna and she wasnt impressed at all and oh I almost forgot there was a gross odor at our table the whole time which the bday girl didnt appreciate. My friend had the spare ribs and he LOVED them. Oh and the Cooler was the best cocktail I had in Vegas. overall it was OK not sure if I'd go back for the 4 of us with 2 cocktails and a glass of wine it was $220.00.
