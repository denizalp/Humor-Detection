Large selection of discs with all the major and even minor brands in stock. Lots of various models for each manufacturer, too. It's like the owner decided, well, if I wanted a certain disc from a certain manufacturer, what would I stock?\n\nOther disc golf related items as well are in stock to suck those dollar bills out of your wallet.\n\nThe owner likes to talk. He's just very friendly and just loves his job. I love it when I encounter people who love their jobs. Just be aware that sometimes a quick 5 minute turn-around purchase is not going to be as short as 5 minutes. It may carry on for another 3 or 4 minutes because he just likes to talk about disc golf. I love it.\n\nThis is an excellent disc golf shop. You *will* be able to find the disc you want there. And it is right there off of the Vista Del Camino Disc Golf Course. What more can you ask?\n\nOh, so you asked! OK, well they have this great program that if you bring in a lost disc, you get $3 in store credit. When the rightful owner comes in to claim it, he pays $3 to get it back. That's cool.\n\nAlso, they rent bikes, which is handy for that great bike path that runs through the park and beyond.\n\nThey also sell used discs, which sometimes you can get a bargain gem.\n\nDon't forget to check in with your Yelp app as you will get a 10% off deal.
