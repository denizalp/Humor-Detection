A huge, ginormous, wonderful thank you to Nikki for the review on Tea Fusion. I bookmarked this place the second I read her glowing review. I love boba (or bubble tea). Growing up in Vegas, it was always just a \"thing\" to go meet friends for boba, eat chicken, and just chill. I have now found my Charlotte version of this!\n\nThe korean bbq bahn mi was delicious - the meat was tender and sweet with the right about of veggies. I wish the bread was a little more crispy, but I'll take it.\n\nWe also had the popcorn chicken. So hot, freshly made, and served in a little box with sticks to grab it with. It has a slight spice to it, but not too much. Just great.\n\nMy ONE complaint is that the tapioca balls are not my favorite ones I've had. I've been to this place twice - the first time, they were a little small (for my liking). The second time, they tasted slightly undercooked. This place definitely has the best boba I've had in North Carolina, but not a 100% winner. \n\nI will definitely come back! I'll also give an update on the tapioca verdict next time.
