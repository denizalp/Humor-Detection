In town for the rock and roll marathon and still celebrating the hubs birthday with dinner here. First it's a pretty generational contrast to the otherwise under 40 crowd that mostly roams Vegas. The hubs had a branzino (sea bass) but the way it was prepared - shredded and fried - gave it a more grazing animal taste if you will. Ok I'll say it -it tastes like chicken. Not sure that's the experience the chef wanted and for what it costs ($36) I'm not sure it was worth it, but then again when I'm paying high dollar for meals, they need to perform at a high standard and Portofino doesn't do that. They do however have a vegetarian menu which 2 of us ordered from (vegetarian pastas for over $30), burrata ravioli and another cheese filled pasta with root veggies. Both were good but too rich and probably not great for a carb load with the higher fat and cream content. The homemade burrata pasta with lobster was tasty, but also quite heavy. So if you like heavy cream based pasta this is for you! The restaurant is quiet and doesn't smell like smoke like the rest of the casino so that's a plus. Service was good. no pictures sorry.
