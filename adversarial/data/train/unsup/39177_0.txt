I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.  The rooms are small, but well designed and appointed.  They are comfortable.  The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  The Amtrak is connected to the hotel through the underground city system and this is a huge advantage.  When you arrive in Montreal, you are almost already at your hotel.  The location is perfect for shopping and anything else you want to do.  Join the President's Club online before you arrive at the hotel and you will get your high speed internet free.
