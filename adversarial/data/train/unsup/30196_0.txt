I've been seriously dying to have a paint night and finally made it happen this past Saturday for date night. I purchased a Groupon and immediately used the voucher for the Tahiti Sunset painting session. Christina was the painting hostess\/coordinator and she was awesome! She was very upbeat and made the class exciting! She sang along to the songs and made sure everyone understood her step-by-step instructions. Honestly, I felt like it was a little challenging while painting but I was happy with the results. They serve food and beverages (including beer and wine!) and I loved that concept so much. I would recommend this place to anyone willing to try something new or channel their inner Van Gogh or Picasso. I'm already planning to do this for my birthday!
