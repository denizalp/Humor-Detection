In short: not impressed-- sorry, Bellagio. I've been to Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, both of which are extraordinary, and I expected Bellagio to be in that category too. It isn't. The main reason I went-- and this could be \"user error\"-- was because of all the pics I saw on Yelp of the caviar part of the buffet, which seemed to set it apart from the others. When I got to the counter, the cashier told me they only have that very occasionally for special dinners. Oh well-- I'm here now, so I may as well try it anyway. And what I got is a buffet of good-quality but standard selections. Nicely cooked meat, good potatoes, uninspired side dishes, unappealing desserts. When I first came in, there were macarons at the dessert counter; by the time I was ready for dessert, they were gone, and no more appeared even though I looked for them on multiple passes. Not the end of the world, but that's just the sort of subdued disappointment you get here. I'm giving in three stars because it's not actually a bad buffet by any means. It's just not among the best in Vegas and it's much less than I would have expected out of the Bellagio.
