2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     54\/100\n\nI've been a fan of this place for 20+ years. Before I moved here from Hawai'i, every time we visited Vegas, we always made our way to The Cal and ate at Aloha Specialties. In the past few months, we have been eating here every week and it doesn't disappoint. Food is still the same as it was years ago. The renovations are modern and nice. It feels more spacious. \n\nLately, they seem to have more on staff to keep the line moving. There's still a line and maybe a 10 minute wait at most since this is the most popular Hawai'ian spot in Downtown. But the line moves fast. Now, there's 1-2 cashiers and 2 waitresses, for Saturday afternoons. \n\nThey're the sister restaurant of Ross J's in Henderson. One star off for this location. They have the same food but the only thing that doesn't make sense is I can't order the Korean Chicken as a side. I don't eat white rice or mac salad anymore because of my diabetes so it would be pointless to get the plate. Ross J's offers it as a side. If the owners read this I hope they'll consider adding it as a side order. We come here more often anyways because there's more activities to do in the area. \n\nI've tried almost everything on the menu, all are onoliscious (delicious.) What I usually get is Korean chicken, Kim Chee, steamed broccoli and haupia. All are onoliscious. Haupia is made fresh, one time it had a good amount of sweetness, the next week it wasn't as sweet. \n\nOther great options: The Bentos, Sweet & Sour Spare Ribs, huge bowls of Saimin, breakfast plates, Spam musubi, Loco Moco, Kalua Pig and sandwiches. Everything is tasty. \n\nWhen at The Cal I prefer this place over the cafe on the first floor. Will be back again and again!\n\nTIP: They also sell shortbread and cookies at the cash register. Depending on the wait time, it's worth getting a package to hold you over ;-)\n\nAloha! :-)
