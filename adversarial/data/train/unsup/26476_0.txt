I'm not sure where to begin and where to end when it comes to writing a review for this place. I bought a groupon for a facial at the this spa which clearly mentioned a 75 minute facial with a special kiwi mask and a neck, d√©colletage, face & hands massage. Nothing was done as promised. It was a 45 minute facial as opposed to 75 minute. There was no massage just steam and mask applied. The owner who was doing my facial left the room at least 4 times. When I pointed it out to her that the services were not given as promised in the groupon she said this is what it is take it or leave it. She was extremely rude. I was pissed and obviously not going back to them at all or even recommending them ever to anybody. I will be calling groupon as well to lodge a complaint with them. They used the wrong products and extractions were so bad that my face is still red. Bad bad bad is all I can say. Like I said before I didn't know where to start and where to end on this one. PATHETIC place.
