This place is so good that i went twice within 5 days. Pricey but i think i ate my weight in lobster tails tonight. If you are a local and have a players card you get 25% off. My mom and I paid about $64 instead of the regular $84 for 2 people. Oysters, mussels, clams, shrimp, crab legs, lobster tails, sushi, sashimi, chinese, mexican and way to much more to list. And the desserts???? OMG!!!! 2 words....creme brulee. Service is great, if you get the right person.
