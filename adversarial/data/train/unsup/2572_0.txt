As far as employment, I've never seen anyone get hired on the spot and let go in two weeks. This person arrived to work promptly, never late. Completed all tasks given by management. Human resources gave the document and final check to this individual (whom I know very well) and it stated that \"did not pass probation...?\" and \"not eligible for re-hire...\" Really?  Well, that's cold.  This person was hired for (laborer) facilities, and was told that they were going to train her for an engineer position. Also, management told this person 'that other people were quitting, and that she would be trained to take their place...' I'm not sure what type of shenanigans the human resources department are concocting, but they continue to hire individuals for a laborer (facilities) position. Of course, no one cares unless a certain situation happens to them. I feel that her story needs to be told, because that is unacceptable business practice regarding the hiring practices by the D hotel and casino.  I wasn't aware that this establishment has a revolving door policy.  Shouldn't employers try to keep the people that they hired in the 1st place?!? I guess not in this town.
