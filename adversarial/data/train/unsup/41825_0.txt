The atmosphere is that of a normal lounge but with blue lighting on overdrive.  Seriously, blue lights and ONLY blue lights along the walls.  It's really cool when you first enter and sets the mood of relaxation, but gets annoying after awhile (especially once the sun sets and you get tired of feeling like you're part of the Blue Man Group). Menu's and decor are very artsy and you can tell they put thought into every details of the setup of the place.  My only complaint is that the seats (aka wooden benches) were painfully uncomfortable (a tiny cushion would have gone a long way).  They give you caramelized popcorn with each pitcher of beer, which was the tasty costco variety.  The only food i ordered was the cooked scallops and they were also very good ($10 for about 6 pieces).\n\nFor drinks the only beer they have on tap is Sapporo, which if you like it is a good thing since it's ~$18 per pitcher.  They also have a bunch of other drinks (and a huge variety of sake).  I found some of the sake's to be overpriced but not unreasonable.\n\nService was amazing, they never bother you but were always standing nearby when you needed something.  Also they were very accommodating when we had a extra person show up and pulled up a bench for them so we didn't have to change tables.
