As a long time NY bagel fan, I was anxious to see what all the hype was for Montreal bagels. Well, the hype is real and they are fantastic! They are lighter, thinner, and crispier than NY bagels; less chewy, a slgihtly sweet aftertaste, and not as many flavors. There's definitely room in the bagel stratesphere for both NY and Montreal bagels to co-exist, and St-Viateur bagels are as good as it gets.
