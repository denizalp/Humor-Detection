We were staying at the Mirage, so we decided to check out JET.  It was a Thursday night, and there were only a few people trying to get in...no lines.  Since we were guests in the hotel, we got in for free.\n\nSKYY Vodka was doing some promotion that night, so I was able to get a free drink.  There were a good amount of people on the dance floor, but it wasn't that packed.  We walked around to check out the place, and it seemed like an older crowd that night.  I guess Thursday nights aren't poppin' at JET.  \n\nI had a few drinks, danced a little, and then headed back out to meet our friends that were gambling.  This was one of the smaller clubs that I've been to in Vegas, but not bad.  I'm assuming it has more potential on the weekends.
