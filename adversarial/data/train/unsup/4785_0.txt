I stay at the Crowne Plaza every time I'm in the Queen city of Charlotte. The hotel is close to many great places uptown and has a very safe vibe to it. On the east side of the hotel pass the freeway, there's a few shopping and dining areas  which includes Target, West Elm, Trader Joe's and more. The west part, you can go to  North Tryon Street which holds a lot of different eateries, club and bar scenes. The one you pick is  up to you. Plenty of places to eat, drink and be merry. \nNow as far as the hotel, I've always had comfortable rooms here, but the walls are thin. The work out facility is also decent and they have a good restaurant in the lobby area.\nThe free Internet is always a plus and If you forget your laptop, you can use the complimentary computers in the lobby.
