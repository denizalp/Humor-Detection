UPDATE:\n\nFinally got my gym bag, Thanks guys!!! I am working my way through the variety of classes and trainers and still have yet to work with all of them. Karen is a great motivator and I am inspired by her fit level! I really appreciate Justin's approach to proper technique and form and I love that he calls you on it!  \n\n\nSo Anthony P is not a worker outer he's a trainer... I get it.  It's definitely overpriced if you need a treadmill and find yourself occassionaly tinkering with free weights. Not everybody needs  a trainer or a building to get fit. \n\nHowever, I value someone correcting me on form because guess what? I don't know what the hell I'm doing! I'd rather pay $100+ a month for genuine, hands on trainers who enable you to transform your bod than pay $30 a month to look like a fool among the sea of meat heads hogging the free weights. I want results, where I'm learning how to utilize the gym to my full advantage and be in an environment  free of loitering teenagers and drooling meat heads.  \n\nI'm a worker... a HARD WORKER and I joined this place to get the hands on training to change my body! If you are willing to get out of your comfort zone and TRAIN your body, then you might see what all the fuss is about.
