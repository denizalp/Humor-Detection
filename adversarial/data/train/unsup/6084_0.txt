I had a couple hours to kill in Charlotte and I do so love museums, so I wandered over to the NASCAR Hall of Fame. It was much larger than I expected, and I suspect, set up to be used for events and receptions along with being a museum. \n\nFor $19.95 you have access to the entire Hall of Fame, which you could spend probably a full afternoon wandering around if you are into NASCAR. I am not a big NASCAR fan, so I probably didn't get my $19.95 worth, but it was still interesting. \n\nThe exhibits themselves are well done, although the museum as a whole is slightly broken up, doesn't flow as well as it could. There were more than a few interactive challenges and simulators to take advantage of. Plenty of friendly staff just dying to help with questions. \n\nIf you're in Charlotte it's really silly to not check out the NASCAR Hall of Fame. I even learned a little bit about NASCAR history and trivia that I shall use when pretending to know something about NASCAR.
