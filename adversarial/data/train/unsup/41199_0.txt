Good patio, flavor was on par. Price is pretty reasonable especially their daily deals and combos. Ordered the pork marinated sandwich combo with fries. The marinate on the pork was quite good but a bit oily. The service could be drastically improved. We were never offered if we need a refill (just my preference). This place only takes cash so be prepared. A friend had to wait 30 mins for her food with us having to prompt a different waitress after 20 mins of waiting. Overall experience is good if your in a group of friends. Would not recommend for a first date spot maybe a second. But definitely a place worth checking out.
