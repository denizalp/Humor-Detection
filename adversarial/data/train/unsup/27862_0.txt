Had the sushi.  All the food had amazing flavour. The dishes were brought to the table one by one. Each dish added to the tasting experience of the previous.  The service was very good. The interior is beautiful and it feels intimate. The food portions were generous and the pricing was affordable.\n\nIt all contributed to a unique experience that sets this restaurant apart from other Japanese restaurants.
