This food is amazing!  They aren't afraid to put some seasoning on it! Taste like your at your kin folks house!  \n\nI don't know what took us so long to come back to this place.  Now, I'm ready to check out there chicken and waffles for breakfast. \n\nStaff is great, and the food is amazing!\n\nOhhhhhh, I forgot about the peach cobbler  I got it to go! OHHHHHHH MY!  If you go there you \"MUST TRY\" this cobbler.  My hubby said the banana pudding was off the chain too!
