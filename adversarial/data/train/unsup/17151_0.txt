While I'm not quite empathetic of the absurd fanaticism of In-n-Out fans, it's still super easy to enjoy a bite from here as the main flavor is FRESH.\n\nWhile the drive thru line looks long, don't kid yourself thinking you'll save time by walking in. These guys crank out food as efficiently as possible, but it still takes time. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with anything here as there aren't a lot of options. My recommendation is that you eat the fries first; as they are fresh cut, they aren't extra crisp from a double fry, and they're kind of flaccid... so eat them while they're hot as their desirability weakens rapidly.\n\nFantastic staff, like most In-n-Outs.
