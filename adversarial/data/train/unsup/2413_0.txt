I wish I could give them less them one star. Me and my wife walked in and we were treated as if we came to cause trouble. Got a lot of stares from the staff only one employee offered to help us. He was Asian, normally that wouldn't matter but as a black man married to a Mexican women we only get helped from the only non white employee. Not surprised at all though. The employee who helped was amazing the rest of the staff garbage plain and simple. I will never come back to this pathetic excuse for a business and I urge everyone else too please spend your money elsewhere. Way too many good gun shops around for someone to waste their time on this racist place.
