The Venetian, like the Bellagio and Caesars are my highlights and must sees every time we go to Vegas.\nNo, it looks nothing like Venice but who cares?\nIt's Vegas and for that as good as it gets!\nIt's always clean and well kept with so much to see everywhere you look.\nRide an overpriced gondola through a faux, overly chlorinated river while a non italian is serenading you and everyone is staring and taking pictures, an experience you'll never forget.\nFabulous shopping, dining, bars and clubs, a must see when in Vegas!
