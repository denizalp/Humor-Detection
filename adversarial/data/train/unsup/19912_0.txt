Shipped a car from the east to the west coast - had to do a terminal to terminal due to time issue.  They said 10 - 12 days but i think it only took 7 - 8 days to arrive!  You can track your car on their website during the transit.  Staffs were very helpful and professional.  They also had a nice price - important especially in this economy!
