Despite my not so good experience with MGM Grand itself, I was told fantastic things about The Signature so I figured ... suck it up and give it a try.\n\nObviously, I should have taken note and lessons learned from my first experience. \n\nI got an incredibly good rate for Signature and thought to myself, great! I can stay at a quieter, off the strip a little place that's luxurious and nice and spend a romantic weekend in Vegas (I know I know ... romantic?!?! ...). I go to check in and they can't find my reservation.\n\nI pull up my confirmation letter, which I was prepared with, and the manager looks at it and tells me that my reservation doesn't exist. He doesn't apologize, doesn't say it's lost, he plain fricken just says it doesn't exist. Ok... either way, I'm already here, I drove here, I'm not going to go back, so can they book me a room?\n\nSure, at full price! What?! Really? Seriously?\n\nWonderful. Just what I needed. After many, many agonizing minutes of trying to find some upper management, I finally get a more reasonable rate (not my super deal price though) for a stay and the whole check in took over an hour. \n\nI had to reiterate my thoughts on MGM, no matter how nice the place is, how luxurious, how comfortable the bed, this place doesn't leave you happy and that's the worst star rating in my book.
