Hit by a rock? SERIOUSLY CALL BROCK! He was at my house within 2 hours after me calling him and was done with the job in a very timely manner. I had a chip in my windshield that started to branch out and when he was done it was so smooth and barely visible. Great customer service, phenomenal job, and an even better deal! Thanks Brock!!
