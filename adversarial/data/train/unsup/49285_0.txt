Was really looking forward to trying this place out based on recommendations from friends and internet reviews, but sadly our experience wasn't that great. Got there at 7pm and our drinks and app came out quite quickly. The fried pickles were awesome. Placed our order of chicken and waffles and fish tacos around 7:10. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. The waitress periodically stopped by to say sorry or that it was coming up soon, but we didn't actually get food until almost 7:50. I'm giving it three stars because the food is actually great and the restaurant is very cool looking, but our server seemed apathetic and the wait was ridiculous for these two meals. Would also like to point out that the restaurant was not very busy on a Thursday evening. We will give it one more chance in the future because I want to like it and maybe the kitchen was having a problem, or something?
