Surprise charges to credit card! Might be better off with a taxi ... \nI have experienced a few mistake charges on my account. Last night I selected a ride in UberX and was charged the fare for UberSelect (which is almost double), when I acquired about it, the customer service team dismissed me swiftly and refused to offer any sort of adjustment. This sort of problem happened before with uber (no promo code application, driver that never showed up in which I had to cancel and was charged).
