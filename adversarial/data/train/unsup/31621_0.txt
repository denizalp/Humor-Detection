Lets face it.. Its starbucks.. very similar to all the other starbucks in the city. What I like about this location is their sitting area has plenty of shady spots so even when I was outside in 100 degree temperature I felt relatively comfortable. All the staff was wonderful and even with a packed house the drinks arrived in a timely fashion.. Def recommend.
