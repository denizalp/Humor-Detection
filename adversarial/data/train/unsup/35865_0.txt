Overall this was a great experience we went here for lunch just taking a break from mall shopping.  The staff were really friendly and attended to all of our needs they double checked on our table regularly and our drinks never went empty. It was a great experience and the sushi was super fresh.  I would highly recommend this restaurant!!  It also was the right price!  The bento box is an excellent value.
