So, somebody decided to surprise me and show up to my office with some doughnuts. Yep, it doesn't take much to make me happy - just visit me with food in hand is all it takes. \n\nHe got us an apple fritter, doughnut holes, chocolate-glazed, chocolate-glazed buttermilk doughnut, chocolate-glazed chocolate cake, Bavarian cream-filled and a blueberry doughnut. If Dunkin' Donuts and Krispy Kreme had a babies, they would've been Dee's Nuts...errr...Dee's Donuts. What the heck am I talking about?\n\nYou know how dense and heavy Dunkin' Donuts' doughnuts are and how light Krispy Kreme doughnuts are? Dee's Donuts' doughnuts are right in the middle. The cake doughnuts are moist (ugh! Such a gross word). The chocolate glaze they use taste richer. Yum!
