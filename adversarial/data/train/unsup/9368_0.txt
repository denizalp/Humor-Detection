Every time I coming to the store it's like kicking myself square in the junk  over and over. The customer service seems to get worse and worse.  I told them that the price labels are wrong and some one should check them, the cashier looked at me like I was speaking German!! Next time I contemplate coming into the store I think I'll hit myself in the head with a hammer and see if I still feel like going after that. I suppose this is part of the high cost of low prices.
