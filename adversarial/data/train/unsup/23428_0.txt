Yet another less than stellar experience at BMW North Scottsdale- apparently the norm for this BMW branded Penske dealership. Which is even more disappointing since I purchased a BMW here and you would think they'd at least try to retain their purchase business.\n\nOver a year ago I had routine maintenance performed on my 2007 328i in which during the inspection the service technician noted that I should consider replacing the brakes. His recommendation was hardly a consideration as his exact words were, \"it's almost illegal for me to allow you to drive off this lot with your brakes the way they are.\"\n\nThis might hinder a normal person, but having no signs or other indications that my brakes were nearing the end of their useful life I drove the car off the lot and took the vehicle to a Firestone Auto Shop for a second opinion. To my great surprise they said, \"You have at least a year--if not longer left if you're driving 15k miles per year.\"\n\nOkay--strike one. Tell someone they need something that costs more than $800 when it isn't true. 2nd strike... Firestone could complete the work for less than $500 (and the service tech said even they overcharge). Great.\n\nOver a year later, I am preparing to transport myself to work early in the morning and upon starting the car I hear the caution noise and see two things out of the ordinary on the display.\n\nSince I am usually level headed, I consult the owner's manual for advice and guidance as if it's my financial advisor. It maintains that the illuminated lights are the roadworthiness light as well as the parking brake light.\n\nAs I back the car out of the garage to drive, it feels as though the car has the emergency brake still engaged (likely the result of me seeing the dash display a light I associate with the parking brake being engaged) and I take the necessary step of contacting BMW North Scottsdale to see if they understand the warning messages.\n\nThe advisor says--without confidence and after putting me on hold to check, \"It's fine to drive- you need brakes.\" Don't worry.\n\nDon't worry?\n\nJust about every light on the dash is illuminated and the car feels like I'm going to stop dead while hurtling down the 51 towards downtown Phoenix and YOU didn't sound very sure on the phone. Plus, one of the illuminated lights says, \"Roadworthiness\" which wasn't there before. Doesn't that mean the car probably shouldn't be driven? I had visions of my estate receiving millions from the liability that BMW would incur after my untimely demise and elected to leave the car in the garage.\n\nHaving remembered my prior Firestone experience, I called them again for direction. Unfortunately there wasn't anyone there that could diagnose a BMW and that they said the best bet was to take the vehicle to the dealership.\n\nThe vehicle is towed and BMW is kind enough to provide a loaner car while they diagnose the situation.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that when the service advisor calls back with their typical snotty attitude that I need brakes and the cost will be exorbitant.\n\nI call Firestone and say, \"they've already determined the problem- can you fix this and what would the cost be?\"\n\nYes and significantly less were the answers. So I visit BMW to retrieve my car and thank them for their hard work diagnosing (ie. using a computer to run codes) my problem. \"That'll be $70, please.\"\n\nFine- significantly less than BMW plus $70 still equals significantly less than BMW.\n\nDays later, I receive a survey in my email asking me about my experience. In which I provided honest feedback about my level of trust and the price gouging that I have previously and continue to experience here. I submit the survey and move along.\n\nA week later, somewhat to my surprise, I receive an email from Mark Kaiser the Fixed Operations Director at BMW North Scottsdale.\n\nHe begins, \"I am a little perplexed because I am not sure what more we could have done...\"\n\nReally? You're perplexed? I don't know- not charge $70 for someone to read a computer screen and provide advice that supports an initially questionable recommendation?\n\nHe continues, \"...the symbol you were describing indicated you car needed brakes. It was apparent that you didn't trust their opinions and didn't feel comfortable to drive your car because you felt the emergency brake was stuck on.\"\n\nYou. Your. Typo- it's okay, we all make mistakes and yes, your description was correct.\n\nNow for the economics lesson, \"we had to pay our technician to inspect it and he verified it needed brakes and you declined to have them serviced. This is the reason for the charge to you. It is also my understanding that we provided you with a BMW loaner car for the weekend and washed your vehicle during your service visit.\"\n\nThank you for washing my car... Danny's charges $14.99 without a coupon. That's your economics lesson. END PART 1.
