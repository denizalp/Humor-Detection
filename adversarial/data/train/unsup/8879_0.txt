If you can disregard the overblown gross thoughts that come with the revelry of hundreds of drunken fools in a public waterway, you can be assured of a good time minus the standard sunburn you're certain to receive. Apply sunblock and reapply every hour! That can't be stressed enough.\n\nSalt River Tubing surpassed my expectations in terms of customer service and comfort. Given the sheer volume of customers as we arrived, things moved pretty quickly, from waiting in line for our tubes or waiting to board the antiquated bus. $15 buys you an intertube rental and roundtrip bus ride to\/from your riverside entry\/exit. But if you can supply your own tubes and\/or rides, it's free, or $12 for the roundtrip bus ride. Lucky for us it was Pirate Day and our bus driver was an absolute riot, taking the corners extremely fast and mumbling at his parrot. Additionally, we got to gawk at all the pirate themed groups of people as they floated past. Tubing veterans are apparent with their inflatable rafts, blow-up swimming pools and waterproof sound systems. THAT is the way to do it folks.\n\nBe prepared to be pelted by marshmallows from fellow floaters and to see other assorted garbage floating about. Protect your feet by wearing shoes -- raggedy old shoes will do. You can never have enough food\/drink\/water, and If in doubt, bring more.
