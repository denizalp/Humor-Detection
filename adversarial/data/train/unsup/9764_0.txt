My GF is a fan of the Girls Next Door Show so I surprised her with tickets to the Peepshow. It was a very high energy show, the women were all great dancers, the singing and comedy were also well done. \nYou got to love it when your GF notices that all the topless women were natural with the exception of Holly Madison (very not natural).\nAhh Holly, very beautiful woman, not the best actress or dancer. But the way the show is written she does not have to be.\nWe stayed around for the meet and greet and had a chance to talk to her and have our photos taken (another surprise for my GF).\nIf you are a fan of the GND show, go see it, if your not a fan...stay away
