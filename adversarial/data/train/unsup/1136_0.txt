I've been wanting to come here for a while. I finally had the chance on mothers day. I have to say I went in with high expectations and while it was good it wasn't great. I felt our waiter was a bit frazzled and slow at first but seemed to settle in as brunch progressed.\n\nI went with beignets for my app which were fresh and perfect. To drink I went with the blood orange cocktail. While it was strong it wasn't as flavorful as I had been hoping it would be. I also must mention the fruit bowl on the kids menu. It was fresh and perfectly ripe and I stole a few berries from my boy. My entree was huevos rancheros. The flavors were bold I really enjoyed it. I also had a mimosa. It was perfectly mixed with about 2\/3 champaign and 1\/3 oj. I look forward to coming back and trying dinner. Hopefully service doesn't start out as slow.
