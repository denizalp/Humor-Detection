I have used Bark! Twice since my first review and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. Ciara is amazing. She takes her job seriously and is one of the most compassionate and caring individuals I have ever met. I can leave and relax because I know my dog is in good hands. Bonus...Ciara makes homemade treats that she leaves after her service has ended!!!
