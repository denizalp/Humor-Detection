This is a good arena to see live music. There aren't really any bad seats because it just is not all that huge.  Also, they have huge screen monitors so you can see close ups of Neil Diamond's face while he sings, \"America\", \"Sweet Caroline\", \"Cracklin' Rosy\" and many other hits. I would hit another show at this arena again anytime.  \n\nHOWEVER!  Service at the bar SUCKS AZZ!!!!  40 minutes to get 2 drinks, 1 beer and 1 glass of wine. WTF?  Have more people working and get these drinks served. I can guarantee you will sell more drinks if people do not have to wait in 45+ minute lines to grab a cock. And this is not hyperbole. I will guarantee it, or you can have your cocks back.
