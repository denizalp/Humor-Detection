I really enjoy this range. It is fully stocked with everything you could possibly need - ammo, gear, targets, new & used... you name it. The range itself is the only one we like to visit. While expensive (IMO), they frequently offer Groupons which I highly recommend. \n\nMy hubby and I went using a Groupon (that's how we found this place), and enjoyed our experience. We always felt safe, and knew we were under the watchful eye & help of the team should we need anything.\n\nWe rented several handguns, and when one jammed up, the team was able to come out and fix it for me. No biggie - it happens... I'm just glad to know they're on hand if I need help or feel uncertain.\n\nAt one point, a team member came out asking if I was interested in some advise. Gladly, I said \"YES!\" She was giving me some pointers on how to rack the gun since I seemed to be having difficulty. \n\nOverall, it's a clean, safe, accessible and friendly facility. We drive here from Mooresville just because of the Groupons and the friendly staff. Recommended!
