Really cool concept, but still needs some kinks worked out!  I don't like having to wait in a roped off line to get a drink at only one bar!  There are tons of people waiting for tables too when most of the tables were actually empty.  I guess they are trying to build exclusivity.  \n\nI'll be back when the seafood joint opens and hope it won't be so chaotic.  Again, cool concept, great drinks and food with a good location!
