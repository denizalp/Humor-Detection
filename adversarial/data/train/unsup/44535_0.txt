Located on the Barclay Downs side of Southpark Mall (stop by California Pizza Kitchen for a salad to re-fuel) is a big box store full of big boxes.  And little boxes.  And medium boxes.  Mesh boxes.  Plastic boxes.  Etc.  \n\nIf visiting during prime dining hours, be aware that this is near the food court, CPK, McCormick and Schmick's and City Tavern, so parking can be a bit of a stress.  \n\nIn a new home with minimal storage, I came to The Container Store after visiting their website to see if I could find some storage solutions, as well as a new container to keep the cat food fresh so picky #1 and picky #2 wouldn't stop eating their food half way through the very expensive bag.\n\nTo store the quilts that my mother has so lovingly made for me, I found a natural fiber woven looking laundry basket to put next to the fireplace full of quilts for colder days for $40.  I also found a cute plastic pet food container with paw prints painted on for $10.  \n\nI do think that some of the prices here are a little high, while some are average.  A couple of things that I saw seemed like great solutions to storage issues, but while perusing another website for a big box store, I was able to find similar items for slightly lower prices, and when you couple that with the 20% coupons that are continually sent, the other place was a better bargain.  However, if you are wanting higher end items, just like spending more money, or need perhaps unique items, The Container Store is the place for you.  I very much enjoyed browsing through the aisles getting ideas.  I took some pictures of some items, so I will return when motivated to complete my next organizational task.
