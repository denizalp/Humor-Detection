WOW.\n\nI never thought I would be so impressed with something as simple as a lemon tart or a hazelnut puff pastry, but La Gourmandine is solely responsible for spoiling my appetite for dinner.  I jumped straight to the dessert and sat on the couch with mixed feelings of satisfaction and disappointment in my inability to restrain myself and wait to eat the delicious desserts until after dinner.  Oh well!
