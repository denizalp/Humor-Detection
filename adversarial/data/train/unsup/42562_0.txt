The best place for a burger in Markham. Been coming here the past 15 years and the quality of the home burger has never changed. French fries are always fresh too! These guys do Greek food exceptionally good too! 5 stars all around. \n\nIf you're staying to eat at the restaurant it's a bit dated, but it adds to the greasy spoon experience. Don't be silly and expect the \"keg experience\" some past reviewers have come to expect.
