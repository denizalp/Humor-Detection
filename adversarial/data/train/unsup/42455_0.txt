This place is great. There are some reviews on here from a few years ago which makes me think that this place is either under new management or had a huge turn around. All statements about the chips and salsa are true (they are great) and that can be said for the margs too! My fiance and I go for the Happy Hour which is amazing. We love the crab cakes and tacos. The prices for the main entrees are a bit crazy for us, but the happy hour pricing is great. I would call this upscale tex-mex. Just thinking about Cantina Laredo has my mouth watering...guess its good we plan on going tonight.
