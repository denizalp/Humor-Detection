Not my favorite Barriques location, but I do enjoy the bright interior.\n\nIt's just a bit too loud at times, and can get really cold during the winter with people coming in and out of the front door.\n \nBuuuuuut, they do have wine and beer tastings all the time, and while I don't consider myself an alcoholic, I do consider myself an-enjoyer-of-fine-alcoholic-drinks-at-all-times-of-the-day kind of person.
