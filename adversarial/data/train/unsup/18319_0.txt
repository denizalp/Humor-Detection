Long on my list of quick lunch places to try, I finally made it to Hummus Xpress. And, I have hence determined this is an immensely dangerous find as I work nearby and will have to give them all my lunch money in exchange for tasty Mediterranean food. \n\nSimilar to the Chipotle-style of choosing your ingredients (and having no one to blame but yourself if the combo is questionable), you first choose between a bowl, salad, pita or plate. Then all the options begins... \n\nChicken, braised beef, falafel, veggies, or gyro leads to a selection of 7 hot veggies ranging from lemon kale to fried eggplant. Then you made choice on 6 different hummus flavors (cilantro jalape√±o actually has a bit of a kick!) Then salad choices (tabouli, kale onion, lentil kale) to finally finish off with an impressive array of toppings. Everything is full of flavor and cooked well, and the staff was efficient and nice. \n\nI'm already plotting my next bowl for my return visit.
