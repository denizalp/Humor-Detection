This place is open 12 hours a day (from 10 am to 10 pm) and has a delivery, good for me and for people that don't want to leave their houses on weekends. The food is pretty good but pricey according to the portions they serve. You have to wait for your order for very long, even if the restaurant isn't busy at capacity. I don't like the open kitchen because od the various fumes and food odor and the mess inside is visible too. This why if you like their food it's better to take a delivery.  \nI have been here and ordered delivery several times. Not all of their dishes are tasty, prepared and seasoned well. My favorite dishes are The Catfish and The Chicken and Waffles. I love the Cornbread, as well, it's very tasty. \nOverall, this is a standard place with average food, you can find better places to eat.
