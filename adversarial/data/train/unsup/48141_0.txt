Best bagels ever.  I ordered the lox and requested that they toast my bagel really well. I got exactly what I asked for. They had fresh coffee, and the ambiance was great.  Loved the photos they had on their overhead TV. Showed lots of platters, and so many different pastries. \n\nThe service was also great. When I visit Vegas again, I will definitely make an attempt to visit them again!
