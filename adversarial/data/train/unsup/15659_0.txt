I love have love\/hate with this store. Great prices but horrible when it comes to staffing their cashiers. Great food court but how can  I say that when I see a roach on their counter. The store manager happened to be walking the area so I told him to come and see what I had found.. A ROACH. He killed it and walked away. No apology or nothing. TODAY I Was in line for 45 mins at check out. I finally decided to leave a full kart of groceries, wasting at least another hour from picking up my items. Store manager was working a cash register- a sign of poor management. Get someone that is capable of running a store this size.. THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME.. UGH
