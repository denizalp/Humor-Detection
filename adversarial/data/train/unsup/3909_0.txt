I always love coming to this hotel no matter if it's for a staycation or simply to shop and grub. As locals we can take advantage of deals, for out of staters it's hard. This hotel is always priced right for what it delivers. Caution this hotel can get very busy due to conventions and the convention center attached. If you want a more quiet hotel I wouldn't come here. It's always packed. For conventions this hotel is mobbed. Restaurants are a massive wait if there is a convention. \n\nIf you are looking for fun shops Mandalay place has some great spots. Like the noodle house and house of blues. Both offer different experiences. Also both have great food. House of blues is great if you like concerts and music venues. House of noodles is my favorite because I'm a food junky and noodles are in my blood :)\n\nIf you are trying to stay here make sure there isn't a convention if there isn't one stay here and make sure you pop into the aquarium. It's absolutely stunning full of beautiful sea life that you can't see many other places. Plus the ticket prices are great for not wanting to leave the hotel. \n\nAll and all this place is fantastic and if you do it right I guarantee you will stay at this hotel the next time you are In vegas. It's why locals like me choose this hotel. Such beauty!
