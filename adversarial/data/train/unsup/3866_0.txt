I will not be removing this, I removed the pictures as requested by YELP! \n\nThis is a fair review of your services that you delivered to us. If we could of given 0 stars we would of. If you don't like the review maybe you should change the standard of services you're delivering. \n\nYou can stop emailing me offering me a cheaper service to remove this and you can stop threatening me..\n\nYour customers will read your comments and realise what kind of person you are! \nAs if I would pay nearly $200 and ruin my own nails! Seriously if you would like to get legal advice we can have your phone calls submitted for the evidence also your emails and your threats enough now. \n\nI'm reporting you for harassment!
