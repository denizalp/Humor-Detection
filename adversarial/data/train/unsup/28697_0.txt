Stopped by cause we went to the Asian store and discovered a hidden gem! Super nice owner, Joe, took over former taco shop and its amazing! Tried the carne asada taco and its on a home made corn tortilla! Sampled the Pastor w\/pineapple and decided to give the windy city fries a try. Very tasty!!! We will be back! This is a mom and pop type shop and every one should try it! I haven't tried much but what we did try was great!
