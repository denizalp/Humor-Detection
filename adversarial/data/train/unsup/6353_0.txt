Nepalese cuisine: still don't understand exactly what I ate but I like it!\n\nA totally different type of culinary experience within Calgary than what is normal. I had one of the traditional dishes so I could try a bunch of different things and I have to say it was all delicious. I chose the lamb as my meat and it was very good. Look at everyone else's reviews that say essentially the same. \n\nMake a reservation and try it out!
