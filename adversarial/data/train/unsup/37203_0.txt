I went In for a touch up on my full head of highlights. I'm a cosmo but I have nobody to do my hair because I recently moved out in this area and all my cosmos are in my hometown and I can't reach the back of my head myself I didn't want to break the bank and didn't mind getting something less than perfection because anything was better than my terrible grown out regrowth I had two girls who worked on me (iris and Anna)and they were very lovely they asked an instructor whenever they were unsure that way I was not  left for the wolves. two things I didn't like was the fact the instructor insisted against highlights saying there was not enough regrowth to do just the highlights on what was not pre- lightened but as you can see I have at l at least an inch and a half and if they wanted to my hair could of been  highlighted to the midshaft with the lightener but she insisted on me putting bleach on all of my regrowth which made my hair very dry at the root and non dimensional and I was left with a band of yellow simply because my regrowth was so long .. highlights would of made the color transition so much nicer and I would not have to nurse my dry roots or have to add lowlights the other thing that made me so upset was I was charged $50 which if I knew that's what it was gonna cost I would of gone to a professional they charged me extra because two bowls of bleach were checked out  remember I had two students do they each had their own bowl(it shouldn't take that much bleach for root touch ups where you are literally paying extra) and I payed extra for toner if I knew that I would of toned my own hair not to mention it wouldn't of needed a toner with the highlights I wanted in the first place  anyways I'm happy with the students but the fact the school was over charging me for little things included in a professional salon that are expected was absolutely ridiculous especially when I was there for 4 hours. Why would anyone want to come In that long to be charged the same as a professional salon so I would be carful
