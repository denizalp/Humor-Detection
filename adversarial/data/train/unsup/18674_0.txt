Residing in the boonies most of the time makes it hard to find good, close restaurants. Tom Yum north Phoenix is definitely the go to Thai food joint for me. The drunken noodles with the duck is so incredible I'm considering ordering it right now! The Panang curry is also excellent but beware when they say hot they mean HOT! I've only ever got food to go so I can't comment on the service but I would definitely stop in and check it out if you're looking for a good Thai joint!
