Angel was the cheapest quote around for installing a new rear wheel bearing on my 2004 Subaru Forester. I knew it was going to be a tough job from the start, but Angel made it happen. These Subaru wheel bearings can be a pain in the ass and this one was no exception. Good customer service and easy to deal with. Very accommodating.
