Stopped by Portion for lunch with my co-worker. The place has been updated since it was Mirch Masala just a few months ago. We perused the menu and we both independently selected the chicken salad wrap, cuz how could you go wrong with that?\n\nYou order ahead of time at a register, pay, and then seat yourself and wait for your food. If you pay with debit\/credit card, you have to tip in advance. If you have cash, you can tip after. They have free refills on drinks.\n\nThe cashier delivered our food to our table and offered refills. The wraps looked good and so did the french fries that my co-worker ordered. I opted for jalapeno potato chips, which were very tasty. The wraps were served with a slice of tasty dill pickle.\n\nBoth of us found the chicken salad wraps to be bland. They had a good portion of chicken in them and they had the right amount of dressing, but they could have used some pecans, walnuts, grapes, onions, celery...ya know, flavor!  The lettuce gave it a good crunch. The quality was very good. I wouldn't order it again unless they kicked it up a notch.\n\nI might stop back, but I might not.
