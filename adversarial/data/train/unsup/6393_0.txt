Yes it's true. I go to a barbershop instead of a beauty salon. Why? This barbershop is cool. Not only are you going to get a haircut, they also give you a hot shave, hot steaming towel on your face after you get a cut and a shoulder massage for such a reasonable price. It's so rejuvenating! I've never had that kind of special treatment from other haircutting shops for the same amount. The stylists here are from Persia and Russia, so this is probably how they do it in their country. Sweet!
