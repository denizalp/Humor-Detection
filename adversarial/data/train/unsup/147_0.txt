One I the worst massage experiences ever.  For 90 minutes all I heard was the therapist chewing gum, people loudly talking and walking in and out, plus actual elevator music - the bad renditions of 80's songs.  The technique was not even poor - it was non-existent.  The massage consisted of slight pressing by barely leaning.  \n\nWhen the receptionist asked if I enjoyed it I said no and told her about the gum chewing and poor massage.  All she said was, \"oh, that was rude.\"  She then asked if I had a loyalty card or if this was my first time.  I said it was my first and last time.  She replied, \"Well, that will be $45.\"   UNBELIEVABLE.
