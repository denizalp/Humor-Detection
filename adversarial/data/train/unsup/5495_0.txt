My 6 yr old was ready for her very first piercing!  I was looking for something professional, not the usual mall piercing places.  Because it was for my little girl, safety and sanitation was priority and that I got at Sadu plus much more.\nI called and spoke with Cindy. She was very sweet over the phone and went over the requirements with minors. I ended up calling two more times (to make the apt and then find out parking info) and spoke with a guy named Mike who was equally courteous.  Upon arriving I was greeted and Cindy soon came to help us. She asked my daughter some questions to make sure she was ready and we went on with the process of choosing the earrings, etc.  \nI am beyond satisfied with our experience. Cindy explained all that was to happen as she unwrapped the tools. Oh, big plus here, the cleanliness of Sadu was impeccable. Everything was sterilized and neatly stored.  The room was clean and gloves were changed more than once during our visit to ensure cleanliness. \nUnfortunately, my daughter chickened out after the first lobe piercing and Cindy couldn't have been any more patient and wonderful. She went far and beyond to make her experience less frightening. Even told stories, gave my girl a Popsicle, the works!  She was just an amazing person.  Thankfully, (and after 2 hours) my daughter calmed down enough where Cindy felt comfortable piercing the second lobe.  I was so embarrassed by the delay my daughter cause and honestly I wanted to slap her for backing down after begging for pierced ears and promising she was ready.  \nOverall, the customer service I received exceeded my expectations!  This review is not typical but it goes to show the quality of the business in handling different clients, even children, with respect and patience.  I would give 10 stars if I could. \nOh and my girl's ears look so cute and she loves them!  She can't stop talking about how happy she is to have earrings. :)
