I do love me some Pacific Mall!  Where else in the GTA can I get boxes of eyelashes, Hello Kitty car mats, shark fin soup, eye glasses, DVD's, dried persimmons and a jade necklace in one place?!\n\nFor all the stalls and vendors, the layout is quite good.  If you are going, I recommend to do so during the week when the crowds are at bay, and to park underground so you do not need to schlep your jacket around with you.  I have also been told that this mall is fairly easy to access by public transit from downtown.\n\nThere are 2 levels of shopping.  The top level is mostly food services.  Do not miss out on the bubble tea and juice.  I had a strawberry banana juice (in February!) that was to die for.\n\nCash is the preferred method of payment for most vendors.  There is only one cash machine on the main shopping level on the far north side.  Also, there are washrooms only on the top shopping floor and the top floor of underground parking.
