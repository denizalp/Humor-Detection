Five stars to Pita Jungle for being one of the handful of places that my mom, dad, husband  all enjoy. Oh, and I love it.\n\nAfter about 2 hours of deliberations last night we decided to head over to the Scottsdale location. Bad news was that it was a 25 minute wait. The wait was made even worse by the fact that I'm quite sure the hostess accidentally skipped over us at least once. But once we sat down we forgot all about it. The parents had the salmon ($13), my husband had the seafood provencal and I had the med platter (it's the first time i\"ve gotten anything other than the lentil fattoush salad, which is one of my all-time favorite meals). We all all got the cup of red lentil Turkish soup which was fabulous!\nEveryone was happy and full at the end of the meal and my dad was even excited about how cheap everything was.. thank you Pita Jungle.
