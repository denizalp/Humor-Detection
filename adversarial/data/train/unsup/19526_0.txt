Serendipity- a fortunate accident.  We were fortunately happy after dining here.  \n\nLocated in front of Caesars, you can't miss the pink decor building. I had been here before just for their famous frozen hot chocolate.  My friend wanted to come here to eat so I obliged.  We had a pleasant experience versus my previous time.  Service was good and the food was better.  \n\nWe split the T-BLT sandwich and onion rings.  That was more than enough food for both of us.  The onion rings had a great flavor since it was dusted with Romano cheese.  The sandwich was piled high with turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomato on sourdough.  Everything was tasty and would order again.  Of course she had to try the frozen hot chocolate.  It was better than the first time I had it and was happy she liked it as well.  \n\nPrices are a little high here so don't forget your Total Rewards card to knock off a few bucks.
