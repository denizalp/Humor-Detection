i bought a groupon for the puppy package and called ahead to make an appointment, although they told me they had already discontinued the groupon they were still able to accommodate me :) \n\nthe puppy package basically came with nails trim, ears cleaning, anal glands, wash and a trim.\n\nthe place is a small hole in the wall shop located on spring mountain and decatur, but the people were so kind! the service was prompt and professional. my shihtzu came back happy and clean.
