It's a modern take on the traditional way of ordering pizza. This place is a fusion of Domino's meets Sunway. I love the concept since I love getting  unlimited toppings and the thin crust pizza. Additional option to get pink sauce (alfredo + marinara) a perfect cherry on top of this package. My favorite is Thin crust w\/ pink sauce mushroom onions fennel sausage and meatballs. I always ask them to make is well done. On Tuesdays all pizzas are $6. You should definitely check this place put at least once.
