Aly did a wonderful job on my haircut and blow out today. She was super nice - everyone at the salon was super nice - and had a nice chair side manner. She listened to what I wanted and gave great advice on texturizing my layers. Right before I left I had a concern about how one side of my hair was laying and the owner took the time to take a look at it. It turned out it was just weird how I was running my hands through it and was totally fine. The space was trendy and clean. I was checking out the other clients and everyone looked great when they left. I used a cheapy groupon and wasn't treated differently as sometimes that could happen with some boutique salons. I had a little sticker shock at the haircut prices when I first looked them up, but after seeing that they really give a quality experience and a beautiful cut, I will definitely be back to see Aly!
