I've read many bad reviews about course (many were quite true). However, I've been coming to this place for around 2 years and for the deal you can't beat it. \n\nYes, there was one time I saw a homeless guy living in a one man shanty town that he cobbled under the wash that runs between #10 and #18. Yes, I did see a man on Nellis (drinking a 4Loko at 3 pm in broad daylight on the street) get into a screaming argument with a golfer between a chain link fence for apparently no reason. Yes, sometimes you do have to play winter rules after your ball snuggles up next to a crumpled Natural Ice tall boy on the side of the fairway. And yes, a stray pitbull did pick up my golfing buddy's ball in it's mouth and run for about 50 yards back towards the tee after a drive. All of this is true. I think that's part of the reason I keep coming back.\n\n I've played some pretty nice courses, but this one has charm. However, for locals after twilight - $15 for 18 holes and a cart can't be beaten. Desert Rose has a pretty nice practice area with full chipping and putting greens, a sand trap and very cheap range balls with grass practice tees. They even have a pretty good deal on 6 Michelob Ultra's and you get a cooler. The staff has always been very nice every time I've been there. \n\nIf people want to complain, this course is what it is: a great deal. If you don't want to complain go to Rio Secco and pay $200 a round.
