Short Review\n\nThe Wild Leak Pizza was great although the crust is somewhat burnt which I don't like. Plus it cost like $13 bucks so its not as expensive considering the pizza is cooked in a wood oven at the back of the restaurant that is also a open kitchen. \n\nThe atmosphere was alright considering I went here late at night, the booze really complimented it. For a steamwhistle\/beer its about $5 dollars which its an average rate of pricing in Toronto. \n\nThe service was friendly but I didn't like when my server, Jesse (I think) called me a \"little man\" which was really rude.
