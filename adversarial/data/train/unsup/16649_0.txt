Five stars for straw delivery from Shelby...\n\nMy husband found Mesa Feed Barn a few years back when we were preparing to host Thanksgiving... We were seeking hay stacks and Mesa Feed Barn had what we needed.\n\nWe've been using them annually ever since.  \n\nOur needs are a bit niche with stacks of straw delivered and picked up for Thanksgiving each year, but I wouldn't hesitate to seek out Mesa Feed Barn for other products if I lived close by.\n\nWe've been pleased with our service, the pricing, and professionalism at MFB.  We hope to continue to support this local business for years to come!
