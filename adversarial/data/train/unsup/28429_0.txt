My dad got the Marzen and I got the HEF...banana and clove, yup...Thnx server guy, sorry I forget ur name. \n\nThe food was Okay...But the Garlic fries are AWESOME ! ! ! at least with a Beer they are...\n\nI got the Beef Dip and my Dad got a Club sandwich...Good but it's not like they're reinventing the wheel with these two classics...\n\nBEER BEER BEER !
