I hired them to remove a car from a parking lot that was being repaved in an apartment complex I owned. They were hired to move the car from the parking lot to the side lot.\n\nAs soon as they hooked the car up to their tow truck, they stated that they were legally required to tow it to their impound lot. I am stuck paying a $350 fee to get one of my tenant's cars out of impound and brought back to the lot.
