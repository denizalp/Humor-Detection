I got to try Poke for the first time when this place opened up at Yonge and Wellesley. I loved every bit of it. Albeit a little too expensive for everyday lunch, portions are generous and selection is great. I got chicken bowl as i am not too big on salmon. Purple rice was surprisingly flavorful. Definitely recommend.
