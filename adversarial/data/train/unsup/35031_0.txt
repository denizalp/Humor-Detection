Bonfyre ... what happened to you?  I used to have two (yes, two) five star reviews for Bonfyre.  But recently, my experiences have been less than spectacular.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I couldn't justify 4.  \nFirst off, the desserts have started to taste old and stale.  My last one was literally so stale that the top was solid (it's supposed to be mousse).  The wait for the food has gotten annoyingly long and the service is starting to slip.  These are all things that have set Bonfyre apart from other restaurants.  The food used to be out before you could blink and the service was soooo attentive.  They'd ask you if you wanted a refill before you realized you needed one.  Their food is still pretty good (mostly).  I used to never be disappointed by the food but now sometimes it's like \"eh, I've had better\".  So, now they're OK, nothing to write home about.  So, Patrick Q from Bonfyre - it's ironic that you commented on my 5 star Bonfyre review that I wrote in May, because it reminded me that it needed updating.  Thanks.
