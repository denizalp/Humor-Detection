True rating = 0 star.\nWORSE Japanese restaurant EVER!!!!!!\nI ordered grilled pacific salmon dinner for $19.50.  It came with rice, miso soup and salad.\nSo, here's why i rated it 0 star:\nThe salmon was dry and hard to dig into.  When i told the waitress that the fish was over cooked, her immediate response was a defiant \"NO!\"  I insisted that it was and would like a replacement, she went to the kitchen to consult with someone and came back saying that it's Pacific Salmon.  Unlike Atlantic salmon, it's harder.  I told her that i had lots of Pacific Salmon before and this issue is with the cooking, not the texture of the fish.  She then went away again and an older guy came to me.  I showed him how tough it was to cut into the fish and he told me that it's pacific sockeye salmon, and they are all like this and he walked away.  He didn't want to replace the salmon, nor did he offer for me to order something else that a decent restaurant would do for their customers.  \nAlso the waitress didn't even bother to refill our empty cups with water.\nPoor attitude from the staff and poorly made food.   Terribly disappointing.
