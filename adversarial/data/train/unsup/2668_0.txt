I'm salivating just thinking about these moist, chewy squares of goodness. Fairytale Brownies are literally the most delicious things I have ever eaten in my life. \n\nThey are a favorite corporate thank you gift and they were sent many a time to the office at my last job, so I've had the opportunity to try almost every flavor. Each one lives up to the fairytale name!\n\nOrder some and you'll see what I mean.
