We had a lamb and vegetable biriyani. Food was flavourful and not too hot and the taste of spices came through. \n\nThe ambience though is average. Considering the restaurant opened recently, my chair was rickety and the table was not too stable - a case of cheaping out a bit on furniture. Lighting levels ( especially at the central tables where there are no overhead lights) was very low and to read the menu was quite a task. There is a fine line between sophisticated low lighting and just low lighting.
