Hate to say it butteruhh this airport is not-so-great so i appoint it the star named:   \"meh. I've experienced better.\" \n\nAfter quite a trek, I finally found myself at baggage claim, and in good company with all the others who were also---totally confused. Ummm, where the hell are my bags and how the hell will I find them?  That's the sentence (add an F word here and there) I said aloud to self while pacing the 'ZONES.'   Come to find out, you have to check the magical  \"baggage boards\"  first to help you with the search and rescue mission. \n\nSo, once at the wall-O-baggage boards, I struggled to find my zone still. Why you say? Oh because Charlotte is an international hub which meant there were about 200 flights listed by departing city. And nope---not your departing city--but the departing city where you possibly connected. I mean, I can only assume that since OAK was no where on the board. So, when I located Phoenix---another huge hub---you have to then sort by airlines. Oy vey. But then the flights are listed by times...not in pacific time, or central time but eastern time. WTF. And even then...the times were no where near a time associated with any points in my day's travel. \n\nSo here's what I did. Took a quick survey of where the majority of 'US Airways' flights were zoned and noticed most were Zone 2. So off I went in that direction AGAIN... Once there...Zone 2 was marked \"luggage for all cancelled departures only\"   This was due to alllll the cancelled flights due to the East coast winter storm\/blizzards.\n\nAREYOUFRIGGINKIDDINGME?!. \n\nSNAFU!\n\nSo, being a fish out of water, I wandered around like a asinine derelict till over in the corner I spied my doppelganger tagging my bags as abandoned. After a not-so-Navi-like exchange of words, she insisted I dig out my baggage tags that I'd tossed in my purse at the crack of dawn about 12 hours ago. Then, at last, I was on my way... \n\nWhile the experience on the way home wasn't half as bad, it left a lot to be desired too. Shops, employees and overall customer service was for the birds.
