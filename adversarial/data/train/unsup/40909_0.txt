I've got a bit of an athletic shoe fetish. I've studied biomechanics. I've run my entire life and won national and state titles. That said, they get at least three stars for carrying shoes!  However, I don't believe in arch support unless your overweight.  Any architect can tell you that you never put something under an arch, because it weakens the arch.  That said, I don't like running stores that tell people to shy away from barefoot shoes and then micro manage your footwear. It's bad biomechanics.  Old think. I'd like to see them update their selection and save the arch support shoes for those whose weight makes barefoot shoes problematic. Then they'd jump to a 5 for me.
