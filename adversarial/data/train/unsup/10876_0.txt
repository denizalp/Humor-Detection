VIBE \nLoud. Snobby-rich. 18-22 year olds. This was my favourite store when I was 20, I have to admit (hello, Triple Five Soul winter coat FTW) but now? Meh to the super Meh. I never really get anything here anymore. \n\nTHE GOODS\nIf you like your shirts $200 plus, then this is the store for you (or your rich parents). Lots of TNA (the brand), Talula et al. It just always looks the same. But tank tops? Sometimes they have some fabulous tank tops or hoodies. \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nMore A-rich-ia and less A-ritz-ia. I take my business across the street to H&M, where I can afford the merchandise.
