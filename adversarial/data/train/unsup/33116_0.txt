Being that I had two kiddos with me the day I went, I can understand the paranoid security guards following us.. But it was a little excessive... On a better note. The exhibits we had seen were very nice. They had very antique furniture and pottery, paintings and tapestries, modern art displays, and some scary\/ disturbing\/ loud displays that my kids and I had to scurry away from. This was a very nice museum. I will, however, recommend coming here with no kids and lots of time on your hands. You have to really take the time to understand and see everything! There is so much!
