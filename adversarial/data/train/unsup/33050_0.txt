Corey stopped by today and treated our property in Mtn Edge.  As always, he is extremely professional with a nice touch of humor to brighten up my day.   This is the 3rd different property in Las Vegas we have had service from Las Vegas Pest Control and we are very happy customers.  Good value & top notch service!
