Summary: tiny pho spot is efficient (5 min from ordering to eating), and cheaper than restaurants in the same price, but is expensive compared to other pho restaurants\n\nTop Must-Get: House Special Pho\nTop Regret: Watching the TV inside the restaurant\n\nI've come here a couple of times for lunch now, and it has always struck me as a quick-eat place if you didn't want to go to Markville Mall's food court. When I was there for lunch on a weekday, there was just one other person eating.\n\n$10.50 for an extra large house special pho is a bit higher than the classic Pho88 variant, and unfortunately it also has less meat, is smaller, and just doesn't taste as good.\n\nThe extra large house special has three tendon pieces (which is AWESOME - some places don't give any), several beef slices (rare and well; the latter ones were a bit rubbery, but that might be because I let them cook too long while trying to take pictures for YELP haha), some tripe (but not enough), and a couple of meatballs.\n\nIt's very simple fare - many other pho spots are getting fancy with eggs and fancy egg noodles, but this is very straightforward. The broth itself had an, uh, interestingly grungy taste. I didn't love it, nor did it fill me.\n\nThe pho came with a SINGLE slice of lime topping which is a bit stingy (most places give at least two or three), and some beansprouts.\n\n\nThe simple washrooms are surprisingly clean for a grubby place - and I mean grubby, because when you turn the washroom light on, the ventilation fan goes on too, and it's so rickety that you might imagine a demonic ghost is about to burst out.\n\nService is typical of a forlorn Asian restaurant. On the plus side, it has a television. On the down side, it plays the Food Network, and it's entirely possible that watching succulent pieces of steak being taste tested on the screen will make you disparage the overly-well beef slices you're trying to gnaw through.
