I had such a great experience at Nohea Nails. I had a voucher for a manicure and even though the service wasn't costing me anything, the tech did a beautiful job and took a lot of time to make sure my nails looked perfect. The salon is beautiful and the owner Zena is so sweet and bubbly. I will definitely be returning. I live across town but I will take the time to drive to The Gramercy just so I can go to Nohea Nails. I can't speak highly enough of Zena and her team.
