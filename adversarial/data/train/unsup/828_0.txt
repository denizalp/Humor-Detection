Updating because after 20+ years of living in Montr√©al I finally went to the Butterflies Go Free exhibit at the Botanical Gardens. Honestly even crowded with annoying people and squawking teens this is totally magic and you should go. Try to go on a weekday morning if you can.\n\nYou wander through desert cacti, spectacular ferns,  beautiful bonsai, and the warmth and smells just make the snowy melting grey outside go away. At the end of the wing you get to a greenhouse full of delicious smelling, butterfly-friendly flowers and the beautiful fluttering delicate otherworldly creatures are everywhere. It's magic. Definitely go.
