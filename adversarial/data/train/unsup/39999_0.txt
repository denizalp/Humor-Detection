I've only tried their lunch menu, apparently their full menu is available after 5pm until 2am. I ordered the vegetable club and my husband tried their black bean burger. Both of our meals were delicious and we'll be back again for sure. The restaurant was a little hard to find, and they had a very cool 80's\/New Wave playlist (I got really excited to hear several tracks by The Cure).
