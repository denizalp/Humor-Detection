I like a good old fashioned cinnamon roll, I had to try these but kept thinking are they using all these different toppings to hide a crappy pastry?\nSo I went with something pretty simple, Carmel frosting with walnuts, the cinnamon roll was soft and fresh, I like to \"unwrap\" my cinnamon roll and eat from the outside in, it was just as delicious on the outside as it was on the inside. I liked the carmel frosting, not overly sweet.  It was a nice size too. My only complaint was that the walnuts were too \"whole\", they needed to be crushed up a bit more. I'm not sure of the one my husband got but it was a messy one! Had pieces of brownie on top and chocolate sauce, he loved it though, said he'd get it again.\nOur big disappointment was with customer service, I read all these great reviews about how friendly they were but the girl that waited on us was not great. It felt like we were bothering her, it was an effort to answer our questions.\nMy husband ended up adding on a cup of coffee, which both carafes were empty when he tried them. Finally a guy from the back helped him out and filled them but the coffee was bad and had coffee ground floating in it.\nI would definitely go back for the cinnamon rolls, its what they are known for. Their name isn't Coffeeholic or Happyholic!
