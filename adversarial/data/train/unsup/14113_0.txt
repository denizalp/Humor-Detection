This place is extra delicious when you're drunk. Sober? It's pretty mediocre. Food is good enough to eat but not great enough to crave. \n\nThey have great late night specials like the $6.99 half pound steak. BUT, it's not \"Steak & Eggs\" like it usually is in other places. You gotta get those eggs as a side! I usually get the Oxtail Soup which is also a late night special of $9.99 after 11pm! I love oxtail soup. It's a pretty generous portion for it's price. Comes with a side of rice too but I usually opt the rice. You add some red chili paste to it and BAM! heaven in your mouth. YUMMMM. \n\nThis place is usually pretty crowed during the late night specials. Lines form and it gets really long. Usually it moves pretty fast though if you don't have a large party. The staff are nice and helpful even when they have to wait on a table full of obnoxious drunk individuals. AKA-- our table. \n\nOverall, good place to sober up!
