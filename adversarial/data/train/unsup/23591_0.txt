Malabar has what you need to succeed in the world of costumes and disguise. Whether you are going all out or need to slap something together in a hurry, they got you covered.\n\nMalabar is easily divided. They have a section for cheaper throwaway costumes and party accessories, another section for legit costume rentals (high quality but expensive) and a third zone for dance costumes (think eight-year-old girls in sequins and eye-makeup and jazz hands). I can't really comment on the latter, so if you're into dance read Denise S's notes on this section.\n\nThe costumes and party supplies section is well stocked. You can get hats, wigs, fake moustaches, and tonnes of accessories like swords or guns or wands. You can pick up a ready-to-go costume or piece something together pretty easily. The rentals department however, is where Malabar truly shines. The costumes are sorted by style, decade and theme, and I'd be shocked if you couldn't find what you needed here. Want to dress like a 17th century dandy? No problem? Need a costume for an astronaut? Sure. Want to dress like a carrot? They can do that. They have a very impressive catalogue of costumes; it's no wonder that film and theatre productions often rent from them.\n\nOh, and be warned: this place is a madhouse during the month (yes, the whole month) of October. Wise owls should plan their elaborate Hallowe'en costumes in advance.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Raising the MALABAR on Toronto's costume scene.\n\nMenu Readability: (cackles)\n\nNeed to mention: A lot of items are final sale.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: According to the Yelp mobile app I am a \"regular\" at Malabar, and yes, I admit this is a little creepy.
