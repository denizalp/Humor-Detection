Brian North and team are the best! We sold our home in one day and Brian is a great negotiator to get to a fair price. They do a great job staging the house and it showed great. He knows the area and understands the market. We highly recommend Brian and his team. He has sold 2 homes for us and we bought one at the right price. Brian and his team definitely add value and we couldn't be more satisfied with our experience.
