Today was the first time I have ever gone to Paris 66. I really really enjoyed it. The waiters were extremely friendly, and the ambiance of the restaurant was extremely vibrant and authentic.\n\nIt was adorable how the waiters greeted patrons in French. Also, the owner of Paris 66 came up and introduced herself, which I thought was really sweet.\n\nThe food was AMAZING. It's currently restaurant week in Pittsburgh, so many places are having a special deal on the food. I got to try escargot (for the first time), beef wellington, and macarons, all for $30.\n\nThe escargot was really tender, and garlicky. It was interesting haha. :p Of course my favorite part was the mararons. In fact, I liked them so much, I took half a dozen home!\n\nMy friends and I are definitely coming back. The fact that there was a really cute waiter definitely didn't hurt either ;D
