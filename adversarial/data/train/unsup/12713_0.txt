'Seriously babe?? A burger joint? Ugh..fine.' Was my response to hubby's suggestion to come here for lunch on a hot Saturday but man, am I glad I did!\n\nLBeLB isn't your typical burger place.. It's not your typical gourmet burger restaurant either. It's simply a creative experience. Sure, if you want a normal burger and fries or grilled cheese you'll find it and it won't be anything special... But, you'll also find a peanut butter, banana, and bacon burger (SO good by the way) alongside a slew of other crazy concoctions.\n\nFood portions are massive, and the food is super delicious. My goat cheese burger was on point and hubby's banana burger was phenomenal. The fries are good, and so is their pickle! I usually hate pickles with a passion, but these ones are dipped in Kool Aid...... Crazy, right? Right! And whoever knows me knows that the crazier the better in my books! Coleslaw was also good but not amazing.\n\nThey also have an extensive drinks menu - everything we tried was awesome. \n \nYes, $20 for a burger and fries might seem steep, but it's totally worth it! We will definitely be coming back to try some other creative inventions! \n\nPop on by and please message me to tell me about what you tried if it was awesome! I can't decide what I'll order next time because I simply want it all.........
