Located in a courtyard off of Main Street, this shop offers an amazing amount of flavored olive oil and vinegar, gift items and fudge. Went with Mom because she was on the hunt for honey ginger balsamic vinegar and was able to find it here. They packaged her purchases nicely for travel. Fudge looked yummy but we were just too full from lunch.
