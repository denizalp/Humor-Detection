Your typical gourmet burger joint in Vegas: overpriced. Located inside the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes, they say they are owned by the same folks as Johnny Rockets and use \"fresh prime Angus beef that's never frozen.\" Do I buy that or not...who knows?\n\nFYI, The menu is not very combo-friendly. An order of a burger does not come with any fries. You have to order the fries separately as the burger only comes with a pickle slice and a small cherry tomato).\n\nAnyways, I got the Cali Club burger on a brioche bun and I'd have to say I've definitely had better \"boutique\" burgers before. The burger was very dry and didn't have that special sauce that typically accompanies burgers. Maybe I overrated having an avocado in my burger. Sounds better on paper than it tastes. I had a bite of my friend's 21st Century burger and it was much better. The fried egg in the 21st Century gave it a distinct and unique taste that was quite delicious.\n\nWe got orders of fresh-cut fries ($4.50) and a tower of onion rings ($9). I was not a fan of the fries. If you like small and skinny fries, this is something you'll love. However, I was a fan of the onion rings...really big and crispy. Goes great with ranch. If you're a fan of spicy, you can even ask for spicy ranch.\n\nThe service was pretty bad. Yes, they have only been open for a few months but the servers did not know what they were doing. She messed up our drink order and our food took FOREVER to come out.  That might be an understatement. Not to mention, it all came out at different times. 1 burger came out, then an order of the fries, then another burger, then the onion rings, etc...Whatever request we had for our waitress, we had to ask multiple times...\n\nTough gourmet burger crowd in Vegas nowadays. With the price I paid, I'd rather go to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR or even Shake Shack. You definitely pay a high price for convenience.
