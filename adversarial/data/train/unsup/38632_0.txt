We visited The Peppermill for breakfast with my family. We wanted a place that was centrally located, and had good food at decent prices. We were not disappointed!\n\nNone of us had been there before, so we made the mistake of ordering an entree each. Their servings are really big! I fill up fast, so I ended up taking more than half of my meal home. My aunt and I both ordered the Spinach and Feta omelette and I really enjoyed it. It had a good amount of feta cheese, which is a big deal to me. They serve it with potatoes and bread. I chose the blueberry muffin which was served warm. Yum!  \n\nMy mom ordered the fruit plate and it was enormous. It included strawberries, grapes, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon. They also give you a small banana nut loaf with marshmallow cream. It was so good!  \n\nMy grandma ordered the Pancake combo. It came with three large pancakes, three eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links. It was a very large entree. I should also mention that I really enjoyed the coffee here. \n\nAll in all, it was a great and very filling meal. The service was really good as well. I'm sure we'll go back.
