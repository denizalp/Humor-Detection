Great location!! I was really impressed the the variety of AÃ§ai and protein bowls. Menu was clear and easy to see every ingredient and add on's. I loved the fresh pressed juice names and different healthy options. It was an overall positive expensive and great customer service. Visually the place looks clean and there a beautiful wall of positive quotes and chalk drawings. I will definitely return again!
