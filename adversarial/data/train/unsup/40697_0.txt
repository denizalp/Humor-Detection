I saw Sarah on last minute notice because I had so much tension in my shoulders and neck, which was giving me such terrible headaches.  She was so kind, and really attentive to my aches and pains. It also helps that the environment was so calming and relaxing from the moment you walk into the door. I will continue to be Sarah's client, she's a hidden gem.
