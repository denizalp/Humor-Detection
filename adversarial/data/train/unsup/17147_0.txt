Yes please! \nMy whole Twisted experience was kicked up for the max due to the uh-mazing bartenders and of course the food:) We made reservations for a table and started off with drinks at the bar. The bar was so much fun, we decided to have our dinner there as well. \n\nDrinks were made with utmost care and precision, the food was just absolutely phenomenal, and did I mention the attentive but not overbearing bartenders? Come check this place out, you won't be disappointed.
