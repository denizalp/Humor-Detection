I've been waiting for over two years to write my review for Jack's Auto Alignment & Brakes. The reason I originally went to Jack was because my brand new tires in which I had put about 7,000 miles on were worn out on the insides for all for tires. Needless to say, my new tires are still going strong, the alignment was the best $85 that I spent on my car. Excellent on time service and I've become a life long customer.
