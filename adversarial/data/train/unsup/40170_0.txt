I must eat Gluten free.  I was so sick of eating cardboard, that I was contemplating a hunger strike...then I found Daily Kitchen.  Very clean for Gluten free folks, extremely delicious for everyone.  I eat there four time per week, never disappointed.  I've catered a lunch for 35 with them as well, food was fabulous, service with Dominic was exceptional.  Their Israeli couscous with truffle oil is phenomenal. Guacamole is the best I have ever had (I just drooled on my keyboard).  I'm eating there tonight, Turkey Chili sounds good.  Highly recommended (if case you didn't catch that already).
