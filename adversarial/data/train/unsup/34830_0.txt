Had a messed up last few days. Week actually.  Just life bs all at once.  Thats led me to workout longer than usual.  The great employees at this location have been the only bright spot. Does that mean im that pissy or they that good?  Whatever.  I needed it.  Clean facilities. Smiling. Attentive.  Caring.  Great post workout fuel.  Special shot out to Carlos for the shirt hookup when i spaced and forgot mine at hotel.
