Damn.  How on earth do you take a quaint little diner, in a quaint little village, in the middle of the quaintiest national park in our quaint nation and screw it up this completely?\n\nMy father took me to Fisher's in the early '70's for lunch.  That could well be the last time they served a decent meal.  It is baffling.  The service borders on arrogant.  \"You want what?  Come on.  Here, try this.  I'm busy.\"  Sheesh.\n\nIn the summer, the bike-riders (self-propelled and internally-combusted) pack the outdoor deck.  All year 'round the parking lot is chock-full of cars, everyone yearning for a great meal to round out a visit to the valley.  I can't imagine more than a few ever return.  Why would they?\n\nI pray that one day another little diner\/cafe\/restaurant opens in or near Peninsula, with an owner who just decides, okay.  Let's have good food, good service, and just for kicks, let's clean the place every night!  Fisher's would become the abandoned shell it deserves to be.
