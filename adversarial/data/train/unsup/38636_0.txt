This place is really big, and almost impossible for just browsing, unless you want to kill some time. \n\nI think the best strategy is to go in looking for something specific, otherwise it's quite dangerous and you might get lost in there. \n\nPrices are similar stores like Kitchen Stuff Plus (which I still prefer), but be on the lookout for one of their deals. \n\nThere's also not a lot people to help you out, not very friendly.
