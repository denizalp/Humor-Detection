I was in need of a massage (when am I not!?) and I found a coupon in the Coffee news for $10 off so I decided to give them a try.  I was glad they were able to schedule me in on the same day, because I was so very tense.  The massage itself was enjoyable, Bryant was a competent therapist but the place itself could use some improvement.  The room was a but bright and it was quite noisy; it's hard to relax when you can hear several conversations going on while you are being massaged.  Relaxing music playing in the room did little to tune out the voices, I think the walls must be pretty thin!  Also, the massage room did not have a chair to place my items on, just a small hook and a bookshelf.  Again, I would rather support local businesses, but Massage Envy is way ahead of this place in terms of a good massage environment (light dimmer switches), better sound proofing (and people whisper around there) and a better overall sense of relaxation.
