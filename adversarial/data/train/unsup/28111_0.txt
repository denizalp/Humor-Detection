Stayed here while in town to see a show at The Van Buren. The hotel is great! EVERYBODY was very friendly & helpful. The room was nicely decorated, clean & comfy. Small-ish lobby but on the 2nd floor is a much bigger space to hang. Great decor and a nice vibe. Location was great for walking around downtown. \n\nI'd like to give a special shout-out to Natalie. Our flight was cancelled & we couldn't get out of town until much later that night. She was able to give us a later checkout, stored our luggage for the day & recommended a local movie theatre to pass the time. She was very personable & called me by name when I saw her later in the day. Most people don't even remember helping you, let alone your name. I was impressed!
