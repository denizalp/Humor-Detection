Ugh, Where do I start with this place? How do I go about rating it? Do I grade it as a Chinese Buffet, or do I compare it to all general eating establishments? All difficult questions.\n\nOkay look, as far as Chinese Buffets go, Red Wok Buffet is above-average. That needs to be stressed. It's nearly 4 stars, but it gets 3 for a very good reason - giving it 4 stars would be an insult to all the other 4 star establishments I have reviewed. So it gets 3.\n\nIn my own experiences (3 visits), a trip to Red Wok can be extremely satisfying or incredibly disappointing or anywhere in between. It all depends what kind of mood I'm in, how strong my stomach is that particular day, what time of day I visit and what kind of day the restaurant staff is having. \n\nThere are just too many variables to pinpoint this place. Unfortunately, it's too unpredictable for me to recommend, but I could definitely picture a hungry family visiting this place and having an outstanding and affordable meal. And picturing it is easy, because I have seen other families having exactly that type of experience every time I have visited this buffet!\n\nHonestly, the previous reviews do a pretty good job of explaining the typical Red Wok Buffet experience. Therefore, I could easily end the review here. But that wouldn't be any fun now would it? \n\nYou came to read a real review, so I'm going to give you one. But instead of typical explanatory paragraphs, I'm going to give you a list of quotes that will undoubtedly cross your mind if you are brave enough to visit this establishment. Some will be glowing reviews suggesting a 5-star experience. Others will make your stomach churn and question how in the hell in my right mind I gave this dingy little dive a 3-star rating. \n\nPlease be aware, I had more \"quotes\" in mind, but I can't remember them all because I just ate at Red Wok Buffet, and I feel tired, ashamed and bloated. But this is where the action is, so let's get started:\n\n\"Oh boy, I can't wait to visit the buffet!\"\n\n\"This area of town is really sketchy!\"\n\n\"There's many cars in the parking lot but still lots of parking space!\"\n\n\"Wow the prices are very affordable and fair for an all you can eat buffet!\"\n\n\"The lady who took my money seems very nice!\"\n\n\"The other customers all look very suspicious!\"\n\n\"Wow look at how many selections!\"\n\n\"The trays appear well-stocked and taken care of!\"\n\n\"Look at all the great choices of sushi!\"\n\n\"Wait a second, all the sushi is imitation crab!\"\n\n\"Everything I need to complete my dining experience is tastefully laid out!\"\n\n\"Lots of fruit! I can't wait to load some of my plate with healthy natural goodness!\"\n\n\"Oh wait, most of this fruit looks pretty bad. I better carefully pick out the good pieces.\"\n\n\"Wow, this chicken looks great! And look how many different poultry options there are!\"\n\n\"LOL It's the token American\/Soup section of the buffet. I'm not wasting my stomach space on this.\"\n\n\"Gee, I really loaded up my plate! Better wobble back to my table to eat!\"\n\n\"Hmm this food tastes a little strange. Oh well, I'll eat it anyway.\"\n\n\"Oh wow, this food does taste a little unusual. But if I eat it quickly, it's pretty nice, and I hardly notice any strange tastes.\"\n\n\"This sushi is actually really good for a buffet... even if it is mostly crab.\"\n\n\"I'm really enjoying eating all of these different foods... even if my stomach feels a little weird.\"\n\n\"I really wish that young child at the table next to me would stop crying.\"\n\n\"Wow! I can't believe I ate all that! Time to get some more!\"\n\n\"Look at all the diverse food! Kim-chi, octopus, bok-choy! I haven't been to a buffet this authentic in awhile!\"\n\n\"Is that child old enough to be at the serving station unsupervised?\"\n\n\"Gee that other guy sure has a lot of food on his plate. No wonder his belly is large!\"\n\n\"I can't ever get enough sushi!\"\n\n\"I don't know what this is, but I'll try it anyway!\"\n\n\"Another big plate. Time to chow down!\"\n\n\"The waitstaff is on their game! My old plate is already gone and my drink is refilled!\"\n\n\"I don't know if I can finish all this.\"\n\n\"I really need to use the bathroom.\"\n\n\"This seaweed salad tastes like soap.\"\n\n\"I'm having such a good time even though my stomach is in knots.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen a crowd this sketchy since the last time I took the bus.\"\n\n\"I don't care if I'm sick; I'm getting my money's worth!\"\n\n\"This chicken tastes so good, yet so unusual.\"\n\n\"This is the best meal I've had all day. Gosh I feel nauseous.\"\n\n\"Is it over yet?\"\n\n\"How am I going to drive home?\"\n\n\"Please, can that freaking child over there stop crying already!?!?\"\n\n\"I'd probably cry too if my parents brought me to Red Wok Buffet.\"\n\n\"Oh please, please, refill my drink again. I need to quickly wash down this poison.\"\n\n\"I can't stop eating all of this decent food!\"\n\n\"I feel so sick, But it's definitely not the buffet, no way! I'm coming back next week!\"
