Originally chose to eat here for the Elotes, but sadly they didn't have any corn that day. Incredibly sad. We did end up ordering Al Pastor and Asada tacos with an Asada Burrito and chorizo nachos. It was my last day in Vegas and the boyfriend wanted to make sure I was incredibly full for the mere 1 hour plane ride home. Ha. Their side bar was fully stocked with beans, sauces, and veggies. There was definitely something for everyone. I admit, we demolished the food and was left with a quarter of the burrito. As we walked...more like waddled to the car, we were hit with the painful reminder to not stuff our faces till we puke. Otherwise, it was some pretty good food and such a spacious restaurant. I was to see the Banda was about to play as we were leaving. Oh well, next time!
