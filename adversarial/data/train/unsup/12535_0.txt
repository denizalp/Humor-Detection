I love how this place is right next to 24 hour fitness! \n\nI ordered the chicken shawarma and falafel. The chicken shawarma was okay and the chicken was a little dry and not my favorite. I feel like the chicken shawarma was missing flavor in something. The guy also didn't give enough tahini sauce so my salad felt bland and dry. I definitely should order the steak next time. I love how can you customize your bowl but be aware that it's extra for certain things to add into your bowl\/gyro\/salad. \n\nMy favorite was their falafel! It was so delicious. The falafel was crispy on the outside and perfectly grainy on the inside. \n\nService was nice though! The guy was nice enough to put a little rice into my salad.
