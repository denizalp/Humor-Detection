after spending 3 hrs and $50 bucks at the bar, the bartender approaches me and says- \"im being \"cut\" (sent home early), - you can either cash out, or i can transfer your tab to another bartender\". i say \" why dont you get me one more drink, & ill cash out w\/ you\".  she gets my drink, i pay my tab & leave her a tip. not a great tip, but a tip none the less. wasnt 18% or even 20%, was more like 15%, - but you know what- im unemployed right now & thats the best i could do. she never acknowledges me or my appreciation, never says thank you, or f__ck you, or anything. - like i owed it to her, and it wasnt up to her expectations. -im sorry, but ive been in the industry for 30+ years, and when i came up, i remember when tips were appreciated and not expected on a percentage of what you spent. it was a way for the customer to acknowledge superior service, when you recieved more than you expected, and your server, or bartender or whoever, went \"above and beyond\" the call of duty. so after trying to get the attention of the two \"supposed\" managers on duty, and not being able to distract them from their shots and glasses of wine, i left. when i got home, i called to express my displeasure. the person that answered the phone asked \" how can i help you\", i said i would like to speak to the manager on duty, - they responded- \"who is this?\",  i told them my 1st name, and they said \"what is this concerning?\" - i said \"my experience tonight\" i was told \"hang on hon- ill try to find somebody\". after 5 mins on hold, i hung up, promised myself id never go back, and  posted this.
