UPDATE: 01\/22\/2017\n\nThe review below stands, but I wanted to add what I've seen as I passed the TD a few times recently: a sign in their parking lot that says Parking for Town Dump Only - \"Flat Tire.\" OMG! Is that a definitive threat or what? Park here illegally and we won't have your car towed, we'll flatten your tires. Wow, Just ... wow. Wish I could give my rating a negative number instead of just a one.\n\n\nOther posters have clearly said what is wrong with this place: over-priced junk, filthy, cramped store, BEYOND RUDE employees. I dropped by today for the last time just to see if they had any new ceramic wall gekkos. Note that Buffalo Bill's just down the road has the same size-type for $5-$7 less, but I bought two because the colors were great. When I entered I said good afternoon to the woman (not lady) at the front counter and she barely grunted back to me. This is typical, and will grate on anyone raised properly with a sense of good manners. \n\nThere are signs all over the place that are written in far from welcoming terms, such as underlined 'our prices are firm,' you break it you buy it, do not take anything out of the stored, etc. And I mean multiple of these signs at virtually every turn. Yeah, we get it - customers disgust us, they're stupid, we'll take their money, but drop dead if you expect courtesy. Understood.  If you want great stuff keep driving south to Buffalo Bill's and their sister store, El Toro Loco. Town Dump? Yeah, exactly ...
