Meh... If the service was better and if the restaurant didn't smell (like raw meat) I would've enjoyed the food I ordered. Mind you it seemed like the AC was not working as great since they had commercial blowers in there. (It was still hot and I'm always cold.)\n\nOur server was a bit shy with no enthusiasm or welcoming spirit. We had to ask a few times to refill our waters and wave him down for napkins etc. We ordered our food and 2 drinks and It took about 20 minutes to get 1 alcoholic beverage and 25 minutes for the 2nd one. The lychee drink didn't taste good. It was missing something. The calamansi martini was good. \n\nFood: \nSisig Tacos\nCrispy Pata\nSisig Bangus\nKabocha and long beans\nBone Marrow with crostini\nPork BBQ Skewer (last item served-think they forgot)\nBibingka Souffle \nCoconut Halo Halo\n\nThe sisig taco was just ok. I didn't like the strong lemon or sour flavor. Also, I've had some good sisig tacos in North and South Cali and Cutting Board didn't match up to it. In addition, the taco was falling apart. There's too much sauce that it broke the wrap into pieces. \n\nThe bone marrow and crispy pata were my favorites and the best I've ever had. \nAll the other dishes were good but nothing that stood out for me. \n\nThe bibingka souffle was delicious and so was the halo halo. I did wish the halo halo had some ice in there but it didn't.  \n\nOverall, a pretty good size restaurant.  My friends who are locals here says that there's live music.  I would love to return and try other dishes and hope to get a better experience.
