The cheap looking awning as you approach the place made me a bit skeptical of the place (located on the side of the Rotunda Bldg)... but once we entered I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nAt this point I can't think of anything negative to say about Village Tavern.  I've been twice... once for dinner with a HUGE group (Fall of 2013) and once for lunch (December 2015)... service was good both times... everyone enjoyed their meals.\n\nEverything I've ordered has been DELICIOUS... pizza, kale salad, deviled eggs, crab dip, etc etc (see pics).  \nParking was a little tight when we went as a big group back in 2013 (but it was a Friday night and we went a few hours after they'd opened).  The view was gorgeous... we could see light snowfall and city lights - ambience = 100! :)\n\nDiners were in all sorts of attire... dressy, business, casual, panthers jerseys... so come as you are! :)\n \nThere's indoor and outdoor seating and the bar is a pretty decent size.  \n\nCan't wait to come back!
