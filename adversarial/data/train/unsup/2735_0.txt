Had to find a new place for a haircut uptown since I moved here.  The Cut...makes the cut!  This place is walk in only so be prepared to wait a little while if you get here during peak hours but the fact is, men's haircuts rarely take very long anyway so you won't be waiting long. \n\nThe stylist all seem to be personable and in my particular experience I told her just a few things and came out with probably the best cut I've had in a long time.  She was great (Stephanie?).  You can ask for a stylist by the way, but if you do you'll just have to wait till they are ready.\n\nYes, they have beer and other drinks and right now there is a check in offer on Yelp that gets you one for FREE :)
