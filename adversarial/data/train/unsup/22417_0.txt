we tried Kneaders two times, both times not impressed. Soggy bread, uncooked pastries, we will not go back. Service was \"directive instead of suggestive\" the clients that were there each time were more interested in our conversations then keeping to themselves while we were eating.\n\nIf I even get a weak moment and try it again I will re-review.
