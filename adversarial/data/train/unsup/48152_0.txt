We just returned from a round trip from Pittsburgh, PA to NYC. This was our first time we traveled to NYC this way.  The trip was awesome. Our driver to NYC was incredible! She drove through heavy rain, assisted a disabled passenger with compassion and care to assure her safety, even asking if we could get her food when we stopped for lunch and kept us  abreast of our journey and time frames.  We would do it over and over again. It was nice to have someone else to safely take charge of the road.
