Very small amount of ice cream. Very disappointed. This place was hard to find because it is in a neighborhood and it is VERY small. Previous reviews stated that it was inexpensive. Well, not true. Today I was there and for a small, 1 scoop vanilla ice cream in a bowl and an oreo cookie sprinkled on top and a donut, we paid $9.97. The cup was the size of one that would be considered a child size, think, Dixie Cup size.  NOT worth your time!!
