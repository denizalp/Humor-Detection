Since everyone eventually reviews P.F. Chang's, I thought I would give you all an alternative, a great, Americanized Chinese food restaurant. \n\nThe Golden Phoenix is a great example of a successful Chinese restaurant. They do excel in most ways but  fall short in others. First off, for an appetizer, get the Mu Shu, its the best I've found in town. The Hot and Sour Soup is great too, good balance of flavors. Great noodles, and rice always seems fresh. Most of the chicken and tofu entrees are cooked extremely well, as the chicken is tender and tofu is firm and sauteed well. Now for the not so good, stay away from beef entrees. As most Chinese restaurants, the beef used is from a cut that needs to be finessed, its tough if not cooked delicately, most of the time its cooked too long and gets rubbery, Michelin\/Goodyear like. Stick with chicken or tofu. \n\nAs for the service and decor both are better then most. The restaurant looks like a Chinese restaurant should, bright with Asian decor. The service is prompt and professional. \n\nAs a previous review stated, they don't handle parties well, I disagree, I planned a party for 25 and they handled it quite well. In fact when the check came I tipped above the automatic gratuity (reserved for large parties). \n \nTake out is outstanding as I tend to call in my order and pick up rather then a take out from Pei Wei (support the little guy!). To make things easier the menu is available online at their website. \n\nHere is the web address, at this time though its not loading properly, check again if the page is not available. \n\nhttp:\/\/goldenphoenixrestaurant.com\/
