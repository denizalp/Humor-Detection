My first memorable evening in Paris I met a handsome boy on the dance floor and minutes later jumped on the back of his scooter for a drive to the Eiffel Tower.  We kissed, we made out, we fell in love, and then we exchanged names...that's how I do things, that's how I roll.\n\nThis wasn't quite like that, but I did take a moment to recollect....XoXo\n\nAwesome views of the strip.  We made it just in time to see the marvelous Bellagio fountain show.  I wish I would have gone at night but that's just not how it fit into our super sensational LV itinerary\n\nAu revoir Peewee, Au revoir Simone~
