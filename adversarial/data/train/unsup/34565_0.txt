Tried to change out my own thermostat and of course it didn't work and not only did it not work when I put the old one back on it didn't work either. Called Ron Brocks and the girls on the phone were courteous and helpful. Edward the technician came to the house within an hour. It only took Edward about 20 minutes to figure out the problem, put on the new thermostat and was done. Edward is my new hero. To find somebody in the construction industry that is on time, courteous, and a true professional is unusual Ron Brock's is all of that and then some, Thank you Ron Brocks.
