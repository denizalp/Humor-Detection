What a pleasant experience I had here for lunch. I would have never known about it if it was not for Yelp.  It is in a random strip mall in an industrial part of west Phoenix. However, it is near my work so on short days I will have to stop by on my way home. It is not the best NY Deli in town but still very good so giving it Kudos on the stars on it's own accord and South West Phoenix is a foodie wasteland when it comes to non Mexican food. I gave the place five stars, and my friends know I am picky with the five stars, because they have Boars Head meats, the owner\/manager, I think she said her name was Jen, is fantastic. I observed her for a while during my visit and she really is very special, kind to all her guests, and very customer centered. Jen knew all the customers by name. Gotta love that. I also love seeing kids behind the counter. It reminds me so much of NY. \n\nI had my go to, a chicken salad sandwich. I got a little daring and ordered it on Rye instead of a baguette. It was good. The folks at the table next to me said their meatball was great. I know a return trip is necessary. lol  I think the specialties here are the Pastrami's and Corn Beef type of NY sandwiches. The Rachel looked awesome!  I do not like those things but the customers were saying they were the best in town. \n\nThe only thing I can add is that maybe they can carry Yoo-Hoo and Wise products. Please consider adding Onion Rolls to the bread choices too. Also, I like Coke products better than Pepsi but that is a life long argument and debate for another day. Ha!\n\nLiterally, the place was jamming with special orders from companies in the area. I overhead all saying this is the new it spot for lunch nearby. I am happy to hear it. I will most definitely be visiting more often. \n\nThank you for such a lovey lunch experience.
