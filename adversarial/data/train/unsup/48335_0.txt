Amazing clean. The concessions stand are get your own sauce for chicken fingers. With no extra cost. The bathroom all dispensers full and soup full. Not thus way in any AMC in jersey I been too. Here the theater had no popcorn on floor. They really clean the theater between shows. \nHots off to the manager and staff here at AMC Concord. And did I mention it cost $7.25. You can only love this place. By far the best AMC yet
