I must say this place is pretty awesome so far. I've had my fair share of crapy auto shops where they screw you and not in a good way. Took car in two weeks ago for an oil change and also check of the ac as it was blowing hot air. Shop did a flush and recharge of ac and found a leak in my condenser. Came back to get it fixed and they did another courtesy recharge for freon since it leaked out previously. Thanks Mark :) You guys rock.
