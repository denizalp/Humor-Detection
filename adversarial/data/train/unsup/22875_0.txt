So I lost my Korean Food virginity here, and now i'm an all out RICE QUEEN.\n\n\nLove this place! The free apps are soooo good. My favs are the noodles with sesame and the potatoes. Hands down the best side dishes i've had in the city (now that i've tried a few more korean places)\n\nMy friend LOVES the Bibimbap :)\n\nSince I'm still new to Korean food, I like to try out a different dish everytime I'm there. So far, its all been good.\n\nLast but not least, my favourite item on their menu is the Gyoza. That little dumpling takes my heart away. It's a must have everytime I come. \n\nService can be kinda slow sometimes, and if your sitting right near the entrances, you're screwed.  Always try to get into the rooms or the booth-ish places. Make sure you have the bell-thingy to call the waitress, otherwise you'll probs get forgotten.
