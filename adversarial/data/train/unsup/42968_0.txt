I've been to Rusans sooo many times for dinner but haven't been for the buffet.  \n\nBeing off work on Labor Day we decided to check it out. The buffet starts at 11:30.  My recommendation is to get there right when it starts.  There were tons of options from regular rolls, fried rolls, teriyaki chicken, soup, salad, dessert, etc.  I tried to take some pictures but it was so crowded that I couldn't get good ones!   The whole restaurant was filled without an empty seat in the place.\n\nThe service was incredible and the lines went fast for sushi and all of the extras.  When a dish ran out, it was replaced immediately.  \n\nThe best part of it all..... the price!!  $11.99
