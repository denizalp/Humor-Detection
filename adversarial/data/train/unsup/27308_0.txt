I came here near the end of October and it was very satisfactory indeed. \n\nEverything is as you would expect in a luxurious Vegas hotel and the Bella suite didn't disappoint us. My only gripe about this place is really the proximity of the Venezia to the casino area. You literally have to take two different elevators just to get to the casino level, which made it seem like a journey all on its own. Not even the elevators were very large and were almost never private. \n\nThis hotel has a vast array of shops and levels that I can never keep up with. The casino area is very nice and the people that frequent this resort are more mature here.\n\nThe security is first class at the Venetian. We had an incident in our suite where some random stranger was knocking repeatedly on our door (he had the wrong suite) in the middle of the night around 5 am. I phoned the front desk and they sent security up right away and they handled the situation without further incident. They even check room keys before letting u to the suite area and that's obviously a huge plus.\n\nPros: Very Luxurious; Shopping; Mature Patrons\n\nCons: Lots of walking; Maybe location on the strip; Okay restaurants
