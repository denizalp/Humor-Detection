Unfortunately, I found nothing good from this place. The musubi fell apart and I could taste it's from dry leftover rice. The magic boba isn't boba at all. The french donut is probably the only good thing but it took them more than 20 minutes to get my order of 3 items and I'm the only customer in the store.
