I didn't particularly enjoy my first experience today at Shandra's. As it was my first time visiting, it wasn't a great feeling to be greeted by a frowning cashier who stood in front of a blank chalkboard where the menu items were supposed to be written. The only information that WAS presented to me was in the form of a sign that indicated that all of the prices went up in November, 2017 and another sign professing that their \"hot\" jerk is extremely hot and no refunds would be issued if you can't handle it. Oh and another sign that said Cash and Debit only! and another sign that said NO outside food allowed. Yes ma'am!\n\nI opted for a large jerk chicken as I was sure it would be on the invisible menu. As suspected, the scowly cashier was miserable and mumbled further questions about my order such as if I wanted it hot or mild, etc. without breaking an iota of a smile or looking directly at me at any time.\n\nAfter seating myself to wait, I decided I had better get a coke in case it was as hot as the sign made it out to be. I returned to the cash. \"$2.10\" she mumbled. \"$2.10 for a can of coke?\", I exclaimed, \"you're really overcharging for that considering the food you serve almost necessitates a drink.\" She said \"We sure are\". I then remembered that I wanted to try their famous hot sauce on its own so I asked for a side of hot sauce. She handed me a thimble's worth and mumbled \"quarter\". I said \"pardon\"?. She said \"It's a quarter\". I said you gotta be kidding me, and took my seat.\n\nThe food was ready in a very respectable amount of time. The quantity of food was acceptable for $11.00; 2 thighs, 1 drumstick, about a cup and a half of rice and peas and about a 1\/4 cup of slaw. The jerk was simply doused in their vinegary hot sauce. So much so that the flavour of jerk was overpowered and minimal. The sauce itself was indeed hot but definitely does not require any of the warnings they have posted. It ain't that hot! The only other flavours that were able to penetrate through the hot sauce were more reminiscent of stew chicken as opposed to jerk, It would be my guess that this chicken hadn't ever seen any sort of open flame on any sort of grill. The rice n' peas were fine, but quite clovey and the slaw wasn't anything special.\n\nI know that I'm in the minority with my negative review of Shandra's but I really think they could improve both the quality of their food and especially their customer service. Perhaps I should have read more Yelp reviews prior to my visit to see that I might have been better off ordering oxtail from their invisible menu.
