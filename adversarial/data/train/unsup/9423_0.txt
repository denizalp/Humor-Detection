This is my new go-to place for waffles! Came across Waffle U on Blog TO and had to try it. Waffle U makes only 99 waffles a day because the owner believes in quality over quantity. The place closes once the owner sells out all 99 of his waffles. This is actually my second time here because when I came here the first time the owner had already ran out of waffles. You can always message him on Instagram @waffleu to ask.\n\nFor $10, you get a Liege waffle (waffle with deep pockets) with unlimited toppings. Once you get there, you pick a table, sit down, and the owner will call you up to the counter to pick up your waffle once it is ready (takes about 10 minutes).\n\nHe will have several jars of toppings that you get to choose from at the counter. I decided to add the chocolate chips, marshmallows, PEANUT BUTTER, almonds, walnuts, strawberries, bananas, vanilla ice cream, and nutella drizzle which was actually a great combination. I love how he carefully places a marshmallow in each of the pockets to make sure each pocket has a marshmallow in it. He then torches the marshmallows and chocolate chips as well which gives it a very nice touch. If you are unsure of what to toppings to get you can check out his instagram for some inspiration or ideas. It is almost like art work.\n\nI was very excited to try my waffle and I must say it was truly amazing. The waffle was fresh, buttery, crunchy on the outside, and stretchy like fresh bread. All the toppings blended together so well - the way the chocolate melted and the way the marshmallows turned stringy like cheese just really made my day.\n\nIt's very relaxing. The jazz music and the black and white murals painted by c8mk_design add a very nice European touch to his overall interior as well. Loved the red, white, and black theme inside. I will definitely be back again soon
