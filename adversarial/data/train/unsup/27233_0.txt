I came here to grab some breakfast for the first time on a Sunday afternoon.  The place wasn't packed at all.  The nice thing was there's a patio area in case you wanted to eat outside, but I saw some smokers out there and decided to decline.  Does AZ have any laws regarding smoking in restaurant patios?  \n\nI tried their southwestern omelet and it was good.  The salsa and chorizo weren't too overwhelming with spices.  The hash browns were crispy but not burnt.  The plate was a good portion to start the day off.\n\nThis place beats going to a Denny's or some chain.
