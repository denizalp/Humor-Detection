Popcorn....no longer the land of good old fashion salt and butter flavours, The Toronto Popcorn Factory has literally taken the next jump in flavour town with flavours like maple bacon, water melon, and even pizza!\n\nIts a small shop in Kensington Market that is cramped wall to wall with some of the most unique flavours you'll ever see.  Unlike Kernels, the flavours here are much more bold and exotic.  They have a ton of flavours that you can sample and the pricing is grouped by both size and flavours.\n\nWith so many different flavours available I can definitely see ourselves coming back again and again.\n\n4\/5.
