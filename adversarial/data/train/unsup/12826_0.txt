What a wonderful place to hang out. I think I found my new favorite place at Boca Park. So many amazing craft cocktails here at Mixx. \nShout out to Joshua!! \nWe met Joshua who has so much passion with his service and recommended us so many yummy cocktails. By the end of the night we ended up with 6 cocktails and they were all delicious. We were also lucky to catch their Happy Hour. Food and some well-drinks are $4.77, great deal. I am wondering why is it $4.77?? That will be my question to them next time I return. Mini burger was so juicy, Truffle fries with aioli sauce on the side were also flavorful. We ended up ordering a second round of happy hour food as well. \nI will definitely be back!
