I almost never write negative reviews, but I feel like this is one of those times I should save you the heartache.\n\nThe service for pick-up was just fine, but the food I got back left a lot to be desired.\n\nWe just moved to the area, and thought BWW would be a good go-to that first week.  The boneless chicken (I got 12, my wife got 12) were popcorn-chicken size.  They were tasty, but seriously, seriously small.  Small enough that we busted out laughing when we saw them.  I like my baby chickens in egg form, please.\n\nWorse were the buffalo chips with cheese.  We ended up discarding them after just starting to eat them because the entire bottom of them was adhered to a white plastic material.  I'm betting that it's a big chunk of whatever bag they come in when frozen that they got cooked with, as one homogenous lump.  \n\nI took a photo because I wanted my friends to see that we're now living in the future, where we're expected to eat space-age plastics.  I can't wait for the next step, my BWW Spicy Hot protein pill!\n\nI normally love BWW, but I don't know why I'd come back to this one.
