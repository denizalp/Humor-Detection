So.... who HASN'T been to jake's? I remember turning 19 and hanging out here almost everyday in the summer (WOW, DID I GET POOR). With that said, the pricing is high, even for a main street. I guess they make it work though, because boy do they get a lot of customers. \n\nThe patio is the main treat in the summer time. Being a passerby, you are always envious when you see groups of friends drinking on the patio, swaying to the music and generally having a great time. However, as you approach, you get stopped bluntly by 'security' that think they're downtown bouncers. The power trip is unreal. The power trip is so unreal to the point where you think you'd have to pay customs to get in. \n\nThe inside is like a giant house party, to be honest. Different rooms, upstairs, downstairs. It's LIT. The crowd is mixed, young teens with fakes to older groups of what could be hells angel's gang members. I don't remember the food being insanely amazing but I don't recall it being barf-worthy, ONLY hella $$$$. \n\nService depends.. it seems like they can't handle it when it gets busy because servers get overwhelmed and either visit your table 20 times in two minutes or none at all in two hours. I don't even know.\n\nJake's, please step it up. With pretty much the BEST spot on main street Unionville and a sunny summer coming up .. please.
