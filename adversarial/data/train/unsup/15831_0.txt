I'm writing this review while I'm trading in the crappy car Planet Hyundai sold me about 5 months ago. Who ever plans to buy a car here please learn from my experience.\n\nThe first warning should have been the first time I dealt with them fixing my new car I bought from them. They actually lost it. When we told them we were calling the police to help them find it someone finally found it.\n\nDespite this fiasco we decided to give them another chance when buying a used car from them. They are all promises and good warm thoughts until you sign off on the car. Then all the promises made about fixing something as simple as a car speaker go ignored. My husband would call and call just to be ignored.  He even went there in person to be ignored as well. \n\nDon't think for a minute that their warranty will have you covered. Try being stranded in Baker without a choice of mechanics. The warranty only covered the bare minimum when it came to parts.  We had to pay about an extra 500.00. When we called to try to see if they can pay more we were told that we shouldn't have broken down in Baker....like we had a choice. \n\nPass this place by if you value your sanity, money and time. Cars should last more than a couple of months if you are selling quality vehicles. The car dealership shouldn't run and hide when there is a problem if they value their business either.
