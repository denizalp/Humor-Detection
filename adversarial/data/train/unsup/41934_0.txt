I had a good experience here. needed a watch battery and they got it done while I waited even though they were busy. the gentleman that served my needs was knowledgeable and efficient. I can see why there may be perceptions of being curt or borderline rude but I personally think the man is focused on many things and doesn't break concentration. especially when working with tiny watch components, I'd prefer a focused person doing the work as opposed to friendly and chatty. that's my experience and was a 5:30 walk in not turned away because of the time. cost was cheap as hell compared to most other places I've had work done. also they can service pieces many other establishments cannot. I'll be back
