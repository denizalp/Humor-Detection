My expectations were unreasonably high.  We had been trying to get food from this place for almost two months.  The first time we went there they were closed- okay so they aren't open after 3 on Mondays.  Any other time it would cross our minds they weren't open then either.  Then we tried to collaborate with the hours they were open and the owner was on vacation for two weeks, so the place was closed.  By this time I was convinced I would never try these cheesesteaks that were so renowned.  To make a long story short (too late) when we were finally able to sample this place's wares we shared a cheesesteak and a Rueben.  My thoughts on the aforesaid:  Cheesesteak was what a school cafeteria would make- cheese whiz and steak ums.  If that's what you want in a cheesesteak then that's cool.  I just expected something a little less processed.  The rye on the Rueben was so stale it broke into pieces when I bit into it.  Corned beef had that very distinct flavor that can only come with age.  I guess I'd give this place one more try, but my search for a great cheesesteak continues.
