The young lady in charge of the print center doesn't handle pressure very well, she seemed to be all over the place and she is very loud and comes across obnoxious and rude.\n\nI would recommend not attend OfficeMax if you need print services done I would go to either Office Depot a Kinko's or Staples they seem to be a little more friendlier and little bit more organized I've been in the store twice and each time they've had a printer down that this doesn't come across as very good business practices.  The people who work the cash registers seem to be pretty friendly but for the most part the store seems to be missing things products that I'm looking for just aren't there.
