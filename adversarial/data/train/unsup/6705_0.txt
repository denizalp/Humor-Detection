UGH. So wanted to like this place but I was sorely disappointed. \n\nCounter attendant was awkward and standoffish - big no no in any front of house position. No proper greeting, no eye contact (and it's a small store). I asked if the cupcakes had been baked that morning and he got all shifty... They didn't taste like it either.
