Good budget hotel option. Perfect location central to Old Montreal, the Village, Chinatown, Rue St Catherines (shopping) and Rue St Denis (Latin Quarter)\n\nWe had issues with young hooligans partying in the room next door, but the staff here kicked them out immediately when we complained! Awesome\n\nRoom was large but quite dated. Bad decor. Washroom clean but a bit ghetto. Lobby was equally dismal.
