Have visited and enjoyed many meals in this quaint little family owned business.  When it comes to a good homemade Mexican meal this is one of the best.  This is not fast food or is it prepared, it is all home made fresh.  Wait a little longer for your meal, but, you will enjoy the results.  On some visits you may notice the children working on their homework or just helping with the patrons.  It is truly a family business.  Prices for their meals are very reasonable considering the quality.  You will get plenty to eat and may have to get a take home box.  They also have great Margaritas.  Give this one a try , you won't regret it.
