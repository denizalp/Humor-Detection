One of the best things about the Vegas strip is the selection of free entertainment.  I have seen the Bellagio Fountains many times and it never ceases to amaze me. I would go so far as to say it is the best, with the mirage in second place.  It's also great that this show runs every half hour so if you miss one you don't have to wait too long for another. The only thing to note is that they don't run all day, at least year round. Right now in April the show starts at 3pm and runs until midnight.
