This is single-handely...the worst business that I have ever been to in my entire life so far. I wouldn't even dare to give this a star...this should be no stars at all. However, tie for the review...\n\nI came in here looking for a Toyota Avalon...but when I arrived at the dealership, I recieved no greeting from a salesman, no help when I asked for it, and it pissed me off to see that these workers were in thier own world drinking and eating without a care for the customers who were in the same situation I was in. \n\nForgetting the crap service, I went back ouside and found the car I was looking for, so I went to go find someone to help me out with the Avalon just so I could hear it's specifications, performance and total cost. I couldn't find a single employee to help me out and one of them who would acknoweldge me responded with a lazy...\"that isn't my job\" answer. What do you mean it isn't your job?? This is an auto dealership for Penelope's Sake!! \n\nAngry and about to sock the guy on his knees, I left the dealership and still have never returned. I would love to see this place get a whole new staff and management department. This is not how to treat a customer...and sorry to say, this is the worst then Wal-Mart.
