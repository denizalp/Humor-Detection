I hired Noble to seal my new floors. We just moved into a new house and wanted to make sure that the floor would be less likely to stain if we spilled anything into the grout. They came out spend a few hours and sealed all the floors in my house. The guy who came out was professional and he did a great job especially sealing in between the tile. He was very particular and the cost of the sealing was a lot cheaper than I thought it would be!
