Choose another Rental Car Company at this location... After waiting 45 mins in the waiting area just to get to a clerk, I had the worst experience I ever had renting a car.\nEven if you have a Prepayed reservation... you wait.\n\nJust to warn you the clerks are sales people and will lie to you about the size of the cars. They will immediately tell you to upgrade and then charge you $10-$20 per day than what is on the website. I actually had the clerk walk away and tell me that he would not sell me a car. He was pissed because I said NO to all the extras and told me he would get fired if he did not ask. I had a manager come out because he was so ridiculous. I think this is part of their training so don't get sucked in if you decide to stick it out.\n\nYou have many other options stay away!!!
