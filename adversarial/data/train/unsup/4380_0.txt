in between getting my ass kicked at the tables I decided to take a break and wandered in here. First impression,nicely done,inviting. Thats where it went downhill. I stood there for 7 minutes,god knows why,without so much as a ni hao. seriously annoying. ordered a spicy shrimp dish. Lets just say that I know of many places out of state where this would have been fine for 8 bucks but for 20+? The whole casino experience is really starting to be a huge turnoff. They serve swill and you get raped at the tables,awesome! Thank you sir may i have another? The best part of the whole meal was the giant beer i ordered,luckily they cant influence the taste of a sealed item. When will these casinos overhaul their stock holder mentality and up their game? probably never,its not profitable for them.
