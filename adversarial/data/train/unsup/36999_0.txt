A sandwich at Sacks isn't unlike a sandwich you might make at home with fresh and interesting ingredients. The art themed sandwich names lend themselves to the ingredients used and the offerings are in no short supply. In addition to a large and accommodating menu, a whiteboard boasts daily specials:  One cold sandwich, one hot, a salad, and soup. After placing an order at the register, find a table or loiter around the deli counter which displays bottled beverages, side dishes, and desserts. The crew will holler out your name when the grub is ready; occasionally, they'll deliver to your table.\n\nDuring peak lunch hours, this place gets busy. Even when greeted with a line trickling out the entrance, I've never waited long and always receive a sincere \"sorry about the wait, what can I get for ya?\" in the event there's even 1 person in line ahead of me. The staff doesn't appear to have a high turnover and is friendly and prepared to offer suggestions or chit-chat.\n\nFor me, sandwich assembly is important and Sacks has the ratios down to a science. Be it tomato basil sandwich bread, a baguette, or rye, the balance of meat, veggies, and condiments is always appropriate and well balanced. Edge-to-edge with delicious ingredients.\n\nI generally opt for the Symphony or Ruben, though my lunch partners are never disappointed with their choices.\n\nOf note is their drink selection. In addition to a soda fountain which touts unusual choices such as Sprite Zero and Barq's Red Creme Soda, the tea selection is great. The Market Spice tea is particularly addicting and the Pineapple Jasmine Green tea is tasty, too.\n\nIf you're craving something sweet, Wanda's cookies are pretty good. Try the \"57,\" a combination of various cookie doughs that result in an original tasting treat.
