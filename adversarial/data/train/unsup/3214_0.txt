Ordered delivery tonight from here through the \"Just eat\" app. I ordered a cheese burger, small poutine, an iced tea (2L), and a Nanaimo bar. With tax, $3 delivery fee and tip it came to about $24. Online it said they would come by 8:20 pm, they didn't come until 8:40 pm. This could just be mis-communication between the store and the app, I'm not sure. The burger was pretty good, still hot when I got it. Poutine was the best part, it was fairly large for a small (It fit in one of those 9 inch circular take out trays), the fries were nice and thick, so was the beef gravy, I think they used shredded cheese instead of curds but it was still good. They give you two nanaimo bars in a pack, a good size I'd say 1 inch by 2.5-3 inches each. Overall it was pretty good, it's been a couple hours and my stomach doesn't hurt like it usually does after greasy food so there's that :)
