I was so hungry for lunch and I wanted Mexican food that was quick and easy so I found this place nearby. It took some time to figure out how to get here because the airpark was in the way but when I finally arrived, I found that the restaurant was in a shopping plaza with tons of parking. I parked and waited in line. I ordered a lobster and blackened shrimp taco on corn tortilla with a side of rice. My order came to $8.\n\nI decided to just devour my food there and so I sat down and waited. The employees are really friendly. They came by and asked if I was ok, they gave me salsa and when I was done, they thanked me for coming it. It was refreshing because lately, the service in the restaurants I've been dining at lately haven't been great. \n\nLet's get to the food - it was pretty delicious! I wish there was a little bit more meat but tasty nonetheless. I practically didn't leave much on my plate and for less than $10, definitely worth it!!! I'll be a returning customer for sure!
