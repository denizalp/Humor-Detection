This review applies to the baked items I tried in addition to the cappuccino.\nA couple of my friends swear by this place and are always recommending to come here for a brunch. So on a nice Sunday the same invite was extended I couldn't resist. Sadly I had breakfast earlier but I will be sure to come back for the main courses as they all looked tempting. \nThis is a simple, mostly self order kinda place. At the start of the line there are quite a  few baked goods I decided to pick a croissants (a good yardstick to judge a bakery) and a bichon (with a lemon filling) too bad I had already placed my ordered as I noticed some desserts from perennial favorite Rahier! (will come back for those)\nThe croissants and bichon were quite good. Nice and buttery high marks here. The cappuccino didn't fare well though. here is the verdict\nEspresso: Medium\nCrema': average\nMilk: Frothed below Average\nLatte Art: None\nA half decent drink. I would say 2.5 stars.\nHmm if you are in the mood to grab and go I would say pick up your capp from several decent alternates nearby and pick up your baked good here.\nI will be back to try the brunch items as they all looked decent.
