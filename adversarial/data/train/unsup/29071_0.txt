Yes, I'm updating this again ... because I keep going back time and again.  Tried and true.  Love the place.  Had the rice in lotus leaf (nor my guy) which was perfectly cooked, rice just right, not too dry, not too moist.  Had the curried cuttlefish - tender morsels of deliciousness.  The BBQ ribs were luscious, the BBQ seasoning done perfectly.  Spouse found the lo bak go (turnip cakes) a bit greasy but I disagree except that they could have been a bit crispier on the outside.  The shrimp chong fan was nice, but not hot enough.  Took the dan taat home for dessert.  The wait staff there have known me for years and are always so friendly, we joke around and I always walk out of there happy.
