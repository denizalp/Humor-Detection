I'm a little late with this review, but I went to Drai's rooftop nightclub their opening weekend (Memorial Weekend). I booked a Cabana, the pool deck Cabana with a private pool, last year 2015 in July. I have to say it was a killer experience both day and night. I love being outside and seeing the lights and energy of the strip. Pair that with a club ambiance and music at night, awesome! During the day, freakin ballin! I love this place.
