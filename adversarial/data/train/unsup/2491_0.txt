Went there on a late Sunday afternoon, there was four other people in the restaurant . The restaurant is small and maybe holds up to 20 inside in a semi circle bar\/table. I do a take out order and sit down to wait and then a large group of 7 comes in to sit so I give up my seat so they could sit together and the waitress thanks me and tells me to sit and as I sit this idiot in the group that sat in the seat I gave up asked me to move so he could sit next to his friend which there was a seat between his friend and I. Wanted to put my fist in his food since I gave up my seat previously and he was so ungrateful. \n\nThis led to my displeasure for my experience here.  I ordered the Ingo Burger with a fried egg which I specifically asked to not have sunny side up. As I opened my food later the first thing I see is a burger with a sunny side up egg. Also ordered the fresh shattered potato chips they were pretty good but the dipping sauce seemed a little off . Overall the food was average at best the service was average and the idiot in the restaurant was like a grade school punk . With all the quality restaurants in that area that will be the last time I will eat here
