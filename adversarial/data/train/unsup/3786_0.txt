Horses! That pretty much sums up my experience at South Point, so don't get confused and think I have stayed, eaten or gambled here. We stopped by for the premiere of their virtual horse racing. Not being a gambler, I can't offer an expert opinion on this new addition to the gambling repertoire. \n\nHowever, while circling the casino, we wandered down the hallway leading to the arena. The giant Benny Binon on a horse statue beckoned to us, and we noticed a sign advertising a \"Cutting Horse\" championship. We had no idea what this was, but before we entered the arena we asked a South Point employee. She informed us it is a horse trained to separate cattle from the herd. The competition was free for the public to attend, so we sauntered on in. Unfortunately, the round of competition had just finished up, but we were still able to see some horses circling around the arena floor. We also popped into the Saturday Night Bar. We didn't have a beverage, but the venue was nice complete with the old Western feel and huge windows overlooking the arena floor. \n\nThe arena apparently hosts cowboy events throughout the year, and the majority of them are FREE! For example, August 1st-4th is the Cowboy Mounted Shooting Association \"Scully Western US Championship.\" Cowboys? On Horses? Shooting? Pair it with an ice cold beer from the Saturday Night Bar, and this might be some of the best entertainment in town. I want to go back.
