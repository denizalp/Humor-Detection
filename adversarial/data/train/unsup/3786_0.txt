Took my 2 year old here for his first cut, i put him in the chair he started to cry and the judge told me to go sit down. my son stopped crying and got the best cut. My son loves going in for a cut even now at 13 years old. As a women going into a mans shop i felt comforatable which is awesome. I recommend this shop to anyone looking for a great cut for their husband or sons.
