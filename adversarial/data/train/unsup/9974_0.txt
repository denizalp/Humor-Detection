Nani's specialty is dim sum, which is the Chinese version of tapas. They have a dim sum menu and a entree menu, both offer plenty of options, which is great for those seeking variety.\n\nI was reluctant to order their dim sum as I've never been here before and had no idea what to expect so I decided to play it safe by ordering from their entree menu. I only ordered one dim sum plate, the BBQ pork buns, which are a very common Chinese food. They were delicious! They were the right amount of sweet and savory. For entrees, I ordered the young chow fried rice, BBQ pork spare ribs, and sweet & sour chicken. All three plates were amazing. The food was not overly greasy, like most Chinese food tends to be, and at the same it was full of flavor. The entree portions are pretty big, enough to share between two or three people.\n\nAfter such a delicious meal, I think this is one of the few places in Madison that offer an authentic Chinese food experience. I will surely be back to try their dim sum pretty soon.
