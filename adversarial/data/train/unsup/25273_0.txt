We recently moved to CA from AZ and we wanted to sell our Chandler\nhouse, I interviewed several agents from Yelp, and I selected Tom\nbecause of his vast experience and knowledge about the Chandler\nmarket.\n\nTom made the process as efficient, understandable, and predictable as\nit could possibly be. We could not be happier with Tom's great\nadvise and his ideas on making our house as appealing as possible\nto buyers. Tom priced the house absolutely right for the market and we had 3 offers in first 10 days and we SOLD our house much before our expected time frame.\n\nTom was also great with keeping us up-to-date with developments, and\nvery responsive to our Calls\/Texts and emails whenever we needed\ninformation or anything.\n\nTom took complete care of our house when we moved to CA in the middle\nof closing.\n\nTom's blend of experience, professionalism with a cheerful down-to-earth personality make him a highly effective realtor and a delight to work with. We highly recommend Tom if you're looking for an experienced realtor with East valley real estate expertise. He truly cares for his clients! Thank you Tom!\"
