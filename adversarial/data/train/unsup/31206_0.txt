A great suite for a $100! All around cleanliness and updated furniture. The kind of suite where you're comfortable enough to walk around barefoot if you know what I mean? The bath area has a huge vanity mirror with exceptional lighting. Kitchen is fully functional with a standard size refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave oven, stove with 2 burners, sink and cabinets. Quiet and close to the airport.
