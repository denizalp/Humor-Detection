Atmosphere is nice. I ordered Meatball, Beef carpaccio, Calamari, caprese salad, Duck confit pizza. All dishes are so nice! Must try Beef carpaccio! That was awesome balance of taste. Calamari also enjoyable with sauce. Duck confit and pear is beautiful balance on pizza. Server is so friendly. Definitely come back here.
