Of all the dog parks I've taken Miki to, this one honestly has to be my favorite. It's a very nice open non-fenced park, with a great view of the city and the river. It's also one of the cleaner dog parks too (meaning people properly pick up after their dogs, for the most part). It's also one of the bigger off-leash areas in the city.\n\nThe only downside would be the parking lot and school congestion during weekdays. However, there is plenty of parking on the street.\n\nAfter the May long weekend, the city installs a fountain for both people and their canine companions (which is excellent in the summer).
