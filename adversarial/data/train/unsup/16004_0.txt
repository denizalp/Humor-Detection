A great place to go if you're looking for something to do for a weekend.\n\nMy family and I came here for some fun bonding time. We all chose to do something different. Some of us made candles. Others made soap. And others decorated a cake!\n\nMaking candles: Such a fun process! Pick a shape, chop up some colored wax, choose a scent, watch your candle get made! I made a beautiful rainbow peach scented candle. It smelled wonderful, even a year after it was made.\n\nMaking soap: Got to choose cool letters and glitters go add to it. We got to watch how they make the soap and put it together. It was way cool, and we were all adults. I'm sure the kids to nuts for this!\n\nCake decorating: Difficult according to my cousins. You need a lot of skill and patience. Lots of fun fondant to play with! And then you get to take the cake home and eat it after 50 or so pictures to post on social media. \n\nStaff members here are such a delight! They were so fun and had a great sense of humor. Amazing customer service! They had a cute little Instagram frame in which you could snap a photo of yourself with.\n\nFinding parking was a nightmare though.
