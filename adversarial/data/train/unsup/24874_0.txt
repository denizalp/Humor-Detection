Mesa Grill is hit or miss depending on what you order here. I've had a mix of both hits & misses here and thankfully this visit was a hit.\n\nThis was a quick visit between my bar hopping and other eats this Vegas trip. I told myself I had to stop in here since it's been a year or so since I last visited and I did just for an appetizer. If there's anything I truly enjoyed from my previous visit, it was the sweet potato tamale that came with my pork tenderloin which prompted me to try the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic tamale this time around.\n\nThis tamale was very flavorful...a perfect blend of sweet corn and garlic. The tiger shrimp were a nice size as well as delicious. $18 well spent for a quick snack and worth it.\n\nIf there's one thing I can say about Mr. Flay, he knows how to make some damn good tamales with any spin he throws on them. My taste buds love it which means this will most likely draw me back in for another visit.\n\nSnack 12\/12\/2015
