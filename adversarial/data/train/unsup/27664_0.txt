I tried this place for dinner. There were two staff on- the cook and a girl at the counter. As I waited for service. the girl leaned across the counter and started talking to a friend of hers sitting at a nearby table (who I believe was also waiting for food) about personal life stuff- the cook actually had to tell her to serve the customers, as there was also a lady behind me.  \n\nI ordered a taco salad and it was disappointing. I asked for it without cheese but it came with cheese, unfortunately. As I'd already been waiting awhile, I didn't bother to bring it back. The salad was loaded with a strong, sour vinaigrette- while the description did say there would be a dressing, it was overkill. There was a puddle at the bottom of the shell which made it mushy and inedible. Other than a greens mix, there wasn't much to the salad besides a sprinkling of corn and beans (no rice, grilled veggies, guac, etc). Definitely a let-down.\n\nThe folks working seemed friendly, but I don't plan on going back.
