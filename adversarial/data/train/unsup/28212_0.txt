Pretty good pizza plus they're open late! Slices is definitely the place to go whether its 2am or you just want a quick bite. It's a bit on the pricey side for single slices but they are pretty big. I looove the white pizza! They have a lot of interesting flavors like potato pizza. I really like that their crust is softer than most other places, so it doesn't feel like gnawing on a piece of dry cardboard.\nNot too much indoor seating so it's probably not ideal for large groups, but it's not like it takes too long to finish a slice of pizza. Definitely worth a stop by!
