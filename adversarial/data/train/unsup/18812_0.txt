4 stars for the great service we received from Bree!\n\nThe chestnut praline latte is one of their best holiday beverages!! Got grande the first time. What a mistake!  Did it right the second time around and ordered it venti! Yes, it's that good!\n\nNow I just need to remember to recharge my starbucks card so that I can earn my stars! Shooting for Gold stars in 2015!!\n\nDrive through available at this location and plenty of parking spaces available.
