I love Yoga Tree studios and I have been going to their studios since Dec 2014. They offer a large variety of classes (hot, hatha, yin, restorative, Iyengar) across 5 locations in the GTA. Although this is not my home studio, Bay & Dundas is my favourite Yoga Tree studio. It is conveniently located close to Eatons & Dundas subway station. \n\nThe studio is very luxurious, clean, and beautifully designed. They have 1 hot room, 1 reduced heat room, and another large studio. The washrooms are fully equipped including soap, lotion, and even hair ties, qtips and face cotton balls. The lockers are convenient because you don't have to bring your own lock to use them. There is also a sauna & massage rooms which currently are not in use yet.\n\nI work downtown and I went to the lunch hour yoga. It is short (50 minutes to an hour) and really convenient for those who work and want to fit in a yoga practice during lunch. \n\nThere is also a mat storage space available for $10\/month for those who don't want to carry their mats back and forth. Free tea and cucumber water is available for all the students. I love looking at the yoga merchandise for sale. Also, there is the Pekoe Kombucha bar that's open for those who want to drink kombucha after class.\n\nI did my Yoga Teacher Training (YTT) at Bay & Dundas in Winter 2015. Jason (owner) & Karin (Senior Instructor) are very experienced teachers and I learned a lot from them. The majority of the teachers teaching at Yoga Tree are trained through their own YTT program. The teacher screening process is intense, and it really shows through the quality of classes.
