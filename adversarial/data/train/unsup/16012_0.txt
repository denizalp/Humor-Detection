Came here on a rainy day with friends and wanted a post-workout meal from an intense hot pilates workout. You can never go wrong with the Sexy Bitch Bowl (snark snark), sans the red onions (because I dislike everything onion except for green) and 'shrooms (just because). It had the perfect blend of quinoa (noms), broccoli (yum), avocado (AVOOOO!!!), asparagus (bye bye water weight) and squash (I barely ever eat this stuff) - my only wish is that they have tomatoes or lime for me to squeeze onto. The salmon was soft in texture but not so buttery as I would like it to be. Needless to say I was filled and my burning insides were heartily satisfied. This would be my go-to, that's to say if I come here often after working out. \n\nI asked for a citrusy juice and they recommended the Summer - it was indeed citrusy however nothing extraordinary as any other blended healthy drink. \n\nTake note that they only offer the 10% off Yelp Check-In deal if you plan to write a review.
