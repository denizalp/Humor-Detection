I love Town Square and I am an Apple geek however this store tends to get a bit crazy. The employees have always been very helpful and courteous but its not always easy to get help unless you plan on waiting at least a half an hour. The store does offer everything an Apple enthusiast could want. If you happen to be in the area check it out unless it's on the release date of a new product. Happy shopping.
