Probably one of, if not the, worst experience I've had in recent years.\n\nWhen the highlight of your experience is laughing at a message board on the wall that describes the \"social media post of the week\" and the details rave against the spot - I'll take that as a self-admitted hint not to return.\n\nDuring a humid summer day, my girlfriend meant to meet me here for drinks and a bite before a show.  She was told there was a 45 min. wait for two people. As she stood in the \"lobby\" (a bed sheet wrapped close around the front door entrance, the hostess told her that she'd have to wait outside.  Approx. 60 seconds later, I arrive and meet my gf outside the front door.  When we ultimately decide just to sit at the bar, we're told it's a 25 min. wait for the bar.  As someone walks through the sheet, I point out to the hostess that there are a number of empty seats at the bar to which she responds, \"yeah, there's a wait.  Our bar is pretty popular.\" No more than 5 min. goes by before another hostess says there's space at the bar and she could show us in.  Guess what, while walking to the far side of the bar, I count 4x 6-person tables and a number of other seats that are untaken by even ghosts. To top if off, we're later asked to move so that the newest hostess can squeeze 3 people into 2 chairs at the bar and one stand (one seat on either of us) as we're trying to pay and leave.\n\nThe cocktails were decently priced, but overly sweet or overly poured.  The food was lackluster, and the overall environment is what I would imagine a retro-millennial dorm room to look like if I gave them $1,000 budget.\n\nI won't return again, and I've already warned people not to risk it.
