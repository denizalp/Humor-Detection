I love this place, I am a big fan of Thai food and have been to many places to eat and this is by far one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to. there portions are big, the food is delicious and the price is great. I had the green curry which was amazing and my boyfriend had the pad Thai which was also really good and didn't taste overly sweet and unauthentic like a lot of other places serving pad Thai. Can't wait to go again
