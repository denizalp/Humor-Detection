This place is incredible!!! Moving to AZ from Florida I found it difficult to find sushi that doesn't suck. This place does not suck! I live in Tucson so this will be my new Phoenix noms for sure! It's so good! This place is super casual, the rice is purple,  and good luck finding that bathroom, it's like the dang labyrinth back there. My tip to you is ask for your spicy tuna extra spicy and don't forget to ask for the real wasabi, you won't be let down! Oh and they close from 2-5 but after 5 the parking is free on the road! Enjoy!
