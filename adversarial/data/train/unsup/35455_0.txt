There's nowhere in the city quite like this Ryerson digs. It's been around for a long time, and that's the feeling you get there. The first floor is fine - feels more or less like your average pub with dated furniture and a back room for performances (I've never attended, but the space looks decent). What makes this place special is the upstairs, or the Library. This place feels like Christmas year-round. Between the bookshelves that line the walls, the couches, the lively chatter, the fireplace in the corner, and the Rat Pack music endlessly playing into the early morning, you really can't leave here in a bad mood. Haven't tried too much of the food, but I have tried the wings. They're delicious. I got the Ghost Pepper sauce. I was informed the sauce is made in house and uses Scotch Bonnet - my favourite hot pepper. Usually they only serve the sauce on the side as one too many people have complained that it is in fact too hot. The wings are definitely up there in the top 10 spiciest things I've eaten in Toronto, but my god are they good. \n\nThis place is an experience definitely worth having.
