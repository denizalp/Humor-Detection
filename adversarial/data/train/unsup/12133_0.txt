This was my second visit to Vegas and fortunately my family was there too all the better.  They were arriving from Chicago, with comp on the rooms.  So, that was a plus for me.  Having to not come as far as them, I got there first.\n\nI loved this place for the ambience and the staff.  As crazy as Vegas can be, it seemed really easy here.  So, after off boarding the shuttle I arrive and tell them I'm waiting for my family who the rooms were reserved in.  No problem, they take my bags and off I go.  \n\nSo now, free of luggage, I get to roam around. But first things first I'm starving.  So I head over to Zoozacrackers for a salad.  Pretty good, doing some serious people watching now.  It's always comical in Vegas.  Now that I'm full, I begin to take a gander around the hotel.  It's gorgeous.  If you get a chance to watk through it , do so.\n\nFamily arrives, yea, we get our rooms.  Tower Suite of course.  Wow, incredible.  Room over looks the golf course and part of the pool area.  That's pretty high up.  We decide what to do about dinner and head out.  Mean while I had already scoped out some after hours eateries and the Buffet.  \n\nThe next day we go the Buffet, awesome, I could have stayed here and completely vegged.  \n\nNow, I had an awesome time here, but I will tell you this now I receive comp rooms from the Wynn, I'm terrified.  I lost my ass.  But, that's my fault.  Pluses, they are right across the straight from the Shopping Mall. Minuses, they are on the other end of the Strip.  Plus, it's a great walk to the main drag after the sun goes down.\n\nWould I stay here again, oh yes with a quickness.  Jenni B. hit the nail on the head with her review.  Now, Tryst I did not go to since I prefer the lounges at the other hotels for entertainment and besides that, it's free. :-)
