I'd give this place half a star if I could, only because the only thing they decently delivered on was getting me a vehicle that works. The entire process was unbearable and the level of professionalism was subpar.\n\nEven as I'm typing this, a customer is asking for help with navigation and the employee isn't even stopping to make eye contact and help the customer. He in fact laughed at the gentleman.\n\nAt check in, employees weren't waiting at the desk but were all in some back room. They ended up charging us a $200 deposit, which I've never paid before, seemingly because I had my own insurance and didn't take their collision coverage. I also had to show proof of insurance, which I've never done before with any rental company.\n\nUpon the employee bringing our car around, the employee said that he already took video of the damages so we don't get charged. I saw no official record of what damages he had recorded, and if I didn't ask which damages were on record, he would not have said anything to me. How do I know that I'm not gonna get scammed later and lose my deposit?\n\nReturning the vehicle was also suuuuper sketchy. I walk in with the rental agreement. The employee at the desk tells me to pull the car in back and that they'll email me a receipt. I had already returned the car in back and if I didn't hand her the key, she probably would not have asked for it. I'm pretty sure nobody checked that the vehicle was physically there.\n\nOne sentence review: this place is sketchy AF
