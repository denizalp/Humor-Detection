Okay, when you walk into a restaurant and it smells like bleach, it's best to just leave.\n\nMy cousin and I came in here, and despite the bleach smell, we were super hungry and stayed. We ordered some rolls and a katsu udon to share and some miso soup and salad. The soup and salad were fine, but the rolls were small. They also weren't super tasty. The katsu was good (served on the side and crunchy), but the udon soup was bland. VERY bland. Contemptuously bland.\n\nService was friendly, but unfortunately, it couldn't make up for the food.
