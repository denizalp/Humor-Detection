My husband and I enjoyed a very unique style of dining at The Mixx Grill and Lounge. The concept is called Fresh Market to Table.  A FRESH LOOK AT HEALTHY DINING has come to Summerlin, Las Vegas! The process allows you to choose from three size bowls, small-med-large. Once chosen you choose from fresh greens, pasta, baby bok choy, and many more, vegetables as a base; followed by meats, such as filet mignon, colorado lamb, chicken, pork loin; followed by choice of sauces to top off your desired pallet. Premium meats such as prime angus beef and bison are also available, as well as, ocean premium- lobster, crab and ahi tuna. View the full menu of choice on their website. After you have chosen your desired ingredients, they are slow cooked on a hot stone right in front of you, in a huge open kitchen.  Our dinners were succulent and most satisfying, accompanied by a delicious house red wine! Superb!  The desserts are also hand picked and formulated by the patron with many diverse copulations available to satisfy every dream dessert! We enjoyed cheesecake topped with mango sorbet, hazelnuts and caramel sauce topped with salty bananas!! The chocolate cake is also divine! Special \"thank you\" to Ray- our top shelf server; also special \"thank you\" to J.P., owner, for  presenting such a unique concept to Las Vegas! We appreciate your gracious and attentive presentation. The Mixx opens with a happy hour at 2:30 to 6:30.  The Bowl- Fresh Market concept begins at 5pm till closing. NOT TO BE MISSED!!! COME AND ENJOY THIS UNIQUE DINING EXPERIENCE AT THE MIXX!!
