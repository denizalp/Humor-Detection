Came here for breakfast at 10 AM and the place was hellacioucly busy! I mean busy as the line snaked out the door on a cold Saturday in December. It's a big restaurant but one thing the restaurant failed at paying attention was that it's one big hall so when it's packed it's a loud place. \n\nOnto the food the breakfasts are humongous. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and it came with a huge serving of fruit (awesome) and an equally huge serving of potatoes. I can eat a lot of food but I left a good amount of potatoes to be thrown away as I could not possibly eat that much food. I'm not trying to be a sour puss but they must throw out a lot of food here as the plates are beyond what one person could eat. That kind of food wastage isn't my cup of tea but if you want a monster big breakfast serving come here. The salmon eggs Benedict was a solid 4\/5. My wife ordered an omelette to share with my daughter and another person eating with us ordered an omelette as well. All big servings and everyone had a full tummy as we left. \n\nOverall the experience is a bit meh as for breakfast I prefer a more chill place than Grand Central station. That's just me however. The food was very good just that other parts of the experience could be better. If the restaurant management is reading this please, (I know it's probably all about volume) the coffee you serve is barely palatable. Sure many people may feel fine but a true breakfast restaurant understands the importance of high quality coffee. McDonald's understands this and that's the reason it's a lmeetup\/hangout place for old people now. All you need to do is have a high quality house coffee. Don't even serve capucinno or espresso. Charge a $2 premium for a higher quality one. I'll pay it.
