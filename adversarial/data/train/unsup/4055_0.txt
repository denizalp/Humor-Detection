Ahh, this place makes me think of \"Coming to America\" with Eddie Murphy.... \"Just let your soul glow... just let it shine through!!!\"  This is some of the best soul food in town.  My usual staple for soul food has traditionally been Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles, but I know that if I'm looking for fish and chips, I'm coming to Papa Joe's.   \n\nI had the 2 piece spicy catfish and shrimp; the portions are generous, the catfish is wonderful -- he uses a real light breading on the catfish and a thicker, crunchier breading on the shrimp.  I like the that the catfish was reasonably mild in flavor, although he has an option for spicy breading.   Standard fare includes fries, although I opted for the jalapeno hush puppies, which did not disappoint.    \n\nThe shady neighborhood and bullet holes in the windows add a nice touch to give you that authentic experience as well.
