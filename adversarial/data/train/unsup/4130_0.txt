3 Amigos is meh. It is so meh that I think it defines meh. I think meh should be added to the dictionary with this restaurant as its description.\n\nThe hostess and the two waiters we interacted with were very rude. Suffice to say, they did not seem like our three amigos. Maybe our three frenemies, at best. They didn't really seem to want to seat us or take our order, and I just KNOW that our main waiter avoided our eye-contact whenever possible. It hurt - right in the feelings.\n\nThe food is alright. Little things - would have traded more guacamole for less  chips. And calling it the best guacamole in town is definitely a stretch. It's alright. It's guac. Margaritas were super sweet and tasted synthetic. Will this green concoction turn me into the Green Lantern? Only time will tell.\n\nThere are so many great restaurants to explore in Montreal! Don't let this one steal your fun away, no matter how festive those sombreros look from across the street.
