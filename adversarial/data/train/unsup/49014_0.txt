LOVE LOVE LOVE the fountain show. \n\nYes, I know its dancing water with stupid light bulbs shining through.  Yes, I know we're just listening to Muzak.\nYes, I know its crowded as f*ck and we're all watching water.\n\nI don't care... its freaking amazing and I have to watch it when I go to Vegas.  EVERY.  DAMN.  TIME.
