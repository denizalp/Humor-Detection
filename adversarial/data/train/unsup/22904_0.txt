We go here for karaoke on Friday Nights. They are getting a new host, but Kidd Productions has a great staff so I am sure he or she will still be awesome. There food is AWESOME as far as bar food goes. I have only ever gone on Friday Nights, but a word to the wise: the super skinny blond bartender tends to skimp as far as drinks go and is often not willing to personalize an order. I would suggest the other bartender who is also blond, but looks like she eats and is WAY friendlier.
