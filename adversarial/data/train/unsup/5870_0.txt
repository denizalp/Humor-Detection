I tried Hobe Meats about 3 years ago but they were so rude I swore I would never go back.  Well I decided to give it another try and that was my mistake. I told the lady behind the counter that I had a coupon and she said, you can only pick from these 5 rows of  steaks ($19.00-$33.00 per lb.) and a roast (around $13.00 per lb). The lady behind the counter was huffy when I asked about the other beef.  She said, \"everyone knows that prime beef only includes steaks and roasts.   I ask why they didn't put that in their ad and she just got angrier. She said all the rest of the beef wasn't prime.  I since looked carefully at their ad and it doesn't say all you can get is steaks and roasts.  I ended up with three small packages of meat for $54.00. The man who was really rude before was in the store, slamming stuff around and shooting daggers at me.  I am cured. I will never go back. I learned years ago, my money spends every where and it won't ever be spent at Hobe Meats again.
