Just moved to Gold Canyon and needed a new thermostat installed. Todd, the service technician, showed up early for the appointment. He called when he was about 20 minutes away to let me know he would be early. That's very professional. Not only did Todd install the new t-stat, but he changed all three of the air filters, and took the time to explain how the Nest thermostat worked. He entered all the correct parameters for my system and went through all the different scenarios for heating and cooling. Top-notch company for sure. Would recommend them to anyone! Thanks Todd!
