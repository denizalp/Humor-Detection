It's hard to find good Asian food in this part of the country...so I didn't really have high hopes for this place. It was right next to my next work appointment which made it convenient enough. I got in there around 1 -2pm for a late lunch. \n\nFood: \nThey were out of Pho =(\nI ordered what I typically order to test the skill of the chef. I ordered a Chow Fun.\nChicken Chow Fun - It wasn't too greasy, didn't clump, and had a good balance of flavor. I approve. Not the best but definitely not bad. \n\nService: \nFriendly staff. Owners work hands on as well. They seem to know half the customers walking in. \n\nEnvironment: \nVery pseudo Asian design in here...like the stuff you see on TV. I actually felt like I was sitting in an Asian porn set. Not that I know what an Asian porn set looks like....but...ok...nevermind...\n\nPrice: \nWell priced for the type of food. Honestly if they raised their prices...people would still come because there is not much else nearby. \n\nFood: 4\nService: 4\nEnvironment: 2\nPrice: 4
