My wife and I paid $67 for the buffet, and like everything else at the Rio, it was deserted. There was an outbreak of the norovirus at the Rio this past weekend, and I assume people were worried that it came from the buffet, because it was dinner time and the place was way less than half full. \n\nThey have a velvet rope where they make you wait before being seated. There were three employees standing there staring at us behind the rope. One of them acknowledged us, asked us how we were doing, and then just stood there and stared. Not even ten feet away was a section with about ten tables for two, and only one of them was occupied. As visible as these tables were to us, they were even more visible to the three employees staring at us. Also visible were the buffet lines, with maybe five people total getting food.\n\nWe waited about ten minutes and finally it just grew absurd. We decided to ask for a refund. For $67, at a second-rate off-strip casino, it's ridiculous to make anyone wait. Especially not when the place is basically deserted.\n\nThe refund process was a hassle. The employees all took nasty tones with us, and the manager who gave us the refund didn't even apologize for the whole ordeal.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague. Actually, with the norovirus already present, maybe the plague is next.
