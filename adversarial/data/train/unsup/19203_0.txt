Never use this taxi. I have been nearly crashed into at top speed by these morons changing lanes on the freeways; without looking, without signaling, and without stopping their move as I slam on the brakes to avoid them crashing into me. If you value your lives and others on the freeway, do anything you can to keep these idiots off the road and run THEM into bankruptcy.
