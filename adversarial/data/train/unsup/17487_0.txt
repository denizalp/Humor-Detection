Years ago, I used to go to Tempe Imrov all the time, but the last three or four times, I did not have a good time at all. The comedians weren't funny, the venue was outdated, and the two drink minimum sucked because you end up spending around $50 per person (ticket, drink minimum and tip).\n\nAnyway... It's 2016 and I find out that Jo Koy was coming to town at the Tempe Improv. First of all, I rolled my eyes because of the venue but I LOVE Jo Koy! He is so hilarious especially since I'm Filipino and I can relate to most of his jokes. It was a great time to see him too because I really needed a good laugh. We paid online and with all the fees they tack on to the $25\/ticket, we ended up paying $60 for two tickets. \n\nI suggest heading to the venue at least half an hour early because the parking lot was already packed when I got there half an hour before the show. We were seated right away and of course, the two drink minimum still stands. I decide to order the red sangria, but when I finally receive it, it was horrible! It tasted like orange and cranberry juice and no red wine so I took it back and ordered a red cab instead - obviously they can't mess that up, right?\n\nMy hubby decided to get three bottles of beer to fulfill our 4 drink minimum for the both of us because I did not want to drink anymore. We finally received our bill, but my hubby paid and didn't really look at the receipt. After paying, I finally asked him if he tipped the girl and he said \"yes\". I told him that they automatically charge gratuity of 15%, which obviously he didn't realize. \n\nOn the receipt, it says \"15% gratuity added to all checks for convenience.\" I laughed at it. It really should say, \"15% gratuity added to all checks to trick your ass so that you pay at least 15% regardless of the service and if you don't notice we added gratuity, then I trick your ass again because you paid an additional tip.\"\n\nTotal of our time here: close to $97 for two people (so no change here from prior years)\n\nAs for the comedian, Jo Koy did not disappoint and I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt! When you exit the venue, they guide you to Copper Blues so that you can stick around to drink more and watch the band - it's a pretty slick move to get you to spend more.
