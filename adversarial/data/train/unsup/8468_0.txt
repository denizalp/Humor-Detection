Real thing. Not a jerk chicken expert since west coast options are scarce but Rasta Pasta was lit af. House hot sauce and hot peppers set my mouth on fire. Tears, neck sweat, nose running, fever - check. But enjoyed every minute of it. To beat the heat: mix the coleslaw with rice & beans, oh and a ting soda. I ordered a small jerk chicken (drumstick and thigh), comes with rice & beans and your choice of coleslaw or steamed veggies. Perfect portion size and left me comfortably full. $6 meal homie. Don't forget to ask for extra jerk sauce. \n\nLike the other reviews testify, the chicken literally falls off the bone and the flavor is superb. Easy to find at Kensington Market, pretty busy during lunch and not a lot of seating. I didn't look into the pasta. Hope to try more jerk chicken spots next time I'm runnin thru the 6.
