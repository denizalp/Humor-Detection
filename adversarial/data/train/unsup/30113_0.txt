I was in town and my glasses broke :( I went into monocle optical and they have an amazing selection! I found a pair I LOVED and was out the door with my prescription glasses in 30 min! And he was WAY cheaper than any place I have ever been! Great service and great product! I'll definitely be back and in sending my family and friends. Such a good find! He even let me see how the glasses were made :)
