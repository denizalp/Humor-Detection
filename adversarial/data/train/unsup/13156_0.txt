We didnt have reservations last night for our party of 3.  Jose asked as we arrived then said it's ok I'll seat you ,as he proceeded to tell us there was a party of 8 coming so we'd only have around and 1hour and 15 minutes for our dinner. For a party of 8??? Ok. I thought is was awkward to be told that, and a bit rude! My husband chose this for a surprise date night for myself and our teenager, so I made the best of it . The ambiance was way  pretty though. Small menu selection, but at least it's easy to choose, great flavors. I ordered a Cadillac Margarita, Jose advised me to order that because there was only enough for one so he would sell out. I thought that was a little odd to be told that ,So basically sit down, order and eat quickly and only one drink ! Pay and leave! I didn't feel  welcome here at all.  Jose seemed like a kind man maybe under pressure from over booking or something ,who knows?  First impression not a very good one though .  I'll stick with Lindo Michaocan they always make my family and myself feel overly welcome wether it's just the 2 of us or the 3. Plus better  Margaritas they are scrumcious at Lindo it's right down the street from here anyway.
