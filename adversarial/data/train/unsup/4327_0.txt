On our way to airport we stopped to have quick lunch.\nOrdered the Mussels and when they arrived they were the largest mussels I have ever seen, seriously steroid version.\n\nIt was hard to choke down one I even tried to cut into pieces, just had horrible bitter watery taste.  We told our server we would like something else.\n\nDecided on a couple sushi rolls which were nothing to brag about.  Then thought we are in a Thai restaurant lets order curry, that is what they do best.\n\nWe chose a red curry, the waitress was hard to understand we thought we ordered hot.  To our surprise, it arrives with those giant Mussels back in!!! We both laughed so hard, felt like scolded children, you will keep getting these Mussels until you finish!!!\n\nNeedless to say we paid the bill and left. \n\nOk I admit do not eat a lot of Thai, although like a red curry and I enjoy spicy food.
