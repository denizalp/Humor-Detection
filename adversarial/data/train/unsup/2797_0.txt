I've been dragged here numerous times over the time they've been open - both Pickering and Mississauga locations: overdone, dry chicken; hopelessly dry burgers (which they say are supposed to be that way \"because they're made a grill\"); steaks are cooked incorrectly and full of sinew; and poor, careless service every time. Proof that people settle for mediocrity when it comes to halal 'western' restaurants because lack of choice.
