i came here to get a fill because my normal nail place wasnt open early enough on sundays and they opened at 10a (i had somewhere to be at 11a)\n\ni called the night before to make an appointment and still had to wait when i got there because all of the employees were late except one. she rushed through my fill (who does a fill in 15 minutes?!) \n\nshe was also pretty insulting because she kept asking me if i wanted to get my eyebrows waxed while i was there. i kept telling her that i do them myself and i knew they needed to be done i just hadnt had time. i dont trust anybody with my face except me and i'm glad i didnt have her do them because she did a shitty ass job on my nails.\n\nthey were so bad i went to another place a week later and got a whole new full set. \n\ndont go here.
