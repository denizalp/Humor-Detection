I am happy that Pizza Care offers to the community healthy pizza. They have crusts that are whole wheat, multi-grain, and gluten-free (as well as regular unhealthy crust if you still prefer that). They try to reduce the sugar, fat, and sodium as much as possible in all of their ingredients. They also sell breadsticks, hoagies, wings, soda, pasta, salad, gyros, wraps, strombolis, desserts, etc. The food still tastes good and has similar prices to other restaurants.
