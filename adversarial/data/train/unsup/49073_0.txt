A nice little oasis at the Charlotte airport. The seating area is blessed with high ceilings and copious natural light, which might not work on a very sunny day but was perfect for my slightly overcast visit. To start with, my mojito made me very happy. Loads of fresh mint, used to great advantage.  I had a salad with a piece of skirt steak on top and it was much better than it should have been. This is real food from a real kitchen. Sure, the plastic cutlery is a drag (airport security), but I'd be surprised if you could do much better than this while at the airport in Charlotte.  Check it out.
