What happen to Chilis. I used to eat at Chilis all the time. Great food and the Margaritas where always great. It's been about 5 years and I recently went. The Margaritas and service where great. The food was nothing like it used to be. I had the southwest egg rolls and the fajitas. The egg rolls tasted like something they bought in the frozen section of walmart. The fajitas came out with barley any veggies and only three tortillas. I was not happy and they have lost me as a customer
