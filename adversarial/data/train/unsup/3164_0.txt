what's worse than ghetto people at wal mart? ghetto store employees. This place is a cesspool and the customer service is just as bad. Long lines even in the fast check out. Store employees you can hear cussing, listening to head phones, playing on their phones, and looking like they came from the same trailer park as the store customers. smelly African American  trannys with foul smelling odors flock to this place to buy dry dog food and rubbing alcohol - don't ask me.
