We wanted to try a new restaurant. I was far from be impressed by Milestones. The waitress seems to be in a rush all the time. I confirmed she was.  When the drinks came, in 5 drink (3 waters) one was missing. The taste on the other 2 drinks was not right. It seems the soda dispenser was bad.  To be fair the waitress told us that the food would take 30 mins and it took that. The food was ok.\n\nYou spend money on these places to have a good time and has a good experience. At the end of the meal, no one of us (5) would say that there was something to make us come here again.
