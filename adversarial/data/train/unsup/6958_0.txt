Rolled up to Nature's AZ Medicines last Thursday after a disappointing rec league soccer game and my PTSD was needing some serious attention. Everywhere else seemed to be closed at 9p or earlier and when I got to NAZM's at 9:35p, there were about a dozen people in the waiting room. I was greeted and found a seat in the waiting room. \n\nAfter about ten minutes, Jordan brought me back and showed me the selection. It's an impressive layout (to this amateur anyways) with television listing the products and jars of bud lining the walls. Jordan let me know I got a free pre-roll with my first visit and took care of my order. I like that they measure out the weights right in front of you so you can see what you're getting. As he rung me up, Jordan also noticed that I had a veteran identifier on my driver's license and recalc'd my price with my associated 5% discount, which I appreciated because I had no idea it was offered. And besides -- the military service is what got me needing weed to keep my shit together in the first place -- so I guess I'll take the 5% off for it. \n\nHere's hoping next week's game goes better and I don't have to go through my free pre-roll by halftime.
