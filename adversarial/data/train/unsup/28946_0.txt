If you want the WORST EXPERIENCE bar in Las Vegas you gotta try Wahoo's Boca Park. Went in with my wife for a beer and taco and the waitress passed by 5 times and hung out on the other side of the bar. Even served the man beside us and just completely ignore . Finally asked if we were getting served and she just walked away to the other side. We decided to leave after 10 minutes of this and asked her name...answer CAN'T YOU READ, step into the bar to get her name as she was hiding it and got told to get the hell out of her bar.Yelling and screaming get the hell out of my bar! \nCalled her boss, on vacation for 2 weeks and contacted head office in Cali. At first they emailed right back, then it was we have to see video, then it was main guy was away. Finally local manager contacted me and we meet. Now this guy comes up with some story we were cursing at her, and some older lady agreed( think it was a friend of the bar tender??)so she was justified. Maybe I should have but sorry still a gentlemen.\nI'm 64 yrs old and my wife was with me , why would I embarrass myself in a 2 bit surf bar such a way. Conclusion I stopped the emails as they hoped it would just go away. \nThe owners acted the same as the staff, JUST IGNORE THE ISSUE IT WILL GO AWAY!\nI own 2 business and my staff would have been let go instantly for this service, oh yea but I forgot she was friends with the owner and had a gaming clientele.\nYou just gotta go there and have the short fat one with the twin peaks serve you, sorry ignore you. If you love to be abused, lied and threatened  this is the place for you.\nConclusion the business is a reflection of its leadership WORST BAR IN MY 64 YEARS  MANAGEMENT AND OWNERSHIP. AND YOU CAN GO FOR ABUSE TOO !
