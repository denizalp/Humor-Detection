Fantastic sushi. Like others I implore you not to judge this book by its cover. The service and food is incredible. We had the edamame, garden salad and clear soup to start. All were best in class. Then we had the ninja roll, tuna roll and California roll. Again, all were top notch. \n\nNo alcohol is offered, but you can bring your own. So if you are looking for a great dinner, grab a bottle of wine, a friend, and head on over.
