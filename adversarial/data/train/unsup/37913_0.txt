The paint on my truck had been sun and dirt beaten to the point where I wasn't really sure if compounding would be sufficient. Turns out it was. Peter restored the surface on my car beyond what I thought was possible. Amazing service. Worth every penny. He also subdued and almost removed the thick funk\/smoke smell from the interior courtesy of the previous owner. Thoroughly impressed. Very flexible service. They worked with my tight schedule. Look no further if you're looking to have your vehicle detailed.
