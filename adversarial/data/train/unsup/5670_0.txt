Although I am not a big fan of buffets, Le Village Buffet had in the past was always pretty good.  Unfortunately, this time around it was mediocre, just another Vegas buffet.  \n\nOne of the things I like in a buffet is the seafood bar.  Unfortunately, the selection this time around was limited and the Alaskan crab just didn't seem that fresh or tasty.  Moreover, the carving station was not all that great, the prime rib was average.\n\nUpside, big desert bar and plenty of selections.
