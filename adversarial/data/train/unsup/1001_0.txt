October 26, 2018 Friday - 1:30 PM for lunch \n2 Adults\n\nAtmosphere - 4 stars\nFood - 5 stars\nService - 5 stars\n\nBackground - Just arriving in Vegas from Reno via a long drive and need lunch.  Decided to hit a Diner, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  I have my Vegas Triple D's all in a collection in Yelp and used a map to find somewhere where I needed to be.\n\nAtmosphere - I completely forgot that this place was inside a casino until we pulled into the casino parking lot via Google map directions.  You can tell this place has expanded since Triple D has aired.  Just a few other people we dining.  Take out was going steady even at this later lunch time.  It has the old diner feel, but recently built, with a little touch of Chinese art.  The counter has probably 6 spaces, with 5 booths, and a few tables.\n\nFood\n  Drink - Lucky Buddha beer, it is all about the bottle.  Really the beer is just blah.  They even use the old bottles as vases on the tables.\n\n  Lunch - Dinner reservations are coming up fast.  So my wife and I shared a meal.  Asian Duck Confit on Rice, which comes with a balsamic house salad.  The salad was good but felt out of place.  Perhaps an Asian veggie mix would having to the duck confit beer.  The duck was next to rice with rice covered in a light amount of sauce.\n\n\nService - Friendly.  Like any diner you pay at the register, which the area is a little cluttered.\n\nFuture - I could see coming back here.
