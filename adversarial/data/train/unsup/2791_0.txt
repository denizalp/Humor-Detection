I would give it 0 stars if I could.  The store is a mess of plants and trees scattered throughout mud piles.  Owner is an obnoxious bitter unhappy man with 0 customer service and female employee must have taken lessons from him.  Do not believe there Warrenty they do not stand by it!  Trying to work with them to resolve an issue the response was sue me. Wtf?  Most unprofessional I have ever experienced. PLEASE BEWARE!!!!!!  Old Old man gets a kick out of his bad customer service!  He's laughing all the way to the bank.  Don't give him your money!
