after I had stake here, I am not satisfied any other stake house...sign.\nDelmonico stake is the best.\nMake sure to get \"bone in rib eye\"\nSimple salt & pepper, and you can taste the MEAT.\nFillet minon was good, but compare to salt & pepper rib eye, I like rib eye 100 times better.\nThe excellent cooking temperature, perfect medium rare.\nI have no complain. \nAmazing.\n\nAlso, the simple lettuce wadge salad was amazing, too.\n To make this simple dish this good is wonderful.\n\nI highly recommend this place.\n\nSo, sad that they are not near where I live.
