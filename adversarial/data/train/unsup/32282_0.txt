Good service, tasty margarita, so so food. \n\nI went in on Tuesday night to have dinner and a couple of margaritas. I was by myself and I sat at the bar to eat. The bartender was busy with other customers when I came up, so it took him a little while to get to me which is understandable. Apparently it was Taco Tuesday which meant  $1 beef tacos and $2 Tecate beer. Unfortunately, I am allergic to onions and yeast, so both the attractively priced specials were off my list of options. I decided to go with the fish tacos, which the bartender recommended....I've had better. In fact, I've had better fish tacos at both Rubio's & Baja Fresh. The fish tacos came ala carte and were $4 apiece. $8 seems like a lot for two breaded fish sticks, sauce, and cabbage, each in a single flour tortilla. They weren't horrible, they were just OK, so so, mediocre...and they just weren't worth the price I paid. I would say they were $1 quality fish tacos. \n\nThe bartender was fantastic and really friendly. My margaritas were also delicious. I thought they were priced a bit high at $8 each. They were served in what seemed like a smaller margarita glass, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, my glass was also filled to the rim with ice. When my drink was gone it was still filled to the rim with ice.\n\nSo the good points were that the place had a friendly, laid back atmosphere, friendly and personable bartender, tasty margaritas, comfortable to hang out at, and I can ride my bike there. \nDownsides were that the margaritas were to small\/over iced & a little too pricey, food was second-rate and over priced for what you got.\n\nBottom line, it was a nice place to hang out at, and I would probably go back again just for margaritas at happy hour when they are half price.
