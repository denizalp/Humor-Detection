We went to Tandoori Times last night as it was the only place we fancied that was open!\n\nOnly 2 other tables were taken and our service was great. Really friendly server. \n\nFood was pretty good. I had the Mattar Paneer and hubby had the Chicken Vindaloo 'Chef Hot'. Also tried the chili naan. All very good. Not the best we've ever had, but very good. \n\nPlace could do with a good clean. The area under our table hadn't seen a broom or mop in a while. \n\nBut all in all, we liked it and would go back.
