I have been searching for European food & I've finally found this place which hit the spot! I miss my moms & grandmas cooking so much & this is the closest I can find in Vegas! The staff is so friendly & the atmosphere is very unique, felt like I was back home & I loved it!\nThe food is great & I can't wait back to explore the menu! They even have European dumplings just like my moms pierogi & that nostalgic taste makes me so very happy!\nI cannot wait to go back!
