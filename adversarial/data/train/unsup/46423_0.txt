Hands down the worst fast food experience I've ever had. Wanted to stop in real quick for a bite before we needed to be somewhere in north ridgeville. No one in line, only a couple of people waiting for their order, thought it would be good.\n\nNope.\n\nWaited for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there. And the first thing I'm told is it's a 13 minute wait on original chicken. Not hello, but that we'd have to wait longer with the most 'I dont care' to be I've heard. I then asked what about tenders and the cashier just started at me without answering.\n\nI said fuck this I'm leaving. Running late now.\n\nAlso those people waiting for their order were still waiting for it and were demanding a refund as I was leaving.
