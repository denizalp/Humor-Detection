I love love love the Nobu inside Caesars!\n\nPro-tip: reserve a seat at the teppan-yaki table. You can still order sushi and everything else there as well, and it's just a fun, sexy experience. Most recently I was here with a friend and we ordered a couple rolls, lots of nigori sake, and split the tasting menu. I'm so glad we decided to share because it was SO much food:\n\n-sea bass\n-lobster tacos\n-rock shrimp\n-shishito peppers\n-tuna tartare\n-wagyu beef\n-chocolate lava cake\n\nThe chef also sent out some other fun items, I can't remember what they were...one was a white fish, but everything was incredible! My favorite bites were the rock shrimp and sea bass. Definitely go!
