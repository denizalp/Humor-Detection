Always a pleasure to eat at this BJ's. There's great atmosphere, many tasty food and dessert options, as well as a wide drink selection, all for decent prices! \n\nThis particular visit I had the Calimari and Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. The Calimari was delicious, came both in the round and typical squid pieces, and was accompanied with marinara and a creamy, white dipping sauce. \n\nThe tacos tasted just like a typical chicken pita and came with a side of quinoa mixed with rice. The waiter suggested cholula hot sauce which definitely kicked the tacos up a knotch.\n\nOverall, very satisfied with the food and even more satisfied with the attentive and personable waiter.
