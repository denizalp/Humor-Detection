Extremely disappointed and would not recommend consigning fairly new and nice furniture items.. I brought in 3 pieces of furniture that were purchased within a 2 year time period and were still in the store catalogs.  I gave them the receipts and they had priced them less than 1\/2 of what they were purchased for and that was okay, but what disturbed me was, they were marked down within 2 weeks of being in the store and I was told that they had a lot of interest and it was priced to high.  The two desirable pieces sold as soon as they were marked down and the 3rd piece which was less desirable was never marked down ???.  I still can't figure that one out. When I questioned the man on the floor,  his response was we need to price that down too.  Very arrogant attitude and I learned my lesson the hard way.  There are many Consignment stores out there and they wait 60 days before they mark down an item and you split the purchase 50\/50.  If it's a nice item, I'd go else where..
