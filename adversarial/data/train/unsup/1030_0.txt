The Falcon and Firkin is a decent neighbourhood local pub if you want to just chill with your friends and watch a game.\n\nNothing too fancy but is spacious enough so it never feel too crowded even on busy nights.\n\nThe beer selection is decent more than the usual Canadian or Coors Light. I never try the food aside from carrots and celery and fries but seems like they are standard overpriced pub food. \n\nThere are also daily specials: $13 Pitcher, 65 cents Wings, $4.75 domestic pints..\n\nI will always remember this pub as where I watched Leafs lost to Boston 7th game 1st round playoffs which will probably go down as the worst breakdown in the NHL playoff history...\n\nThe backroom has a huge TV which is good for groups.\n\nParking can be pretty tight! Seriously tight as the parking lot is so small and people are parking their cars all over the place. But the free municipal parking is just a few minute walk away.
