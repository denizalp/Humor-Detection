This is my favourite store for fabric. I am not a quilter but use fabric for many of my projects. The staff are amazing! They always remember me even though I live in Edmonton and when I lived in Toronto they offered to send me fabric. It is a small store with floor to ceiling stock on a variety of fabric styles and types. Yesterday we were approached by three staff members offering to help us find what we need. We were able to get our fabric cut and paid for in a fraction of the time you expect at the bigger stores with more staff. Sometimes it is a squeeze because it is so popular, but it is worth it. \nThe owner always takes time to ask me what my latest project is and offers tidbits to make it even better. Love the attention I get from their service.\nIt is my first stop every time we go to Calgary and I always leave with a huge stash of fat quarters.\nLoveLoveLove
