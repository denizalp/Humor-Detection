If you're looking for a day to go to a great liquor store followed by 15 minutes of road rage then this is your place.\n\nI love total wine. They carry pretty much anything you can imagine. Obviously great assortment of wine but tons of the hard stuff as well. They even get many hard to find craft brews. I also love the wine tastings which seem to be daily as they are having them pretty much very time I am in. The sips of wine really to quell the rage of the parking lot.\n\nI do occasionally find they have boxes and restocking carts in the isles which get a little crowded with the large shopping carts. Either get the boxes out of there or give us small carts!\n\nThat being said. I will be back. Probably today. It's Friday after all.
