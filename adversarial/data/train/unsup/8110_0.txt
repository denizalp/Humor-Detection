Not much was open on Boxing Day in the east end, but I was out of Christmas wine. Ah oh! Ah oh! Sound the alarm! \n\nFewf. PG was open it's usual hours, until 2am. Double fewf. \n\nI'm sure the food is just as solid as I mentioned in my previous reviews, but something ugly happens here after dark these days. There is a bouncer. There are frat boys everywhere. The music is top 40 and far too loud. Any signs of sophisticated life appear to have disappeared into the cold Leslieville air, leaving me in some twisted hell. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: Sick jager bomb, brah.
