I'll be honest...I was looking for Einstein Brothers bagels, and didn't find them right away, so I decided to stop in here.  It actually turned out to be a good decision!\n\nThere was one man working the joint.  I went with an everything bagel with cream cheese, and a garlic bagel, plain.  Total for both bagels was a little under $4.00.  Not bad..not bad at all.  Here is how they were..........\n\nEverything bagel with cream cheese-  First of all, this was a big ass bagel!  When I unwrapped the white paper, I was impressed!  This thing had a ton of cream cheese on it and was cut in half so that it gave you 4 quarter slices of bagel to enjoy.  The everything bagel had the usual poppy seeds\/garlic\/salt etc on the outside and was incredibly tasty.  The outside had a nice crunch to it and the inside was nice and chewy.  I detected a hint of sourdough, too (might use a sourdough starter for their bread?  Whatever it was, it was delicious!)! This was one mighty fine bagel.  Probably the best bagel I have had in the Phoenix area since moving out here permanently.  \n\nGarlic bagel-  Delicious!  Lot's of garlic salt\/pieces on it.  Crunchy outside, chewy inside, just like the everything bagel. \n\nOverall, I was happy I \"got lost\" and found this place.  It is a bit hard to find (behind Bank of America, next to Starbucks on the corner of Bell & Grand), but it is worth the search to locate it.  These bagels were really good, prices were fair, service was to the point and it's a locally run business.  I'll be back soon enough!
