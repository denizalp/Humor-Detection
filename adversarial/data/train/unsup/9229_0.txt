Went with my family and we waited a few minutes and got the table and it was busy because it was a game night but it's a fun atmosphere and the stuff where very nice and the have tv everywhere and the food is always hot and fresh and good amount of sauce and they have good deals every week and you need to try the every sauce like they have 100 types from dry \/ wet sauce for boneless or bone and every Thursday the boneless wing is 75 cent each so that's a good deal and if you want to do a party or gathering with friends and they have a kids menu and you know can order from the app or website and pick up at the restaurant and on Tuesday, traditional wing for $0.75 cent each and they have cool beer selections and you need to try and they do family night from 4pm-8pm so I very highly recommend this restaurant for family and friends
