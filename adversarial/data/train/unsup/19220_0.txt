This place has great food, awesome tacos and a great Happy Hour plus every Tuesday is $2 taco Tuesday all day.\n\nWe've been here twice now and have NOT been disappointed in the service, food  & drinks...cannot have tacos without tequila...\n\nThey stay open late which is great for a place that had such great food and drink.\n\nThe staff have all been warm and friendly not to mention they remember you and acknowledge this.  I highly recommend this place no matter if you come during Happy Hour, on Taco Tuesday or just anytime.\n\nThey have several tv's around the place and the decor is very cool. Most people never look up when they go to a place or if they do they really don't notice the unique decor places have.  Make sure you take some time to check out the ceiling at just enjoy all the interesting decor.  We will be back over and over....
