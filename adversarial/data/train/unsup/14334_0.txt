I ate here once before and the food was decent. I decided to return and plan my mother's birthday party at the restaurant and booked for a group of 12. The restaurant manager told us that we were allowed to bring our own birthday cake and birthday candles but that the cake was NOT ALLOWED TO BE EATEN!! He said that the cake would be taken away and that we would have to order dessert of their menu. Now, has anyone heard of something more ridiculous?! I know some restaurants charge a nominal fee if you bring your own cake but to not allow patrons to eat their cake is nuts.  I think the owners need to find a new manager before he drives the poor place in to the ground. To refuse a party of 12 over a cake with out offering a reasonable alternative leaves me speechless.
