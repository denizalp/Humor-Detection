I have finally found my go to delivery spot for greasy Americanized Chinese food! After trying several others (Cook on Wok comes to mind) that fell short, this one so far has been far better than anything else I've tried in Vegas. *note - for \"fake\" chinese food, clearly this place isn't authentic and doesn't try to be! \n\nAll of the meat dishes come in \"small\" (which is still very good sized for 2 people). Be sure and ask for the small size if there's only a few of you or you want to try a few things. \n\nPork fried rice - classic greasy chinese food staple. Plenty of pork!\n\nSesame chicken - the best rendition of this I've ever had. Sticky, sweet, crunchy, delish! So far no weird chewy chicken pieces that I usually find in Chinese food dishes\n\nMongolian beef - very spicy and I wasn't loving the beef.. kinda chewy. This one I won't be getting again\n\nDumplings - good for chinese delivery, but nothing to write home about\n\nCrab ragoons - the best ones I've had here. Getting the perfect blend of \"crab\" and cream cheese is an art and these guys rock !\n\nIt says no MSG... there's probably some trace MSG in the food or something, but I can say I do feel fine after eating here - which is more than I can say about most asian places in town. Delivery was quick, prices are reasonable. I'm in love.
