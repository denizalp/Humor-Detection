The five stars are for the Hebrew National hot dog that they serve at the Costco Cafe.  They've got a competing 1.50 special for a long pole vault size Hebrew National dog that is so good, you might want to get two.\n\nThe shopping isn't as good as some competing bulk shopping stores but I like their produce section a whole lot more.  But yes, it's the hot dogs that keep my membership alive.  I'm a slave to the weiner. I'll admit it but I'm not seeking any help because I don't want to be cured.\n\nOne warning though, you can shop with your debit card but the Costco Cafe only accepts cash so have some handy.
