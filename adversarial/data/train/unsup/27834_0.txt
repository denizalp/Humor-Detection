I have am a fresh client with ABS, well for about 4 months that is. The printer I received has had no issues and they connected all my computer to the printer as part of the initial setup, which most companies i compared to only connect the first 5 computers as the initial setup.....\n\nsince the intial setup my business has grown and have had to add 2 more computers. They did charge us to add and setup the new computers for me, but I understand that they can not stay in business by doing things for free and I found them to be more helpful than my previous Print Company who told me to find an I.T. Guy to make any changes.\n\nWhen it comes down to it I am giving 4 stars, there customer service is great and when you call them you get to talk to a real person and not a machine. They provide both Printer support and IT Support, so this is easier for me to have one company that can do everything and assist in  managing my entire structure than having to call different companies to get one task done.\n\nThank You ABS for all your support with my Printers and IT Structure and I look forward to doing business with you
