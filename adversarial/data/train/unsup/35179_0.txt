This place is horse shit. First of all they charged our 8-year old who ate one small plate the same price as adults. Their sushi is worse than the take-out sushi you can buy at Vons. Their crab legs suffered from anorexia. Even their steamed rice was hard and overcooked. They couldn't even get STEAMED RICE right. I remember when this was the best buffet on the strip. Now it's pure shit. Stay clear.
