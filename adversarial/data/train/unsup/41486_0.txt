I love TMI, one of my favorite restaurants and hangout spots in town. The best time to go is on Sunday and Monday for Happy Hour for half off beer (which can be dangerous). I love sitting outside in the patio and listening to old school hip hop. Great date place, group place and dog friendly. \n\nThey have a rotating taps, which usually has at least one awesome and rare IPA such as Green Flash West Coast or Coronado Islander. \n\nThe food is great too. I love their salads like the Baby Bleu and the Winner. The grilled cheese, Artichoke Heaven and Jive Turkey are all phenomenal too. I would stay away from the olives though, as it is probably the only thing I've sent back to a kitchen ever.
