Honestly, I didn't expect much when the family suggested eating dinner here. C'mon, seafood restaurant just off the floor of the South Point casino, how good could this place be? Well actually, pretty darn good. \n\nAll I can remember is that we ate good...crab legs, cioppino, clams, oysters rockerfeller,  calamari, clam chowder, and a bunch of other goodies. Everything was really good, including the service. Prices weren't too shabby either.\n\nEntire family left satisfied. As they saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover.
