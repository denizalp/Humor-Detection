First time here and will never coming back! First of, they don't give lemon or lime for your water. The rude old ladies doesn't greet you. I ordered my food and it was not I expected. Made my stomach hurts and didn't even eat it all. It came with a scramble egg and it was nasty! Macaroni is bad too. Idk why most of these people here gives them 5 stars. I should've read the reviews. They charge for food that is not even good. Wth is that.. they don't even ask you if are done with your plate. They just grab it whenever they want it to. DONT COME AND WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!
