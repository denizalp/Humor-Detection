We came here dinner and surprised at the Korean spots around Mesa.   Ordered fried chicken wings, spicy chicken and the katsu.   The katsu dish is the signature and very juicy and awesome katsu sauce.  A little weird because I thought katsu was Japanese, but whatever.  The wings were tasty, the spicy wings are the solid but over sauced.    Satisfied and plenty of sitting and space for the kids to run around.
