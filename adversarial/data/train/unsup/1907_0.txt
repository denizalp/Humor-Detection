My fiance desperately wanted to watch the sunset somewhere and I wanted to celebrate officially picking a wedding date\/venue! So, of course, I immediately thought of Sanctuary because of their gorgeous views and delish cocktails. We walked in through the lobby entrance and stepped out to the Elements balcony where a nice man handed us a glass of {complimentary} champagne and said \"Here is a toast to the sunset!\" Ummmm, WHAT?! Our day, wait month, was literally made! How did he know that was what we came there for?? He literally read our minds. Now folks, THAT is world class service!! \n\nAfter enjoying the delicious glass of champagne, we walked over to Jade Bar where we had yummy HH cocktails and some chips & guac to tie us over until dinner. \n\nGuys, if you're looking to knock the socks off of your significant other, take her HERE! ...Even just for drinks! They are about $12-$14 not on HH but on HH, they range from $7-$9. Happy Hour goes until 6 PM. The views are insane and the service is impeccable. We'll be back soon for sure. (Shhh, don't tell but i'm also a HUGE fan of their spa!)
