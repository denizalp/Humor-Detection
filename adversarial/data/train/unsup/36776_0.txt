I needed a one-time deep clean for my Richmond Hill townhome.  That is one room, one main three-piece bathroom, kitchen, living room and entryway done.  I mainly just wanted scumming, floors done and a general good wash for my home. The maids pulled up in a car with the company logo on it and they brought their own supplies (vacuums, disinfectants etc). Their maids are insured for theft and damage. And I paid cash (tax included) when they completed the job.\n\nMaid Day charges $85\/hour (for two maids with the Supreme Package Service), so it's on the pricey side. \n\nThe Supreme Package from their site states:\n\"vacuuming all carpeted areas, floors including under all furniture and moveable equipment, sweeping and hand washing of the floors, dusting all surfaces including windowsills, blinds, shutters, baseboards, spot washing walls, light switches & doors. Wiping all knick knacks, polishing mirrors & glass, Removing cobwebs, trash removal, bathroom cleaning - wiping down sinks, mirrors, counters, toilet fixtures, bathtub\/tiled walls, wiping down all the walls and baseboards, window sills and blinds, design towels & toilet tissue. Sanitizing kitchen cupboards, countertops, degrease exterior appliances, inside microwave, polish all knick knacks, canisters. Wash dishes\/load & unload dishwasher, sanitize kitchen sinks, table & chairs sanitized, remove garbage, clean garbage container, hand wash floors.\"\n\nPersonally, I think they did a satisfactory job. They completed maybe... 50 - 60% of what the package outlines... I was given a checklist by the company to show the maids (which I passed onto them), but they didn't even look at it. The maids seem to just do what they are used to doing. (I didn't want them to do the microwave, but it was done anyway etc).  So the checklist process seemed pretty useless.  One maid was kind enough to vacuum the bottom portion of a cat tree I had which was great. In an hour and half, they were only able to finish the bathroom, master and kitchen.  My living room was untouched, so was my hallway.  I asked them to quickly vacuum the entryway mats before they left but if I hadn't said anything, I think they would have just left it. \n\nWhen it came to meeting my expectations, I really felt that 1.5 hours should have been enough time. But I did notice them taking quick breaks and answering personal cell phone calls while cleaning.  It didn't take up much of their time, but I think productivity could have been maximized if they had taken a few minutes reviewing my checklist\/needs. \n\nAlso, they started the clock as soon as they arrived.  My briefing (asking them not to go into certain rooms etc) counted towards that time... and they stopped exactly two minutes before 1.5 hours (I also used my stopwatch to record their time as soon as I finished welcoming them into my home). \n\nOver Rating 2\/5. Underwhelming.
