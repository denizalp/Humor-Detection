Worst service I have ever had at a sushi restaurant. Took over an hour just to get our food. When we asked where the rest of our order was, they said they were busy and to reorder it. It took almost another 40 minutes to get ice cream (that was melted). Had to ask a few times for water refills and when asked the servers for it they looked lost and would avoid our table for the rest of the time we were there. Will not be returning
