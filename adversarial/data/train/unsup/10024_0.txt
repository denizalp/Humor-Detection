We came to watch a soccer game and asked if they're going to show it and the hostess told us they will.\nWe found out theyre not showing it after we sat on the bar and asked the bartenders if they can switch the channel after we waited for 15 minutes with nothing happening. Eventually we decided to leave.\nAlso there was a bartender who was very rude to us while we sat there, didn't pay attention to us and waved us with a laughing smile when we left.
