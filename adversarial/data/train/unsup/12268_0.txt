On the 2nd Floor of The Cosmopolitan is Milk Bar by Christina Tosi. It's the sister bakery to Momofuku Restaurant by David Chang, who Tosi used to work for as pastry chef! Her specialty was turning toasted cornflakes steeped in milk into the base for her ice cream, panna cotta, and ice cream pies. In 2008, she opened up her first Milk Bar in NYC. And now there's a storefront here in Las Vegas!\n\nWe stared at the menu and truly had no idea what to order, so the nice young man behind the counter offered samples to try. First we tried the Crack Pie and then the Cereal Milk soft serve. Sold! We decided to order a slice of the Crack Pie to-go, a pint size Soft Serve of Cereal Milk topped with crack pie to share, and a single size Soft Serve with corn flake crunch.\n\nThe Cereal Milk flavored soft serve tasted just like the bottom of your bowl cereal milk with a tinge of corn flake flavor, except in frozen form. Pretty cool! It was light and frothy-like, not too sweet. My kind of dessert. But, the addition of the bite-sized crack pie toppings made the dessert a little overbearing. The pint size for two of us was actually a generous serving and we couldn't finish it. The single size for half the price would've been perfect.\n\nOn the other hand, the corn flake toppings on the single size serving was a lighter dessert with a nice crunchy texture. Probably will order that next time!\n\nThe Crack Pie itself is very rich. It is a chilled slice of buttery, brown sugar custard on a toasted oat crunch. It's like a cross between baklava and a granola bar. Very filling yet satisfying in just a few bites. Probably better with a cup of coffee.\n\nSo much more to try and I'm sure I'll be back with friends and family so we can share! Cookies, cakes, breads, milkshakes, fancy shakes - a whole lot of sweetness right there!
