Smoke-free equals lots of stars from me! That's the main idea of this paragraph. It can be hard to find an establishment that offers video-poker that is smoke-free and serves decent kibbles, but if that's what you're looking for, look no more. Shucks is the place for you.\n\n(I don't play video poker, but I appreciate the plight of those that are trying to keep their health while doing a little gaming.)\n\nShucks is known for seafood, but I am not a huge seafood eater, so I will just say that my husband, who does, likes the snow crab legs, but did not like the oysters. The oysters are farm-raised. \n\nI have had two different entrees: mahi fish tacos and their Black and Bleu salad. I would definitely order the fish tacos again. The only minor complaint is that the tortillas are flour, and I love corn. The salad was not incredible. It is a good value because it comes with a nice portion of flat iron steak. However, the steak was dry and under seasoned, and the lettuce a bit wilted. If executed better, I am sure it would be delicious, but on the night I visited, it fell a bit short. \n\nThe other great thing about Shucks is that they have some type of special every day of the week. Most notably, $2-3 drafts every Monday and Wednesday. Kids eat free on Sunday. There's more, but you'll just have to roll up to find out. It will be a fun surprise for you.
