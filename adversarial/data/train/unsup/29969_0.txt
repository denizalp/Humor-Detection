5 stars all the way for Jenaro and Dr. Cool.  I recently posted a review on Air Pro Max LLC who pretty much sucked so bad.   \nJenaro called me and I was at work.  I told him and explained to him what the tech from Air Pro Max did.  The Air Pro Max LLC technician installed the blower incorrectly and was unable to diagnose my problem that took him 7 hours.\nJenaro fixed my issue in less than 40 minutes!!!\nDr. Cool AC and Jenaro, you rock!!!
