I definitely prefer this place to the big chains like IHOP. it's very straightforward here with the buttermilk pancakes, eggs, meat type of stuff for breakfast. If you're vegetarian, there's not a whole ton for you. I wouldn't mind seeing some more options that aren't littered in animal proteins, but hey, I'm just happy there's buckwheat. I will eat buckwheat all day. \n\nCoffee - weak, but hot and plentiful\nFood - gets the job done\nBuckwheat - YEAH BABY\nFruit - Meh\nToppings - They have lingonberries! Yum!\n\nThis is a good place to come if you are one of those people who can't figure out what you want. You can literally piecemeal your entire order. Do it. And come early on the weekend or expect a big wait.
