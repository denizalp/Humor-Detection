I have heard about Wahlburgers before but never in a place where they were until I found one in this airport terminal. Now, an airport terminal isn't, in my opinion, the best place to experience a restaurant, but sometime, you've got no other choice!\n\nIt was pretty busy, but not overwhelming. Don't you hate it when you're eating in a terminal restaurant and people keep bumping into you with their luggage? I was seated immediately off to the side of the bar and was greeted momentarily by my waitress.\n\nI wanted to get their Thanksgiving sandwich but they were out of stuffing which sucked. Ever get so excited for something and then get it ripped out from under you? That was me in that moment.\n\nI ended up with the our burger and tater tots. The burger was good. A standard American burger with the typical fixings. It was good, but didn't stand out as a wow! The bun was very fresh and I appreciated that for sure. The tots were great but you pay $4 for a side and get a handful. It comes in a cute cup. Keep the cup and give me more potatoes.\n\nI'd like to give them a shot again at a standalone station, and not at a terminal to see if there is a difference. Things were good, but maybe elsewhere they are great?
