Dr. Sharma had been my primary care doctor for 5 years. I searched for a doctor for a while before I found one I liked. Every issue I ever had he knew right away what it was and fixed it. Amazing doctor!\nHis front end staff needs help, though.\nI have worked for the same company Aria resort for 5 years and thus have had the same insurance for 5 years. MGM resorts insurance PPO. Nothing has changed.\nI walked in yesterday for my 1:45 appointment, at 1:30. The front office guy asks my info and says \"your insurance isn't active\". I was confused, \"you must have something wrong, my insurance should be fine. I get an email if anything changes.\"\nHe said \"no, it says here it's not active\". I said \"ok? Now what? Can I call them?\"\nHe answers \"yes if the can clear this up you are fine\"\nSo I call my insurance they tell me my insurance is active and fine, nothing has changed. So she puts me on hold while she calls him. She comes back on line with me after 3 or so minutes and says: \"he won't take any information from me over the phone, and he has your wrong member number. So that's why you look inactive.\"\nI log into my insurance website and pull up my insurance card. I go to show it to him so he can get the correct number. He looks at the card on my phone and says \"I can't accept that you need to email it to me\"\nJesus! CMON?!? I say \"ok! What's your email?\" He says \"wait let me see your phone again\". pulls it closer and says \"it says in the corner Sierra Health plan of Nevada\". I said \"yeah? So? It's always said that.\" He proceeds to reply \"well we don't take Sierra Health, sorry.\"\nNow I'm just flustered, he is acting like a girl who is coming up with 8 reasons not to date me, one after another.\nI said \"you have been taking this Insurance for 5 YEARS. It hasn't changed, i don't get it\".\nHe just said \"sorry sir\"\nI said \"what am I supposed to do now? Find a new doctor?. \nHe said \"yes sir, one that takes that insurance\"\nI said \"ok, well can I at least say good bye to Dr. Sharma, he had been a great doctor and I want to thank him for the last 5 years\"\nHe said \"sure, I'll let him know\"\nI waited for 15 minutes and he never came out. Guess I can't take a hint.\nBack to the grind of finding a a new doctor!
