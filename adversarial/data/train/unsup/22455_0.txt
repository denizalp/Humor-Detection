I came here this past Saturday for Tiesto and pre-sale tickets were $57 (including the processing fee).. If you didn't purchase your ticket in advance then they were charging $150 at the door.. The venue is relatively large and this is the place to see and be seen! Some of the most gorgeous women and handsome men will be found at this pool party, and everyone dresses to impress.. Their security staff are on top of everything and are great at making sure that it remains a safe environment for everyone (considering that you're mixing alcohol + high temperatures).. There were a few people that couldn't handle the madness and passed out but their medical staff quickly assisted them and escorted them out for medical attention.. They have a huge shaded bar by the pool and it is one of the larger ones I've seen at a pool.. They offer a full bar including the mixed frozen drinks that you'll find anywhere on the Strip.. A cup of the frozen stuff runs for $18 and sadly you don't get much bang for your buck.. I drank two of these drinks and did not even feel a mild buzz.. The security guards by the shaded VIP area are very friendly and if you're a good looking girl then they will allow you to sit inside the guarded area.. There are many day beds and cabanas surrounding the main pool and they had House\/Trance music going all day.. Tiesto did a great job spinning at this venue and it was a fun time!
