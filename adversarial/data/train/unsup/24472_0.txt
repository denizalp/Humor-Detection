Everything is authentic and fresh, no out of the can crap here. If you have been to the Olympic Flame restaurant down the street on Thomas, this is the same owner of the joint. Salads are always fresh, no premixed junk here and the baklava is melt in your mouth.\n\nThe tiramisu is the treat of the whole evening. Just shut up and get the hell over there for some awesome food, were not writing a book here. They bring the food right to your table and they honestly do care a lot for their customers. Amin usually knows all of the customers by name.
