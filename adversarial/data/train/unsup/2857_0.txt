Shaving a Leopard\n\n  Remember brasserie St. Jaques? Me neither, welcome to Epoxy.\n\n  The owners changed the sign on the front door and a few light bulbs and beer coasters but otherwise, this is the exact same dirt bag, Habs bar that you can hide from the world in.\n\n  Even the condom machine in the bathroom is the same. Be forewarned, if you use that machine, you deserve what is coming to you.\n\n  Pun intended.\n\n  Waka Waka
