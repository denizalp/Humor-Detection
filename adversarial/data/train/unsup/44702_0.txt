Like, like, like this spot. Friendly bar, good cozy patio. The wings are awesome. Not the norm with  a chicken, duck and turkey combo. The hot sauce is HOT, try a hit of hot with the honey garlic to tone it down. Oyster special is average and the wine on tap is a good house option. Also a good last call option on the way home.
