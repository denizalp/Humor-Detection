I was immediately impressed with Bumble Bee Plumbing in the manner in which they answered the phone.  Craig greeted me with \" It's a great day at BBP how may I help you?\"  That is music to the ears of anyone with professional customer service training.  \n\nI gave Craig the run down on my water heater issue and I was surprised that he would be able to send someone out the same day.  I really appreciated the appointment set up system with confirmation email, photo of plumber who would be out and the 15 min heads up phone call that the plumber is enroute.\n\nWhen Jesus arrived he gave me an estimate and all seemed fairly priced.  He commenced with the work and I went about my business.\n\nWhen Jesus was giving me the details of what he did to fix the supply line leak he: \n1.)  Told me he would have been done sooner but he had to put a second supply line in because he didn't like the weld he did the first time.  \n2.)  Next Jesus pointed out that there is a second leak further up in my supply line that neither of us noticed because the efflorescence\/mineral deposits on the pipe were the same color as the garage wall.  He said he would be out to fix that with no additional trip fee.\n3.)  My house was the last stop for Jesus that Tuesday.  He said he was at the shop at 6:45 that morning.  Jesus didn't leave my house until 6:30PM.  \n\nHow many contractors would have taken the time to redo a repair they just did when it is well past quitting time?  My guess is 1 out of 500 in this day and age.\n\nIt is so very rare to encounter any individual or company that has the integrity and honesty that Jesus demonstrated.  \nThank you Jesus and BBP for striving for excellence.
