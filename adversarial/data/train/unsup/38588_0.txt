Excellent dentist office! Dr. McAdams is phenomenal. I came to his office to get a second opinion and was immediately at ease with his plan for treatment. He was incredibly understanding of some medical conditions that make treatment trickier than normal, and even researched it before I came in for my first visit. I was incredibly nervous to have my first cavities filled, but there was really nothing to be concerned about. Dr. McAdams clearly explained what to expect as well as what was happening throughout the procedure. There was no pain after the initial prick of numbing medicine, and even that was hardly noticeable because of his vibrating tool that distracted from the pain. He and the hygienist kept me laughing during the work. I look forward to going back for a regular cleaning and can't recommend this office enough! Thank you!
