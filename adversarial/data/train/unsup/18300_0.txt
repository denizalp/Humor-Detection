CHRISTMAS REVIEW!!\n\nI came to Tiffanys to buy a Christmas gift for my Mom, and a little something for myself! ;)\n\nWhen the boyfriend and I walked in, we were greeted right away and asked what we were looking for. They directed us to the pendants, and a nice gentleman was standing behind the counter waiting to help us. I showed him pictures of the different pendants I was interested in, so that I could see them in person and base my decision off of that. He ran back and forth a couple times, to grab and show me the various pendants I was interested in. Sorry!! \n\nALL ABOUT THE TIFFANY BLUE\nI narrowed it down, and found the perfect one for myself and the perfect one for my Mom. Or so I hope! The gentleman took out brand new pendants, asked me what chain length I wanted for each necklace and then packed them in a cute Tiffany Blue drawstring bag. Then tucked that into that beautiful Tiffany Blue box, that everyone loves to see! Since it's the holidays, I had a choice of getting a traditional white ribbon or a holiday red ribbon. The red ribbon and the Tiffany Blue box went so well together! After he finished tying the ribbon into a beautiful bow (which I could have never tied myself), he placed it into two cute little Tiffany bags. One for me and one for my Mom, yay!! A huge thank you, for the best boyfriend in the world! :)\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe store was decently sized and is located in the Bellagio Hotel & Casino. The gentleman who assisted us was very friendly and helpful. At one point I couldn't make a decision as to which pendant to go with, so I started to ask him for his opinion! Haha. I would definitely recommend making your visit to the Tiffany & Co. store located in the Bellagio. I've been to the one located inside Caesars Palace, and the service wasn't as great.
