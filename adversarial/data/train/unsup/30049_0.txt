I like Tyber Creek.  I went early on a Thursday night and had a good time relaxing and catching up with a friend.  If there were half stars it would get a 3.5.  Here are the great things about it:\n\n- Ample parking\n- Cozy inside\n- All pints are $3 on Thurs.\n- Adequate beer selection\n- Chill\n\nI didn't try any of the food.  Service wasn't as attentive as I'd desire, but we got what we needed!
