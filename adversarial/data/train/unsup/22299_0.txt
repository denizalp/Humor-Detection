I went once when it was up in Scottsdale and I probably wouldn't have gone again (Old Tucson is a lot better), but there was a huge group going and I was invited to do the Sundown Cookout.  I'd never gone before, so I thought I'd give it a little try.\n\nFirst off, it's $45 and if you want first dibs on a table, you have to go early.  The first wagon rolls out at 6pm.  If you're going with a big group like I did, you'll want to reserve a table for the party.\n\nTo start the party off, you get a little short hayride pulled by horses or mules.  It was a beautiful ride watching the sun set, just a little shorter than I thought it would be.  Once there, everyone gets a straw cowboy hat and red bandana.  \n\nFor food, you get your choice of steak, ribs, or chicken.  You also get a baked potato, piece of bread, and cowboy beans.  There's free lemonade, iced tea, or coffee.  After the main meal, there's apple pie and marshmallows on big long skewers that you can roast at one of the firepits.\n\nThe steak was perfectly done - extremely tender and had a good flavor.  I had the ribs and they were fall off the bone good without being too mushy.  I didn't get to try the chicken.  Everyone seemed very happy with their food.\n\nThe apple pie was pretty good.  The roasting of marshmallows was a nice touch.\n\nI'm wavering between giving this place a 3.5 or 4 stars (I'm erring on the positive side) because it's quite expensive.  We also had to wait for a table and weren't the only ones waiting.  Beer was about $4 a bottle, soda was $2.50 a bottle.  \n\nThere was also live entertainment and a little poker section as well as a play area for kids where they would pretend to rope cattle.  The band was actually pretty good.\n\nAt one point one of the actors was shooting off his gun, and one girl that must have woken on the wrong side of the bed wrinkled her nose and said that he needed to stop that.  \n\nHellooo, we're supposed to be in the old west....ever see Tombstone?  Maybe if you didn't wear high heels in the desert you wouldn't be in such a bad mood.\n\nBut I digress.  In the end, we had fun and since I'd never been, it was a good experience.  I probably wouldn't do it again unless someone visiting from out of town really insisted and begged to see it.  \n\nBy the way, I know I mentioned Old Tucson...but the benefit of Rawhide is that admission is free.  You only pay for food, drink, and souveniers...and of course the Sundown Cookout.
