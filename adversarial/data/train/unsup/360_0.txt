How can you not be drawn in, just by the name alone!  Clever, fo sho!\n\nSo once you're drawn in, what are you drawn to?  In keeping with the seasonal theme, I ordered the Southern Tier Pumpking Ale.  Delish, as always. They have about 12 or so beers on tap that's clearly written up on a big chalkboard above the bar.  I'm into bars that have a wide variety on tap.  I can't stand when you go somewhere and all they have is Miller and Coors Light.  But for a name like the BeerHive, they really should have more to offer!\n\nThey also have a big refrigerator with a whole lotta specialty beers to pick from.  You can either pick up a beer and drink it there or take out for a \"night cap\" at home.  \n\nFor \"bar food\" the food is pretty decent!  Sticking with the hive part of beer they have a lot of honey type concoctions.  We opted to try a couple wing flavors, as they all looked pretty yummy.  We tried the salt n' vinegar, honey bbq, ranch and buffalo.  I really enjoyed the salt n' vinegar, being a huge vinegar fan!  I also thought the honey bbq was pretty good.  We also ordered I REALLY enjoyed the honey bites, mini cinnamon pretzels with honey drizzled on top.  YUM-O! \n\nThey have a lot of different specials, including $1 off beers and $3 apps.  The HH special for beers isn't too great, but I love a good deal on food too, so it balances out!  They also have a special armature comedy night.  I think that would be an interesting thing to see, laugh at them or laugh with them?  We'll see!
