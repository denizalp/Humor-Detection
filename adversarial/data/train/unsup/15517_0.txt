I went to the September TUM (their 1st birthday) I got stuffed on delicious food and had a lot of fun but I'm still conflicted over TUM - so I'm going right down the middle here.\n\nShit I liked:\n - great concept\n - innovative tasty food (holy hell, those buns from Hot Bunzz was damned good and sisig fries are damned genius)\n - reasonable prices - most of the items are $5 or less and the portions are reasonable (much more bang for your buck that the overpriced food trucks in Vancouver and Toronto)\n - freebies! (your mileage may vary - but through the sheer force of my charm, I got free sandwiches, free beer and a schwag bag full of freebies)\n - free shuttle bus from Broadview station\n\nShit I didn't like:\n - long line-ups... and not any line-ups... line-ups of... ugh... 'foodies'... the worst people on Earth - it seems not so 'underground' anymore and long lines are new.  My excuse: I'm new to the city.  But for fuck's sakes - don't talk about how you liked it before it became popular - unless you want to sound like a complete foodie hipster douche.\n - $17 cover (night TUM + ticket charge) - cover is understandable, but this is quite a bit of money and the event seems oversold.  Either raise the prices and keep out the riff raff out (shorter lines) or limit the number of tickets.\n - go early before the food runs out - not really a complaint, I suppose - at least they aren't madly pumping out trash
