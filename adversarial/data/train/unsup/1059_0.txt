Who would ever guess that Beaver Choice was a Scandinavian restaurant? And across the parking lot from Ted's Hot Dogs? The convoluted naming history apparently originated from the Mascot of a University they originally were sited near in Canada. But beavers and hot dogs and Massage in the same center?\n\nThe food is unusually wonderful and  . . . unusual. The family cooks and servers are over the top friendly offering samples and telling you about all of their offerings. \n\nThe atmosphere is uncomfortably stark, sterile, and small (less than 400 ft2). Their obvious target customer is take-it-out since they offer a 10% discount if you take-it-out. It is not a restaurant you go to to relax, sit back, and enjoy. It is so small we watched as the cook dipped his ladle into the pot, then tasted the contents, tapped the ladle on the side of the pot, added something else, tasted, tapped, and added several more times before going to another pot and repeating the process - yikes! Do yourself a favor, take the seat facing the window.
