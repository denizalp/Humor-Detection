I have been to CB about 50 times throughout my life. I was never a real big fan of subs because I do not see the value. \n\nWell at CB you get the value. They are a no frills sub shop. The 5 inch sub is not enough for most people but will do good for smaller kids. \n\nI took the kids here to grab a quick bit before a holiday concert. I had the french dip, it is about 2 oz of meat and a slice of cheese on toasted roll. The meat was cheap the cheese was sparse and the bun was great. They serve this with a little au jus. \n\n\nKid a: had a club and she picked the bacon and the meat off and ate the bread. \nKid b: had a Italian and used some of my au jus.... \n\nThey both asked to get something to eat after the concert as they were still hungry. \n\nThe walls are filled with tons of interesting things to read or view, the service is as expected. Young girls chatting it up and laughing at nothing, talking about boyfriends etc. (They did put out a mini fire in the toaster... that was amusing.)
