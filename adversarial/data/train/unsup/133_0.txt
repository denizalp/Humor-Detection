Gah, the night club is alright.  got in for free due to our hookups with promoters at TAO.\n\ncame here on a friday night, there were some non-EDMish hip-hop-like beats with no words on the outside\n\nwhen the DJ comes they close the outside and every crowds on the inside where its just blasting bass and everyone is standing there fist pumping.  prepare to have your eardrums blown out\n\nthere are tons of asian uncles and sweaty curly haired guys here, prepare to get creeped on and have drinks spilled all over your feet\n\nwear platforms because all the confetti piles up and gets mixed with alcohol and grime and stick to your feet if you are wearing some open toed shoes\n\ndefinitely liked Tao better
