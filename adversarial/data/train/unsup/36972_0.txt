Authentic and at it's beat, this Mexican joint hits the spot if you're not super hungry, but can eat. The beef quesadilla with a Jarritos is $14 with tip. The beef is succulent and it's 10 inches, super-packed. The three beef tacos are also jammed with flavour; very filling and doesn't make you hate yourself. $11 with a can of Coke. Sinuses are clear plus you're warm and full. We'll definetely be coming back!
