High quality food, aesthetically pleasing restaurant with a great staff!  It could be pricey to some, but as long as you are willing to pay about 25 dollars a plate then you should definitely go!  We each shared our dishes and they were all fantastic.  I don't think you can go wrong at this place.  The downside is that I was too full to try the \"brookie\" (cookie meets brownie).  I will be back for sure!
