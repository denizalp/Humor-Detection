We made a 5 pm reservation to miss the crowds before a show. Hostess was cheerful and seated us promptly. They had all the guests lumped together in a section where we were packed into a cluster of tables like we were eating at a hot dog eatery in a Tokyo subway. To my left was Captain Bitchy Bitch, a wormy white collar jackass that ripped on the food and the fact that the water was flat, and called out the poor busboy for not giving him all his sparkling water. To my right was mommy neurotic, who announced grandly at the beginning of dinner that \"this is a 'no phone night!'\" then proceeded to interrupt hubby's ramen orgy with tales from the nanny.\n\nIt was not an enjoyable dining experience. I could smell the tic tacs that Mommy neurotic was chomping nervously when she sat down. Love those strawberry ones - don't tell me they are \"for the kids\", mommy. \n\nAs for the food? Ok. Not worth the price, timing of our order was laughable (and our neighbors were not pleased either with how the kitchen's timing played out for their meal(s)). Cocktails were good...but I left feeling somewhat ripped off (not a good value) and exhausted after our triple-date-by-proximity.\n\nGo to grand luxe instead. If you are looking for funky fusion, go to the spa and get a Brazilian wax and drink French wine.
