I've been to Melt quite a few times within the past few years (this location in particular). Everytime I come here, the food is outstanding. I highly recommend The Dude Abides, or the Smokehouse Club. The sandwich in the picture is the latter. The food always comes out tasty with PLENTY of cheese. The sandwiches are always massive and frankly, its hard to pick just one everytime. The waitress we had tonight was very personable, and said that she wished she could eat with us! I wish i caught her name but alas, I did not. Side note, the menus all have a back to them that is some famous soundtrack. I happen to get Beauty and the Beast, which my wife loved. My only real complaint would have to be how long the food took to came out. There were only three of us in my party, and the restaurant itself was modestly full. It took about 20-25 minutes to come out. But in the long run, it was totally worth it. Definitely going back!
