So, it has been years since I have been here, but my Mom, who recently moved to Charlotte, remembered our visit. She wanted to check it out, being a nice night and the patio is a nice treat. We arrived at 6:30 and got the last open table outside. After 10 minutes we were brought menus and water, one short. From there it took us over 20 minutes to place our order, which included having to ask the drink specials, and what was on tap, & the waitress said \"it's on the back of the menu\". After reviewing we ordered and waited another 45 minutes for our meal, which came out incorrect. It was corrected immediately, however, the server was very rude and short with everything! I also need to note, sitting outside offers smoking, so be warned. We, unfortunately sat @ two tables that included chain smokers...somewhat annoying while you are trying to enjoy a drink and dinner. \nAs far as the food, I ordered the zucchini cake, which was undercooked, however, the others ordered the fish & chips, amazing. I will make sure I enjoy that dish if I return. Overall the food was good, but the service was so disappointing.
