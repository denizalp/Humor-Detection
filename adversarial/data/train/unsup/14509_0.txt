I'm Torn on this one.  3.75 Stars OK?\n\nI've been here...3 times now?  I think its finally adequate to give them a review. \nThey were probably \"THE\" buffet back in 2009 or 2010.  Since, then I believe they've regressed a bit.  There's like a million reviews on here so I'll just compare this and bacchanal, cause someone's going to find this useful!\n\nround 1 : Carvery \nBacchanal: Terrific Leg of Lamb.  OK sausage.  OK Ham.  Tasty (a bit salty) briskey.  Salty pork rib (No BBQ sause) .Missing Prime Rib?\nWynn: Best beef rib.  Juicy prime rib (I waited for a good piece), didn't touch anything else.\nwinner: wynn\n\nround 2: seafood\nBacchanal: Amazing selection.  Fresher oysters.  Creative mini dishes.  Spectacular soups.  good support of sauces\nWynn:  lacking in options.  Very good cold king crab legs.  small oysters.  \nwinner: bacchanal\n\nround 3: sushi (i know its seafood...)\nbacchanal: why bother?  5 different rolls and sushi combo?\nwynn:  not much better, but they did have a very delicious seaweed salad.\nwinner: wynn\n\nround 4: World assortment (so i clumped it up..)\nbacchanal: pho\/udon station, cheese and ham station.  Italian station that served steamed crab (bonus point for seafood).  Wagyu beef sliders ( overrated..).  Good looking chinese food station.  Nice assortment of fruits and salad. \nwynn: nice dim sum platter, specialized salad dishes, a lot of italian inspired foods, points for ramen station. \nwinner: bacchanal.\n\nround 5: dessert\nBacchanal: gelato, cookies, creme brule, crepe, cakes, creme buffs, candied snacks\nwynn: same\nwinner: tie.  This should have been the wynn's but I think they pulled back some items that used to be there... disappointing.\n\nAh crap, I thought I got a winner out of this.  It's 2-2-1.  Well, if i had to spend my next $50 bucks on something... I'll say bacchanal...just because The WYNN told someone in my party over the phone that Dinner was a cheaper price then what we actually paid for.  That totally did not go well over with us.  ARE YOU LISTENING WYNN?!
