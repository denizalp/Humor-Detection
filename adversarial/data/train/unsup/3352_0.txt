I have no idea why there is so many good reviews for this place. First off, its location is in such a bad part of town, i told my wife, this is where i would carry a handgun, preferable a .45. Meaning the parking lot and area is very dark and not welcoming. (cant expect too much from vegas, rite?) but still...I felt like i was gonna sell my kidney in the black market.\nOnce we came in, the waitress was just rude. We spoke to her in Korean, so there was no language barrier there, but she acted like, \"why the heck are you guys here at 7pm\" kind of attitude. \nWe ordered tofu pot and a spicy squid dish. The rice they provided in a small bowl was so old that the edge of the rice was hard and difficult to chew. Come on...if your an asian restaurant at least you can make the rice, rite!? Kimchee... nope! not good. to be honest... all the ban chan was terrible! so besides the service being bad, the food tasting bad, here is the kicker!!! Jin Mee does not stop giving after you finish your meal! Just wait about 4 hours and you have yourself a natural laxative. I mean, talk about the runs!!! My butt felt like it ran a freaking marathon!!! the thing is... both me and my dad both had it!!! so yea.... I will recommend this place if you want to experience a dark alley, dirty attitude, terrible rice, and poop that screams as it exits your anus, then i recommend this place w\/ 5 stars!!!
