Build your own stir-fry, but not really. The manager for a little snotty when we wanted small bowls instead of large (called them kiddie bowls) and they actually do not let you put the food in yourself. The sweet chili sauce isn't great, but hunny had the teriyaki & it tasted good. Our waitress was kind of snotty too, especially when we asked for a dessert recommendation. The stir fry cook was nice, but as he got busier he forgot who ordered what & someone else initially ended up with our food. \nGood for the Groupon; but we probably won't be back.
