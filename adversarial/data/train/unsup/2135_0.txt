I so want to like this place but it disappoints every time. The food is poor quality. I've been here several times and continue to be unimpressed. The kids like it - that's why I keep coming back - but I'd rather punch myself in the face than come back here again. Small portions. Crappy quality to the food. Service is terrible and slow. Always feel like we are bothering them. Our waiter actually complained that he wasn't supposed to be working today and was upset that he was. Awesome!  There are lots of decent options in aurora and Newmarket. You don't need this one.
