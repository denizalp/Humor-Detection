Ordered the TMC breakfast sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. At first I was a little turned off with the egg being a sliced hard boiled egg but it was amazing. The mayo was homemade. The staff working that day was very friendly and funny. When the cook brought our food over he stayed and talked to us for a while. Great coffee! Will come back if I'm ever in Montreal again.
