Located next to Food City in the corner of a strip mall.. I would have missed it had it not been for Yelp.\n\nSmall dining area, I was told to sit anywhere I like.. I had the spring rolls, pretty to look at, fresh and flavorful.. I added chili sauce to the peanut dipping sauce for a bit of heat.. fresh and delicious \n\nI had the beef pho .. rich broth, thin shaved beef, delicious.. this is a big bowl so bring your appetite \n\nService is fast and friendly.. plenty of parking. I'll be back
