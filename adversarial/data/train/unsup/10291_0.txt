Worst experience.  I  took my S4 to have the screen replaced.  When I got my phone back the first time  there was an air bobble and food crumbs trapped between the glass and screen. The second time the bobble was still there but the food was gone. The third time they told me that the bobble was normal and if I wanted it gone I would have to pay an additional $30 on top of the $100 I already paid. Then when I got my phone back my screen would not work or it would start texting on its own. The forth time I got it back the screen would not work at all and there was damage all around the side. Plus the glass is not attached and you can lift it right off. They tried to hide this by putting my case back on before giving it back. When they saw me removing it they tried stopping me by saying they already tested the screen. I asked for my money back and they would not give me all of it they said they still had to change me for labor. I told them labor would not have been that much if they just did the job correctly the first time. \n\nDo not bring your device to this place. They messed up mine so bad I had to buy a whole new phone. Plus their compensation charges half the rate and does it correctly.\n\n***I had posted a photo of how they returned my phone to me. You can open the side of the glass to see the guts under. This company askes yelp to remove it says it was of sexual content.  So I say again do not use this company to fix your items. There are many others out there that will do the job right and for cheaper. ***
