Paul and his crew from Stellar Home Services just left after replacing my water heater.  I could not be more pleased with their service.  He called when he was about 20 minute away, and got here right when he said he would.  He came with two other technicians.  The old water heater was out and the new one was being filled almost before I knew what was happening.  They were very efficient and all 3 worked very well together.  They were done in under 45 minutes.  The area was cleaner than it was before they got here.  Great job, Paul and team!!
