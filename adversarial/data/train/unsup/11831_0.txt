DEPLORABLE customer service! I have been here four times for take-outs, and I literally ripped their take-out menu b\/c I won't be returning again. I will rather eat less tasty foods than coming back here again. I ordered the lunch special today, and when I showed up, the Chinese gentleman didn't greet me nor even smiled at me. He literally threw the pen at me for me to sign the CC receipt!!! Really?!! Completely RUDE and uncalled for!! \n\nThe other three times, a different guy helped me with the takeout orders, and horrible customer service as well. The guy didn't lift his head up from writing on a piece of paper when I walked in. He was nonchalant and couldn't care less about the customers!!!
