Girls, this is the place you have been looking for! If you don't want the predictable sparkle, ruffle, bows and corsets that seem to be prescribed to be a bride...this is your place. However, the service is what will make you feel like a princess! I just started my gown search and Something White was my first stop. No other shop seems to hold a candle to the personalized time spent with the owner to find just the right dress for my big day. This time in a bride's life should not be shared with 5 other brides all being paraded past large mirrors and feeling like a \"number,\" as in the larger stores. You all know the kind of store I'm referring to.\nThe dresses are designed flawlessly by some of the most talented in the business and the shop will help you collaborate with the designers for any tweaks or changes to suit your needs and your ultimate vision.\nI haven't purchased my dress yet, but it will be hard to find a better option than the gals at Something White are able to provide. \nI didn't even mention what a cute shop it is! The shop has an amazing nostalgic flair to go along with the classic style of a well designed gown. Worth a visit for sure!
