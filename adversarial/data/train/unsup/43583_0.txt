They deserve their 5 stars. I called Thursday late afternoon, they sent someone out early Friday morning, and he fixed my inoperative a\/c unit quickly and professionally.  Another company had told me the compressor would have to be replaced which is a major expense, and he fixed it for a small fraction of that.  I have cool air now and will definitely call this company in the future!
