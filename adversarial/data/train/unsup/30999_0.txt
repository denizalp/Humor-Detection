Ok, prior to having a kid, I would have definitely been in the one or two-star camp. This mall reminds me of the suburban malls near where I went to high school- somewhat tired and department store heavy, with few big-name brands. BUT- now that I have a little one to cart around and entertain, PV Mall is our go-to place for hanging out (not shopping). 1) Play areas- there is a free play area that opens up BEFORE the mall even opens! You can find lots of bleary eyes parents sitting around with their to-go coffees, while kiddos run around screaming. I personally prefer the $10 play area on the other side of the mall. The $10 fee gets you admittance for the whole day and there is free coffee for parents. 2) the Changing Room- The changing room it's self is so amazing, it deserves to be capitalized. There is a gigantic changing lounge and a nursing station. Seriously. 3) the merry go round, 4) the train, 5) those weird animals looking things that kids can drive around. So, all in all, three years ago, I would have been in the \"never PV mall camp\"- but seriously, it is a dream for parents with kids under five (especially when it's 100 degrees out).
