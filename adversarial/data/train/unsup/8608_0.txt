3.5 stars! Stopped in for 'za and a beer. Divided in two rooms, the bar area and the dining room, I liked the bar area for less kiddos\/families. There's also a couple arcade games in between rooms. They've got a nice rotation of Wisconsin craft beers, and keep the board above the bar current! My server was excellent, and let me try a beer I wasn't familiar with. It didn't turn out to my liking, so I went with the excellent Karben4 Fantasy Factory IPA. \n\nI ordered the Animal Lovers vegetarian pizza on thin crust, and it was great. Lots of fresh veggies, and very tasty. It was delivered quickly to my table, which was really appreciated! My server was excellent, but it seemed like there were way too many servers standing around, and a few just didn't seem that motivated to be at work (so I can see how some other reviewers' calls of bad service might have credence). My server checked in frequently, and I was in and out of there in a flash, which was nice!
