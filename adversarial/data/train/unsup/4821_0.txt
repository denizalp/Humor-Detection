Ok,\n\n I have friends that have raved about this joint for years.  So, it was time to put it to the test.  For starters, there was a Pens game starting up, so the place was packed. We stood for about 15 minutes, then got seated. Not too shabby.  The place is small and cramped but not too bad.\n\nA friend recommended I order the Steak & Cheese w\/ an egg, so I did.  My wife ordered the fish, and my daughter got the ham and cheese.\n\nThe server brought out a side of fries, which were lacking salt... Okay, no biggy, throw some ketchup in the mix and you're good to go.\n\nand for the sammys...\n\nNow, I get the whole, \"I'm from Pittsburgh, I grew up on this stuff and it's best thing since indoor plumbing.\"  But seriously folks... THIS is what everyone raves about?  I mean, let's break the sandwich down.\n\nTwo slices of bread and in between, coleslaw, french fries, steak and cheese, and a fried egg.  Grant it, the combination is exquisite, however.  THERE IS NO SEASONING ON ANYTHING.  The strongest flavor in every bite was cabbage.  I wish I was kidding, but it was so bland that I had to drown it in hot sauce to at least get some kind of flavor to it.\n\nMy wife's fish sammy was just the same. We probably could have swapped and couldn't have told the difference.\n\nWe were both thoroughly disappointed and couldn't even finish it.  Actually, my daughter's ham and cheese was the most flavorful of the 3 items ordered. \n\nIn all, it was something that had to be tried. But to say this is a great sandwich, is a lie I can't pass along.
