Pretty amazing how a place can change so much when it becomes a new bar in the same building. Really a far cry from the previous establishment, even though it's the same place, and a far cry from the original Ray's in Kent. \n\nThe beer selection is OK, the food is OK, and the atmosphere is OK, but nothing really stands out. The entire place seems generic. The night we were there, it seemed like the few customers at the bar either worked there and just got off, or were friends with the bartenders. The extremely small crowd was odd to say the least. Seemingly newly 21-year-olds that thought it was ironic to play horrible music on the jukebox (Kid Rock, Kenny G, Nickelback, Lou Bega) while dancing like they were in A Night at the Roxbury were the standard for the night, and really killed the mood. It felt like I was joining them on their first legal night in a bar. \n\nNext time I'll drive further down the road to the original establishment, where apparently all of the original clientele have gone. I don't see this Ray's lasting very long.
