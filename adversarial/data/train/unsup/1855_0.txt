This place catered for a work conference. Buffet style lunch. One day Italian and the other day Mexican. I thought it was pretty good. Much better than to be expected. the reviews on this place aren't great and I couldn't speak about the regular meal service. However, everything I had in the buffet lunch was really good, cooked wall and lots of flavor. The Mexican lunch was a little on the salty side but hey what isn't salty in Las Vegas? \n\nService was good, just busing but the were prompt about everything.
