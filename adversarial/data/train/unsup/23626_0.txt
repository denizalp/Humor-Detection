Typical pizza takeout spot with saucy pies, various apps, salads, and lunch specials. The pizza is their forte, but I can't say I'm the hugest fan- as others have mentioned, the sauce is a bit too sweet for my liking and it was a touch greasier than I would have liked. However, the slices are huge and reasonably priced and a $4-5  slice is filling enough to be your entire lunch! The pepperoni is solid but the veggie slice is my go-to.\n\nThe salads are huge and fresh, and the gyro version in particular comes topped with tons of tasty protein. They also offer their gyros with fries as a cheap lunch special on Wednesdays, though I didn't particularly care for their tzatziki as it was mostly plain sour cream. Each day has it's own discounted special, though. \n\nService is pretty stellar- the guys working take my order, make it fresh, and have it ready in under 10 minutes even when I don't remember to call ahead. Dining in here IS an option, unlike other takeout-exclusive spots.\n\nDon't forget to check in for 10% off your walk-in order!
