I'm VERY Pro-diner\/greasy spoon and dive bar....that is what makes this hard to do:\n\nI pass this place almost every day at some point. The awning gives the place great curb appeal and I finally took it upon myself to go there with two little ones in tow....\n\nFirst off, as soon as I walked in, it smelled like musty death. Like water damage and abandonment. The carpet was my first suspect for the source because it just looked guilty.....you'd have to see it to believe it.....\n\nI wasn't about to let that stop me though.\n\nVeggie platter: Obviously not as described in the menu. Nothing fresh about it....obviously bought-in, dainty and sad breaded creations. Lowest bidder anyone?\n\nHouse Salad:  Oh my. CANNED MUSHROOMS on a salad?! Moldy pepper chunks. Bad bad produce.\n\nCheeseburger (off kids menu): Missing cheese, seeded bun the size of my head (very kid-friendly), and the patty was dryer than my humor)\n\nFries: Adequate\n\nChicken tenders (Kids menu) : Actually not all that bad. \n\nService: Meh\n\nI just felt dirty and felt like management could care less about the health or happiness of their customers. \n\nBOTTOMLINE: If you need a good laugh or are drunk and looking for adventure....here ya go! If you are there to eat and aren't drunk.....don't.
