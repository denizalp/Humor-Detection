Cool little spot in an alley, walkable from the Westin.  I ordered online through Yelp but their computer was down.  Expected to wait a long time, but was very pleasantly surprised how quickly it was ready.  They grab a lump of dough, put it through a press machine on the wall a couple times, then top it to order, put it on a timed conveyor belt oven, and it comes out perfectly cooked in a couple minutes.  Then they add flavored oils, and other fresh toppings as desired and then box it up for you. Boom. Fresh, delicious, fast, and cheap.  $10 for a pizza that easily feeds two.  Would definitely order again.
