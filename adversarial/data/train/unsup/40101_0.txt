Huge fan!  I have been here multiple times.  It is a tad on the pricey side, but much better in quality than Kabuki.   They have a pretty solid Happy Hour menu on their roles.   I am a huge fan of their Vegas Roll, yet to find another place make it anywhere near as well.\n\nThey have 2 different outdoor patio's available as well.  My favorite sushi place for sure.
