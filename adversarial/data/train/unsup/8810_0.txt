The problem with this place is that it smells MUCH better than it actually tastes.  It's like those damn hot dog carts that suck you in with the delicious fried onions and then halfway through the hot dog your over it.\n\nAnd I must say taht this place has NEVER failed at smell.  My mouth seriously starts to water everytime I walk past this place- it's so dangerous to decide to go to the theatre or Aroma (the two commercial spots that neighbour this place).\n\nBut I find the food very average.  It ain't bad, but I have definitely tasted better.\nI maybe would have even rated this place higher if the place DIDN'T smell so good from the outside just cuz the amazing smell just ends up in a let down post-shawarma
