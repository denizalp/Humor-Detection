Eggslut lives up to the hype! I always make a point to stop by whenever I'm in Las Vegas and it is worth it every time!\n\nI've tried their bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and fairfax sandwich. I was not impressed with the bacon, egg and cheese, but the fairfax (with added bacon) was absolutely AMAZING. It is hands down, my #1 recommendation! Their cage-free eggs were scrambled to perfection - incredibly soft and super fluffy. Their sriracha mayo complemented the sandwich very well and added a great depth of flavor. I also loved their warm brioche bun! \n\nThe long lines are there for a reason. If you're ever in town, Eggslut is a must - it's SO good!
