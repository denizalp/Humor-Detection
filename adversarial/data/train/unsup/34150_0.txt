First off- arrived early before 8am and was surprised that the doors were unlocked so they were already open...great! cuz it's hot outside. Second impression-lobby is beautiful, clean & updated with a refreshing feel: nice furniture & flooring, large flat screen tv playing a cute and interesting movie about the life of a bear and her cubs.  Receptionist greeted me immediately with an offering of water or an array of Tazo Teas. As each employee arrived including Dr. Cherrington they all greeted me kindly.  Dr. acknowledged me with a handshake in the reception area.  Magazines to read while I waited 10 minutes for my name to be called.  Soft fresh baked choc. chip cookies in the entrance of the exam rooms.  Didn't have to wait (not even one minute!) for any of the 3 women separately  to proceed with my visit\/exam. Didn't have to wait for Dr. to assist me either.  I would recommend Cherrington Dental as it was the best dental experience I have ever had in my 49 years of life. They go far and beyond that you need to experience for yourself.  $49 Coupon for a cleaning on Groupon is well worth it.
