This is the first time I visited Beer Bistro and I will definitely be coming back!  They have  an option where you can pay $6 and sample 3 different specialty beers.  It's a great opportunity to try it before you commit to a full pint.\n\nThere is a great variety of beers and the prices aren't too bad for downtown Toronto.  We had a great, entertaining waiter who was very knowledgeable about the types of beers on offer.  We didn't order any food but I will next time I'm there as I've heard it's tasty.
