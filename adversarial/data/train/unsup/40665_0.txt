I must admit. I was extremely excited when this Albertsons opened. The store itself is great. I even brag to friends how my Albertsons is better than theirs. Only problem. Staff friendliness & incorrect charging. With the exception of one person, I have found all staff members rude i.e. rolling eyes when I ask to pass through the aisle they are blocking, to the manager who just responded \"can't you just wait?\" Before walking away when asked if they could just be asked a question. Now I hope y'all are checking your receipts because incorrect sale prices are being charged. So much to the point that the customer service representative was complaining about how many refunds she had to do because the system isn't working properly. I was going to wait in line to have my sale prices corrected, but after  10 minute wait on top of my observations... the difference didn't seem worth the trouble to hear both customer service representative & manager complain about another incorrect charge!!
