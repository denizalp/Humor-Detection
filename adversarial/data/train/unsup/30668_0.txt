I first came to this renovated Duckworth's for a Yelp event. After the event, I knew I had to come back for a Wednesday $10 beer and burger special!\n\nMy husband and I stopped in last Wednesday and sat outside, as we had our pup with us. Side note: They brought out a huge bowl of water for him, which was so sweet. I settled on a glass of wine and my husband got a beer.\n\nFor food, I got a build your own salad with lots of fun toppings. I will say this salad was huuuuuuge! My husband got the Impossible Burger (veggie burg) with tots. The tots were super tasty. The burger was so fun as it definitely tasted like meat to me! \n\nService was great and food was tasty. Overall a win.
