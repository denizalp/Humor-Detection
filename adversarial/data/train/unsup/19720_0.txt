I really want to give this place more stars only because the staff and service was excellent, but there are just way too many cons that 3 stars is being generous.\nCame here on a friend referral who is a local of Vegas. Remind me to call my friend later. Appears most of the locals come here for the oxtail ramen. Sounds delicious and hearty right? Negative. Oxtail was tough. You had to pierce your fork into the meat and kind of fight with it just to eat instead of it nicely peeling off the bone as it should be. Also tried out some of their HH appetizers, none really worth mentioning. The Hamachi tail was actually cooked well. Location is off the strip, inside South Point Casino. Another negative. Not well ventilated, my eyes were burning from the smoke, my poor lungs were working doubletime. Overall, I don't see myself coming back here.
