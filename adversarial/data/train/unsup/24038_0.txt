cabo fish taco was good.  i ordered the cabo fish taco, but wish i had been a little more adventurous.  the salsa that they bring out was very watery and hard to get on the chips.  as other people have commented, there was corn all over our table.\n\nthe CFT was good but needed more spice.  adding hot sauce helped quite a bit.  the prices at cabo fish taco were extremely reasonable and the atmosphere was fun.  the local art hanging on the walls was interesting to check out - as CFT is located in NODA.
