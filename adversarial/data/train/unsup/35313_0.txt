I was surprised to see that Hob Nobs was not getting good reviews by my fellow yelpers.  My wife and I visited them on a brisk Saturday morning and had a great time.  We were really happy to see how beautiful the remodel came out.  We had visited a while back when it was the Willow House and the remodel was seriously needed.  The wooden floors are beautiful and everything was comfortable and very clean. The coffee was decent and the food selection is limited but awesome for a small coffee shop. Don't try the verve energy drink though...you could choke a horse with that small can of canine venom.  Prices were good 6-7 bucks for a sandwich and 2-4 for a tasty beverage of your choice.
