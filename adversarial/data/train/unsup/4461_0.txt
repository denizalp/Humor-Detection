If you live in my house then you know that I *may* have a bit of a shopping habit. Maybe. Therefore, it's not surprise that not only do I enjoy to shop, but I also \"acquire\" quite the collection of handbags, jeans, etc. In comes J.T. Posh to alleviate some of my upscale goods and also provide an option for....um...reinvestment?! \n\nThis sweet little consignment shop is one of the best in Charlotte - it's very, very clean, well organized and full of other ladies' goods. They also occasionally bring it brand new items from boutiques that are letting go of extra inventory. You'll find countless pairs of designer jeans in great shape, jewelry, handbags, tops, dresses, sweaters and shoes. Prices are just right, especially considering the merchandise is typically in great condition. A few treasures I've found here: a lovely Rebecca Taylor sleeveless top, an already tailored pair of Joe's jeans and a flowy silk BCBG top that was practically brand new. You can check out their website \n\nOn the sales side, you can bring in your well kept designer duds to sell to others. I've sold a few pairs of jeans and a couple of bags here....I'm sure husband would be delighted if I brought in more! Ah wishful thinking. They keep and sell your goods for 60 days and you'll receive 40% of the sales price. And that's where the reinvestment comes in...\n\nWhile I won't find a treasure in my size every time I come in, it's a great stop to peruse the racks and check for some fab deals.
