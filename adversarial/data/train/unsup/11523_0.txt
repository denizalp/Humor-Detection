After completing a major work project this week, I was in the mood for some steak and decided to give this place a try. \nLocated at the corner of E Bethany Home Road & N 16th St.\nThe first noticeable issue with the location is the lack of parking (-1).  The parking lot is extremely small and shared with other popular businesses.  Thankfully I got there a bit late and someone was pulling out. Even maneuvering within the parking lot is extremely difficult.  The signage for the restaurant could do with a sprucing up but was still somewhat noticeable from across the street. \nStaff were friendly but weren't overly friendly (-0.5).  They were attentive to our needs, like checking up on our meals, and even taking our orders in a timely fashion. \nThe place is small inside but it has age and character.  Lots of memorabilia on the walls and ceilings.  Some booths aren't completely cordoned off so you can see fellow patrons beneath the partitions. \nDrinks were served timely but food took some time to come. \nMenus were simple, short, and not too in depth. \nFood tasted good - their ribeye was cooked to perfection and was soft, juicy, tender, and not overly seasoned; and the dish comes with fries or mashed potatoes with gravy, bread, a biscuit, coleslaw or salad.  The coleslaw was served on its own and fresh and too runny.  The bread and biscuit was warm.  The mashed potatoes were perfect - not dripping off your fork kinda mashed but semisolid enough, and the gravy complemented it really well. \nI'd love to come back and try their country fried steak which, I heard is good, but I'm reluctant to based on the abysmal parking situation.
