I HATE THIS THEATER! There, got that out of the way.\n\nI didn't even realize Cineplex Odeon still had the old movie-style seats were the floor is gently raised instead of the new, row by row seating style. My bf and I were so close to the group behind us that I could hear one chick's smacking chops on a popcorn kernel as well as her asking some dude if he thought she vs. another chick was more sexy (groan).\n\nAnd just our luck..out of allllll the rows available, the big, obnoxious group chose to sit rightttt behind us. However, it could be because the room itself is very small so everyone wants to sit closest to the back rows because if not, you will get a huge crick in your neck. Seats are cramped and tiny. Personal space is kaputz.\n\nThe only reason why we came here was because we were waiting for our glasses to be ready, and wanted to kill time. We came here in the afternoon which in the theaters I go to are usually quiet, but because the room is so small, a couple of people sitting down already makes the place feel packed!\n\nI am glad that we didn't have to pay a dime for this experience (we used coupons that were gifted to us).
