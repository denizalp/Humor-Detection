Our tickets to this show were free, dependent on us buying drinks.  The drink of choice was a pina colada and that was one hell of a good pina colada. \n\nThe seats in the theater were so tight and crammed that it would make airline seats look like a couch.  I understand the need to make money, but why not just have more shows with more comfortable seating instead of less shows and crammed seating?\n\nThe show itself was pretty cool.  Mac King is a great magician and has a good sense of humor which moves the show along pretty well.  I have nothing really to compare it to so for what it is I would say I was satisfied with the show overall.\n\nPersonally to me, it seemed more like a family event and maybe not so much for adults but nonetheless it was still enjoyable because kids laugh at everything and lighten the mood up a bit.
