If you read my review in 2012 I gave Paris's tattoo 5 stars. After that I sent sooo many ppl to Paris. Marcus Lund was the guest artist for Paris at that time who did my tattoo. I admire Marcus Lund's work and I was hoping for him to come back to do a cover up on my old tattoo on my lower back! After a year and a half of waiting. I doubt he will. Then seeing all the turmoil on Paris's Facebook page about the problem with Paris and Marcus, I know for sure now it's time to go to Paris and see if he can do a cover up instead. \nI visited Paris around my birthday last year.. He remember me right away. Saying oh you're the one that's in love with Marcus. I'm like no. I'm in love with his work.. But I need to find someone new since Paris had a falling out with Marcus. How do I know that? Paris vent and went on and on about it on Facebook. \nHe look at my tramp stamp. Told me 3 things! 1) he doesn't do cover up! 2) he doesn't do small tattoo 3) I need to get it laser off before work can be done. Maybe 3 sessions. \nThen he sent me off to someone I know nothing about. I really feel like because I like Marcus's work and due to the fuel Paris has with him, I wasn't welcome. \nSo this is why the 1 star comes in. The customer service isn't how it was when I came in the first time. The way he vent about the problem re: Marcus on Facebook was unprofessional, after all it is a business page. And how he treated me because I admired Marcus's work and regardless of how I feel about him.. I don't feel like I should be caught in the middle.. I really feel like I was unwelcome there. And maybe his preference is only doing big tattoos but you never know. My tattoo might be small, and can be big later.. So I left. Anybody who ask me about my arm tattoo. I don't have anything good to say about Paris due to my last experience. Went on to find another artist. And she did a big tattoo on my back and cover up my old one w\/o any laser sessions needed!
