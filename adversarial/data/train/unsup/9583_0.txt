Went for Milos last night based on the better Yelp reviews compared to other places we considered. Our whole party was EXTREMELY disappointed. It was truly the worst food I've had all year long. \n\nFirst off, there's almost nothing really Greek being served -- most of them are fatty, fried American dishes. Second, service was incredibly slow and it wasn't even that busy. Our server was very impersonal, had that \"unavailable\" vibe, and impatient. We ordered their \"famous\" black bass, Milos appetizer samplers, tuna tartare, filet mignon, marinated peppers, and a bunch of other things, all of which were incredibly underwhelming and just... bad. \n\nDinner was SO bad that we were SO done before dessert. We decided to go back to our suite to order room service desserts -- which were pretty good. However, the terrible dinner food didn't mix well at all with all of us. I went to sleep right away with this icky, nauseous feeling. Never again!!!\n\nThis was the second time Yelp failed me!! What a MISS....
