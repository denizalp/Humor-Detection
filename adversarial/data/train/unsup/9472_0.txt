At the time of this review, there were 507 preceding mine. \nWhy bother? I asked myself.\nIf a Yelper can't conclude what this place is about in the first ten or so reviews, (4 stars or higher) how's mine going to make a difference?\nThen it hit me.\nI could review the table setting..\nSo here you go, my review of Nobu Las Vegas, and my table experience.\n\nOur table was nice and had all the features one would expect of a nice table such as legs and a top.\nIt didn't wobble either, nice and firm, some may even say heavy. \nAnd it was slightly rectangular, with a nice wood surface. Very pleasant looking.\n\nAdorning our table were some chopsticks, and a couple of plates. The plates were nice. Small but nice, and as plates go, they seemed a better quality of porcelain than most. They were also square. This caught my eye right away, as I sat there thinking, \"Gee, these plates are square...how cool is that?\"\nAnd highly functional too!\nWe used them to eat our food from, carefully filling them with food from the serving dish, which was also nice, only much bigger and a lot  nicer than our little square plates\nWhen the food was on our small square plate, we then used our chopsticks to start eating, which I should mention, worked just fine. \n\nNow let me stop here.\nIt would be sinful of me not to mention the chopstick presentation.\nMy chopsticks came in a nicely wrapped white package, similar to what drinking straws come wrapped in. \nHowever.\nOur server, opened them up for us, carefully placing them on a cute little black rock. Or maybe it was a stone. I'm not certain. \nThe stone was small and black, and looked like it might have been some kind of vintage variety of stone, (or rock) that I've never seen before...almost resembling an Apache Tear or something. It may have been volcanic too, I'm not sure. \nThis is what made me think it was a stone or lava, and not a rock.\nAnyways, kudos on the stone selection. \n\nThen there was the little container of soy sauce. \nOMG!\nIt was small and looked like a miniature teapot, like something Alice would use when she was small Alice and not big Alice. \nI take that back. \nIt would have been about the same size as small Alice, so forget i said that.\nAnywho,  it was white, and cute, and had a nice little pouring spout. \n\nOverall, my table was amazing. Its size and shape. Just the perfect thing to eat off of. Nice and clean too, adorned with plates, a cute stone, some chopsticks, and a miniature teapot.\n\nOh, and one more thing. \nThere was a napkin too. I think it was linen but I''m not sure. \nLarge and colorful, it did a nice job of wiping my face, hands, and, I think I even  may have sneezed into it once. \nI don't recall, but I'm pretty sure i did. \nThe large napkin would have been a bonus had I needed to spit anything out that didn't suit me,  leaving a large unused portion of it to clean up with afterward.\nBut fortunately, I didn't have to spit anything out.\nProbably never will either... not as good as their food is. \n\nIf you go, I highly recommend one of the small rectangular tables.\nThey're soooo amazing.
