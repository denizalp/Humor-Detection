Food was awesome but the side comments from the staff ruined our experience. When I go somewhere to eat I don't expect to hear the staff saying they wish people would stop coming, and that they want to get a brick out and smash their heads, you also shouldn't kick a chair towards customers to clear room for others. Also it's the day of Harry Potter fest downtown and a staff member said I'm real tired of seeing all these stupid Harry Potter fans. Unprofessional in my opinion
