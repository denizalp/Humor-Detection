Goodness I love Fern. I'm so glad it's in Charlotte. The food is so good that my meat-eating parents left full and without complaint about their vegetarian meal. The food is creative and with variety. Some dishes are clearly with an Indian influence, others lean towards southern or south of the border.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the vegan chocolate cake, which was so good, my parents couldn't believe it was made without dairy!\n\nGo here, bring your friends. Aside from the food, the decor is also adorable - mason jars line the ceiling, and there are ferns planted into the wall. It's just the best. Charlotte should have more places like this one.
