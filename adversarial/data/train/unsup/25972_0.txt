I can't believe this place has so many good reviews. I really can't believe it.\n\nI went on a Friday night at midnight after seeing a movie with friends. They ordered rice paper shrimp rolls and I ordered curry chicken.\n\nEventually their shrimp rolls arrived and I sat waiting for my chicken. Their shrimp rolls looked delicious and I was tired, hungry and cold as I waited for my chicken.\n\nThe server came by and asked us how everything was. He didn't even notice I didn't have my food. I told him I was still waiting for my chicken. He said he would go check on it for me. Turns out he forgot to order it. So I waited some more.\n\nAfter some more waiting, my house salad arrived. This is when I really realized the fate of my meal. I wish I took a picture of it so I could share how pathetic it was. It was a few leaves with.... hot sauce on them?? It was some red sauce. I thought... there's no way I just got handed a salad with hot sauce on it. It must be some special dressing. I tried a piece of it, and it tasted like leaves with hot sauce on them. Because that's what they were. Now that's I've seen other yelp reviewer's pictures of the sad salad, I wonder why they even bother. I pushed it aside and waited some more for my chicken curry. \n\nIt finally arrived. It looked like leftovers a frat boy would attempt to feed me for breakfast. There was a bowl of chicken curry sitting on a large plate with some scattered rice on it. I'm being generous when I call it a bowl of chicken curry. There were three tiny pieces of chicken strewn on large cut up potato. Potato curry, that's something I've never seen before. Probably because it's fucking idiotic. I dumped my curry on the rice and mixed it together. It tasted like rice and potatoes, two foods that are hard to fuck up.\n\nThanks Java House for my potatoes and rice. My low carb diet really suffered that night. Have you ever taken $10 and put it in a paper shredder? That's what my night felt like.
