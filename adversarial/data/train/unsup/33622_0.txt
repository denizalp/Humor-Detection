Great food, possibly my favorite seafood in Cleveland. The entrees are excellent. The nigiri is great. Service is hit or miss. Love the host - he's the best, always! Have had some good servers (generally on the weekends) and some not-that-awesome servers and bus boys (a bit too aggressive and nervous sometimes). Overall though, nothing that would keep me away. \n\nMy ONLY real complaint (and I really hope someone at the restaurant reads this) is that the chopsticks are **terrible**!!!! I was so surprised when, after ordering a $25 entree, I was given the cheapest chopsticks (chinese takeout style). I've had to ask for additional pairs more times than I can imagine, as they are horrible quality and tend to splinter into your fingers, food, or mouth. If the management could manage to purchase good (or not even good, decent!) quality chopsticks then I would certainly be giving this restaurant 5 bright stars!
