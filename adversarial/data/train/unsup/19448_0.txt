TRUE STORY IN REAL LIFE ! Friend of mine we went to this tiny little few thousands square ft with less than 10 tables casino, we won big money at high limit room , a dude name Jason he claimed he is the casino GM asked us to leave the table and escort us with security went to 2nd floor to a dark room, they started questioning us all kind of info where we from why we here why we won so much , long story short at the end they kicked us out and warning us not to win so much money in a single day. They said if we don't leave the casino immediately they will call the cops said we were cheating \n\nSound like a movie? \nI don't even believe it but it seriously happened to us. \n\nScary casino
