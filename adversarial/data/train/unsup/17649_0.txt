Check this place out! Located by the 8 ST C train, this is my new go to place for lunches and dinner. It's in the old Gohan space. FYI - Pure has an awesome happy hour from 2-5pm on weekdays, half off appetizers. Considering the prices are very good (for the quality and quantity), this is a steal!\n\nI tried Chef Pham's famous kimchi fried rice, snow peas and mushrooms, papaya salad, surf and turf salad rolls and vegetarian spring rolls ( a tad too greasy). This was a lot of food for two people, bill came to about $60 with two glasses of wine. Everything was delicious, fresh and flavourful, perfectly cooked. We left stuffed and happy. \n\nThere are a few chefs I would follow around in the city, where ever they go. Chef Pham (formerly of Watercress) is one of them.
