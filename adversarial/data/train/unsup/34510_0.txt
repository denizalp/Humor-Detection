I was checking on Yelp to see what restaurants were in North Phoenix that I haven't yet tried and Da Valley Grill came up. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted. I noticed they have a chalk board menu and under the breakfast items was Saimin to my delight *^_^* . Unfortunately breakfast time had already passed so I'll have to come here again to try that out. From past Yelp pics of the menu, they do change their menu from time to time since I saw bento option that wasn't available when I came that day. Which I actually like since it means I can try new things they have to offer.   So from  all the savory choices on their menu they had that day, I opted  to order the Kalua Pork and their Spam Musubi. The pork was tender and super moist. I think it needed just a tad more seasoning, but overall I enjoyed it. The Spam Musubi was just as I expected it, no rant or rave.  I also had a bit of Chicken Katsu my friend ordered. That was actually pretty good with just the right amount of breading and lightly fried and to top it off it came as 2 generous cutlets. Couple notes, if you're trying to find the place for the very first time, you might miss it as I did. The restaurant is sort of in the industrial section of that area. Also they close at 4pm during the week and are closed on Sundays.
