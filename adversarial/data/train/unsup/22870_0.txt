Love this station . Chet  buchanan from 98.5 kulc we have a problem ur always on talking about how great IDEAL IMAGE is about how there always having specials and great deals . Guest week with 70% off . Well I went there to get my free estimate , I no expectations I shopped around looking at other places and pricing . I wanted to do my back and shoulders average price for that is around 4700 bucks . IDEAL IMAGE price was 11,871 but with there guest week deal it was 5,341 I feel like I went to a liquidation place were everything in the store is 50% but the price has been jacked up so when u get the discount ur paying normal price . Chet ur always praising them now it's time for u to do what's right and let ur listeners know the truth . Chet there normal price was 11,871 that's a car Chet a car . Do the right thing . I for one will be boycotting IDEAL IMAGE
