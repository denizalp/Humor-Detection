We decided to come to Veggie House for my birthday lunch prior to going to Ronald's Donuts down the street.  My vegan friend recommended that I try Veggie House since it was so close to Ronald's.  It was a plus that there was a Groupon available for this place.\n\nWe sat next to the the makeshift pond where they had water dripping off the roof of the gazebo with fake birds that would chirp every now and then.  I thought it was kinda cheesy but also kinda relaxing and nice.\n\nWe ordered the roti with curry, pan fried noodles and Cantonese pan-fried \"fish.\"  Our friendly waitress convinced us to try the Cantonese pan-fried \"fish\" after debating between that and a tofu dish.  She said we can order tofu at any Chinese restaurant but the \"fish\" we could only order there.  We were sold on the \"fish!\"  The roti was so delicious - it was like fluffy, heavenly crepes with delicious curry sauce for dipping, my BF still can't stop thinking about it to this day!  The pan fried noodles were crunchy with a delicious, savory sauce and the Cantonese pan fried \"fish\" really almost tasted like fish.  It was pretty creative how they wrapped the faux fish loaf with nori to give it a seaweed flavor.  We were happy we went with the waitress' suggestion!\n\nThe service was great and it seemed all the other customers were regulars.  I would also be a regular there if I lived in Vegas.  I will be coming back next time I'm in town!
