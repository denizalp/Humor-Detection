Service at this place is friendly but very slow (a table behind us were trying to get the waitress' attention for so long that they dined and dashed). \n\nThe food here is what you'd expect from a diner\/greasy spoon rather than a nice brunch place. The food didn't really stand out nor was it very interesting - just very basic. There were a bunch of ingredients on the plate but didn't really work together. The cobb salad I got was also very wet, which was unsettling. Likely wouldn't come back.
