Sloooowest service ever. We came in on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy but it still took forever. The whole night was slow. Getting our checks took over 30mins. \n\nFood was alright. It wasn't fantastic. The hummus was my favorite thing we ordered. Definitely small portions for the price. \n\nThe atmosphere and aesthetic of this place is top notch, but the food is meh.
