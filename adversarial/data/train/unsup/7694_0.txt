I don't get the bad reviews. I mean, a few broken sconces and you can't muster a 3 star review? Maybe I'm just not high maintenance like these people but when I am driving through Vegas and need to stay a night, I choose Rio. I choose it because it has a great pool, a rooftop nightclub, flair bar tending, penny slots, a Starbucks, and a few good dining options whether you wants some Wetzels Pretzels or an actual restaurant. \n\nCan I just ask a favor, fellow Yelpers? Stop listing \"not on the strip\" as a CON. That's your fault for booking a hotel off the strip of you were looking for one. I mean, come on!! Anyway, as I lay here in the soft Rio bed after my perfectly hot shower with well stocked amenities, I couldn't help but giggle at the foot-stomping and childish whining in these reviews. You want a hotel with different stuff? Go there. Don't dock it points because it doesn't fit your mold. \n\nFree valet, and bags brought to your room in a timely manner. Friendly and professional staff. Not too smokey smelling compared to strip hotels. Great club for ladies, my friends frequent it when we come through Vegas for sure.
