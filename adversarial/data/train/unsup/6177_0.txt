Yes, it's in a sleazy location (hey, you're in Las Vegas!).\n\nYes, it's super ultra cheesy (guess what? you're still in Las Vegas!).\n\nMichael Jordan and Elvis were married here. Sweet.\n\nIf you're going to get married in Vegas, why try and pretend to make it something it's not? As Air Jordan would say, just do it.\n\nThat being said, the boy and I went through the drive-thru at A Little White Wedding Chapel and picked up a Nevada marriage certificate to accompany the $55 marriage license we'd obtained the day before.\n\nOur pastor (Tony?) looked and sounded exactly like Penn from Penn & Teller. He was awesome and married us in right in our Enterprise rental car in under 5 minutes flat. He was also nice enough to set up my digital camera on the drive-thru windowsill so we have all our magical memories captured in .avi format. Sweet.\n\nThe boy wore a Red Sox hat. I wore a pink sundress. Upon later review of our wedding video, we noticed he'd forgotten to take off his seatbelt and had it on the entire time. Through the \"I Do's\" and all. SWEET. It doesn't get any cheesier than that.\n\nTony gave us a souvenir wedding certificate (the real one can be ordered off the Clark County website), closed the drive-thru window, walked outside and removed the orange cone from the exit so we could drive out back down the Vegas strip. Despite all the cheese, it was definitely a memorable moment.\n\nFYI: The $40 drive-thru, civil ceremony only (no pictures anything else included) special on their website is inaccurate, it actually costs $50 now (plus tip for the person who conducts your civil ceremony - we gave Tony another $50). I just read all the reviews for the first time and am sorry to hear this institution appears to be homophobic, that seriously sucks. My experience was pleasant and I'm sorry that wasn't the case for others.
