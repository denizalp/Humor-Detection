I tried to make my appointment and ended up accidentally clicking this one with the silly website. I called to fix it but the one i wanted was booked for the whole day so i stuck with this one. I read the reviews and was concerned but i figured it can't be that bad right? I ended up getting a lil lost, i go in and say im here for my appt at 3,theres a lady in like her 20s and a old guy in like his maybe 60s. The guy says \"oh you mean ten after 3\" i wasnt sure if he was joking or actually frustrated but anyways they say that my insurance wont cover it and it'll be like 700 or some crazy number, i have her call my insurance and they say to go to the restroom while she's calling, they dont hand me a cup so i ask and they say no they just need u to have an empty bladder, they figure out insurance and then i go into this office but the lights are off and it's only the ultrasound monitor light and a lil mini table lamp lit, and a radio playing rock music on low, the guy rushed through instructions, the sheets on the bed weren't even folded they looked like they were just tossed on there, then i go to get on it and the bed wheels arent locked so im trying to adjust myself in the dark as the bed is moving around, he started laughing when he came in and then said that i was laying the wrong way on the cushion, gave me like two seconds to get switched and of course it's uncomfortable being in a stupid gown thing in a dark room it was all just weird, uncomfortable, i got through it and got out of there but i would avoid this place if u need anything done. I like sarcasm as much as the next person but that mixed with a rude undertone and the severe lack of professionalism mixed with a old guy being the one doing it was all bad.
