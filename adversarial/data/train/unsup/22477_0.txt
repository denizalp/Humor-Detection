Best coffee in Phoenix.\n\nFor me, it's all about a shop's product. You can have whatever decor, or be a douchebag, or overcharge for your wares, but if you can deliver on what you sell, then you're alright. \n\nThat, is parallel what Lux delivers. They are are, first and foremost, a coffee shop. And, time and time and time again, they deliver a premium, tasty, excellent cup of coffee. Whats more? it's 2 bucks. 2 american dollars for a - get this - endless cup of brew. And that's all I ever really want, a quality cup of coffee all hours of the day. \n\nThat being said, it's can be difficult to get past the occasional worker who seems to be unhappy all the time, or the barista who doesn't seem to have enough time to even look you in the eye. \n\nBut damn, that coffee. \n\nThe ambiance is good, with lots of different seating inside and outside, and they serve not only coffee, but alcohol and food as well. Croissants are delicious, albeit overpriced, and the cocktails are varied and well mixed. Four stars because while a the staff can be hit or miss, they deliver on their staple menu item at a great value.
