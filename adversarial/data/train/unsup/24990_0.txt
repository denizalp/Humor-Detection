For our first stay at the Encore we had a 5 star experience for the majority of the time. The staff were very responsive and everyone from the sundries shop clerk, wait staff, and housekeepers addressed us by name. There are two sizable pool areas - my only complaint for the stay was that the pool service was really lacking. It took a long time for anyone to come by, and longer to return with a drink menu. We eventually swam up to the pool bar to help ourselves because the waitress never returned. The hotel is clean and well-appointed. The standard rooms are 700+ square feet (100 sq ft bigger than the Wynn rooms) and have classy and comfortable decor. My traveling companion really enjoyed the phone in the hotel bathroom - he was able to get several loads taken care of at once.
