I've been here a couple times for ice cream but I have to say it's the dirtiest Dairy Queen location I've ever been to (and I promise I've been to loads of Dairy Queen locations in Ontario). The staff was either not trained properly or just choose to be lazy and unfriendly to the customers. It's also the only location where you can't really see the food when they're making it for you. The best Dairy Queen location in Brampton is definitely the Centre St location, great patio and great service there.
