The bubble tea here is good and they have a wide selection of flavours to choose from. However, the service here is terrible. Got take out and asked for 'no ice' in my drink yet the drink came out after a 15 minute wait with ice. Didn't want to wait another 15 minutes so took it and left. Also only takes debit or cash yet when I tried to pay with MasterCard the girl at the front didn't even try to stop me which caused more delays in the end. Will come back to try the food because it looks good and hopefully the service will be better.
