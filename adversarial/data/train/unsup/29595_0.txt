I went just for wings cause I heard they were the best in Calgary.  Wings night was Monday and Wednesday for 25 cents each.  They had a lot of flavors but I think Honey Garlic and the Rickards BBQ are the best ones there.  I was so excited for the Spicy Parmesan but when we got the order, it was just hot wings sprinkled with Parmesan on top, REALLY LITTLE PARMESAN.  Jerk and Cajan were really strong but dry and had no taste.\nDeath Valley was... death valley, but I didn't like how the spice tasted, but if you like the burning feeling, this is great.  Lemon pepper and Salt & Pepper aren't that great, they're really dry, but well seasoned.  \n\nThe wing sizes are really big, even for wings night.  Obviously, for wings night, it's no refills for drinks and everyone at the table have to order something or else there's still a charge.\n\nWe also had the fries and the beef dip.  The fries were normal, but the beef dip was...pretty bad.. the beef inside was not tear able.  When I say terrible, I mean I couldn't bite through it.\n\nI would go back, but only for the wings.  So when I'm rating this pub, I'm rating just for the wings.\n\nPrice Wise (1 being cheap, 5 being expensive):  3\/5\nFood Quality (1 being not worth it, 5 being totally worth it): 3\/5\nService Wise (1 being horrible, 5 being amazing): 3\/5
