I usually take the light rail to Uptown, since I live in south\/southwest Charlotte but sometimes it's better to drive and when I drive into Uptown, I'm parking at the 7th Street Station parking garage. The parking isn't cheap... but there's a machine that will punch your ticket and validate you. It's in the public market area!
