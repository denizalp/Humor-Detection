SO GOOD! \nDefinitely order it with the hot stone and with the egg on top. I normally don't even like eggs, but it mixes so well with the ingredients and the sauce (we tried original and the sweet and spicy). \nIt doesn't taste too \"egg-y\" at all. The purple rice was also really good.\nI love that there is a variety of sauces to try. \nEverything was very fresh and super clean.\nThe whole staff was friendly. \nI loved the flavored water too!
