Had dinner here on Mother's Day.\n\nPut our name down for 5 people.  I see empty, uncleaned tables. We wait for 30 mins, nobody looks at us.  Go ask the girl how much longer, she already crossed us off as if they sat us!  Waited ten more minutes, she's twiddling her fingers while tables are free but not cleaned.  Lots of people waiting. \n\nWe are seated after I complain.  No menu, no cups, no cutlery.  We go up and get it ourselves.  We then order our food. Write it down and hand deliver to the kitchen.  The wait staff came 3 times: to put the grill down, to deliver food, to tell us the kitchen is closing.  Not once did they come check on us or even acknowledge us.  \n\nIt's Mother's Day, staff your restaurant properly.  Hostess, take the smirk off your face and clean off tables instead of watching your line build up. \n\nFunny enough, they have a sign that said \"the customer is king\" but ironically the \"king\" fell down and it's like \"the customer is nothing\".  Seems like you're living up to your motto!
