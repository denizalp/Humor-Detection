As a newly converted Starbucks addict, this is my new go-to spot for my mid-morning cup of fuel. Since it's located in the center of downtown, the shop is packed every time I stop in. The baristas are VERY slow at making drinks, causing a huge crowd to form by the pick-up counter. I've had several encounters with extremely rude employees, but there are also many friendly, welcoming workers - luck of the draw, really. What I love about this location is that my drink order (which is usually complicated) rarely gets messed up and tastes great consistently. At the end of the day, if I get my Starbucks iced coffee, I'm happy.
