I was told if we didn't arrive early last Friday morning that we'd be waiting for a table.  Luckily we barely beat the rush and we were sat in \"Kat's\" section. She was responsive and knowledgeable and from what I could see,   running like crazy.  Our food came out hot, and faster than I expected!  I had the build your own omelet and it was cooked perfectly (not too tough!) The fried potatoes w onions were crisper than I prefer but decent.  The side of pineapple delicious and fresh.  My Chai tea with skim milk was perfect as well. Another in our party loves the sausages as a side,  nice crisp \"break\" in the skin as you bite in.  His English muffin slightly over done but raspberry jam made up for it.  Decore fun, pretty loud with open concept (& clever bathroom sink set-up!). One in our party said evening bar service good and I can see us returning.  But, the highlight was Kat's service- outstanding...she even referred us to an awesome Thai place...all while very busy & with a smile!
