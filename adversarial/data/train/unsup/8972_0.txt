Completely regret going here. A tattoo that was supposed to mean a lot to me, ended up looking like absolute crap and now I loathe having to see it every day. The more he tried to fix it the more he kept ruining it - he knew he was doing it too. Now I'm in the process of getting the tattoo removed. It should have clicked in my head as soon as I heard that he'd only been tattooing for a year. Definitely go somewhere else!
