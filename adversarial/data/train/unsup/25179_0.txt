If you Haven't been here, go ASAP. it's a Phoenix staple.\nI have been eating here since High School !!! Great local owners and they now have a 2nd Scottsdale location. YAY.\nThey have a tasting station at the front, so first timers can figure out what they like before committing to something.  Face it there is nothing like it anyplace. Chinese food fused with Mexican food, has proved to be a match in business and in love.\nThe Phoenix location has had pics of \"chino Kids\" for as long as I can remember and  the pics go back a long way so its a neat retrospective. Love it when somebody in their 20's+ says \"hey that's me \" and points at some kid on the wall.  \nGo for the Jade red chicken , you can have it breaded or not. I have mine on salad in place of rice.  The jerk chicken and rice is another don't miss item. You can have anything put on a quesadilla if you would rather have portable food , just ASK ! \nAn Awesome Phoenix and now Scottsdale institution
