These guys offer quality work at a very reasonable price.  When my Toyota Corolla needed a new radiator, I was new in town and called ten different shops (including dealership).  Hondoctors were the only independently run shop that would actually tell me what brand radiator that they would use so I could do my own research, but they were also almost the cheapest.  I go to them for my regular oil changes now, and they are excellent.  I drive across town for these guys and they are worth it.  Come here and you will be a regular.
