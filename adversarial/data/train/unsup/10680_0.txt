I wanted to drop Yelp a line again about Mold Eliminators and how things have recently changed in my opinion.\n\nShortly after my first yelp review I was contacted by Ben Caine from Mold Eliminators and forgive me I don't exactly remember his title with the company, but my interaction with Ben was professional, articulate and intelligent.\n\nBen apologized for Bill and Craig's extreme lack of business acumen and was completely willing to speak with me to hear about the problems and stated he wanted to learn from them and better his company.\n\nBen was a breath of fresh air and all I could ask for. He was genuine in his concern for the clients and equally as genuine in wanting to better the crew to make sure the next client didn't have my experience.\n\nBen held meetings with his staff and even implemented measures to improve communication between the company and client.\n\nBen made a horrific experience palatable and even took monetary steps to make things better.\n\nBravo to Ben, job well done.
