The food here was great!!! The service, not so much.  The waitress was AWESOME, as she was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.   Unfortunately, they were understaffed.  I'm picky, and when paying for food, give me what I ask for.  They made a mistake on an order forgetting ingredients requested, so back to the kitchen.  The manager brought it back quickly, however, seemed to be annoyed, no apology.   They offer water, but it is not free.  It's their specially filtered water in a normal looking bottle.  You have to request tap water.  Waitress took out off the bill, with no issue.  Again, she was awesome.  The food was great.  My eggs had that dark lovely yolk and the bacon, double smoked.  Americano was great and the creme brul√©, deadly.  A Caesar as a noon treat worked out well.  Prices are a little high, but expected.  4-5 stars would have been achieved if they got the order right and the manager cared
