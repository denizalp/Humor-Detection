Not a bad airport, although it is sprawling, so if you have limited time between flights you will want to be ready to run.  You feel the humidity as soon as you walk off the plane, BANG.  The airport was pretty easy to get around, but it is a busy airport.  There is free WiFi, so you can catch up on life.  The other thing that I liked was that the food court had tables next to power outlets (so you could charge your laptop or iPhone while you eat).\n\nIn terms of the eateries, you have your standard airport stuff, nothing out of the ordinary.  I find that top notch airports have unique food to the area, Charlotte felt standard.
