Sleepy Hollow is a beautiful and well-maintained Cleveland Metroparks course in Brecksville offering, by far, the most challenging greens in the limited number of courses I've played thus far.  Especially on a hot day, with the heat reflecting off the greens, its far too tempting to try to read the green quickly and think its a straight-away putt.  But...it's never straight-away....\n\nPrime, early-morning tee times seemed pretty tough to secure.  I ended up going in the late morning on a Sunday and was surprised by the generous spacing between groups and the relatively quick pace of play.  (With its reputation, I fully expected a traffic jam.)  On the negatives, particularly on a hot day, it would have been nice to see more water coolers rather than drinking fountains serving up warm water.  Also, I really disliked the layout of one of the last couple of holes, essentially hitting the ball up the long side of a very ditch-like valley.  Finally, humorously enough, we had a cart on the front nine with a bad motor that we ended up needing to push-start a couple of times.  Had no problem switching carts at the turn, though.
