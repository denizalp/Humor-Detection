DONT GET THE FAKE EYELASHES!!!! Don't do it. First off the lady kept getting the glue in my eye to the point I couldn't see anything and I was scared I was going to wake up somewhere else. Now it's been almost two weeks and my eyelashes won't come off with any home remedies whatsoever. The glue was clearly applied by someone who thought they were painting a giant mural... NOT SOMEONES DELICATE eyelash! Just save yourself and pay more for extensions that are worth the money or glue on ones at home... Never again :(
