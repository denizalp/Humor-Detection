Honestly...I think some people expect way too much from AYCE Sushi...Luckily I am not one of those people.  When I go to AYCE Sushi, All I expect is a Plethora of Options, Schools of Fish, Farms of Beef, Gardens Full of Salads....and a Mountain of Ice Cream!\n\nMoon Sushi Delivers ALL of this and More! The quality is great compared to most other AYCE places.  All of the food comes out quick, fresh, hot or cold depending what you order. The service is great and they are extremely attentive to your needs. (sorry they do not supply sweat pants so make sure you come prepared).  \n\nThere is plenty of parking in the plaza so you can stumble or crawl to your car after how full you become from eating at least 2 of everything on the menu!\n\nWe ordered everything from The usual Salmon, eel, tuna, butterfish, terriyaki steak, tempura, calamari, udon, miso soup, deep fried tofu, ice cream, and a ton of other dishes that were ALL delicious!\n\nAdd on the 10% discount for being on Yelp with the decent prices and you have yourself a 5 star AYCE sushi place!\n\nI am absolutely willing to go into Orbit for Moon Sushi! Hehe.
