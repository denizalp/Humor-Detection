Finally Stopped at Karey's for a bite, Actually it was not just a bite but a FEAST, LMAO. \nI always pass by Karey's but never stopped to try it. I always been a big fan of some Filipino dishes cuz i grew up with alot of friends that were Pinoy and Pinay back home in ESSJ, CA. \nThe place is small and cozy, i was the only person there which was GREAT cuz Karen (the owner) and her daughter greeted me and started giving me samples of everything, lol. Delish every single sample. She was sweet, generous pinay lady. I grabbed a 3 item meal with white rice, Also Grabbed a 10 Piece Lumpia, all i can say is WOW!! I really liked the Sweet n Sour spicy sauce they have. Damn it reminded me of dishes from back home. everything was delicious. \n\nI'm going back Friday for some LECHON!!! They have it every OTHER Friday. Cant wait. \n\nI wanted to grab desert too but i think i ordered enough for me to eat, ill be back to get some Friday, lol \n\nAll in all it was AWESOME food, but deducted one star for a lil greasy and some meat was dry, but it was all good!!!\n\nBY THE WAY, yes i did try the Chocolate meat, TY Robert, lol
