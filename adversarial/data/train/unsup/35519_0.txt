Been to this place two times now. First time we went we were not impressed BUT we decided to give it another try since it has such high ratings, we thought the first time we'd gone was a one off but were we ever wrong. \n\nService: 4 stars\nStaff very nice and attentive, zero complaints in that department. \n\nFood:\nSashimi 3.5\nSushi 3\nMaki 2.5\nHot food 3\n\nThe sashimi was fresh, clean no nasty fishy smell and prices were a decent size. Sashimi was the best thing at echo sushi. The sushi I've given it a 3 simply because there was too much rice and the rice was bad. The rice was of the wrong consistancy, it was warm, tasted bad and made my bf and I feel not so good. Maki I gave 2.5 because of the rice. The hot foods were okay, honestly not the worst but not the best either. I did get some very burnt dumplings and tiny beef ribs (refer to photos). \n\nOverall, echo sushi is not the worst AYCE I've been to but it's also not worth it's high rating it has. I would recommend Sushi One in the Yonge and Sheppard area if you don't mind the distance.
