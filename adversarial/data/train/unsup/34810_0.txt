First time coming to any of the Tommy Guns locations. A friend recommend that I try them out. Having been a first choice customer at the same place for 15 years, I decided to check these guys out.\nUpon entering the place looked and smelled clean. It didn't have the overpowering smells and scents of the more lady-folk oriented salons which was a nice change.\nI stood in line and the cashier then explained I had to sign in on a computer. It's not the customer service approach I would have taken but it's a cool way to integrate technology and would probably be easier on the staff during a rush.\nThe wait was about 7 min, not bad at all.\nWhen it was my turn, the stylist greeted me by name and before asking what I wanted asked how my day was, a nice touch!\nI opted for the clean cut service, cut, shampoo, conditioner, and the best part: scalp massage.\nThe stylist did great work, no erroneous hairs poking out and she had crazy good scalp massage technique. That alone would bring me back....\nThe products she used were low scent including the final styling product. It looked like they use Crew brand products for most of their work. Not the best, but not the worst either.\nHaving the sinks right at the stylist's station was great and again, must make their lives much easier. The sinks have a wide lip with a foamy cushion. Another nice touch.\nOverall, the quality of service, and the little touches here and there made for a great experience.\nMy only qualm is the machine sign in, it's not quite right for their ambiance.\nTotal cost was 32$ plus tip.\nI will go back again.
