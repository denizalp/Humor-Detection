[DÃ‰COR] - 5\/5\nSimple, clean, and has a superhero theme. \n\n[PRICES] - 3\/5\nIncreased by approximately $4 since 2017. A sign on the front door explains the recent price adjustments are due to the increase of minimum wage in January 2018. \n\n[FOOD QUALITY] - 5\/5\nThis place has some high-quality chicken! My boyfriend and I ordered a \"Half & Half Fried Chicken in Any Flavour\" - $34.00. For flavours, we chose (1) Rice Powder Fried Chicken and (2) Fried Chicken with Sauce - Mild. \n\n[ORDER] \n- Rice Powder Fried Chicken's skin was surprisingly NOT greasy! I think the rice powder absorbed the extra grease and left the chicken with a crispy coating that sealed the moisture of the meat. \n\n- Fried Chicken with Mild Sauce was sweet and tangy, but not that spicy. We expected more of a kick from the spice at a Korean joint. So, for the spice lovers out there, I would recommend either the \"Spicy\" or the \"Very Spicy\" sauces. Again, the dish is made with high-quality chicken meat, but the chicken breast meat was a little dry in comparison with the meat in the Rice Powder Fried Chicken. \n\n[OVERALL] - 4\/5\nExperience was above average. Servers were friendly, and I would recommend Mr. ChiMaek to foodies who are on the hunt for Korean Fried Chicken in Markham.
