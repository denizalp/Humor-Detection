I came here as I needed an exam and my doctor couldn't get me in for a month. I walked in and considering there were 5 patients ahead of me, I got out within 1:30min as a walk in. To me that was not bad at all. They took care of all of my questions and gave me a referral to see a specialist for further diagnosing. Dr. Carol(forgot her last name) was very informative. Gave me some options and made me feel very comfortable in the office. She did not rush while in the room with me and even took the time to write down vitamin\/oils she recommended. Jasmine in the front was super nice. She has that kind, energetic, compassionate attitude every receptionist should have.  I was brought back by Evelyn to a room where they ask very personal questions, because she was so professional, I did not feel embarrassed at all. Thank you to the whole team!
