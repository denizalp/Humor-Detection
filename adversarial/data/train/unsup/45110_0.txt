I went to Right Toyota looking to buy my first new car. Chad was great, and very helpful in reaching a deal that I feel comfortable with. Ryan, the finance manager, was also very helpful in explaining the terms of the deal in a way that I could easily understand. The management truly cares about their customers and will do everything they can to make sure you leave happy. If you're looking into a Toyota, I highly recommend that you give Chad Salerno a call!
