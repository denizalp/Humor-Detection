As far as I know, this is the only place to eat if you're drunk on your night out in Vegas. There was a wild line out the door with the crowd only speaking Spanish. \n\nI only ordered Al Pastor tacos due to the advice of the surrounding customers. The meat is sliced off in front of you and prepared with incredible speed. I don't mind the price because compared to the fine dining of most places in Vegas, it was incredibly cheap. I snagged horchata as my drink, and my coworker got this dried pumpkin snack thing (I think), and I loved it. I didn't even know I liked pumpkin. \n\nYou make friends in the line. Squirt a lime on your tacos, and check out the mini topping bar to spice it up further. You may or may not remember eating these amazing tacos, so do it again on your next night out~
