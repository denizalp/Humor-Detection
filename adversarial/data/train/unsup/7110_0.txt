I ate here for Restaurant Week over the weekend. I'm a huge fan of Chef Justin Beckett and his other establishment Beckett's Table. Southern Rail is a beautiful restaurant with lots of open space and is located inside The Newton right off the light pail path. It has an open kitchen and a large size patio\/bar area. Its rustic-style, nostalgic decor that gives off a warm, hospitable feel. Because it was my first time, I went with some of their signature dishes. The cup of Gumbo Ya-Ya for appetizer, the Cider Brined and Slow Roasted Pork Loin for my main course and their delicious Red Velvet cake for dessert. I was met with great service and enjoyed every bite.  The Gumbo soup was full of flavor and delicious. The Pork Loin was nice and tender and you can't go wrong with the Red Velvet cake. I look forward to stopping in again on Wednesday Fried Chicken night.
