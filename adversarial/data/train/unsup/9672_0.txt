I like to think that I stay calm.\nI like to think that I'm rational. \n\nThis all goes out the window when I have to get shots, or blood drawn.\n\nI have tattoos, I have piercings, but when it comes to needles taking things from my body.... Bring on the tears....bring on the nausea. \n\nThings I would rather do than get blood drawn:\n\n-Sit through a Taylor Swift concert, with Justin Beiber opening up for her.\n\n-Try and find jeans that fit me properly\n\n-Go bikini shopping right after eating Thanksgiving dinner\n\n-Give birth\n\nUnfortunately, I have to see what my thyroid levels are.\nI made an appointment a few days ago online for this location,\nthat is closest to my home.\n\nI arrived at 2:20 for a 2:30 appointment. \nThe waiting room had 13 people in the waiting room when I walked in, and then two others walked in after I sat down. I always feel that quest diagnostics is filled with three different groups of people....\n\nOld people. \nNormal people.\nand of course, the super sketchy people.\n\nI don't remember what time I was called up and asked for my insurance card so that they could make a copy of it....I wasn't asked for the confirmation number from my online booking. \n\nMy (nurse...?) told me to come through the door, and that we would be in room 5 at the end of the hall.\n\nI told her that I'm kind of a pansy when it comes to this stuff.... She told me we would get through it, and boy we did!\n\nMy gal, Kylie, was so kind. I told her that I usually have to have the blood taken out of my left hand. \n\nThankfully, she LISTENED, and didn't even try my arm. \nShe went right to my left hand...tapped me a few times, and before I knew it, it was over! \n\nI didn't even feel the needle go in! She didn't fish around, she is like a vein artist!\n\n**This is honestly the FIRST time that I have had blood drawn where I didn't\n-have to lay down\n-cry\n-throw up.\n\nI was back in my car at 2:41. \n\nTHANKS KYLIE!!!!
