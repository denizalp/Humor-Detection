It's was cool but tiny. It looked much like someone created this in their basement. No wonder they make you leave your cell phone outside in a locker. If any real photos leaked out it would hurt their scam. The drinks were like mouth wash, but the ice cup it was served in was nice. They warn you to only set the ice cups on coasters, I set mine right on the ice bar and watched it freeze in place.\n\nCertainly a \"once\" on a life time thing to do. But don't waste your money. You can get the same treatment in the freezer section at the local Costco. \n\nIt is cool for the novelty, but the gloves they \"allow\" you to use do not keep your hands from getting too cold. You will not want to stay long, I guess that is part of their business model.
