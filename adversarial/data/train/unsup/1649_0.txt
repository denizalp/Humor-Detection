Surprised the North Shore Trail review average isn't higher!  I love walking this nicely maintained wide urban trail and wish I could do it more often.\n\nHere's what we do.  My guy and I park in the Strip District across the river from the North Shore Trail.  We then walk across the 16th Street Bridge.  Then, there's a decision to make:  take a left to walk past PNC Park and Heinz Field or take a right to get a little more solitude and explore pretty, quaint Washington's Landing?  If there's a ballgame going on, taking the left is a blast for the atmosphere and people-watching.  Otherwise, I like to go right, eventually walk across the cool pedestrian bridge to Washington's Landing, and then cross the 31st Street Bridge to get back to Penn Avenue and the Strip District--a big loop.\n\nHusband and I have been house-hunting like crazy, dedicating the majority of our free time to the exceedingly stressful process.  The other day I was shocked and then immediately saddened when I realized July is more than half over.  Where did it go?!  I haven't gotten out much yet this season, which is uncharacteristic of me.  Time to get outside, and the North Shore Trail might be just the right medicine for my summertime blues.\n\nA nice workout opportunity and a nice way to see the city.  The views from the North Shore Trail on a clear, sunny day are wonderful.
