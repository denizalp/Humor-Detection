I had seen the signs up as I went by for a while not knowing it was an already established owner.  Then I saw Daren's review and decided to try the place.  It is sort of tucked in behind the pizza place which occupies most of the building.  The business name does not fully describe the wide variety of stuff available on the menu.\n\nI arrived a few minutes early and the doors were wide open and everything was ready for business.  The counter person\/server was very friendly.  I got the chicken Caesar pita sandwich with a salad and soda fountain.  Service is fast casual where you order at the counter and they bring it to you.  The restaurant is bright and airy and clean.  It was a lovely fall day outside so I chose to sit on the shaded patio.  I am going to nitpik a little because I cannot find much to fault; the Caesar dressing was a bit too vinegary for my taste and I would prefer more Feta on my salad.  \n\nI'll definitely be back to try some more stuff on the menu.
