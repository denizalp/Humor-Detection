Don't tell my geography teachers from school but I had to look up where Belize was on a map. In case you also needed to know, it's on the Eastern coast of Central America bordered by Guatamala and Mexico and considered both a Central American and a Caribbean nation. The food here really reflects this duality as it has elements of both Latin and Caribbean cuisine, combining to make a delicious fusion. Those that enjoy Mexican cuisine will definitely appreciate the dishes here which are similar yet have a distinct flavor profile that sets it apart.\n\nThe restaurant occupies a fairly large building and is quite spacious. There's a pool table off to one side, and the other side has a projection TV screen with tables and booths dispersed in between. All the menu items sounded delicious but ultimately I was enticed by the idea of the sampler platter ($12.99), one of their specials written on a sign near the entrance. It included a lot of their fried foods (1 salbute, 1 gamache, 2 panades), a Belizean style tamale called ducunu, and plantains. \n\nOut of all the foods in the platter I enjoyed the salbutes the most. It's similar to a Mexican tostada, but amped up 10 times! It was so crispy, light and slightly flaky and the beans, cheese + onions on top were perfect with it. The gamache had a thicker base, was more chewy than crispy, topped with meat, tomatoes and cheese. The panades are the Belizean equivalent of empanadas, but with a more tender dough, lightly crispy. One was filled with beans and the other with meat. I enjoyed the ducunu, a very moist sweet corn masa steamed in corn husks. \n\nService was friendly and attentive.\n\nI definitely want to come back and try more off their menu!\n\nBtw if you get the sampler platter you might get The Itis. In the battle of woman vs. food, this platter did a TKO on me from food coma when I got home!
