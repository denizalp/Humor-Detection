Absolutely don't recommend. A friend of mine recommended Sonny Gonzalez to me five years ago. He is quite a good salesman and visited my home. I was purchasing a new system and having a lot of rerouting duct work ect. This was a 9,000 dollar job. Sonny told me how he was going to put the vents near the exterior walls that will improve the cooling. Once they started the work they said they could not do that because there was not enough space in the roof to locate them. He knew it was a low roof line........ then one of the workmen put a hole in the roof and stepped through the roof. They blamed it on the wood. Henry, the manager said we will have to call the \"big dog\" in on this on referring to Sonny. Never heard from him. I called the office at least 8 times and spoke with his daughter. Sonny never called...... I eventually had to get the roof repaired on my own. \n\nI tried to forget this fellow who is quite proud to tell you about the home he has in Hawaii. The unit has never cooled exactly as the way he stated it would with the position of the air vents... So five years later I get a call on April 3 from his manager Henry. Henry stated he had my file and that my unit's warrant was due to expire on April 11 and they had a special for 39 bucks to do a service check on it. I told him what my experience with the firm was and he chuckled and  said they would not have ignored it and didn't understand why the owner Sonny did not call me back. \n\nHenry said he would give the file to Sonny when he came back from being out of town (my guess - Hawaii). I told him that I would check on the service with my wife and asked him to call me back on April 4 (Friday). Guess what - no phone call. Now, it is April 21, 2014, and my air conditioner has gone out..... and still no call from Sonny or Henry or anyone from Gonzalez.\n\nAbsolutely, I would recommend never to use this firm for any heating or air conditioning work. They are probably in Hawaii anyhow.
