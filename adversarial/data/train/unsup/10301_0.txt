These are hot dogs. Even the best hot dog on earth can't possibly be as good as, say, the median cheeseburger. And yes, you can get a cheeseburger at Ted's for a buck or two more, and they aren't awful. You can get lots of things that aren't awful. You can also get non-awful hot dogs by grilling them yourself at $1.25 for an eight-pack.\n\nUsually the onion rings are good. Disclaimer - I used to work at Ted's. As a starting employee, I wasn't even allowed to know what was in the onion ring batter. All I knew was that making them involved someone dressing up in a garbage bag, ostensibly to keep from getting covered in batter. Anywho, this time around, the onion rings weren't even cooked through. \n\nThis, despite the grill man's comment that the girl running the fryer was the best they had. \n\nThat's saying something. Kids would walk out on the job when they got put on fryer. It's a lot to handle, and you go home with a millimeter of reduced fry oil coating all parts of your body. Even the orifices. Especially the orifices. \n\nSo then, there is also a strange and outdated system of customer service that certainly requires more labor than is necessary. You'll see.
