I had heard a lot about this place so I was quite sure that I am going to love it! Finally went yesterday and I was not too impressed. This could be just me, but upon entering the place, I felt the heighten chaos and super loud music as an assault to my senses. We stood there confused for some time wondering how to order and where to go. We noticed a bunch of people with something like a line so we went and stood there... thankfully someone came to us and asked us if we knew about the ordering process. She explained how it works - you go in the line that you want something from (line 1, 2, or 3). But the problem is, for someone who does not know a lot of spanish terms, half of the items would not make sense unless they google it or ask what it means. I did not feel very comfortable asking about each and every item in such a chaotic rushed environment. I would have appreciated some kind of a hand-held menu with descriptions. There were a lot of people there who seemed to know what to do so again maybe I am the only one feeling the need for an explanation. \nFood was ok, I think I have had much more delicious tacos and tostadas in Las Vegas with much better ambience and presentation. Price was good but I don't think I will go back.
