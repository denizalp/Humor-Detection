A completely unforgettable meal.  And I truly mean that...I have no idea what I actually ate.  We were pretty hungry after the Zumanity show so we decided to stop in.  The only plus side was that we were able to dine outside and people watch.  While the food did not leave an impression, we had a great waiter.  Fast.  Quick to refill our water glasses.  Personable.
