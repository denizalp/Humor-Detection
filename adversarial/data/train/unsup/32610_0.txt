I read the reviews and I was thinking about just going with King Wah but I really didn't want to drive into Rocky River.  I'm glad I decided to orde.  The wonton soup was good, can't really mess that up, and the general tso chicken was pretty damn good.  Most places have a small piece of chicken covered in a pound of breading but this was nice whole chunks of chicken in a light breading.  The sauce was flavorful but not spicy enough, the gentleman said medium may be too spicy so I opted for mild.  I can handle spicy so next time we will probably do the medium! In all it was good food and don't let the negative reviews prevent you from trying!
