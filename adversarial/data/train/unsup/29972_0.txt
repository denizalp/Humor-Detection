I started going to this place in the late 90s!  The scrambled eggs and ham is supered. They had a special seasoning and the generous ham chunks taste like honey baked ham. Their Dutch babies are by far the best in town. Love the Swedish pancakes as well. \nFood is always good but service  is sometimes amazing and other times down right bad but the food outweighs the service.
