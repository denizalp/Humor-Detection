I was in the area and decided to eat here.  I used to work in the area so I came here all the time. They always have decent food here.  Usually the salad bar has a ton of options and is fresh but yesterday a lot of wilted, brown lettuce.  I barely ate anything off the plate.  They do have a nice taco salad station that is always good.   Nothing at the carving station but it was only 3:30.  They have that going on Sunday's and, I'm assuming for dinner.  I have been there once for Sunday brunch and there were more options, including top sirloin which was quite good. \n\nI have been there a few years ago and they did have the carving station going but not yesterday.  They used to have at least hamburgers and hot dogs but maybe I was to late yesterday but I did not leave hungry.
