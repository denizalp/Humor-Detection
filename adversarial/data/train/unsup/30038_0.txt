We went to Bonfyre to celebrate our anniversary and were not disappointed. It wasn't crowded for a Saturday night but then again we were there on the early side of the dinner rush. The staff were all courteous, the atmosphere is nice, and there was a good beer selection. The drink menu looked tasty as well, though we didn't try any on this visit. We had the cheese curds as an appetizer and they were AMAZING! Reminded me of the ones the Old Fashioned used to have until they changed their recipe. Somehow Bonfyre managed to make deep fried cheese seem....light and crispy? I would definitely go back just for the curds. I had fish tacos- mix of grilled and fried- and the fried ones were better. The crunch of the batter was a nice texture to contrast the other ingredients, while the grilled fish just blended in and gave the whole thing a little bit of a mushy texture. The sauce was tasty and had a nice kick to it, though. My husband had the jambalaya and it was very good, though somewhat spicy (a positive for us but I could see how it might be a little much if spicy isn't your thing). The menu had a lot of heavy, comfort food that sounded good if it weren't so hot out. We would definitely be up for returning in the winter and trying some of the other dishes. \n\nMeanwhile, hope the obviously drunk girl at the next table celebrating her 21st birthday with her parents had a good night! She definitely provided us with some quality people-watching while we ate!
