It's always fun to see what people in the 1970s thought the future would look like. It was also fun when me, my girlfriend and my sister nearly got into a fist fight with the concessions workers when we tried to buy corn dogs at an Expos game. Parking garage was overpriced, dark and depressing (in 1970s future EVERYTHING IS OPPRESSIVE AND CONCRETE)\n\nSupposedly the tower is the \"tallest inclined structure in the world\" or some bullshit made up height category that sounds like an award for World's Longest Limp Dick. \n\nAnd Youppi's a bitch.
