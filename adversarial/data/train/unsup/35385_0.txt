My two stars are for the manager only. I purchased on-line however never received a confirmation email. I called and was told to just show the purchasing card... I did this and they still couldn't find my tickets. The manager ended up walking us in (a little embarrassing bringing so much attention and negating the reason for online purchase). \nNow we're going to get the necessary munchies, because we have the munchie - being the devoted Yelper I am, I want to use an offer of 50% off any size popcorn from Yelp - when you click the offer you go to some promotional page that never connects to a code our super snotty cashier can't figure out. Hence, the manager is called again and another unnecessarily embarrassing encounter, that could've been handled so much better. \nHonestly, if you're a good manager and doing your job well, like this manager was but has a lazy, couldn't careless staff - he needs to clean house. Never again.
