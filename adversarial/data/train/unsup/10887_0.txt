Thank you, thank you, thank you Gabi K for taking us here! Excellent choice, and I will definitely request Chelsea's next time I come visit.\n\nWe arrived just after 11 and told the hostess we had a reservation, but she turned up her nose and said 1) they normally don't seat incomplete parties; and 2) they don't usually take reservations. Something must have quickly changed her mind, because she led us to a table in back. As noon came closer and closer, I soon understood her reasons...this place must be THE place to have lunch.\n\nWe were still stuffed from breakfast, but after taking a peek at the menu I forgot all about the egg sandwiches we sharing earlier. Appetizers, anyone? Why of course...let's have the ceviche! It was fresh, with a perfect balance of seafood and fresh avocado, lime and spices.\n\nFor an entree, I chose the grilled ahi tuna taco platter. It was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I felt a little bad for my table guests, because I rarely spoke as my mouth was full every time I looked up. The tuna couldn't have been cooked more perfect...and that chipotle aoili was UH-MAZING.\n\nI tried my hardest to finish and managed to somehow fit almost everything in my stomach. When the dessert menu came around, I reluctantly declined a sweet I think for the first time in my life. I'm still kicking my own arse for not sucking it up and sinking my fork into the shared red velvet cake (made fresh daily).\n\nThank gawd I was wearing a loose sundress that day is all I can say.
