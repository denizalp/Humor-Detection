I'm not sure what to say.\n\nI came here on 12\/21 for a on-fire sore throat that I had for four days.  Waited for about 10 minutes and was taken into the back.  The nurse took my vitals and placed me in a room.  The doctor came in, looked at my throat and determined that I had strep throat.  Now, I've never had strep throat, but I thought that you need to take a swab of your throat and do a test on it.  But whatevs.  I'm allergic to penicillin so he put me on Levaquin.\n\nBy 12\/25, I was breaking out in hives and on 12\/27 I headed back into UMC with hives and swelling all over my body.  The nurse taking my vitals asked why he gave me Levaquin.  I answered that I didn't know.\n\nThen I was put back into a room and a different doctor came in and asked why the previous doctor gave me Levaquin.  I answered \"i'm not sure, i'm not a doctor..haha!\"  So he put me on steriods, z-pack and some anti-itch medicine.\n\nOn 12\/29 my eyes were almost swollen shut, I was incredibly weak from not being able to keep down food.  So my husband took me to the ER and they gave me an IV full of steroids, pepcid, benadryl and something else.  They then gave me a prescription for prednisone, pepcid and told me to keep taking the z-pack and anti-itch medicine.\n\nWith the nurse and doctor at UMC questioning this doctor's prescription, makes me think that the doctor screwed up.  I guess that's why they call it \"medical practice?\"  I'm not totally mad, cause we didn't know that I was allergic to Levaquin, but it makes me think twice about going back to somewhere where other people are questioning what the doctor is doing.
