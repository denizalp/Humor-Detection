We've been here a few times. Either after a movie or just because it's close to home. I've never done a la carte I feel you get more out of AYCE. I love their coconut shrimp tempura and the iced green tea. Staff get our orders out to us pretty fast. I like the spicy edamame, the tempura veggies and everything shrimp. The Choco banana and the red bean ice cream are my favorite desserts.
