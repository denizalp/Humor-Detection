I have eaten here just twice.The owners are the rudest people on earth. Took over a  hour for a pizza to be made, when I asked to just pay for my drinks because I got tired of waiting, the old man started to scream and curse at me, banning me from the establishment.  \n\nThe other time I ate here I tried the pasta and it tasted frozen, not fresh. Didn't mention it at the time because I know chefs can have off days and wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe overall cleanliness of the restaurant is okay, saw some dirt and dust. \n\nOverall this place should be shut down and the owners need to attend a cooking class.
