I haven't eaten here since the change from Barmacie, but I did swing by after dinner recently and just loved the look and feel, the friendly service, and the affordable and dry and lovely glass of cava they had on the menu. We were able to cozy in with our friends who were already there, a kind person came and offered to tuck our coats away in the closet which made the small space feel not cramped. We were also able to order and pay promptly which helped since we were running to a show. \n\nThe lighting is soft and romantic, the vibe is just right for a chill date or a friend hang with intimate overtones, or for laughs on Laurier with new friends..
