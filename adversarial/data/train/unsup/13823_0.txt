I have been going to Magicuts monthly since I moved to Toronto in January.  It is a basic hair salon, with good hours.  They do not take appointments.  When you go in, you write your name on a signup sheet.  When it is your turn, the next available stylist will take you.  longest I have waited is about 30 minutes but a couple of times I have been taken care of right away.  To me, the risk of having to wait a bit is balanced out by the convenience of just being able to drop in after work whenever I feel like it.\n\nI have been there 5 times and have never had the same stylist.  That doesn't bother me, but I am a guy with short hair, and can easily tell the stylist what to do.  My wash and cut comes to about $20.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good place to go for a simple haircut.  If you are looking to really get to know your stylist and get special treatment, this might not be the best option.
