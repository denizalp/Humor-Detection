Worst customer service ever! We spent thousands of dollars over the years at this location. Last month we made a purchase for $1,700 half of it delivered and the other half we were told would come the following month. I noticed today that we didn't receive the remaining items that we should have received on Monday 8\/12\/18 today is 8\/14\/18 (being 8 months pregnant completely forgot) called today and a female answered I advised her that I should have received my delivery on Monday and noticed we didn't. She responded with \"and now your calling\" with major attitude.. I said excuse me what kind of question is that let me speak with someone else. I was so dumbfounded by her rude response.. she said I'm the only one here I told her she's horrible at her job and she hung up .. I called again and she acted like she was the manager and put me on hold and hung up again .. I called again and acted like nothing happened. Will never spend another penny at this store and will be getting a corporate complaint. The fact that I was so nice and didn't mind it being late and she was so rude and kept hanging up. Being a big corporation u would think they would train their employees with decent customer service
