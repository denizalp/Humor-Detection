I'll admit it... I quite often end up at Drais for some late night dancing after the regular clubs. I belive Drais opens at 12 AM and closes at 10 or 12 PM the next day, i could be wrong. This past weekend we showed up....a few hours before the sun rose and it was SO PACKED...A friend we were with ended up shoving several 20$ bills into the hands of a security guard before they let us in.....Are they allowed to do that? They must make so much money working the door there. \n\nAlthough I was happy we were let in...we had to pay cover to! I had to shell out another $20 on my own.... That was a little dissapointing as well. We walked in, grabbed a few drinks and danced the night away for another few hours. It was really fun and they had a great DJ. \n\nWhen we left, the sun was up....just another day in vegas. \n\nMy recommendation: Make sure you bring cash and the earlier you get there, the better chance you have of getting in.
