While looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night after had just arrived from the airport, we ended up here.  How bad can it be? Its a burger joint.  I opted for a small burger, perfect size for me and cooked the way I wanted.  Service was fast which we were happy about since we were so hungry.  Not bad for a quick meal, fast and affordable.
