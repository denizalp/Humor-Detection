I was here at Lazer Quest (35th Ave & Peoria) for a B day party. You can choose you battle name before you enter the arena. I chose TRUMP. After all he is the President of the United States. They said no way! I said he is our President. They said no chance. We can't honor our leader and our country? Let's unify! Support America! This is bigger than all of us. Let's grow up. Set a good example for the children. Please don't breed hate. Be proud. You get to run your business because we are free. Denouncing The President denounces America, which jeperdizes our freedom.  Laser Quest don't forget how good you have it. How does what you are doing look to those who are watching.  God bless. Such a disappointment!!
