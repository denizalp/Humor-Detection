Use to love coming here every week with my boyfriend. They had the best bartender, who took our orders even if we weren't sitting at the bar. He moved to another bar few months back. But man ever since he left, that place is not the same. They have new servers every time I go in there. One time we had to remind the server 2 times about silverware, ranch, and our drinks. Oh and also if we could change the tv from a high school hockey game to a real game that was on that night. He clearly forgot about it. So when our food finally came, we slowly ate until the ranch came. He took 15 minutes to get ranch and our food wasn't even good anymore.. When he brought the ranch over, he ended up dropping it on the ground on accident right at our table. Couldn't help clean it up, because we had no silverware or napkins. Not the greatest experience.
