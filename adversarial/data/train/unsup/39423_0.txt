Sister was driving through the area and heard pretty good things about this place, so we decided to try it out. We had to order take out since my sister needed to get back on the road. She got the Farmer's Omelette and I got the Meat Lover's Omelette. They were both pretty tasty; the home fries were delicious; and the toast was good. However, it wasn't anything spectacular or out of the ordinary. It was good diner food though; I liked it.
