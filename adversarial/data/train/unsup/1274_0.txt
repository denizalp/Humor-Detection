We settled on two sandwiches. The brisket sandwich (first item on the menu) and the steak, onions plus mushroom sandwich. They were fresh, fresh, fresh. Made with top quality ingredients.\n\nTo complete the meal, we ordered a funnel cake to split; surprising it tasted great! Size was not as big as Wonderland's but enough to get your fix on the off season when Wonderland is closed. Too bad they follow the pay by the weight model for toppings but I suppose it's there to control costs.
