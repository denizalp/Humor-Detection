Do you watch that show 'Portlandia'? If so, then you're already familiar with this place. Not because the restaurant itself is featured in the show (it's not), but because this restaurant is the sort of place that they're always poking tongue-in-cheek fun of. It's hipsterish, it's a wee bit self-important, and you'll come up on phrases like 'hand-crafted' a LOT, but the simple fact of the matter is that they've got DAMNED good food, some DAMNED good coffee, a DAMNED friendly staff, and DAMNED adequate seating.\n\nWe came here for brunch (oh shut up) and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. You *ARE* going to be surrounded by Caucasian hipsters with children named Schuyler and Harrison, but that shouldn't turn you off too much. This place has gotten some good buzz lately, and I'm thinking that they'll probably just get more and more crowded in the coming months. That's why you need to get out there RIGHT NOW and enjoy some good food and good coffee, so when you take your friends with you you can be all like:  \n\n\"Oh yeah you know I used to come here all the time before it was popular\"\n\nAnd you'll be a better person for it.
