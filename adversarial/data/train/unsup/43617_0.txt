Please people do NOT get ripped off by these guys. Came and said our blower motor was bad on our system. Then told us it was going to be 1,100 bucks to fix it. When I asked how much the labor was and how much parts were the technician couldnt tell me. They carry a book with various prices to fix different HVAC systems. The page they show you will have the name of the problem and just a price. RED FLAG !!!\nThis is like 600 bucks overpriced based on our model and tons efficiency etx. Dont get jacked up. These guys are rip off artists!
