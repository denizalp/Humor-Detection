Cute spot! I wanted to try this place for a while and was finally in the neighborhood! I'm born and raised from LI New York and am a bit of a pizza snob! The spot reminds me of a pizzeria from back home (love that they have slices available and even have Sicilian slices!) Tony greeted us and made my BF and I feel very welcomed! He treated us to the free garlic knots as we waited for our food to come out uhm hello who does that? Love that and they were tasty to boot! \n\nWe ordered a small spaghetti and meatball along with a large half cheese half pepp pizza! Everything was solid! I will say to me NY pizza crust is a bit thicker but was good! Meatballs were hardy and the sauce with it was good, little sweeter. \n\nOverall great staff everyone was very friendly and tasty food! Btw prices are very reasonable for the good food! Would recommend if you're in the area! Will be back for sure!
