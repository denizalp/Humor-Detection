Came here a while back craving something sweet and i must say the crepes are quite delicious. The sweetness had a perfect balance that was not too overwhelming. Unfortunately, the drinks looked more appealing than they tasted and were a little bit below my expectations.\nThe service was very friendly and the restaurant had was simple and clean. Other than that, I definitely look forward to coming back here again.
