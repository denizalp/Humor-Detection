Spare rib was perfectly cooked, but under-seasoned. The Peruvian-style grilled octopus was to die for. Proficient cocktails - decent beer selection. Nice decor, though a little on the dark side, so visibility was tough for some of my older comrades. There was a good view of the casino, if you're in to that sort of thing.
