I had not been to a ihop in a while and was pleasantly surprised at tonight's experience. Our waiter, Luan, was great!  He was extremely friendly and made the whole experience pleasant. The food was very good as well.  I had a great hamburger with avocado and my husband had breakfast.  I assume his was great too as he cleaned his plate.
