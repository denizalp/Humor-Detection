Brought 7 girl friends to celebrate a bachelorette dinner at Sonata's Restaurant couple of weekends ago and unfortunately I am not super impressed considering the price range of their entree's were on the high range. The ambiance was cozy and artistic, there were beautiful decors all through out the restaurant and the singer was really nice. \n\nOur group ordered a little bit of everything - our most favorite was the Pork Shashlik. The meat was tender and juicy, the aroma of the jasmin rice was incredible and the portioning was just right. \n\nOur least favorite was the Smoked Pork Belly confit. The fat and grease was just too much. It tasted bland and the fat just melted like oil in our tongue. (Mind you, this is not the first time we've had pork belly. We eat pork fat almost with everything).\n\nThe smoked beef stroganoff and chicken kieve was okay - it had nothing special about it. \n\nThe most frustrating part was our server being too slow. We came in at 9pm and the crowd wasn't so busy so we were hoping to get fast service yet he still took a while in taking our order, serving us drinkings and checking on us. \n\nOur overall experience was okay but I don't think we will be coming back anytime soon.
