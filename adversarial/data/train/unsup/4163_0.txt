First time visit. The place was bright, clean and very well stocked. I wish I knew more about Indian food. I probably would have had a better appreciation for the place if I knew what half the items were. I popped in for Tahini but strolled through the isles for a better understanding of the place. \n\nThey seemed to offer quite a bit of staple items, dairy and frozen foods. The fresh produce section was tucked in the back and quite small. I will say this however, they had Okra, at least that's what it looked like, that was so large, it was on the verge of being obscene. It made me giggle. Had the very nice employee not been strolling along with me, I would have snapped a photo. \n\nI think I will educate myself a little more on Indian cuisine and then venture back in. Hell, even if I don't educate myself, I'll go back for the Okra alone. hehe.
