This was a huge let down. I ordered this along with some co-workers that recommended over Hong Kong Asian Cuisine where I usually order from. I will never stray from Hong Kong Asian Cuisine as this was the worst Lo Mein I have ever had. The noodles were some flat noodle with no sauce or seasoning and could not even take more than a few bites. The fried rice that came with my orange chicken was just brown rice with peas in it. The Orange Chicken was the one saving grace so i had something to choke down but I would never eat here again.
