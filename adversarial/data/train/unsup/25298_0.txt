Went on a Fri evening ... Lots of ppl and got seated after 15 minutes. Place had lots of seat and the ambience was ok.  Ordering by checking items on a booklet was different but kinda effective.  Ordered maybe 20 items right away and the food was good... Salmon Sahimi was very fresh and grilled items was good.   Lots of shrimp choices.   Pop was $2.50 with free refills so that's a negative.  Food was good but other sushi places have more selections.
