I ate breakfast here with a dining companion this past Saturday.  Upon entering the restaurant it is easy to see that it is set up like the classic diner including the counter.  Around the restaurant are classic photos from when the area used to be West View Park that my dining companion and I enjoyed looking at.\n\nHaving been here once before to get a hand-spun milkshake many years ago, I once again ordered one even though it was breakfast time.  It was as good as I remembered it and was generously portioned since I was able to twice fill up my drinking cup from the metal cup that was placed at my table.  For my entree I ordered an omelette that was filled with swiss cheese and kielbasa.  Once again the portion was generous and it came with two pieces of toast and a side of hash browns.  All of it tasted good and by the end I was forcing it down in order to clean my plate.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back to Isaly's in the future.  The amount of food that you get for the cost is tremendous and even though I am too young to have even been to West View Park, the pictures were great.
