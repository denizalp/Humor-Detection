Sadly, my experience with them was not quite close as the fairy tale stories mentioned in here. The hairstylist was not able to get my haircut the way it supposed to and she needed to go back and ford with some of the colleagues for help without success.  The owner was finally able to come and help and get my hair fixed and also she did not charge me. I can see why they have a lot of good reviews but I would also like to share that my experience was not the best.
