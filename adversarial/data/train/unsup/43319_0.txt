I went to try to have my son's picture taken on 3 separate occasions- the first time the camera was \" not working properly\" which we were informed as we were looking at pictures that were either super dark or washed out, off center and completely astetically unappealing- and wasted mine and my husbands time. \nOn the second occasion, the flash was not working- the employee had us wait for an hour while he tried to fix it and we ended up rescheduling yet again waiting precious time. \nThe third occasion at attempting these pictures, my husband was unable to come with us. I ended up reluctantly purchasing the pictures on this visit because I was trying to have some pictures to mark my son being 1 1\/2. The pictures are a hot mess. The employee didn't turn the camera or focus the lense- the pictures are either way too zoomed in or there is way too much back ground. They are out of focus. Hot mess would adequately describe them. \nI regret purchasing the pictures just to have SOMETHING of my son. \nIronically I had been to this location the first time when my son was 9 months old and the girl who took our pictures was fantastic. We actually had good experience. Until after when we didn't receive one of the products I ordered. I sill to this day can not for the life of me get a manager or someone to return my call regarding this matter!
