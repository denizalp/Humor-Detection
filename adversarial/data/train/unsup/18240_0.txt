Didn't come here to drink, so my review isn't based on the \"Tap\" part of the Tremont Tap House. \n\nWe came a while ago (last summer?) and sat outside. The atmosphere is pretty nice, but I found that, while the food was good, it was overpriced for the quantity, which is something I encounter a lot with these trendy restaurants. \n\nUltimately though, our server - a youngish man who I've tried to forget - was the biggest a$$hole I think I've ever had wait on me at a restaurant. It's unfortunate for the tap house, because in spite of the pleasant atmosphere and good food, the waiter left such a bad taste in our mouths we have no intention of going back. For a tap house it comes across as a little pretentious.
