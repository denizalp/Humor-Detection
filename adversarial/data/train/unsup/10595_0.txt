Authentic russian\/ukrainian food, noone speaks a word of english here, food is left under hotlamps for hours, and rice is generally rock hard when I ordered it. I'd avoid eating here, but thats because I'm not Russian\/Ukrainian. If youre from the Urals, go for it, its just like your babushka used to make it, but if you're a mange-cake, stick with Tim Hortons.
