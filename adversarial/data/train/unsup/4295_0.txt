Nope. Should not take 2.5-3 hours to do an oil change. I shouldn't have to make an appointment for something that should only take 15-30 mins. I understand it's Saturday but that should make you move a little faster since you'd expect to see more people. My husband said he only counted 2 maybe 3 mechanics working. Note to self. I won't be back.
