I am a doughnut fan so when I saw this shop, I just had to stop in.  We were on our way to have dinner at Carson Kitchen next door.  Dropped in here to buy some dessert for later!  We made it about 15 minutes before they were to close.  It was slim pickings.  Purchased two doughnuts from what was left.  \n\nApple Bacon Fritter ($2.25)  Tasted like it was a day old or older.  Not impressed at all.\n\nMaple bacon creme filled ($2.25)  Do not remember the exact name of this doughnut.  I do remember that it did not taste that great either.\n\nThe shop itself did look good.  The service was fine.  I would return here, if I was in the neighborhood.  There is a good chance that my timing here was just awful because it was almost closing time.  Mornings are always better times to frequent doughnut shops.  Til then, though, just two stars.
