$1 bowling and shoe rentals after midnight!  A dollar, how is that even possible?  In New York, one game is like a bezillion dollars and bowling three requires a mortgage and a kidney as down payment.  \n\nI had a great time bowling here.  The group in the lane next to me was living it up with shots of Midori and Mountain Dew and feeling no pain.  The lane to the left of us had two guys practicing for the pro tour.  And then there was me in my \"I Don't Give a Hoot\" t-shirt having an awesome time.
