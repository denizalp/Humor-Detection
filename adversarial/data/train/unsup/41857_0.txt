I work uptown, and was out at lunch walking around and wanted a quick bite before returning to the office.\n\nthis was my first time and menu looked interesting and saw the words 'fresh', 'natural'.  so instead of a salad, I wanted to try the burger and fries.\n\nthe line wasn't long at all when I arrived, so I figured, within 10 min. I should get my order.  it took 20 minutes for my order to be ready!\n\nHamburger was pretty good, no complaints.  but fries were the WORSE I've had.  soggy, cold, NOT cooked!  disappointing!\nI would give another try by ordering a salad next time.
