I went to this restaurant with a group of friends and I have to say I really enjoyed the food. I had the steamed buns with the pulled pork and it was very tasty just enough spice and the mango slaw and mayo added lots of flavor. I also had the Cemita burger with sweet potato fries. This steak burger was awesome! My steak was well done and with the combo of black bean, avocado and pickled onion it was very flavorful. The sweet potato fries were amazing with just enough crisp to them. I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a Caribbean restaurant just because they have a few jerk dishes on the menu but I would definitely recommend the Cemita! I did have the pomegranate mai tai which many reviews raved about but I didn't really enjoy it and neither did my friend. It wasn't as sweet as described and it was too strong for my liking. Overall great ambiance, great for friends and if you go definitely try the Cemita!
