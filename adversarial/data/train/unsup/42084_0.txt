First off, the location is in a gas station, but don't let it deter you. It's clean, and everyone who works there is friendly enough. I was on a business trip, and I checked Yelp for the best Mexican food in the area. To be honest, as nice as everyone was, I've has much better food. Tortilla's were dry, and I hate that on tacos. I feel like the meat tasted like the grill hadn't been cleaned in a while, or maybe it's just really old. Beans weren't great, but maybe my expectations are too high, as my favorite are my grandmas. Either way, the line was insanely long, for how average the food was. I traveled a bit to try it as well. I'm from Chicago, and I've had better Mexican food here. I don't like when owners are really high on their Yelp page either. The guy, Ben, seemed to want to assure people spoke to him before they posted on Yelp. I don't like that. You can make something right, but a review is a review, and it's based on first impressions. Mine wasn't great, but it seems like he's able to convince everyone else to talk to him before posting, as they have almost no bad reviews.
