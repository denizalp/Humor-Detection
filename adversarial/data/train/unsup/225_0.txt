This place is firkin great !!!! \n\nLocation:  *****amazing view right by the lake. I always go for a walk when I eat here.  It has a big spacious patio. Pet lovers can bring their small pups and tie them on the other side of the fence.  There is a smokers area outside, I don't like the smoke so I sit away from that area.  You can see the city lights and walk the path. You get the city beauty without having to go through the parking and people pollution. It's a nice calm area with friendly happy peeps. \n\nFood: **** It's delicious and well prepared. The nacho plate is huge and you can add on guac. The toppings are fresh and plenty. Just no queso but that's my thing maybe. The chorizo tacos are yummy. You get 2! I'm a shorter person but it filled me up!  I've also had their basa fish. Fish was yummy but a tad bit on the salty side.  But not to worry I had the watermelon refresher!!!! Always a favourite and always hits the spot.  My friends ordered the Caesar and on Sunday you get to dress up your own Caesars with olives, pickled onions, etc etc.  \n\nService: *** to ****.  They can get busy and forget you sometimes. But hey, you can stare into the lake in the meanwhile and sip on it booze!!!  \n\nBathroom and decor: clean, British, classy and fun. All in all great spot.
