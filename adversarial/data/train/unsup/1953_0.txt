Carniceria...panaderia...pescaderia...if you're looking for something that can be found in a spot ending in \"-eria\", Ranch Market won't let you down. \n\nI personally come here for the seafood, as it's my favorite spot to get fish and shrimp for tacos. Their tortillas, both the corn and especially flour (estilo SONORA), are delicious. \n\nIf you're a carnivore, you're gonna be in heaven when you see the meat aisle. \n\nEven more importantly...spices! There are so many. And not just for Latin American dishes, but Middle Eastern stuff as well. This aisle alone is better than any other grocery store out there. \n\nThere are two things I can knock them down a star for. The first is produce Although they've got some Latino staples here, I find the quality of a lot of fruits and veggies questionable. Yes, I understand Americans need to get over ugly produce and stop throwing away a zillion pounds of it every year. But it's harder to stomach when you peer over at a tub of oranges and they're all green. Yes, they turned out to be delicious, and maybe I am totally in the wrong for feeling squeamish. It just feels like all that disposable produce is just shipped here exclusively. It rubs me the wrong way. The second is the booze. The selection is bad, and the pricing is even worse! I've seen better deals at convenience stores. \n\nSo while not perfect, this market is for everyone. You take pride in living in the southwest, so start eating like it.
