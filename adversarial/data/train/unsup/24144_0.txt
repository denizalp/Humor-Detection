If you're looking for outstanding service don't bother. Charlie's is a dive diner literally located in the corner of a parking lot. The building is small, seats 10-15 tops, please dont sneeze the place might collapse.\n\nThe regulars have their seats there. My first visit there I apparently sat in one of those seats. Prior to even getting a cup of coffee the cook came out and told me to stand up. I did, she then took the seat off the post. I wasn't going to argue, she was a beast and could probably kick my ass.\n\nThe food is good diner food and its cheap. Just ask permission before you sit down.
