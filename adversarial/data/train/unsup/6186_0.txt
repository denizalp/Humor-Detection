Went here yesterday to experience what it's like in an indoor waterpark. Overall it was nice except everyone had to exit the water not once but TWICE. Let's just say not everyone swimming doesn't have bladder control. Anyways, food\/snacks are surprisingly cheap with a decent menu. Can't imagine what it's like in the summer. Admission is cheap to (especially if you're a county resident).
