It was..... unforgettable.   But not for anything awesome.   Corny, hair-metal, creepy, dark, sorta Christmas-ish, stage show with hair whipping, lasers, flames, tigers and dragons.  (Yes. Dragons)  Sounds like it should be a giant stocking stuffed with awesome.   Yeah...not so much.  That said, you'll be talking about this mess for years to come.
