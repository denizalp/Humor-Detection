This a great facility, with a great selection of exercise machines, free weights a basketball court, lap pool, hot tub, indoor track, steam room, sauna, locker room with showers - all sorts of good stuff. Trainers to go with it all, too. I've been a member for years, and expect to be hanging out here for years to come.
