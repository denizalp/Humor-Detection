I visited this restaurant last month while on a business trip, and needless to say I think it's really gone downhill.\n\nI found a large centipede in my salad.\nIt was so gross, I threw up a little in my mouth.\n\nI will never, ever, ever come back to this establishment ever again.\n\nI mean really, how does a centipede even get in my salad?  How is that possible?  I don't even think centipedes eat salad.\n\nGrossness.\nThe end.
