--Service was slow...no refills, never checked back, had to wait for check.\n\n--pizza was pretty good. Crispy toppings.\n\n--Parking was not too bad. Park around the corner.\n\n--Too bad for the awful service here! Maybe they need to switch to placing your order at the counter with a cashier and get rid of the food servers.
