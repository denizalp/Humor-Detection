I've been to the \"Orbiting the Mat, Suspension Style\" class multiple times now through ClassPass and every single one has been great! The instructor, Chelsie, is super friendly and makes the experience feel personalized. The studio itself is beautiful and clean, with a nice view of Walnut street. A great low-impact full body workout!
