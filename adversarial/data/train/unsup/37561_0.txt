Nice Panera location with a variety of seating options. For late afternoon it wasn't very busy, and the pastry case was still pretty full.\n\nThe Almond Croissant was amazing as always, and the Cinnamon Crunch Scone was moist and delicious - like fall in a pastry! It would have been better warmed up, but the employees didn't offer that option oddly.
