Better than expected\n\nYes, I know, that is a terrible title for a review but will hopefully make sense as you read on.\n\nMy wife and I stayed at Harrah's recently and specifically did not go to Toby's restaurant the first evening because of other Yelp reviews; however, after a long night of gambling, we were hungry and didn't want to wander all over town so we went upstairs for a snack and a couple of drinks.\n\nWe sat at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. The menu is interesting. The Cowboy Ruben sandwich I ordered was really good. And there was pretty good live entertainment. We had a good time. Good enough that we went back for lunch (pretty good soups and salads) the next day before heading home.\n\nThis is not a 5 star restaurant. It is a bar and grill and if you go in with the right attitude I think you may be pleasantly surprised.\n\nCan't say we loved it but we certainly liked this bar and grill. Think he'll rewrite the song?
