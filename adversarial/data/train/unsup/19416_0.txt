I was a patient at aurora and I can honestly say every single person there is treated like some sort of convict. Kids are singled out and yelled at in front of others if they make a mistake, most of the staff is incredibly rude, and the features they say they provide (group therapy, art\/music therapy, yoga) does not exist. We spent much of the time that was supposed to be in groups in our rooms and were yelled at every time we wanted to go out. When a kid would freak out, the staff would merely try to help them and even shut the door on this girl that was screaming because she was so upset. Most of the staff don't try to communicate with the patients, they just yell at them to get in line or go to their rooms. It's not a very good place to go if you have depression of any kind, because you're treated like dirt and the staff doesn't provide anything for the kids that act out. Overall, the program is very misleading and the staff is very unprofessional (one male nurse told me that my stepmom was \"smoking hot\") . They need to improve immediately before any more kids are sent here.
