Although it was like a bait and switch on the room, I ended up having a nice stay.\n\n I found a room rate of $21 plus $36 resort fee on hotels.com.  Once I checked in I was told the room was in a older section of the hotel in the motel styled building and I'd have to walk over to that building. I agreed to the upgrade fee of $12 to stay in the West Tower, so the room came up to about $70 per nite.  \n\nSince I was upgrading, I requested a room with a view and was given one of the top of the Adventuredome, some air conditioning units and a partial view of the strip (room 16803).  My room was at the end of the hallway and very quiet.  I didn't hear people in the hallways and other than when the maid cleaned the room across from mines, it was very serene.\n\nThere was no ice machine on my floor, but there are vending machines.  The ice machine is on the 15th floor.\n\nThere is no fridge or microwave in the rooms, so when I thought about $70 a night, I probably could have gotten a few more frills for the same price at a different hotel.  \n\nForget finding anything on the TV, most of the channels were news or hotel related or the Spanish channel.  They don't have USA but they have TNT and TBS\n\nThere is a Starbucks and Krispy Kreme inside the hotel along with several other stores and souvenir shops.\n\nI visited the pool twice.  Mainly I wanted to use the hot tub, they only have one, and each time I went to the hot tub it was packed with kids.  I can't believe that parents were not making their kids behave in the hot tub.  They were swimming, splashing water on others and one kid was even spitting over the side.  I was able to give myself a quick aqua fitness class in the pool, so its not a total loss, but keep in mind, this hotel hosts a ton of kids and people don't make their kids understand hot tubs are for relaxing.\n\nElevators were timely my entire stay and I never waited more than a minute for one. \n\nBed was clean and comfortable, but I noticed after taking a shower, the floor had water everywhere, so there was some sort of leak in the tub. \n\nVery busy hotel, but staff was polite when giving directions.  I stopped a lady one morning and asked if t was possible to walk to the convention center, and she explained it was, but, also 113 degrees, so she wouldn't recommend me walking.  I took out walking and about 15 minutes later arrived at the convention center drenched in my own sweat, and thankful I had brought a bottle of water before I started walking. \n\nRequested a 5am wake up call and received it at 4:50am, but better early than late.\n\nI was alone, so I didn't visit the arcades or play rooms, but I can honestly say I didn't see one sad face my entire visit. \n\nSorta disappointing because my uber driver says $60 hookers hit the hotel up at night, so I was hoping to see a real Vegas prostitute, but none were noticeable to me.
