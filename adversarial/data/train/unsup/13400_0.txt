Inferior!\n\nInferior!\n\nInferior to Chipotle, I say!\n\nCurrito isn't bad for a mall food court burrito place, but the burritos themselves are INFERIOR. Firstly, the \"classic\" burrito only comes with pinto beans, not black beans, which I find offensive on so many levels (Why can't ya'll serve BLACK beans? 'Cause they're BLACK??? Hmph.) And the burrito was as bland as Qdoba's. The tomato chunks were much too big, which, I guess, is supposed to signal that they're chopped by hand, but choking on a tomato bit is not my choice of a way to die. \n\nTo top off my experience, the servers were champion space cadets. No greeting or any dressing to our verbal exchange... except for the guy who made my burrito, who whispered to me, \"For here or to go, sexy? You look good...\"\n\n\"For here, thanks,\" I said. \n\nThanks for the burrito, sir. If it weren't for your wonky eye and the fact that you whispered the catcall instead of saying it out loud like you've got balls, I might have entertained you.\n\nHA! Yeah right...
