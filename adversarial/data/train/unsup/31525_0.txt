The office is beautiful, peaceful and clean. When you walk in, a big glass waterfall greets you. You can tell they went out of their way to help calm their customers for what can be an anxious visit. Didn't have to wait at all and Dr. Flores was very nice and personable. I loved the hygienist, Jaycie, too. There was no discomfort with my cleaning and she was very sweet too. The best part- they have a digital x ray machine so you don't have to have those awful films gaging you in your mouth. It is simple as biting on a little stick and the machine does the work. Of note, when  I walked in the front staff was on break and Dr. Flores was watching the desk and answering the phone. I think that is great! He is not pretentious and a team player. Overall, I would say this was a perfect dentist visit and I'll be back!
