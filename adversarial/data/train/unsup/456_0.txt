When I was leaving Las Vegas I needed a massage BADLY.  The stress and tension of moving was really getting to me.  I'm a supporter of local businesses and not chains (a.k.a Massage Envy), so I thought I'd give this place a try.\n\nI needed the most intense massage there was, so I opted for the deep tissue, and hot stone massage.  Oh my God, this was the best massage I have ever gotten in my life.  The owner, Joandra, is a sweetie and she makes you feel so comfortable.\n\nThere's nothing like a deep tissue, and hot stone massage combined.  At $80 an hour, it was pretty reasonably priced for the level of service and attention that I received.  If you just get a one hour Swedish, Deep Tissue or Hot Stone I think the price is only $50.  If you need a massage GO HERE, you'll be glad you did!
