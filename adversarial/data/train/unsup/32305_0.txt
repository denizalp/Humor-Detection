I live two blocks from here and just ate here for the first time yesterday. The owner was so nice and made the most delicious falafel sandwich for for me. Very vegan friendly too!! Everything is made from scratch with fresh ingredients. I'll definitely be frequenting the spot more often! Support this small, locally owned spot!
