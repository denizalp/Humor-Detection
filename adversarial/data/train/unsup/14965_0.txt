Great spaces to walk around between flights during layovers. Just don't get lost or accidentally leave then have to go back through security. The tsa officers are absolutely rude. When I corrected him on how to say my name the ingrate responded with \"whatever\". It's not pronounced seen! I've never seen a man in his 50's say that and act that rudely. Oh well, ces la vie.
