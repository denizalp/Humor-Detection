... Be afraid\n\n... Be very afraid\n\nLike seriously... Botulism and flesh eating bacteria plots to over take this nasty place at night. Together they ooze under the meat coolers where drippings fall and pool to rot and then they team up with the worms in the bean bins to further their filth rein of terror.\n\nUnless you're looking for a quick weight loss plan involving painful bouts of explosive diarrhea and anti-fungal and anti-parasitic  medications while you suffer from lock jaw and god only knows what else, steer clear and pay the extra buck or two per order to obtain clean, safe food from another grocer.\n\nConvenience does not equal safety.
