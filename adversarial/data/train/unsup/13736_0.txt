FIRST!\n\nMaja Indian Cuisine opened last Friday, Nov 14th.  To much great fanfare for new cuisine in the Bloor East 'hood, there was a long lineup around lunch hour. I waited about 15 minutes, as they were still getting into gear of serving a ravenous Indian nomming crowd.\n\nDespite their being new to the lunch crowd game, I patiently stood in line chatting up a few strangers ahead and behind me, trying to figure out what I wanted to have for lunch.  After those brief conversations, I had decided upon the Thali, which included a delicious medley of Indian cuisine involving Lamb curry, Chicken Tikka, naan, chickpeas, salad, and a delicious rice pudding - I was really impressed since I'm not even really into dessert!\n\nIn total, the damage was $11.30 including taxes.  Upon taking to the task of devouring my gargantuan Indian lunch (pls see pix), I had to loosen my belt a notch and just mellow out a half an hour before attempting anything productive.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised of how good the quality of the food is at Maja, I just hope the keeping what they do for the long run and dishing out amazing Indian cuisine.  I can only imagine they'll get better over time...
