This place is cheap and dirty. \n\nMy work comes here for breakfast 3 times a year and the place always leaves me feeling sick to my stomach. I don't think it's food poisoning but a normal person cannot handle that much grease. After learning my lesson a couple times with their traditional breakfast or omlette, I have switched my order to a bagel and fruit bowl which is only mildly better. I usually find a few pieces of over ripe fruit in the mix.\n\nThis place is somewhere I'd never choose to go on my own, but if all you're looking for is the absolute cheapest option, you may have found your place because the portions in the breakfasts are a decent size.\n\nAnyway, my recommendation would be to skip this place unless you love your grease served with a little egg and bacon. YUCK!
