Despite the funky smell and super tacky decor, we decided to give this place a try. I was looking for a good soft corn tortilla taco. I ordered the carne asada taco with the citrus slaw and cajun. My husband ordered the nachos with chicken. My dinner was really good. I loved the slaw and the meat was flavorful. I would eat it again. My husbands nachos were gross. Super hard chips and rubbery chicken! You could tell it was frozen then heated. It was not fresh at all. They didn't put the jalape√±os on the nachos either. I would not recommend the nachos at all. The service was good except the cashier didn't know anything about the food because \"he doesn't eat red meat.\" I felt like I was in a 7th grade boys locker room with all the skate board memorabilia and the stickers all over the tables an walls. So all in all, my taco was good but I don't think I would rave about the place.
