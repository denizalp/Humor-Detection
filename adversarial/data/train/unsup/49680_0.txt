Martino's Pizza offers a tasty variety of pizza slices, but don't underestimate their Asian dish selection! Even their spaghetti and meatballs leave something to remember.\n\nThey offer a decently priced lunch specials and are able to cook the meals fresh in a matter of minutes. I highly recommend trying their Pad Thai and Lemongrass chicken dishes.\n\nFor dinner they offer the same dishes at a higher price (after 3pm), but to compensate they add extra ingredients to your meal such as peppers and other veggies.
