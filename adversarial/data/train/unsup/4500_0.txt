Absolutely fantastic!!!  I loved everything about this restaurant.  I ordered the 8oz American Kobe Rip Cap and it literally melted in my mouth!  Granted it was 64 bucks but I can understand why.  They start you out with fries fried in duck fat, soooo yummy!  We also ordered some oysters and mac and cheese.  Both were also very good.  The service is beyond excellent.  One of my dinner companions did not like his Kobe Burger so they took it off the bill without us even asking.  I would highly recommend coming here for a fancy dinner.
