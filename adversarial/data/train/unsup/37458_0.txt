Not bad at all! Basil Box brings a Thai twist to the 'healthy food in a box' concept trumpeted by the likes of iQ, Kupfert, Fresh, and others. I liked it! I had the five spice steak box with a chilled noodles base, penang curry (spicy) sauce, lemongrass corn, sweet potatoes and crushed peanuts. It was much more exciting than a typical salad box, I thought :) Although I wasn't blown away by the steak, I thought the portion I received ($10.67 after-tax, if I recall) was well-worth the price. It took me about an hour to slowly gobble down the gargantuan box of noodles, and the curry sauce gave it a nice kick! The server (Denzel) was very friendly, and I enjoyed picking my base and toppings Subway-style through a little assembly line where you have a pretty decent selection before you. Not to mention the place itself is very large for a restaurant in the Square and there is plenty of seating (including comfy booth seating, with huge windows nearby) if you prefer to dine-in. Nice option for lunch, and if you are a Ryerson student I hear there's a discount that may be worth making use of :)
