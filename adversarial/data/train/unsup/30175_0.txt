My first time visiting Tea Fusion I tried the KumQuat tee. Delicious!!!! It has a orange & lime citrus flavor. It was so refreshing I came back the following day & ordered a Lychee Tea & Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef sandwich). The sandwich was light & refreshing. I sat at a window seat, ate & people watched. \n\nThis is definitely a nice place to visit if you want a light bite to eat.
