This event was average, just ok. Nothing special, although I did expect special considering it was $100 per ticket. It was semi-small, without the variety of amazing food and drinks that I expected. Yes of course there were a few that stood out more than others. But with Vendors such as N9NE, Mastro's Ocean Club, Capital Grille, and Roy's, that sets the bar pretty high. There better be SOMETHING GOOD. \n\nI will break it down, Pros & Cons. \n\nPros:\n\nA gift bag with Paul Mitchell products for VIP guests. \n\nMastro's sea bass. The best thing I tasted all night. I went back for seconds, and maybe even thirds. \n\nThe weather. (luck)\n\nThe frequent hand washing stations. Although they were not used much, at least we had the option. \n\nThe alcohol variety. (not to be confused with quality) I enjoyed that there was way more than wine. I actually expected more wine! I was not impressed with the selection of semi-cheap wine, mostly all reds. I was, however impressed with the rumchata, the bloody marys, the cucumber mint drink, and the martinis. Patron even had a booth. Some would say the $100 was worth the open bar samples alone. \n\nCons:\n\nSliders from four booths and chicken wings from two. Yes, those are easily hand held foods, I get it. But to the people in charge- we don't really want that many duplicates! Maybe screen the menus prior to the event. For the record the best sliders were from N9NE! \n\nAdvertised people who were not there. I think it should be the same vendors on each night. If Kerry Simon has a booth on day one, day two also expects that. Where was Herbs & Rye? One of the reasons I bought a ticket. Fail. \n\nWine selection. WEAK SAUCE!! Pinot Nior and Cabernet from every booth? Switch it up a bit! I barley seen any white wine, and none of my personal favorites. UHH, LET DOWN!! \n\nThe layout. Sure, it was beautiful around the pool, but when you have 10-30 people trying to walk by a booth as well as grab a sample, it was one big CLUSTERF*%$!!\nCertain booths were easy to get to, others were not. I would also love some pop up tables and chairs! (not only 25 when there are 200 guests) \n\nHooters. Come on now. Hooters at the Las Vegas Wine & Food event? Is there even a Hooters still in Vegas? I just don't see how they match up to some of the fine dining places that were there. \n\nSo there you have it. I would go again, but I would not pay the amount. A bigger venue, with more food options. Or sell less tickets. No one wants to be elbowed by an impatient drunk who wants a mini burg. \n\nFoodie Fest read their reviews and changed some things around, I hope they do the same for this event.
