As many people have already stated they are awesome. I dealt with two other companies before going with them and both were dishonest. Dukes are honest, friendly, and get the job done. I had a few concerns and it was addressed immediately. They also assured me I could call if there are any issues as I had them install two new units. After the job was complete they completely cleaned up and actually made certain areas cleaner that might of had junk left over.  You can tell that Dukes takes pride on hiring employees who are the best techs but also who have great personalities. I obviously recommend!
