Came here for a quick bite with Cesar Q.  and some work peeps.  The ambiance at this restaurant\/bar is great!  Love the safari theme.  The staff wears pretty cool safari type shirts with denim bottoms.\n\nWe were greeted at the door and promptly seated in the back just off the kitchen.  There were 5 of us and apparently this was the only place for us!?  Whatever our food got to us quicker I suppose.\n\nWe were lucky that there was someone in training so we had 2 servers.  We were asked what we wanted to drink and quite quickly we got our beverages.  Placed our order with ease.  The servers did a good job.\n\nI ordered a dinner salad and baked potato as my entree.  The salad was fine, nothing special.  My stuffed baked potato was good but the outside had been burnt with crispy black spots on it.  Such a let down.  We spilt one tortilla soup and I can say it was really quite good.  \n\nI'm not overly impressed by this place.  It's pretty ordinary something like an Applebee's type place.  Everything appeared to be pre measured.\n\nWould only come back if I have to because of work or drinks.
