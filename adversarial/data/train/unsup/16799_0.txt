Stayed here a year ago with my pal and we had a good time. I'm a simple girl, as long as I have a room, hot water, and a TV, then I'm all set. Hospitality is big in Las Vegas and that was proved when we got there. \n\nWe had a snafu when we checked in because my friend got a great deal on Expedia for free buffet during our stay (score!), the check in said it wasn't valid. Huh? So my friend sends a tweet out and faster you can say \"Las Vegas Strip.\" we were upgraded to a better room, our tickets were valid, and the resort fee was waived for half our stay. Sweet.\n\nI wish I could tell you more about the hotel, but since I spent all the trip either stuffing my face, complaining about the bright lights on the street (albeit drunk), dodging bullets off Freemont Street, this is a pretty cool place to stay.
