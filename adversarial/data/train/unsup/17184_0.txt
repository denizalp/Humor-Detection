Shared a room with a friend who flew into town for business and didn't want to stay alone. I was confused as to why she would chose the Artisan but her company arranged all her travel plans. She asked for my company for the night after reading some reviews.\n\nThe one star is for the eclectic and artsy decor, which I love, because it was a refreshing change from what we normally fund in Vegas. The staff was pretty cool too.\n\nBUT.... I will never book my own stay here or come to hang at the bar. The drinks were not good and way over priced. The carpet in my friend's suite was so dirty the bottom of my yellow flip flops turned black, only I didn't realize this until I checked them because I had taken them off and the carpet felt sticky on my bare feet. There was an ashtray sitting outside the window, which was full, and trash strewn across the roof was our view. Bathroom fixtures were broken and the radio\/dvd player didn't work.\n\nEVEN WORSE was the fact that we came out of the room TWICE to a creeper with his ear plastered to our door. What was supposed to be a chill evening evening turned into us escaping to the Las Vegas strip to relax.
