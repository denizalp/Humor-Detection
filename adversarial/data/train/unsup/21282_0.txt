I was still experiencing pain from the bridge and had to go to another dentist to have it adjusted. I am no longer comfortable going in wigwam dental after the office manager got in a yelling match over the additional charges. It cost me another $107 to adjust the bite. I'm pretty sure dr. Ellen. Barged my insurance on Monday to adjust it as well. \n\nAlso, this other office found it odd I was paying out of pocket for temporary crowns or bridges in the first place. They said normally that is part of the overall cost of the a bridge or crown itself. They said the prepare the tooth and place a temporary until they do a final impression and get a permanent. Wigwam dental was charging me an exorbitant amount for the temporaries and going to charge myself and my insurance again for the permanent! There is no end to the shadiness of this practice. I feel taken advantage of and robbed. If you have a problem with this office report them to the state board and the BBB. They shouldn't be allowed to get away with these things!
