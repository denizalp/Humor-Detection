This is a nice quick water show to watch as your walking by the strip...I've seen it many times..my favorite was when they sequenced the fountains to the song from Titanic by Celine Dion...if I had a boyfriend, it would of been really romantic!  It's located right in the front of the hotel and u can watch from any point surrounding the fountain...I personally like to watch right in front...I think it runs every 1\/2 hour or something...not sure, check with the website:) It's beautiful in the day time and the night...but prob better @ night cause it has lights:)  I've seen them so many times, that now I don't make a point of going...but if I'm there and it's about to go on, I would stay to catch a show....the only other thing I'm thinking of doing in the future is watching it from one of their restaurant patios or a room in the bellagio:) We'll see!
