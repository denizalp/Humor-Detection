This place is good, but I only come for a pound of poke, seriously \\o\/ \n\nLocated at ROCKSPRINGS and Lake Mead, look for this in the same strip mall as In and Out, that means across the street from Chipotle.\n\nOh and if you have ever been to a Chipotle, this is kind of how the place is set up.  Go to the far right and start ordering what you want, pay at the end, sit down and eat.  \n\nI can't wait for them to expand their poke options outside the spicy sauce.
