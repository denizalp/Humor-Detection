If I could give Cowtown 0 stars that would be appropriate. My husband put a guitar on layaway, & decided that it wasn't right for him & then decided to cancel the layaway. Cowtown refused to refund his money. I could see if there was a fee to cancel, but no, they only gave him store credit. Any REPUTABLE place would refund your money. We've done layaways at Sam Ash or Guitar center and they refund your money less a restocking fee. Now we are OBLIGATED to have to buy something there. Who does that? Well, you've lost customers. So BUYER BEWARE!!!!! You better ask what their return policy is before you buy ANYTHING at all, because you may not see your money again!!!!
