Great place.  I used to come here when it was IDEAL COFFEE-love the new place so much more.  It is bright and airy with a lovely array of seating options. The barrista was charming and friendly.  Huge windows, great selection of mags.  A great place to hang out to read, write, think and watch the world go by. The latte could have had more espresso (almost identical to a latte I had at bulldog).  Will have the macchiato next time.  One thing we need more of in Toronto are flat-whites.  Terrific place.  Love the atmosphere.  Love the vibe. Makes one want to move to Leslieville.
