Really cute little salon (6 or fewer chairs) on Sackett.  I had high hope based on the appearance of the salon.\n\nPrices were reasonable.  Staff was friendly\n\nI left with essentially two haircuts- very mulletesque.  Not cool.\n\nI will never go again.  The girl cutting my hair was a teacher at the local beauty college... eek!
