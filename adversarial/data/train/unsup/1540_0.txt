The food is disgusting. The scent of their restaurant has an impact on the taste of their food. I asked for my money back and was told \"because they made the food they don't issue refunds\". Horrible customer service from \"the manager\"  wouldn't even rate them with a start of possible. NEVER GO HERE. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE
