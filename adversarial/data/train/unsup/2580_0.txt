I was so happy to go try this place out!  Very disappointed!  Sopes were so hard and dry. Asada taco had a funny taste. No red salsa. We ordered chips and salsa, paid $2.50 for that only to find out they had no salsa for them. Needless to say we will not be coming back here which is a big disappointment as it is in a convenient location.
