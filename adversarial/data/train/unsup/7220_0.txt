Nekter is a chain in California, Arizona and Colorado. They have juices, smoothies and acai bowls. You can grab a 1-day supply of cleansing juices for less than $50. I personally don't believe in juicing per se but hey, to each their own.\n\nAfter having lunch in the area, I wanted a sweet treat. I also needed to undo the bad taste of a bad acai bowl I had hours prior to coming here. It took me 2 acai bowls to make it happen.\n\nThe place has a nice vibe. They have seating inside and outside. I ordered 2 acai bowls which came out quick. The problem I found is that they only come in 1 size (for about $8) which is large for most places and is anywhere from 390-520calories. They have lids in case you can't finish it.\n\nPB Bowl:\nPeanut butter, acai, cashew milk, strawberries, banana, hempseed, granola, dates and agave nectar. I added whey protein for a few cents extra. This was recommended by the girl behind the counter since I couldn't figure out which 2 bowls I wanted. Excellent!!! I couldn't stop eating this. The flavors and textures were perfect. The granola was light and crunchy even if I let it sit for a while. 5\/5\n\nPitaya Bowl:\nAcai, Pitaya, banana, coconut butter, coconut water, pineapple, granola, agave nectar and coconut flakes. Refreshing and fruity. Perfect consistency and naturally very colorful. 4\/5
