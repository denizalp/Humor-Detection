If you can get past the dogs barking on the patio, kids screaming inside and the flies that come through the open air bar, you'll love the food.  Maybe takeout would be best if that bothers you.   Admittedly, the food is excellent and the portions are generous.   Today we ordered the breakfast meatloaf and chicken & waffles.   Delicious!
