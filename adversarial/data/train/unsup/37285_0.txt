Urban Bean is simply delicious! I can't seem to stop gushing about this place because the food is amazing. Its upscale taste at a reasonable cost.  I must admit that the only disappointment I had about this place was that more people weren't there to discover the tastiness of their food. I had a Pear and Arugula dish and the goat cheese, pesto, and sun dried tomatoes dish. Both made me mouth happy. Overall this place is adorable and the staff including the owner are helpful and friendly. I'd suggest that all of PHX go to this place and enjoy.
