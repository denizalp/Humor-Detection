I rushed here after work and got here 30 minutes before closing time (5:30p). They had a \"sorry we're full sign\" taped to the door and the closed sign up. Not good business! There were 2 people waiting, but 3-4 barbers working. They could have easily accepted more customers before closing time. One barber even made eye contact with me through the window and just let me walk away with sheer disappointment on my face!!\n\nI've heard of closing up 5-10 minutes before closing time, but 30 minutes?! That's just bad business!\n\nI'll go find somewhere else more accommodating. If you say you close at 6pm, honor it!
