This is probably the best dental office in town. It's a tad far from where I live but the drive was DEFINITELY worth it. The office is pristine clean. Dr. Karimzada was kind and professional and informed me in detail with what was going on. Jeff went above and beyond with dealing with my insurance and even offered other options if my insurance was terminated. My experience with Eric was great! it didnt feel like your regular dentist appointment, he was very friendly and I felt extremely comfortable with my experience. \n\n10\/10 would recommend everyone to get their teeth worked on here!
