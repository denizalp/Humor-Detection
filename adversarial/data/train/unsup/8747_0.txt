Reviewing Common Market on Yelp seems almost like a right of passage. Will I be the first yelper to extoll the virtues of this deli\/convenience store\/bar? By no means, but do I honestly value this local gem? You bet your bottom dollar! Common Market's strength is that it can be many things depending on what you need. \n\nHungry for a meal? Go into the deli and you can choose from one of their concoctions (I recommend the reuben on rye, no mustard) or make up one of your own. Vegetarian? They have plenty of options for you as well (The mid-eastern wrap is particularly tasty). \n\nJust looking for a snack to quell the (possibly late night) munchies? They have all kinds of tasty chips, pretzels, cookies and soft drinks to satisfy.\n\nOh, you wanted a slightly stronger drink? Well you are sure in the right place. Chilled, room temp, individual, 6-packed, in a case or on tap, Common Market has a beer selection to astound. Whether it's a PBR night or you are looking for your favorite craft brew they are prepared. I should mention they also sell wine, but with so many unique beers I tend to forget.\n\nDid you want more of a destination than a grab and go? No problem. They've got tables inside and out on their patio. They have weekly live music performances. Or you could just pick up a copy of the paper and do the crossword.\n\nWorried about parking? They have spaces in the front, a lot in the back, there is street parking and a large lot around the corner. Oh, and they have bike racks out back.\n\nDo be advised that they have a $5 credit\/debit minimum, so have cash if you are just grabbing a snack or drink.
