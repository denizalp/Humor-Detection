I went here on a Sunday to look for a gown.\nThey do some heavy advertising on Craig's List and I'm REALLY trying to avoid going to David's Bridal. \n\nFirstly, the web site recommends appointments, but they don't indicate that they're required.  Based on other walk in reviews and it being a Sunday afternoon I took a chance.  I walked in and there were 3 young ladies at the counter.  I explained I had a pretty good idea what I wanted and would just like to try it on.  They asked me if I could come back at 4, and said they were booked until then as far as .... Servicing customers I guess?  I'm not sure, because there was no one else there except myself and the three employees.  As a matter of fact, I browsed their racks for about 20-30 minutes, and no one ever came in while I was there.  Just me and the, um, customers representatives, yep...just us.  So I was pretty baffled as to what the issue was with someone assisting me,  I even offered to try the gown on unassisted but the lady didn't even respond.  Actually, I think they were huddled around the upcoming weeks schedule, because I heard some debating and phone calls going on about THAT.  I just came at a bad time maybe?\n\nSecondly:  The selection is off rack, 'discounted' wedding gowns.  I didn't see much of a price difference between this place and others that I have shopped.  Also, there's a pretty limited selection.  There is no order service provided, but they'll alter it.  The accessories seem priced as high as big bridal shop items I've seen, and maybe 2nd hand?  \n\nI'm not a bridezilla, and I'm not in a last minute frenzy.  I went alone to avoid the whole wedding dress debacle with friends and family.  The service here, today, was absolutely inexcusable for a business as a whole.\n\nGood luck if you walk in.
