I'm on a very restricted diet so it's difficult to eat out.  Our waitress Alicia P. went above and beyond to make sure I left with food in my belly, and a smile on my face.  She took a crazy amount of time working with me to create a delicious meal that was Ideal Protein Plan friendly.  So remember,  just because something isn't on the menu,  doesn't mean they won't create it for you!  (chicken breasts, garlic shrimp,  and spinach with mushrooms on the side)  Amazing!
