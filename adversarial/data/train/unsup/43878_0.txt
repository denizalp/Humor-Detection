I give the store and the employees 3 stars. i needed some fluids so I asked where the coolant was one of the employees just pointed to the back. I give Noel the gentleman that changed my car battery 5 stars. Was very helpful and pleasant and came to the back to help me find what coolant I needed. Thank you so much Noel.
