So, came here for happy hour.   Nothing happy here.  Left in a sad minute.  The only happy hour items on the menu is half price appetizers from 4-6.  Disappointing because I was looking for happy hour drinks.  None.  Been to the same chain and they had happy hour drinks.  What a shame.   I left. \n\nThis place needs to turn my frown upside down! \n\nOh and they have a low sanitation rating.
