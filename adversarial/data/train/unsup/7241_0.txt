I went to Youfit today to cancel my membership because my contract was up officially March 11th and I hardly went to the gym anyway.  I was told in order to cancel my membership today March 29th that there would be a $25 fee to cancel. It's free to cancel within 15 days of the expiration date of your membership. Ok so 18 days later I still have to pay $25 to cancel my membership. I asked to speak with a manager the kid advised no managers will be in until Monday. He said the managers will tell you the same thing I am now: you have to pay the $25 fee because you are 3 days over the 15 day window. He gave me a \"Membership Consideration Request\" to send to corporate. He said maybe they would call if I didn't get a response that means my request was thrown out. What?! Ok so seriously this place SUCKS! Small place with not a lot of options offered in NICER gyms.\n\nIf I could give zero stars I would! Wish me luck on my \"Membership Consideration Request\"
