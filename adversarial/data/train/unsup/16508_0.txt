HATE  Nothing.\n\nDISLIKE  The socially awkward cashier. Punch card is very specific to certain plates even if you're spending more. The random coin operated sticker\/toy machine by the door.\n\nLIKE  The availability of low carb options. The Hawaiian music playing in the background. Choice of mini or regular size. Shrimp fried rice. Location close to work.\n\nLOVE  Nothing.
