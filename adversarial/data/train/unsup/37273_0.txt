Went there a few days ago and my lemon pepper wings and fries and potato salad was pretty good. This is the best one I've been too so far in Nevada. Staff was really nice and knew how to work and keep a conversation while I was waiting on my food . I'll be coming back on my cheat days. The food did take about 25-30 mins on just 10 wings and fries so they could speed it up just a little.
