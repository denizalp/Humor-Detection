It does not look like much from the outside but wow what great food awaits inside.  I had the eggs benny and my girlfriend had an amazing omelet. Both were great and the staff is friendly even once they got extremely busy. I don't have a ton to say other than you really need to TRY THIS PLACE if you are ever visiting or live in the city of toronto.
