After reading the good and not so good reviews of this restaurant, my husband and I decided to give it a try  We went on a Friday night without reservations. To start off with when we entered your eyes really have to adjust to the very dark dinning room.  There was a couple in front of us with reservations and when we heard the host telling them in not such a friendly manner that they were early we knew this wasn't going to be good...lol.  We were told that the  only seating available was in the bar.  The waitress promptly escorted us to this area that was an enclosed cement floor like patio area.  The table we were offered was this tiny high top that would almost fit two people not very comfortably.  We looked at the rest of the room and there were a BUNCH of table clothed tables empty.  We asked if we could sit at one of those and she just said \"No.\"  We weren't even offered a wait time in which we could have been sat in the dinning room or bar\/patio tables. The main dinning room wasn't even full.  My husband and I decided to leave and the hostess showed us a back door out.  Not even a little apologetic.  So we ended up dinning at a wonderful restaurant downtown.  So my rating is not on the food but on how they treat their diners.  We won't even give them a second chance.  Not all the reviews have  been great for their food and the prices are pretty steep for a place that looks horrible on the outside and cold on the inside.  O, there is a $5 coupon on their website.  That will cover cheese and bacon on two baked potatoes.
