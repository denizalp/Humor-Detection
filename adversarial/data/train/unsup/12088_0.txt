When the Corner Bakery sign went up I have to admit I was pretty excited. Who doesn't love sandwiches, soups, and muffins? So I was really looking forward to having one down the street. \n\nI finally had a chance to visit for dinner. My first impression walking in was that this place was really clean. I guess it should be because it just opened, but hey you never know. Also, this place was very overstaffed, like 15 employees and 3 customers. Maybe they were still training? Unsure, but the service was great. The girl that took our order was friendly and even offered some suggestions with making my order into a choose 2, which I thought was nice. Good customer service!\n\nBut the food? Meh. As other reviews have mentioned the servings were really skimpy. I opted for a side salad with my meatball sandwich and it came on a small plate with literally a handful of lettuce. Sure its a side salad, but still it was on one of those small plates used for your table bread. The meatball sandwich was hearty. I would order that again. The entree serving of the bacon mac and cheese arrived in a bowl was half filled, which was kind of sad. Also ordered a bowl of the baked potato soup. \n\nThe best things about Corner Bakery that are in the drink department. It's all about the coffee and the lemonade. I totally dig the variety of flavors and the quality of their lemonades. Definitely a place where I would just stop by for a drink or something from the bakery. Yum!\n\nThe food was good-- but was it $40 dollars good? Not really. But the real problem is that within that total I didn't even get to order a chocolate baby bundt cake. Ha! That's the real disappointment here. Basically, if there was some sort of lunch debate happening between Panera Bread and Corner Bakery, my vote would go to Panera. \n\nSorry, Corner Bakery.
