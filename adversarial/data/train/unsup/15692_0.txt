I am at fusion right now. The people are absolute assholes. Eminem's dad left him with a whore, and these people are still worse than him. We asked for them to reserve a table for 8, they said yes. Upon our arrival these bastards informed us that it is walk-in only and that there are no reservations. Not only that, we were also never asked for our order and they treated us worse than MJ treated 10 year old adolescent boys. The place is tiny, there are no recreational activities. This boy that looks like a 9 year old on steroids mocked us for getting pissed for the bad service. Michael Jackson, if you're out there, I have a 9 year old man child for you ready to be raped. Please avoid going here at all costs. The shisha is dirt cheap, probably because it is comparable to smoking dogshit. Even yelp said to me that I wrote the pants off this review. They're saluting me as I speak. Trust this review, trust me: don't come here. BEWARE OF THE MANCHILD. best regards to you and hope you are not abused by this lounge as we have.\n\nBurhan Syed
