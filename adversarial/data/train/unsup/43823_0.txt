If you love the 50-60s pinball, this is nirvana.  I wanted some late 70s-early 80s pinball, and didn't recognize any games that they had.  And most pinball games are .50-.75 cents per play - just something to keep in mind.  There are also some old school video games (Tron, Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Defender, Robotron, Super Mario Bros, Space Invaders, Ms. Pacman, Paperboy, et. al).  These were all .25 cents per play.  I spent 2 hours and about $10 here and had fun.  Based on that alone, I'd give it a 5.  But one of the pinball machines took my .75 cents, and I had no idea who to even see about that, as the only employee I saw was an electrician type fixing games in the back, and he certainly looked engaged, so I decided that I would just think of it as admission.  The place is free btw, and the building is ugly on the outside, and certainly ugly inside.  But yeah, a way better investment than slot machines!
