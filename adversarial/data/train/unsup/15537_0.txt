This used to be our FAVORITE brunch buffet in Vegas and unfortunately over the last couple of years it has gone down hill :(  \n\nThey used to have a huge lox and bagels and smoked fish selection and now it's very small and just shoved in a corner.   \n\nThe over all quality is lacking, it's a shame.
