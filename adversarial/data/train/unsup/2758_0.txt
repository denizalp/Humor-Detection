Singaporean food! I was craving for something different & this was a good mix of asian food. Located off the end of the strip. Definitely a hidden little gem next to other shops that aren't even restaurants. Small parking lot.\n\n* Ordered:\n- Chicken Bacon Truffle Burger (4\/5 stars): Talk about egg porn! This was one of their off the menu specials & the fact that I'm not much of a fan of bacon in my burger, the egg drew me to ordering this. Anything with \"truffle\" in it, you already know it's going to be a crazy combination of other food in the burger. I loved how it was served with potato chips & a large sliced pickle. It balances out the salty part of the burger to sour to sweet. \n\n- One buttermilk fried chicken bao (4\/5 stars): This is the main reason why we went here! What was deceiving was the portion size. I didn't know it would be a mini size until they asked if I wanted one or two. It seemed like a snack to others, but this could be just another meal if you order 2. Crispy, buttery, & soft on the bun side. Thankful we decided on this!\n\n- #3 Roasted Spring Chicken with Rice (4\/5 stars): AH! Such a good plate filled with both rice, chicken, & lemon with seasoning to squeeze all over. I love the way they roasted the chicken. It was perfect to its crisp.\n\n- Milk Green Tea & Vietnamese coffee (5\/5 stars): These 2 drinks were first served to us & I almost finished it before the food even got to us! SO good! The milk green tea was not just any green tea, it was very mellow on the milky side. I loved it! Same goes for the Vietnamese coffee. Something to keep us awake throughout the day yet very light on the coffee side.\n\n* Service (4\/5 stars):\nShout out to LIZ! She was our sweetest waitress! She acknowledged our outfits & conversed with us like any other customers dining in. She deserves the full 5\/5 stars for her friendly service, checking up on us, & made us feel welcome. As for the girl who took our order at the register, she didn't seem pleased to serve us. Simply took our order & gave our number, nothing too dramatic, just no expression of a smile & kept talking to her coworkers. They have a \"House Rules\" posted & it seems as though to help them better, TAKE YOUR ORDERS TO GO! It's such a small dine in that it's understandable that they'd love to serve everyone but simply can't because they do not have the space for it. \"To go is helping you, help us, help you\"\n\nOh & rule number 9, when you're in Vegas though... \"No shirt. No shoes. No service.\" Straight up & simple!
