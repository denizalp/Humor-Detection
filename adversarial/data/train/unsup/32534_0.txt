The prices are a little high, I think because they include the wine and dessert automatically. I didn't understand wine was included. My group and I were not interested in having the wine, so I feel like we paid for something we didn't want. The service was decent. There was a man playing the accordion and he came to our table - he was super sweet and definitely added to the ambiance. The restaurant was very dark.
