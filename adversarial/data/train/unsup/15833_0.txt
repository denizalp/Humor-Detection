First of all this studio states they are \"beginner friendly\" and that is the last thing it is. I took my best friend to her first cycling class and the teacher (Tiffany) yelled at us during class for \"talking\" when if she had been teaching like she was supposed to my best friend wouldn't have been confused, thus we would not have been talking.  Not only was it embarrassing that she yelled at us over the microphone in front of the class but she continue to scold my best friend after class at the front desk. Making her so uncomfortable she refused to go back for another class. \nSecondly their \"hot Pilates\" is really just hot boot camp. Instead of focusing on the proper form they run the class in 30 second intervals. All the classes I took (which I took at least one of each) were all very intense with little opportunity to modify. This is not a place for beginners or people who enjoy a variety of intensities in their workout. \nLastly their owner is extremely unprofessional and inconsistent. She claims she \"created hot Pilates\", which is obviously not true since her class isn't even hot Pilates. Also looks like she needs to chill on the Botox and preworkout. \nThere are better studios out there, save yourself from coming here.
