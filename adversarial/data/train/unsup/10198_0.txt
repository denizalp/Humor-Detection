Well I needed a doctor...hmm...a nurse I mean during a visit at the Heart Attack Grill !  Fortunately with an empty stomach, I was able to complete my double patty with cheese and not get spanked by a lovely nurse.  My strategy besides coming in hungry:\n1. Eat one patty with one bun\n2. Finish\n3. Eat the other patty with the other bun\n4. Finish and Done!\n\nThe burger was good and the atmosphere festive of course.  The promo videos of the staff is comical and a delight.  I would come back for a spanking..i mean burger in the future!
