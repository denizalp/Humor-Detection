Horrible customer service. My boyfriend got to this airport early, he tries to check in and the stupid hosts or whatever they are don't even help him or try to direct him correctly to where he needs to go. He is getting attitude from employees when hes simply asking a question. He misses his flight by only 5 minutes and now has to wait for the next one. This is fucking unbelievable, never ever using this airline again and will most definitely warn friends and family about them.
