I'm amazed that it took me 16 years in Vegas to find this place.\n\nI love Teppanyaki. I used to frequent Hamada when it was on Flamingo (back when it was good), and have eaten at many teppanyaki places, Osaka, Geisha Steakhouse, Ohjah, etc, etc. This by far was my favorite experience.\n\nThey have quite an extensive menu, featuring anything from Kobe Beef to NY Strip Steak, Lobster, Scallops, Prawns, Chicken, Salmon and more. Probably more selection than other places. Prices are a little bit higher, but the quality makes it worthwhile. I opted for the Samurai 3 dinner, NY Strip and Salmon, for $33 (add $3.50 for fried rice). So not too bad.\n\nChef Yung (probably misspelled) was excellent. He does all the tricks with the knife and spatula, onion volcano, etc. He really stood out because he can cook!!! He took some special sauce orders and whipped them up. My salmon could have been prepared 3 different ways, I chose lemon dill and it was great! The conversation at the table also focused on Yelper's favorite subject.....other restaurants!! Tiger the owner has a couple new ones coming up. He also gave us a few to try out which of course I can't remember (thanks Sake and Sapporo). \n\nOverall, just a very pleasant dining experience, with good high quality food. I'll be back, and I'll be sure to highly recommend to anyone seeking good Teppanyaki.
