Cozy takeout joint located in the same plaza as Papa Chang on 16 and Markham Rd. Ample parking for takeout, especially for dinner rush when other shops have closed. Dine-in is available, but there are few tables and you'll be surrounded by guests waiting for their takeout orders. \n\nI ordered their 100 pc Sushi-Sashimi-Roll platter for $60, which comes in two takeout platters. Plenty of food for 4-5 people. Sashimi tasted fresh and sushi was well constructed. I like that they give a variety of rolls with different fish in it. (Seriously cheesed when sushi restaurants cheat you with cucumber rolls and crab rolls.)\n\nDo order ahead as they get pretty overwhelmed during peak hours. For the price, Ai Sushi offers exceptional value. Also helps they're located super close to home for me!
