After 3 tastings with other caterers that we were less than blown away with, we tried Noble. Glad...we...did.\n\nThey blew us away with every course. But better still, was how well they executed at our wedding this past weekend. Wow. All of our guests could not stop raving about the food and it made the night.\n\nTina is the 'hostess with the mostest' and really knows how to pull everything off seamlessly. 110% on point!\n\nChef Noble is a true artist and his group of support chefs take pride in his vision.\n\nBook them. Now. You will not go wrong!
