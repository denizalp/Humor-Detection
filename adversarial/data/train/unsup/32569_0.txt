This is a 4.5 star review.\n\nPro: \n-Great facility, modern rooms\/washrooms, love the duvet and the washroom facility. \n-Outstanding Service: I almost had the fit when my requested 'connecting' 2 rooms weren't available as I booked with this hotel specific for that reason..however, the front desk were able to find me the joining room eventually. I had to check into one of them first since the other one wasn't cleaned yet ..i was fine with waiting as we could still chill inside the other one. The manager called me later that night to offer us complimentary breakfast for this mishap and was very professional and apologetic about the whole situation. \n-Breakfast buffet by the way was AMAZING, love their scrambled eggs with cheese and they even had descent congee which I needed after waking up hung over -_-\n-Complimentary wifi was offered as well although we didn't end up using this.\n-Good value..price for a night was competitive to a 2-star hotel.\n\nCon: \n-Location is bit far from the city (10 min walk to get to core downtown?)  but it's nice in the summer since it's right by the harbourfront.\n-No descent restaurants or food places nearby.\n-No working fridge in the room...apparently they have an old one still installed under the tv stand but it doesn't really work like a cold refrigerator anymore.\n\nOverall, the value of the hotel was awesome and I would definitely come back to this hotel!
