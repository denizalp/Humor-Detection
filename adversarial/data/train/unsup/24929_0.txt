HIGHLIGHTS: Made-to-order souffles, vanilla ice cream, freshly-shucked oysters, steamed crab legs (upon request!), wagyu sliders, peach iced tea, lotus-wrapped pork and rice, truffle scalloped potatoes, taco bar, charcuterie and cheese sections, crispy peking duck skin, Chinese soup dumplings. Worth every penny. Every other Vegas buffet can give up now. Everything there is delicious, but the amazing food makes the still-above-average food seem mediocre.\n\nLOWLIGHTS: your stomach has a capacity.
