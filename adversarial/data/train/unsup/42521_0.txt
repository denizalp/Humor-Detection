YEEEEAOOW!\n\nyesterday I had lunch at RM SEAFOOD. let me just say i am a fan. Chef Rick Moonen is the business! very creative & unique menu.\nlets get the formalities out of the way..the hostess (and i use that term loosely) is BELOW AVERAGE and should probably be reassigned to rolling silverware in the back of the house. \nHowever my waiter JOESPH was awesome & recovered for the poor greeting. After consulting with Joesph, I ordered the Clam chowder & the EKG burger.  YUMMY..the chowder is a meal in itself with THICK pieces of bacon & potatoes in every bite. & the EKG burger was delish... topped off with cheddar & pulled pork mac n cheese. \non my next visit i think I will split the burger..its HUGE.
