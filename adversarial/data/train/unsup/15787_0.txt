My first experience with lobster was circa Hanukkah 1993. The irony of my family going out for un-kosher lobster on a Jewish holiday is certainly not lost on me. I had my brand new Molly doll from American Girl sitting next to me, and I, once known as the Princess of Picky asked to try a bite of my parents lobster.\n\nThe ended up having to order me my own.\n\nAnd the rest is history. Although we had a mid-nineties flirtation with Red Lobster (the cheddar biscuits still haunt me) Lobster Trap is my family's go to for a lobster feast.\n\nAs others have mentioned, all lobster dinners (the only dinners with which I have any familiarity) start with the choice of starter and the amazing garlic bread. For the reviewer who called the garlic bread too buttery, there is NO. SUCH. THING.\nThe salad is fine, the chowder is good, but everyone knows you need to go for a big creamy bowl of lobster bisque. So good, I think I need to get a fix soon.\n\nThe main event is always good, obviously certain times of year are going to yield fresher results but I've never had an issue with less than delicious lobster. Is it as fresh as at a lobster pound in the Maritimes or New England? Nope. But a trip to the trap is definitely cheaper than a plane ticket!
