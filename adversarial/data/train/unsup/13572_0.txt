This was our first time here.  I did a \"check in\" and immediately was handed a free \"soup of the day\" by Dailee.  She was very courteous and took our food\/drinks orders immediately.  \n\nI got the chicken salad sandwich (GREAT)\nWife got the breakfast tacos (GREAT)\nSon got the Red Rock Nachos (GREAT)\n\nThis place has a very good menu, good prices plenty of drink selection and multiple iced teas.  \n\nWe were very happy here and definitely will be back.
