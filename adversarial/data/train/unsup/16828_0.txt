A friend and I came in here a while back to shop for babies. Unfortunately, they don't REALLY exchange babies here, but they do have lots of cool new and very gently used stuff that babies and little kids really need, so it's a groovy and good thing.\n\nAnd we DO need to support our independent stores -- go Urban Babies!!!
