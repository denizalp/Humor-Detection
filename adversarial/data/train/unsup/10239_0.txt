Owned by the Landry's Restaurant Group at the center of Caesars' Forum Shops it is no secret that TREVI Italian Restaurant is targeted at tourists, so with a trio in town from Paris looking for something 'casual' it was as a group of five that dinner was served, Chef Jose M. Navarro and his team showing exactly why Las Vegas remains far ahead of the pack in terms of high volume Restaurants as relates to both Cuisine and service.\n\nLocated amidst giants such as Armani, Gucci and Ferragamo plus the \"Fountain of the Gods,\" a pseudo-outdoor patio popular for people watching cozying right up to flowing waters, it is from a podium that guests are led to tables spread across two floors, a rounded booth overlooking both kitchen and dining room providing plenty of space and comfort as a Wedding Party one table over celebrated one of Las Vegas' many newlywed couples.\n\nAccessible yet offering enough intrigue and good ingredients to please the culinary-minded, simple plates and 'signatures' joined by seasonal inspirations, happy hour specials and at least one off-menu Pasta daily, it was with a round of Drinks plus warm Bread that dinner got underway, the famous Trevi Peach Bellini a rightful favorite that is deceptively boozy while a seasonal Blueberry Martini was also quite pleasant thanks to an herbaceous linger.\n\nManaging volume like professionals, both the decibel level and meal's pacing just right considering at least two-hundred guests around 7pm on a Saturday, it was as drinks were being sipped that Appetizers were served with ample descriptions, the simple Caprese Salad showing off sourcing while Prosciutto with Melons in various forms plus Summer's Steak Tartare did the same while also upping the ante by way of their multi-textured presentations.\n\nTold that TREVI's Brick Oven Pizzas are somewhat hit and miss, though any opportunity to indulge in the World's second most popular dish is generally worthwhile, it was prior to Pasta that a deep-dish \"Lasagna\" Pie was served bubbling hot with layers of Meat and Cheese atop crisp and buttery Crust, a single slice probably enough for most given the heft but one of the rare 'hybrid' Foods that actually pulls double-duty in representing both classics equally.\n\nMaking several Pastas in-house, no small feat for such a venue, it was a bit disheartening that otherwise good Shellfish got a little lost amidst thick Cream Sauce but turning attention to three filled Noodles things were immediately back on track, an \"appetizer\" of Pea Casoncelli finding favor even from someone who generally does not like Mushrooms thanks to its freshness while both the daily-special Agnolotti and Chicken Ravioli were plump and nicely cooked with the former expectedly rich but nicely balanced by the sweet Wine Reduction.  \n\nOnward to Entrees, several at the table already getting full, it was in place of menu-suggested Salmon that Scallops were set amidst fragrant Dill Cream and Asparagus, the roasted Tomatoes just one of many excellent accoutrements that also included creamy Corn alongside medium-rare Steak and Kale that was almost as crisp and delicious as the juicy Chicken it was plated with.\n\nAccepting an offer of Coffee prior to Dessert, the educated and affable server correctly naming and preparing  an \"Iced Americano\" it was after a bit of Hockey talk that three sizable housemade sweets arrived, the Tiramisu fairly typical while TREVI's molten \"Chocolate Gooey Cake\" and Italian Cream wedge both outpaced many Las Vegas fine-dining institutions in terms of taste and texture, not to mention portion, with blend of Coconut, Pecans and Cream Cheese Frosting arguably one of the most underrated Desserts offered anywhere in Sin City.\n\nFOUR STARS:  Just under $360 all-in, a complimentary round of Housemade Lemoncello offered to finish, it is safe to say that TREVI over-performed expectations and although a \"tourist\" Restaurant in the middle of a Shopping Mall may not be some people's idea of a good night out the majority, including those who travel to eat, can certainly find a lot to enjoy about the experience, particularly when eating with people who aren't necessarily into 'fine dining' but still want a delicious meal with great service.
