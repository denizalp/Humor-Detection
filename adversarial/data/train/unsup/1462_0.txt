** Update 7\/18\/16 **\nHotel management reached out to me following my review and offered a refund of my first night room + tax as a service recovery gesture. I think this is commendable in light of circumstances and it's nice to know they pay attention to guest reviews even if the staff on site weren't quite so pro-active; thus, I've changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars. I hope that beyond satisfying one guest complaint they are taking steps to address the issues I encountered so others don't run into the same (that would earn them a 5 stars in my book!). \n\n\n** Original review posted 7\/17\/16 **\nI wouldn't give this resort \"dismal\" marks but close to it. I was booked for a Fri\/Sat 2-night stay and I booked a \"King suite\" at Wynn but opted in for a standby upgrade for a King Panorama (+$34\/nt) or a King Tower Suite (+$80\/nt). The day before check-in I got an email saying that no upgrades were available but to check with the front desk on arrival. No problem.\n\nOn arrival at the Wynn and after a 30-minute wait in a very slow check-in line, the desk agent said my upgrade to a King Tower Suite was already processed and in the system. Yay for the upgrade but thumbs down for not notifying me before arrival as the Encore tower is a 3\/4 mile walk with my bags and has a private check-in area that I would have liked to use instead of a 30-minute wait at main check-in. They were still happy to charge me full price for the upgrade despite the diminished enjoyment of benefits due to their lack of communication. #fail\n\nThe room itself was awesome. Beautiful view of the strip, nicely appointed and an amazingly comfortable bed. The one thing I would change is there could be an amazing view out the windows from the bed but it's blocked by the TV. It would be nice if there was another way to arrange this so the view could be enjoyed from either the living area or the bed itself.\n\nHousekeeping arrived at 9PM for turndown service. I told her I was leaving in 20 minutes and asked her to come back. She said \"yes, of course!\" but never did. #fail\n\nMy rate included buffet breakfast for two at the Wynn buffet. There's nothing in the literature (or my welcome letter) about a strictly enforced dress code that prohibits sleeveless shirts - it's 110 degrees in Vegas and for most guests who are planning a pool day, dressing up for something as low end as a buffet meal is not front of mind. Perhaps include a note in the welcome letter about this? So there was a 1.5-mile walk in vain since we couldn't go in and yet another benefit of my room rate that went unused due to poor communication on Wynn's part. #fail\n\nAt the tower suites pool it was rather busy since it was 110 degrees but they only had 3 attendants working 100+ guests. We were there for 90 minutes before we could get someone's attention to ask for a food menu. 30 minutes later still no menu so I asked again. We finally ordered and got our food & drinks 3 hours after we arrived at the pool. #fail\n\nLast, at 9AM on my last day the hotel emergency alarms went off - so much for sleeping in! I don't fault the hotel for the alarm but the message was \"this is a pre-notification and we're investigating the source of the alarm.\" This message and the siren repeated for about 10 minutes which is excessive and unnecessary. After it finally went off I tried to go back to sleep only to be startled again with another alarm and message saying \"the alarm was due to a minor issue and it has been resolved.\" Which, again, repeated several times. For god's sake if it's non-emergency then let me sleep! #fail\n\nOn checkout (in the tower suites lounge this time) there was no order or organization. While I was first \"in line,\" if you can call it a line, the desk staff called up everyone OTHER than me who arrived after I did. The clerk asked how my stay was and I said I probably wouldn't stay again. She asked why, I mentioned a few of the above and she said \"I'm sorry, is there anything I can do?\" I said \"you tell me, you're in a better position to know what you can offer but at this point my stay is over\" at which point she printed my bill and apologized again. I guess that means there is nothing they do for service recovery, then again based on my experience I'm not surprised (note: removing the upgrade charge would have been a great way to turn a bad situation around). #fail\n\nOverall, nice rooms and nice aesthetic to the property but if you expect good service go elsewhere.
