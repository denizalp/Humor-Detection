I'm so sad to see that people have had bad experiences here, because mine was so splendid! I bought my wedding dress here last week and Carmelita was the friendliest, least pushy salesperson I could have imagined! She totally worked within our price range, didn't hover over us while we looked (my biggest pet peeve with wedding dress shopping has been just that), held my dress from about noon until the next morning so I could sleep on it, and it was just generally a completely wonderful experience!\nI definitely do not have the budget for most things in her shop, and I suspect by my worn in shoes she knew it, but she was so kind, and honestly was just so fun. \nTotally recommend this shop!
