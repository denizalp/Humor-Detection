Bad first experience with Rouge! As it was the only place open late on Sunday evening, I went after work with a friend. We showed up at around 6:30, no appointment, as nowhere did it explicitly say they were necessary (their Instagram page says \"walk-ins welcome\"), and we were greeted by two girls chatting at the front desk. \nThe girl sitting at the desk asked if we wanted to make an appointment but we said we would like pedicures. The girl replied that there were no technicians available at the moment. We asked if we could do something else to which she replied they were \"actually closed.\" So, are you closed or are there no technicians available? And if you are indeed closed, why is the door to your business unlocked, and furthermore why did you welcome us when we walked in instead of telling us you're closed?\nThis experience left a really bad taste in my mouth and I was really not impressed with how we were treated.
