A group of my friend and I arrived at this place around six, and it was very desolate.  There were three dancers in two hours and each of them did about three minutes worth of work.  \n\nThough there was one very dexterous girl who was impressive, it was mostly depressed girls on their phones.  Really a mournful experience overall.  The only plusses were seeing the Make It Rain ATM machine (Why isn't this in Vons?)  and said one dancer who managed to do more pole tricks in four minutes than I've ever seen.\n\nAlso, I think the DJ\/Announcer guy didn't even bother showing up for the first 45 minutes.  We went over to Treasures and had a way better time.  With alcohol.
