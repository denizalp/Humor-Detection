This review is for the Bar\/Lounge at the Tuscany.  A friend of mine who was in town for the G2E convention reserved all the rooms for his company at this hotel and decided to have a pre-dinner get together at the Bar\/Lounge in the lobby.  This is the 2nd year in a row that he's done this and not much has changed since last year.....the place is not at the top of my list, here's why:\n\n- The bar\/lounge is very smoky.  I understand that we live in Vegas and people can smoke indoors, but damn this place reeks of smoke even when there are no smokers!  When we got down there, we had a party of 16 and not one of us smokes.....no one in the bar was smoking either, but it smelled like there was a peace treaty happening in the middle of the lounge!\n\n- The service is S-L-O-W.....I waited for over 10 minutes just to place a drink order.....then another 5 minutes for the drink, this was at the bar!  I guess they can't handle 24 people in the bar at one time.  The bar can easily accommodate 3x that many people....oh well.\n\n- The house Wine sucks.  They didn't have a Wine list and I wasn't in the mood for Beer or Hard Liquor so I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  That was a mistake.....blech, it was pure Swill.  Good thing I wasn't picking up the tab.\n\nOn the plus side, the seating is comfortable and the large TVs allow you to watch sporting events with ease.  It was Monday Night Football when we were there and the game was just getting started.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the company and conversation and was comfortable.....but the drinks and service was a disappointment.\n\nWill I return?  I won't come back unless I'm meeting someone here for an event like this....
