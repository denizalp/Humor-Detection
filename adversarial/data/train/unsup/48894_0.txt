Muy Rico!! Came to try the pollo asado which was outstanding. Crispy perfectly charred skin. Tender and juicy. The red rice was some of the best I've ever had. Very flavorful with each grain light, fluffy and separate ( can't stand gummy rice). The salsa was made with fresh tomatoes and was perfectly spicy. So good I could drink it. As a matter of fact we enjoyed our meal so much we came back the next day to try out the carne asada tacos. Good call ! They were beyond delicious. We also had the beans which where brothy and perfectly done. Not too soft not too hard just right. Going back tomorrow for the pork tacos and the elote asada. Thank you Yelp for the lunchtime suggestion. We might have missed out on this great experience had it not been for Yelp. This is definitely our new place.
