We just purchased a car from Anthony Torres and could not be more pleased.  I was not looking forward to going through the car purchasing experience again but Anthony made it so easy.  We knew what we wanted and the entire process took less than and hour.  Once the deal was finalized Anthony filled the tank, put on the temporary license plate and bid us good bye.  A few days later he checked back with us to make sure all was in order.  We will recommend this establishment to others looking for a great car buying experience.\n\nGeorge & Darlene M.
