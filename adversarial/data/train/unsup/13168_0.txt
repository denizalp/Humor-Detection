Casual dining at the Wynn.  This place is the only place and thankfully, it was well worth it.\n\nBreakfast sliders and sour cream coffee cake.  Delicious.  The coffee cake is huge and can serve about 4 people.  We had to take the leftovers to go. The sliders were a basic ham and egg sandwich but were really tasty.  The hash browns were studded with green onions, crispy on the outside, and delicious as well.  \n\nService was great and everything was reasonably priced for the Wynn.
