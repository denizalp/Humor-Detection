I had such horrible experience from this restaurant and want to share my experience hoping to let others know. \n\n1. Customers not allowed get more side dishes after 2:05 even though the restaurant closes at 2:30.  \n\nMoral of the story: Do Not Go after 2:05. You Will still Be Hungry After eating the Main dish. \n\n2. Waiters\/waitresses are not friendly. \n\nMoral of the story: Be Prepared to get yelled at by the waiters\/waitresses \n\nSo, I wouldn't go to this restaurant if I were you.
