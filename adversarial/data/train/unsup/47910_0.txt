I went in here on a whim, looking for a relaxing pedicure. The salon is quiet and nice. The pedicure chair had tons of massage options, the bowl was glass and very pretty (they also have special chairs for little girls pink with butterfly wings, adorable). The practitioner did a great job and was very nice. With tip I spent about $45, but it was worth it for a treat.
