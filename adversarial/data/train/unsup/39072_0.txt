I wasn't a fan of Shawarmas until I came here. I purchased the groupon as a quick dinner meal after the gym during the week when I had no time to cook. Went there not sure what to expect but I was delightfully surprised. The food is flavorful and delicious. Those pickled carrots or whatever they were are awesome. I love it. Anyways, great experience prompted me to get another groupon. I look forward to going back.
