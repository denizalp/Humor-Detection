After the owner contacted me about my previous one-star review, I felt it necessary to point out that most of the reasons why this place sucks probably have nothing to do with the management.  Yes, I called the doorman a jackass, which was probably harsh-- I'm sure he's just a perfectly nice guy who has simply become bitter after having to deal with the level of drunk idiots who frequent this place.  I guess he kind of has to assume that everyone is drunk enough that they might potentially attempt something that they will forever regret, so I suppose it makes sense that he assumed the same of me even though I arrived entirely sober.  Also, being that I'm 35 years old, it's fair to say that this just isn't my type of place, and a one-star joint for me might be considered the best bar in history for a 22 year old frat guy who isn't aware of how crappy Pittsburgh really is.  This place sucks because the clientele is made up of people that I generally try to avoid, not because the management is incompetent, which I can't really speak to.  If you are a 21-24 year old male who is forced to reside in Pittsburgh or surrounding areas and your typical Friday night consists of drinking until you throw up and going home with a girl who will only speak to you because she's even more hammered than you are, have at it, loser-- FIVE STARS!!
