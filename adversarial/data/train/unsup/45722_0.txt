My house is 17 years old so lately there have been a few issues...After a few misses I decided to call Focus Plumbing...Their service is very fast, friendly, professional and most of all get's the job done right the 1st time..Pricing was very fair...I would highly recommend Focus Plumbing to anyone from building your own home to fixing emergencies in an existing home to doing remodel work...
