Stopped here for a friend's birthday. Very fast service, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the hookah was good. They had alcohol free \"mixed drinks\" which we thought was hilarious, those were good as well. Multiple wait staff would stop if they thought you might need anything, even if they weren't your primary server. The seating was also pretty unique and the atmosphere was really nice. Can't stress friendly service enough. Rated 5 stars for the whole experience.
