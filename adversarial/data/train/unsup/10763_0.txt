This Walgreens is my favorite Walgreens, which has a nice Vegas flair. We stopped in here more than a few times during our visit to grab items for our Vegas stay. What a convenient location being right in the middle of the Strip, right next to Planet Hollywood and across the way from the City Center. There are two floors with plenty of shopping space. The aisles are easy to navigate and doubly wide. \n\nThey have a large selection of alcohol and even a whole shelf devoted to half-bottles of alcohol, everything from tequila to wine. These smaller bottles were very convenient for our last night in which we didn't need full bottle sizes. They were even giving out free samples of flavored rum one afternoon. \n\nThere are some cool souvenirs, including Vegas tank tops, baby outfits, glitter coffee cups and tumblers, pink and zebra print flasks, magnets, postcards and glitzy bags. I saved on a LV coffee traveler mug here,  paid $9.95 and found it outside of Walgreens for $14.95. Stock up on your souvenirs here, you'll save yourself some money. \n\nThere are between 6-10 checkout windows for easy in and out checkout. The lines flow very nicely and the checkout clerks were all very pleasant. Even the security guard manning the door gave everyone a friendly greeting. \n\nI'll be hitting up this Walgreens during my future Vegas visits.
