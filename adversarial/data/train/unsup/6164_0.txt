I was taking a few minutes to wander around Old Town when I spotted this boutique. Well actually I spotted the Keep it Wild and State Forty Eight shirts in the window and that is what drew me in. As I told the owner, Carmen, I always see these brands on Instagram, but finding them in person was a pleasant surprise. It turns out, that not only does Carmen sell these brands but other local Arizona clothing and jewelry as well. Sure, you could go across the street and get a t-shirt that says Scottsdale, but it's the exact same shirt you'd find in other places just with a different city name such as Sedona, San Diego, Lahaina, etc.\n\nWhether you're a local or a tourist, Carmen is the place to go to find actual local souvenirs and local brands and its the type of place I like to support. Plus, Carmen was extremely nice and fun to talk with. For those who remember, she used to own Active Body near Scottsdale and Shea which was a great store as well.\n\nOh, and it's not just for women, she also carries clothing and accessories for men as well. So if you're ready to up your Instagram game, go by Carmen and get yourself a new shirt and then show it off in your hiking selfies!
