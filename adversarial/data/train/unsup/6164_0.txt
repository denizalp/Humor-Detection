I love this Target!  It is always neat, clean and well stocked.  The staff is courteous and are constantly stocking and straightening the merchandise.  I can run in and get what I need and get out with no fuss.\n\nTo make my shopping more complete, there is a Starbuck's in house! What could be better than sipping a Caramel Macchiato while picking up cleaning supplies and mascara?
