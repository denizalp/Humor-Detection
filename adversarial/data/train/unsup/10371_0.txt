Took our newest feline friend, Cringer feline to be vetted here a while back.\n\nIt is not cheap, but the staff is super friendly. The doctor (was a female, cannot remember her name) was fabulous! She answered all of my twenty million questions and calmed me down and told me it was highly unlikely that Cringe had FLV or FIV. That test took 24 hours and he was in fact negative - thank god!\n\nWe got him his shots and he was snipped (poor guy) - all said it ran us about $420. We returned about a month later for his boosters and that was a cool 79 bucks. Holy hell having felines is expensive, but those fur babies are worth it.\n\nCringer (aka Battle Cat) was previously a stray and was easy to feed but hard to wrangle - once we got him in that cage, it was off to the vet we had to go. The vet was very easy to work with and kept Cringe overnight (they had to wait for the FLV\/FIV test). Even if Cringe had been FIV\/FLV positive, the snipping surgery was still available - they just would have had to be a little more careful because risk of infection skyrockets.\n\nAfter surgery they hung onto our feline friend for the majority of the day (gave him some good pain meds) and we picked him up before close. Cringer feline now lives happily with his sister feline - Loki.\n\nWill definitely be back again to make sure our kit cats healthy.\n\nAlso, Detroit Dover is accredited by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) which means their hospital is measured against the most rigorous published standards in the industry; which equals great care for your pets!
