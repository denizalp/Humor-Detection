With a few sushi options in the neighborhood, me and my family always like returning to this Japanese restaurant. When you walk in to this small shop, you are greeted by a welcoming staff and K-Pop on the tvs. All the servers are tentative and have grown to remember us and our orders especially my parents and little one. I like to change it up and have tried multiple sushi rolls and have enjoyed them all. Their fried rolls are never oily and battered just right. The fish is always fresh and colorful. And the prices can't be beat for a neighborhood spot.
