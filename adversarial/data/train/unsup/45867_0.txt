One of my favorite places to eat ever! Their food is incredible. Their pesto is so authentic and yummy! There's never been a dish I tried and did not like. I would totally recommend their potato cream cheese soup, buffalo chicken sandwich, or chicken pesto and feta sandwich! Top favs! \n\nThe location is also very neat and clean. They have some of the sweetest employees I've ever encountered! Especially Stephanie. She has gotten to know my order and greets me by name.
