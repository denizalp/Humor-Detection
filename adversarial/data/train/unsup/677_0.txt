This one star is specifically for IRENE the cashier. She was INCREDIBLY RUDE and profiling. I would also say probably racist bc she was nice to the people in front of us. If you have a problem with a PAYING CUSTOMER you should NOT be in retail! \n\nFirst incident: she placed the video game I bought for my brother in the bag directly without taking off the security cover. I notified her of doing this, and she said what do you want me to do about it? I want you to remove it so I won't exit the store with a problem! It's like she had never done it in her life. She had to insert my DOB so I handed her my license bc she asked me for it. She then threw it across the counter at me instead of handing it to me directly. \n\nSecond incident: I had a coupon for coffee, and she threw it at me saying is this yours? Yes, it is mine. And I wanted you to scan it so I can use it, idiot. \n\nThird incident: I inserted my card and she yelled at me saying to not remove it. I know. I can read, and this isn't my first time purchasing anything with the new chip. Plus, it CLEARLY says in English \"please do not remove your card.\" \n\nFourth incident: she tried offering me a job as if I'm not employed. Yes, I may look like I've had a rough week but that's because I work 12.5 hour shifts at the hospital. She also said this was her second job so I can have another. Hahahahahahahahaha! Classic. I guess I look like someone who can't afford my lifestyle and need a second job! Sorry, woman. I thought of that before I graduated college. \n\nIrene is the greatest target employee ever. Insert sarcasm here. I wish to never come across her customer service. Ever again. And I go to target weekly.
