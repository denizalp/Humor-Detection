The food is awful and not worth it.  The women who is doing the barbeque is extremely rude and unfriendly.  I think she doesn't know the meaning of customer service and respect.  One tip to everybody, don't waste your money on this place.  There are other filipino restaurant around the plaza that is far better than this junk.  I cant put a zero that is why I rated it one star.
