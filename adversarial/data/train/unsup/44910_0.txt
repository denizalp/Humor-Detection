Honestly I would have never gone to this place had it not been recommended to me by a friend! I had never seen it and I've been to Vegas many times but I'm so glad we tried it out! It's a very different atmosphere than all the restaurants in Vegas (and home). The service was quick and the food was really tasty! They do give you \"free\" wine which is pretty good too! The salad was so yummy, as well as the ravioli's and meatballs. Also, the cappuccino at the end was a perfect little dessert. As we ate, this older man came and played a love song for us, it was sweet! Great place when you're in the mood for something new!
