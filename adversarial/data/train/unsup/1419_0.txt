My wife and I eat out five nights a week.  We know what is acceptable and what is not when it comes to ambiance.  We booked a table for the patio...and dropped German's name as he is the Gran Fromage.  When we arrived...on time...we were told no tables on the patio.  We were given the choice of a table in the bar ...or a table in the dining room.\nGiven that the noise level was so pronounced in the bar...we opted for a dark table in the dining room.\nWe sat down, and when the server arrived with the water, we were unable to communicate with each other, as the noise level was intolerable.  Not chic...but NOISE.  So loud, we opted to bolt...and went to another establishment.\n\nI think German does a great job at Local Bistro and would at Central Bistro ife he got the noise level down to an acceptable level.\n\nI was most unhappy that our reservation was not carried out as specified.....but even more disappointed that the lame assed interior DECORATOR thought the noise would be acceptable.\n\nInterior designers and Architects are idiots.  They will blow smoke at you and have you think they know something...when in fact, most all are friggin hacks.\n\nWill not return to any of his restaurants...as we found the noise to be a game changer.\n\nGood luck with the over 35 crowd.  You'll never make it.
