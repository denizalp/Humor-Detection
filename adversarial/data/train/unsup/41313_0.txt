Gonna give Boston Pizza a middle-of-the-road rating.\n\nI've come to this Boston Pizza location a handful of times. Once for food, the rest primarily for drinks.\n\nI find the location to be great, central to most of Mississauga. The patio is also a good size - makes for a good place to spend summer afternoons\/evenings.\n\nService was rather dreadful when myself and our friends visited last night. It took about half an hour for us to settle our bills (given about 9 of us, but half were paying cash). The waiter would come by, set up the credit card machine - and walk off, not coming back for another 5-10 minutes. \n\nThey should consider re-allocating staff to help out. The patio was about half full, but there was only one person managing that entire area.\n\n\nCan't comment on the food at this point, maybe if the chance comes up that I end up trying it.
