I really enjoy this style of Indian food! It feels like Chipotle and feels really clean. I wouldnt go necessarily for an authentic experience but I went with a friend for a quick inexpensive bite. I got the samosa chaat appetizer and that was a good snack and light meal for me and would definitely make it out here again.
