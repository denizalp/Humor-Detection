Naked anything is good right? Naked BBQ it's no exception. They execute standard Bbq perfectly. \n\nNBBQ is tucked in the North East side of I17 & Bell rd. If you see Lamar's donuts, turn in, it's behind them.\n\nI ordered the obligatory pulled pork sandwich, Mac n cheese and a drink. $10.88 not bad. \n\nThe pork was fresh, smoked with oak and pecan, and a good portion. The bun was the prefect size, texture and flavor to compliment the pork. It is served naked go figure. \n\nThe Mac was mixed to order, so there was not just a mushy mess of old soggy macaroni. The cheese sauce used was very good. \n\nIt was served with pickles, I like pickles, these are really good. \n\nI liked both sauces, especially since they are served hot out of a pump dispenser. They both had good flavor. The hot was not hot but had some spice.\n\nI sampled the turkey, it was tender and moist. \nI sampled the hot link, good flavor, not hot.\nI sampled the ribs, great flavor, nice chew good crust.\nI sampled the brisket... ask for sliced not shredded. It was perfection. \n\nThe place is clean and inviting. The service was great and will only get better with time. They are on day 4 today. \n\n The owner Oren was welcoming and liked to hear feedback. You know I will be back. \n\nThey are only open for lunch as they start out. I added the phone number (per yelp they ate adding it) call before you go... They close when it meat it's gone.
