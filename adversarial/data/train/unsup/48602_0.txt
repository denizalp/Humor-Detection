So I've eaten here 4 times in the last year or so and I've had a hit or miss experience. When I want an authentic Argentine asado, this place is great. I haven't had a better experience anywhere in Vegas.\n\nThe empanadas I never miss. These aren't the Mexican style jelly filled empanadas, they are the delicious meat and cheese filled kind. They are so good they take you right to the streets of Argentina. I ordered these my second time there, and every time I go back I always start with them. \n\nI've also ordered other items, that frankly, failed pretty hard. Last time I went I had a breaded and fried chicken, pollo empanizado, it was spendy for what you got. Tasted like it had been bought from the pre-cooked frozen food section of wal-mart, and it didn't look good either. Poor meat quality, and one of those individually sliced cheese squares melted on top. Two people, bill came out to ~$45 for two of those, a plate of three empanadas, and two sodas. \n\nMoral of the story, go there for the beef. Get steak, get there asado style meals, get the things you would want to get if you flew into Buenos Aires, I haven't been dissappointed yet when I order the right items. \n\nBetween my visits with myself and my wife, we each have ordered plates that we didn't like...at all...but when we order the right items, this place can't be beat.\n\nLastly, they have a little store in the back, you can go in and get mate, alfajores, and a whole host of other Argentine products. Not bad at all.
