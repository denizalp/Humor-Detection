During my trips to Vegas, I've been to Fremont Street twice!\nThere is so much energy and it really is a different crowd of people which makes for some good entertainment :) with that being said...\nDO NOT bring your kids! There were girls and some guys standing around with barely anything on, practically naked. Definitely something your little ones shouldn't be looking at! \n\nGambling? Craps and blackjack had a very low minimum and the slot machines were 'antique'..very cool! \n\nAlcohol? So cheap!! Margaritas were like $3 and draft beer was $2 pretty sure I would've spent over $20 on those drinks alone on The Strip. \n\nFood? I've never eaten here..when you see an advertisement for a steak and lobster entree for $9 you should probably be worried..haha! \n\nOverall, I had a great time on both of my trips to the Fremont Street Experience although I only spent around 2hr here each time, that's all we needed ;) \nI do recommend the Zip Line at night, very fun and exhilarating!
