The flagship restaurant of​ Michael Mina's empire in Las Vegas is easily the best place to experience the culinary​ world through his eyes. \n\nIf you are looking for Seafood in Sincity Michael Mina is going to be on a very short list and for good reason; it is the place to experience Michael Mina's world renown creations including Maine Lobster Pot Pie, Miso-glazed Cod, Tartare​ of Ahi tuna, as well as land favorites like Rack of Lamb and American Kobe Ribeye. The accolades are endless: One Michelin Star, AAA Four-Diamond Awards, Mobil Four-Star Award... along with countless others thanks to their impeccable​ service and a menu that offers modern​ Seafood and polished​ American cuisine uniquely prepared using seasonal produce all under the careful watch of Executive Chef Nick Sharpe. \n\nI did plenty of research prior to my visit and knew that it would be a sacrilege​ to not try the single dish that every Mina fanboy\/girl has heard about for over a decade, the infamous Phyllo-Crusted Sole. A delicate​, flaky filet of Sole is coated dragged​ in Phyllo Crumbs that have been baked in sheets and then crumbled to adhere to the Sole Steaks. The result once fried is a textured crunchy crust with a heavenly mouthfeel. This is served along with Crab Brandade, Pea Shoots, and a Dijon sauce in​ what has to be the single best Seafood recipe I have ever tasted that isn't served at New York City's Le Bernardin​. This truly is a ​distinctive dish.​ \n\nThe only regret I have was not being able to also order the heralded​  Maine Lobster Pot Pie as I tried a bite of a companion's​ and almost fell out of my chair from the rich & buttery Truffle-Lobster Cream. Looks like I will need to make a return trip... what a shame...\n\nMichael Mina provided a perfect backdrop with wonderful, creative cuisine that is a must-try for any self-respecting​culinary​ adventurer​ that finds themselves in Las Vegas. This one is completely worth the splurge.
