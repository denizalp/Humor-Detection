Brookline History Note: This used to be Boulevard Ice Cream until very recently. Many years before that it was a Baskin Robbins. \n\nOk, so after our nice Italian meal at Mateo's, I felt like ice cream. Ashamedly I hadn't been here in a while and was surprised to find that it changed hands again. \n\nI HAD to have a hot fudge sundae. So I got one. With chocolate marshmallow and butter pecan. Whipped cream, nuts, no cherry.\n\nOoomph. It hit the spot. \n\nWhen I was a little kid, I used to scoop out the hot fudge and eat it first.  I haven't grown out of that. :D\n\nMy date got a Cotton Candy ice cream double scoop cone. \n\nMan, they make ice cream out of anything don't they? It was amazing. Loved it.\n\nThey have fresh made waffle cones too! It's the first scent that hits your nose when you walk in. \n\nNote: They're remodeling, so don't be put off by how modest it is inside. It should only get better. \n\nNice service too. The guy running the joint looks and sounds as if he could be a mechanic or a remodeler, discussing ice cream like he's talking about carburetor's or putting up drywall. \n\nOnly in Pittsburgh. Love it. \n\nGet your ice cream here instead of at the market. I saw people walking out with fresh scooped pints, so they will do that for you. They have a mouthful of flavors here too. Take a date there on a warm summer evening and stroll dahn the Boulevard holdin' hands and eatin' ice cream.
