it's alright. decent price, no wait. and service is fast. \n\ni only had a spam musubi for $2. it helped ease my growling stomach. I had a few bites of the kalua pork -- it was okay.. i wish the cabbage and the pork were more shredded. And it was too watery. I like it a bit more dry. The rice that came with was not hot and was not soft either. It tasted like day old rice. -- no bueno.\n\non another note this place definitely satisfies your hungry stomach.
