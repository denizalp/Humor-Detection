What a excellent establishment.  Every menu item from begining to end is delicous, along with the strong drinks.  Had a nice assortment of food from a seafood appetizer ( sushi was so good I ordered another round for me and wife before dinner) to a wonderful steak meal.  I would highly recommend a visit.
