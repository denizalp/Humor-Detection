Absolutely love going to Polished for my \"me time\". \n\nI always book my appointments with Lil Kim. She's my favorite and one of the most popular girls there. I trust her with my life, and by my life I clearly mean my nails. I never leave disappointed.\n\nWhenever Lil Kim isn't able to do my pedicure, I always book with Ivy. She's the sweetest! \n\nI used to not be a fan of the receptionist, but thankfully they got rid of the bad apples so now service is 100% on point.
