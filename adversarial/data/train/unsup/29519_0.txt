Arrived early for this tour at the designated location. Our tour guide arrived just before the tour time and chatted with us pleasantly while we waited for the other tour takers to arrive. One couple had not arrived by the designated time, so she attempted to call them while we continued to wait. The guide was bubbly, informative and engaging - she definitely made the tour a great experience. \n\nThe tour went to a few locations: Delysees, Forno Cultura, Dlish Cupcakes, Nadege Patisserie and Dufflet - all of which were expecting to see us and had amazing food. \n\nDefinitely DO NOT eat before coming to this as there is more samples than you will be able to finish!!
