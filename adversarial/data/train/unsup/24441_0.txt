I was so angry when I left this place. I take my tea very seriously! A friend of mine ordered a nice looseleaf white tea, which was okay, I guess. I ordered a \"Masala Chai\" which seemed very exotic and fancy on the menu, with Cardamom and blah blah. I took one sip and it tasted familiar -- LIKE THE COSTCO CHAI TEA MIX I HAVE AT HOME & AT WORK. I was outraged. I was paying like five dollars for this supposed ~Masala chai. I tried to explain the situation to them and they didn't do anything about it. They said they used a \"sweetening mix\" with honey, etc. I asked to see it, and they showed me a bucket of light brown powder which looked an awful lot like the chai mix you buy at Costco. I still get angry when I think about this. The girls working there were very standoffish and intimidating. I didn't dare ask for my money back as they wouldn't even look me in the eye. I felt like it was just a waste of time and money. I will NOT be returning and I will be telling everyone about this.
