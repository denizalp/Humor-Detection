The food was great, the ambiance is more of a romantic setting and the prices are what you would expect for a steakhouse. I had the Sea Bass with saut√©ed spinach. This was absolutely delicious! Talk about having your meal prepared the right way. My daughter choose to have a steak, so she selected a 12 ounce New York Strip with a baked potato. She said the steak was tender, juicy and absolutely delicious. I took her word for it because she is the most picky eater I have ever seen. Her friend had the Bacon wrapped shrimp, which is an appetizer, but the shrimp were huge. I guess you would call them super jumbo. She said they were delicious. The two of them had a glass of Merlot wine, while I chose to have a glass of Stella Artois (beer). Because we were celebrating my daughter's birthday, the waiter brought her a complimentary \"Happy Birthday\" dessert which I believe was cheesecake. After a few seconds, it was gone. Another delicious choice.\n\nThis steakhouse is located within the Aria Casino and Resort. Since we stayed at the Aria, this was a great choice for my daughter's birthday dinner. The restaurant is very big with plenty of seating. It's great for large or small parties. Overall, this steakhouse was a great choice. I will be back for another round of Sea Bass.
