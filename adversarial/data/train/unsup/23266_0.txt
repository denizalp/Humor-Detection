There are two kinds of pastries in this world. The light, flaky crusted, and delicate creations with frothy meringues and lightly sweetened glazes. This is not that place.\n\nThe other kind of pastry celebrates butter. And sugar. And smacks your tastebuds and knocks your stomach in the gut while taking your blood sugar on a new adventure. Now, usually that kind of pastry is reserved for a less refined bakery; usually it's reserved for a place that sells \"sweets\" and \"baked goods\" and not pastries. So in the world of pastries, Mirabelle occupies a little bit of that rare in between space. That space where pastries still reflect art, but aren't fluffy. That place where baked goods are good still an art, but an art that will definitely spoil your dinner. \n\nAs I sat on the streets of downtown Urbana, looking over the bag of bakery items I had just selected, I realized that I was indeed going to spoil my dinner. It began with a massive pepperoni and cheese focaccia\/pizza. This thing was huge. HUGE. And it was like $4. For the budget-conscious eater (you hear me, students?) your adventure begins and ends here. I had waffled between this and a sandwich, but went with the hot focaccia. Next time I'll grab the sandwich, but not as a preference, just as a means to keep exploring the menu.\n\nMy bag also included a slice of raspberry cheesecake, a chocolate dipped macaroon, and a raspberry almond horn. All wonderful choices. All very heavy, but in the good dessert heavy kind of way. I'm a sucker for almond flavor, and this was packed with flavoring, plus covered with slivers of the nuts. And the little dollup of raspberry is just enough to offset that almond punch.\n\nI got through almost everything in one sitting, then walked down the road a bit, found a darling little alley and sat down on a bench, looked across at an ivy-covered brick wall, and polished off the rest. Sublime.
