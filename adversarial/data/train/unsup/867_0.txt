Very average to less than average hotel compared to the others in Las Vegas. I was debating between a 2 and a 3 rating. \n\nThe room is large enough and the bed is not too bad, but the bathroom is tiny and not many amenities. \n\nThe bigger issue is the noise. This is one of the noisiest hotels I have ever stayed in. I can hear the conversations and coughs in the next door rooms. And the loud conversations of everyone coming down the very busy hallway. It sounds like they are in my room with no wall separating them. \n\nWe had a pool view but the pool is completely drained and we also have a lovely view of bland old rooftops.
