Saw this place newly opened last time with lots of people. We got there close to 9pm and there are still many people so thinking this place should be good. Ordered a chicken shawarma with rice and Philly cheese steak. First the food takes really long and the person at the register placing the order not very good at explaining. It's more like he has a script that he just read it from there. Anyways, it took more than 30mins for the food and by the time when I start eating at home, then I just realized they forgot about the sauce on my chicken shawarma. So now I got chicken and rice that are dry and no taste and I ended up putting chilli sauce instead. The Philly cheese steak is tasty just like the other Philly cheese steak sandwich, but the pita bread isn't soft and the steak is tough. Had some hard time biting it. Overall, not recommend this place but maybe they can do better after not be so busy.
