Well lets see they are probably the best supplement store in town by a large margin and that's probably because how the prices are almost as good or even better than those online and you don't have to pay or wait for delivery. It seems like everyone knows about them and even travels across town for them.\n\nHonestly I use to only shop at GNC and Vitamin Shoppe just because I didn't know any better, not knocking GNC or Vitamin Shoppe they have lots of items and have always had friendly knowledgeable staff but Vegas Discount Nutrition has that and more.  They pretty much have everything I need when I need it now, everything else I'd probably get online. I believe they match online prices too.\n\nIt kind of sucks that they are located next to a Red Robin and a bakery shops.  It's basically surrounded by lots of places to eat at being located near South Eastern and 215. ALL THAT TEMPTATION!!\n\nThey always offer free samples when you buy something. Of course I'll be back, as long as I don't give up.
