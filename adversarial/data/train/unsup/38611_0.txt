Very negative and disappointing experience here last month re the 2 teen or young adult cashiers and inappropiate conversation at the check out (one was working the register, the other was chatting to her).  Lots of talk re drinking and antics of her friend's mother related to that, including \"standing on top of her car and peeing\", etc.\nQuite unbelieveable the conversation was going on.  I was the 2nd person in line and the two women in front of me had a young girl (about 5 or 6) w\/them listening to the whole thing.  I e-mailed corporate office and got an immediate response.  Apparently this location is a franchise but they said they'd pass the complaint on.
