Disclaimer: I love board games. When I heard that \"live\" board games were coming to Toronto I forced my various groups of friends to try them out. I've completed about a dozen of them with a pretty high escape rate. My bragging aside, this craze spread fast and sadly that brought about a loss of quality and creativity. A lot of recent ones have resorted to the cookie cutter model of \"stuck in one room, solve a locked box to reveal... another locked box\". \n\nDisclaimer #2: Slight spoilers ahead. Next Relic is luckily not that. It's a multi level and multi room maze with a creative start. Large rooms, well decorated to set the mood, with various types of puzzles. You need to use your puzzle solving skills as well as having honed vision and hearing to solve some of the riddles. It's a bit pricier than the usual \"one room\" escape rooms but given the size and creativity it's well worth the price.
