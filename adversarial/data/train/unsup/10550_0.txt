1. Very old fashioned and the furniture says so too, but I love how spacious my room was. I stayed in 4-128 and shared a king bed with my friend and we had more than enough space.\n2. The room had a faint mj smell when we first walked in, but disappeared by nighttime. Our room had a king bed, 2 tvs, a dining table with chairs, office table with a work chair, a couch, 2 single seat sofas, and a coffee table. The bathroom had a standing shower, bathtub, double sinks, vanity, and separate toilet. \n3. I loved the gym so much. Go to the one located where the spa is. Everything there is super clean and updated, and it's never busy. \n4. Do. Not. Touch. Any. Snack. Or. Drink. In. The. Room. Seriously don't. Even if you pick up the can of Pringles and put it back right away, they will charge you!\n5. Because there is alcohol in the room, it's sitting neatly in the fridge so you have no fridge space whatsoever to store drinks or leftovers.\n6. Take advantage of the ice room. Use it as a makeshift fridge or even drink it when it melts. Water is so hard to find in this hotel. No water fountains nearby. \n7. Only downfall to The Venetian is the secondhand smoke that comes with every casino.
