I am from LA, and I've had boba from a LOT of places. I would actually consider myself a boba connoisseur. I definitely thought that Kung fu Tea is among the top contenders for best boba places that I've tried. I actually wish they had one in LA!\n\nI ordered the most famous oolong tea milk tea with boba and it was amazing! The automatic shaking machine they use really infused the milk into the tea and even gave it a frothy texture. Strong oolong taste but not too strong where it was over-bearing.  \n\nI remember the boba being very chewy and had a great texture and overall very consistent. \n\nHope they open one in LA soon and will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.
