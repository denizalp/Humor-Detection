Solid performer in the neighborhood, had some good meals so far.  Surprised to read all the poor reviews; maybe the place has gotten into their rhythm finally!   Cheaper than Renegades next door, and a welcome bit of competition as Renegades has gone down in my opinion. \n\nThe date and brie appetizer is awesome; the fig and proscuttio pizza also a delight (I think it was a special but I had it at least twice in a few weeks!).  I tend to prefer the bar area (full menu available, nice high-top tables and casual atmosphere). The service can be on the slow side, but there is one waitress there who kicks ass - definitely been around the restaurant business a while, knows her job and does it well (don't know her name but she has dark hair and a powerful personality!). They do have a few 'only in Scottsdale' blonds and a rather detached lady manning the 'front door' ... but all part of the experience!  Bartender is great. \n\nAnd you must try the Zeppole's ... I'm not a dessert person but even I can't resist these things!
