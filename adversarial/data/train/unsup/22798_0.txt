My first visit, I thought this place was dope. Very Non-North Scottsdale... kinda. Whatever this means. I guess its meaning, I was impressed without catching an uncontrollable itch. \n\nIt is cool, quaint, a bit chainy... but ok for a new experience.\n\nThe basic menu is what you would expect from a chained \"Grill.\" The main reason to visit is the dessert menu, which most of the reviewers have agreed. The White Chocolate Brownie IS better than sex. Yes, ok guys... not many men say this, but obviously you don't know my ex-, unless you were in Old Town Scottsdale 3 months ago and the douchnozzle reading this review. It just wasn't that great, but the White Chocolate Brownie... scrumpths without her 14 yr old boyish figure.\n\nGo with someone that isn't a cadaverous lay and has great taste in dessert delights. You'll be happy with the visit.
