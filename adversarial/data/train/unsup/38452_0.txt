Nice stadium, they keep it nice and cool on those hot summer days in Arizona! They do a really nice firework display on Friday nights! \nThe Qoors Light lounge is awesome they do happy hour tell 6:30, it's a great place to watch the game from they have TV's, a pool table and the line for drinks isn't to bad. \nI also recommend the Sonora Hot Dog it's amazing! \nMy only compliant is you can't hear the announcer very well at all and the music they play pre-game during batting practice should be way louder too!
