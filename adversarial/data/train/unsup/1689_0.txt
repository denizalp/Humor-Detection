Good food, reasonable prices, and friendly service in a space with a distinct Latin flair (bachata music was playing when my friend and I dined here). The enchilada I ordered was covered in Oaxacan mole - just take note of that, as people who are accustomed to standard red or green enchilada sauces may not be used to this dark, sweet preparation.
