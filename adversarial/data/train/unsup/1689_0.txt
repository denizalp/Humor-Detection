Social House Seven is a taste of NYC in the PGH. The decor is just gorgeous, from the opium den with projected smoke on the walls to the main dining area featuring giant statues surrounded in candles, and a beautiful open kitchen where you could occasionally catch a giant fire cooking your food, I couldn't stop admiring my surroundings! The extra effort in decor is what pushed this wonderful place to a five star!\n\nHonestly, starting with the decor was tough because the food was just as much to be admired! We ordered sharing plates as the waitress suggested some dishes serve 2-4. She's was correct! The sushi was delish! Be sure to try the Pop Rocks. Who knew that Pop Rocks on sushi made so much sense? Another stand out dish was the truffle risotto, with giant scoop of truffle butter that had to be mixed at the table. For those who hate truffle oil flavor - you will appreciate the use of multiple mushrooms to achieve flavor without dousing it in truffle oil.  It's a bit on the sweet side which I adored.\nThe sangria was the best I've had anywhere! It featured seasonal blackberries and pomegranate. Today, I'm featuring a 'worth it' hangover!
