Whenever I have a craving for some fine Mexican burrito I turn to Chipotle!!! The ingredients are always fresh and oh so delicious!! The service is always friendly and mighty fast!! Your burrito or bowl is done right in front of your eyes!!! :) I will keep coming to this Kierland spot for more since they deserve the business and always give you everything with a warm smile!! \nMakes my tummy happy!!!
