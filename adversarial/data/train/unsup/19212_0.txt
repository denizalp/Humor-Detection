If I had a last meal on earth this would be it! MMMMM Bailey's in my Cream Puff? Ummm yes please! I wanted to eat the entire box om nom nom. OH you have coconut and Bailey's all up in my cream puff?! Well I think I have lived and enjoyed the decadence of my favourite things all rolled into one.\n\nI wanted to lick to the box. Seriously these cream puffs are to die for. I normally hate chocolate covered anything but these I make an exception for. The only thing I can say more is eat these cream puffs and enjoy the sheer magnificence of them. Now excuse me while I dab the drool off my face.
