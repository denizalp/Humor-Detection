I'm not sure where to really start to review this place.\n\nIt is in a great location at Town Square, so it could be a good place to stop in if you were shopping there or going tothe movies there. It has kinda cool decor...sort of a rock n' roll theme with guitars on the wall and photos of people like Taylor Swift & Bon Jovi. The bar has lots of TVs for sports, too.\n\nWe went in the afternoon, so it was really dead, which made me feel like the service should have been fantastic, but it wasn't. Our sever, Danielle, seemed to be stoned out of her mind. She talked really really slow, and said things like \"restauarants are in my genetic make up\" and \"I can make recommendations 'cause I work here\". She was nice enough, but there was visible dirt under her fingernails and she kept leaning all over the table to make her aforementioned recommendations...which kinda grossed me out.\n\nThe food and drinks took FOREVER which, again, I couldn't understand since were were practically the only people there. We ended up ordering 2 appetizers (pulled pork sliders & cheeseburger sliders) and sharing. Both were served with french fries that were ICE COLD. The sliders were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nIt took forever to get the check, and the bill came to over $30 for only the 2 appetizers, an iced tea, and a soda. So, in my opinion, WAY over priced!\n\nI can pretty much say with certainty, I won't be back.
