For unique eateries, you can't go wrong with anything in the Paris hotel. Surprisingly, the wait was fairly short.  I ordered the crepes suzette(oranges aplenty) and my gf ordred the favorite(strawberry and raspberry). Both were very tasty, should satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Keep in mind, if you order something with fruit, use the napkins as you might get hard-to-clean berries on your shirt or skirt, as my gf found out.\n\nThey didn't serve full coffee, which I think they should(lattes, mochas, etc.) to complete the crepes experience. My only real complaint is that the seating is limited and shared with the bakery next door. For the value, though, a great meal at roughly 20 bucks for two. A great place for a late breakfast, snack, or dessert!
