Waking up at 5:30am is a new habit of mine. I try to be as healthy as possible and go to the gym. Afterwards, I am a ravenous fiend and it is hard to not give in to breakfast. By the time I am finished, it is 8am and there is not many options in Chinatown for breakfast. Usually mixed reviews scare me, but I want to experience a place before completely dismissing an establishment.\n\nIt is one of those come expecting nothing and leaving with everything type of encounters. Breakfast places tend to not be the healthiest, so I do not even pretend that it is low in calories. I ordered a Veggie Omelet($9.99) minus cheese add avocado. Cheese and I have a love hate relationship. When it comes to omelets, I prefer the green stuff to give my meal a velvety texture. The vegetables are not overflowing, but had a nice mix of tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers. The egg mixture was fluffy yet solid which was impressive. Usually tomatoes and mushrooms release water making the omelet runny, but not here. It kept it's shape well and was delightful. A side of home fries or hash accompanies it. Don't forget about the toast, fried bread, or apple fritter. I got the last item and it was good. I have my dad to blame for my love of this fried treat since childhood. The fry each one to order then slather on the icing. When it arrives, it is pipping hot and needs a minute to cool. Trust me, those two minutes are the most excruciating. Once past magma stage it is great except the middle was not cooked all the way.\n\nMy waitress was the only one working today. If it was busy, this would be problematic. Since there were three other tables besides myself, she was attentive. I didn't get that \"welcome to my house\" feel everyone was talking about, but it was cozy. \n\nCheck out the specials on Tuesday-Friday. There is a list of options for under $5. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/qjLlFfu2pnJ9lVYlj-4QVg?select=OSaZJITQDnMHu9sP7UVQwg
