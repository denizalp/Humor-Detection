The motel 6 hookers scared me.  I was convinced that I was going to have to drive across town to find a place to stay that wasn't OBVIOUSLY infested with hookers, and didn't cost more than $100 to stay at.  As I made my getaway from Motel 6 aka the Tropicana Brothel, I noticed this Travelodge with its quarter full parking lot and lack of vagrants.  \n\nI made a quick right turn, parked, and walked into the office where I met Scarlet.  The office was clean, and Scarlet was just lovely.  After a quick exchange of questions and answers, I was handing over my credit card so that she could check me in.  I got a ground room floor with a parking spot directly in front of my door.\n\nThe room was neat and clean with a bunch of amenities I don't use even when I'm at home.  Amenities like a hair dryer, coffee maker, and safe.  I did however make use of the fridge, air conditioning, and tv.  For those of you who need to be near water, there is a pool located in the center of the parking lot behind the front office.  Oh, and YES, the shower worked, and wasn't disgusting!\n\nLater I found myself checking out some brochures in the front office, trying to figure out what to see and do in the Las Vegas area.  Scarlet happened to be a local, born and raised in Las Vegas.  I explained I like doing outdoorsy type stuff, away from hookers and stinky gamblers.  She told me about Red Rock and the Valley of Fire, gave me directions, and good sound advice that usually only locals can give.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, if I'm not going to stay at one of the bigger fancier hotels that cost helluv $$$  I will totally be staying here at this Travelodge.  It's just a block or two off of Tropicana which is not very far from the strip at all.  The place wasn't over run with hookers and pimps.  The room was neat, clean, and well maintained.  Most of all Scarlet made a lasting impression with all the helpful and down to earth advice she gave me about the Las Vegas area.
