I'm so glad our hotel at this place wasn't expensive.  We found the best price on strip for this hotel through a website during a holiday.  I'm so glad it was across the street from Omnia too.  Saved us a cab ride or 2!\n\nWe got a $9 per day off Starbucks for our stay too which was great.  Too bad we didn't have time to use the first day's worth; it doesn't roll over either.\n\nThe only cons were the rooms had dim lighting (we took the tops off the lamps) and that the ice machine on our floor was broken. And I got a splinter from looking for the cord to that mini fridge bar that was disconnected or no longer in service.  That sucked.
