When Viet Thai first opened many moons ago, we went barreling in  one evening and what I remember was it being newly painted, sparse and no alcohol license yet.  So a group of eight, turned around to leave, my mom tells the man, \"we come back when you have alcohol.\"  I thought good lord, let me get this woman out of here!\n\nI decided to give it a try yesterday, it looked totally different from my first visit. The two people were working were pleasant and efficient.  I ordered fresh rolls and vermicelli with pork.  There is something very addictive in Vietnamese food, maybe it's the cilantro and mint or the fish sauce, but you can bet, I want to eat there again today.\n\nAnd yes, mama, they do have alcohol, it's safe to return.
