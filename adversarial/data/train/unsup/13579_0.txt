This review is a tough one for me. For years and years I have hated discount tire- not as a customer but as a small business competitor. I owned a repair shop up until about 5 years ago and grew to despise all that they represented, kind of like the Wal-Mart of the tire world. Nevertheless in the interest of an honest review here goes:\n\nThe wife's car got a flat last night, too late to do anything about it, I threw the spare (which I ALWAYS check the pressure on) on and drove it home. Looked up online last night and found the tire I needed in stock at this location. \n\nCalled this morning 10 minutes before they opened and actually got a helpful employee who confirmed they had the tire. It was my plan to just drop the loose wheel off and swing back in a few hours to get it and put it back on myself. When I got there I walked in, placed my order, paid my bill and went to get the wheel and leave it by their door. The salesman jumped out from behind the counter, threw on some gloves and took the wheel around for me- nice... this is something I would have done for a customer. \n\nHe brought it around and told me that it would only be about 20 minutes or so and I could wait- Sweet, maybe my day is not totally screwed this early in the morning. I sit down, call the wife, try not to take too much credit for getting this whole thing sorted out quickly and wait :)\n\nThe icing on the cake of my story- the guy takes my keys, pulls the car around, puts the wheel on, puts away the spare and checks the pressure and torque on all of the remaining wheels- Also something I would have done in the past. \n\nAll in all a really good experience, and on top of it all, they did it cheaper than I could have done it by calling up anyone I still know in the business. Damn you and your great prices, quick service and streamlined processes!!!\n\nAnyway, in my honest opinion, they are hard to beat.
