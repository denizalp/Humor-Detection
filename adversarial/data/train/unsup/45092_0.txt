This place is fantastic! Service is great, sushi pieces are large, and they are delicious.  The price is not cheap but the quality and presentation make up for the slightly heftier price.  You can tell it is a favorite of the locals as the place is always full, no matter what day it is.  As always you can save a lot of money by going with the chef's special, but for me that is too much of a risk, I like what I like and don't want things that I may not enjoy.  In any case try this restaurant out, I don't think you will regret it.
