I can see this location from my office window...it's always there...taunting me with it's neon signs.  I look at the sad little cup o' noodles I brought for lunch...then I look back at Jimmy John's....and before I know it I'm beginning an online order.  I can't help it.  \n\nTheir commercials say they deliver \"subs so fast you'll freak\" and they ain't kiddin'.  Today 5-20-16 we got our order in about ten minutes!  The sammiches are always tasty and fresh.  My favorites are the \"big john\", \"totally tuna\" and \"turkey tom\".  \n\nIf you like pickles you gotta try theirs...they're amazing! They remind me of Claussen pickles but they are fresh and bright green and so wonderful.  A whole one is $1.25 but soooo worth it.  \n\nI'm takin' off one star because every single time I've ordered from here there has been at least one thing wrong.  The first time, the sprouts were missing.  The second time, they forgot my pickle.  Today, my sandwich was missing the mustard.  They are efficient but apparently not detail-oriented.
