It's really hit or miss with the people at European Wax Center. The thing you need to do is find one person that does the waxing you like and then never lose them. Until you find that one person, things can be a bit hairy (hehe--sorry). \n\nI get my eyebrows waxed pretty consistently but for 9 months of the year I'm in Tucson and the other 3 I'm in Scottsdale, so I actually have 2 girls who I trust. \n\nUnfortunately, when I came back to Scottsdale in late May I found out my normal girl in Scottsdale no longer worked there. I was devastated. I really thought we had a good thing going on. \n\nWith no other options, I was forced to try seeing new people. The first 2 girls I saw were...let's say, not my style. I've found that if I don't like their eyebrows then I probably won't like mine when they're done with them. Sometimes I just want to have all the aestheticians line up and look at their eyebrows. \n\nI finally found someone new and I couldn't be happier. I will continue to go to European Wax Center and visit my girls:  Whitney and Crystal
