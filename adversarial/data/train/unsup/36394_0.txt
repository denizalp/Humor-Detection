I set down here to weather a long layover.  I wasn't overly hungry, so I had the chili.  Setved in a small griddle, it was homemade and good.  The decor was fun.  Now the issues: the chili came with a plastic spoon and no napkin.  When I  made a complaint, the waitress produced a spoon quickly, explaining that wait staff were throwing them away, so they were short!  Second issue: my double bourbon on the rocks was very small, although disguised by the ice.  Ill go elsewhere next time.
