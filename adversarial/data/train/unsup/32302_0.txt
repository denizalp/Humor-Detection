Spent the winter researching a new air conditioning system as we knew from last summer that our aging A\/C units would probably not make it through another long, Arizona summer!  I am very glad we chose AZ's Dukes of Air!  Not only are we very happy with our new units and new wifi thermostats, but the crew they sent to install our new system was amazing!  Manny, Luis, Freddie, Beto and Danny were on time, very professional, clean and did a fantastic job!  They trained me on the new wifi thermostats and got me all set up on my phone!  I love it already!  Thanks guys!
