For $6.99 I had a Taco Meal - which consisted of 2 small chicken soft-shell tacos, rice, and refried beans. You get a side of fresh salsa.\n\nThe meal was very delightful. Full of flavor, and freshly prepared.\n\nIf you are a fan of real mexican food, I recommend this place. For $6.99, you can't complain. Definitely will come here again!!
