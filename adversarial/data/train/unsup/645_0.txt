The GF and I walk by this place all the time, we finally decided to give it a try after reading up on the generally favorable reviews on Yelp.  I'd like to start off by saying this place is really hard to find.  There aren't any real indications on the outside that it's a Japanese restaurant.  No sign flippers or big pictures of their menu on display.  Just look out for the many people on the patio eating curry bowls and sashimi!\n\nThe food is good, not good enough to speed dial home to your mom and tell her you're taking her here next mothers day though.  You can tell the food is made with care and by actual Japanese chefs in the back.  How do I know this you ask?  Well I heard them speaking Japanese to each other!  I had the Pork Katsu Curry dish and the GF went with the salmon sashimi.  Both were made quick and came out fresh.  Only problem though, the portions were a bit small.  So small that I went to red bench after to gorge on ice cream sandwiches because I was still hungry.\n\nThey take credit card surprisingly as most of these types of places are cash only, so that was a plus.  A brother has to collect his air miles knowmsayin?  Service was a bit slow, but they were pretty friendly.  Expect to drop about $50 for a small dinner for 2 at this place, knowing you will be hungry after.  Overall, I'd come back here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice for Japanese in the downtown area.
