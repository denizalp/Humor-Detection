This is a great place to go snag morning coffee when you're in the area. The service was excellent and the guy behind the counter was working hard to get drinks perfect and out quickly. Only thing we didn't like was the size of the omelette and that we paid for a side that was pretty small too. Other than that the place gets my business whenever I go back.
