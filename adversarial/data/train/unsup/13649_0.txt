So I went to Sushi Kaya to meet my cousin for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I was impressed with the fast and friendly service. We decided on the all-you-can-eat menu. The sushi rolls were good, but portions and the rolls were small. \n\nAfter having a wonderful time and great conversation, my cousin pointed to \"something\" crawling behind my bench. Needless to say, a friendly ROACH paid us a visit. I stopped eating as I felt sick to my stomach. We asked for the check as quickly as possible.\nI WILL NOT BE BACK. They need to spray that entire restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nI was so disappointed. 1 star for the cockroach! :(
