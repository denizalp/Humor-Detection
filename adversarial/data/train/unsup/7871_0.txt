Eight out of ten times when someone compliments me on something I'm wearing, it's a piece I scored secondhand from Value Village.  From vintage to new with tags, you can find a vast clothing selection for your earnest or ironic wearing pleasure.\n\nThis place is huge, and if you haven't gone even once you need to stop reading this review and just go already.  If you've gone and you aren't a total convert, here are a few suggestions.   Go on a non-weekend day, things are calmer there and you won't have to wait a million years for a change stall.  Sat\/Sun is like specially reserved for post-brunch hungover hipsters.  So don't even bother.  Go on like Tuesday at 7pm.  Bring a friend who knows your taste and likewise so you can grab stuff for each other.  Be methodical - you will be surprised at the happy surprises that might await you in the book aisle, or in an aisle of clothes that aren't even your style\/preferred gender presentation\/size.  Things get put back incorrectly or just weirdly in the first place, so you will stumble across some steals.\n\nThere are periodic sales to clear out old stock, check it out but remember things will be more picked over.  A couple weeks before Halloween the place goes crazy but if you've got an original idea for a costume you're guaranteed to find great stuff.  Don't neglect to check out the furniture for solid wood\/metal\/plastic pieces, but just remember the cardinal rule - don't buy anything that can't fit in a washing machine to be fully sterilized.  After your trip, head down the block to the samosa place and gorge on the delicious fried goodies (3\/a dollar! 10\/three dollars!).
