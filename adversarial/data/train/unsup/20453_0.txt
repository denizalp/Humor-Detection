Best club I've been to in Vegas---probably the best I've been to EVER.\n\nHip hop room is small but they play some good oldies (rap\/hiphop) that I never knew I missed so much.\n\nTheir light installation in the EDM room is AMAZING. \n\nNotes:\n* Large outdoor area WITH gambling tables (wahhhhhttt?????)\n* EDM room lights are mesmerizing\n* Drinks are expensive, but where is it not in vegas?\n* Bring folding flats. Thank me later.
