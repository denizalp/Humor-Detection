We ended here on a concert night so everything was crowded. With a handicap van, I had to park three blocks away. That is not the fault of this restaurant, but...this place was so noisy we had to yell at one another across the table to have conversation. The prices in my opinion are rather high... $14 for a burger and the fries are extra??? After eating some appetizers, we left and went elsewhere so we could enjoy our visit with one another. However, the food we did have was tasty.
