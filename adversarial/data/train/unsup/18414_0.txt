Yummeh!\n\nI was craving something sweet with my friend while we were walking through the path so he took me here.  They have a number of mini puff pastries flavours so while I figured I should only have one (trying to be good) the worker advised that they sell the mini pastries in sets of four. Well, I couldn't argue with that!   I'll take the apricot, sour cherry, chocolate and apple & vanilla pudding ones then.  The pastries were all flakey and were like two-bite puffs.  The sour cherry wasn't really sour but did taste like cherry and I didn't care for the sourness anyway so that worked for me.  I had the chocolate & cherry consecutively and thought that they should have a chocolate cherry puff - now that would be good!\nThe 4 pastries were only $2.50 - a great price, especially for a place in the Path. \n\nNote: They also offer savoury puffs.
