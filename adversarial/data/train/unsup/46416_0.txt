I am not sure why there are so many low ratings here but let me tell you my impressions.\n\nIt is a little pricey but with the dinner service you get all you can eat crab legs (snow crab) and all of the legs are cut in half for easy and quick access to the meat.   They do have claws but they are not cut (probably due to the thickness of the shell) but every waitstaff has crackers if you ask for it.   \nDrinks are self serve and are one of those machines that has every flavor and lots of different choices.   The Chinese food is not so great but maybe that is a function of me eating in the large Asian community next to las vegas and food there is so good.\n\nThe dessert bar is so good and full of choices.   They also have a pasta bar where they will make you fresh pasta exactly to your specifications.\n\nIt is one of my favorite buffets in las vegas and I have eaten at many that were just huge disappointments.
