Good solid food, the kind your mom back in Indiana made.  Candy gives you homemade and no frills. The service is friendly and enthusiastic. The ambiance is human-friendly. The music soft and the prices easy. Nothing spectacular on the menu, but if you're looking for a decent breakfast or lunch, you could do a lot worse.
