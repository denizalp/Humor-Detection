My husband was verrrrry pleased to discover we are in Chito's delivery zone. He's a huge fan of all things cheap shawarma, and let's be honest, so am I. We got their chicken, rice and salad plate (extra sauce, duh) for dinner tonight and they were perfect. Our daughter isn't old enough for spicy so we ordered her a panzerotti to pick at. Who doesn't love a giant pizza pocket? Show me the man who doesn't love a giant pizza pocket!
