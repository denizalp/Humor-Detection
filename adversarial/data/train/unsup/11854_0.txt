I appreciate your response however,  it is only because I made this Yelp review otherwise?  The fact of the matter is (after asking my daughter) the girls got a locker and were on their way to get on a ride the park closed.  They didn't even GET IN the water.  Did that take 30 minutes?  Maybe?.  Even if that is the case, why isn't there any compensation for the locker or tube rentals if it takes 30 minutes to do that?  The most annoying comment that you sent me was in the private e-mail that said the Operations Manger offered to extend the ticket and that an ABSOLUTE LIE!  You were not on that call and apparently that is what she told you. She didn't say \"too bad\" but her attitude did.  When asking to talk to whomever supervised her, she stated that I couldn't talk to anyone above her because this was a family owned and operated business.  I realize that weather is out of your control and that is fine, however, the rain checks should not have expiration dates.  Let this be a warning to anyone coming from out of town during Monsoon season that although the website says you can come back with a rain check, it will likely expire before you come back.  The weather policy is not clear like expressed,  I only had 1 child that paid but if I had several, I would even be more irritated!!
