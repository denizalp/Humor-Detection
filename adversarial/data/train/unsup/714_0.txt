NEVER USE THIS SERVICE!!! \n\nA couple days ago I would have recommended using uber, but I have now been taken advantage of. Apparently #UBER likes to make its customers suffer and pay an outrageous rate in order to benefit it's employees during peak times... when uber expects to be busy they will increase the fare anywhere from 2x to 15x the normal price!!! So this past Friday night I paid $9 to go 3 miles, the same trip home was $56!!! Talk about a poor business ethic! I wasn't the only person hit, my friend George was hit with $176 bill, and ive heard others with the same story!!! \n\nUber needs to reevaluate it's business model, their idea is to increase the rates to promote drivers to get on the road... but why should the customer be punished for lack of drivers...?? how about this uber, instead YOU give an inside incentive instead of jacking the prices up!! \n\nNEVER AGAIN! I'm spreading the word and making sure people know that this business is bad!
