There's no place like home. Fresh Cup is home. By the transitive property, there's no place like Fresh Cup. That was my logic when I first went into KFT and ordered the classic boba milk tea.\n\nI was disappointed. The boba was hard and the milk tea just wasn't what I was used to. I told myself I would never go back.\n\nBut people kept going on and on about KFT and how good their teas are. So I gave it a second chance and was pleasantly surprised. Nowhere else in the city can you get such flavorful tea with attentive smiling youngsters ready to adjust your drink if you find anything wrong. \n\nFrom my personal experience and opinion, KFT is great for teas and not for anything milky. The \"wow\" milk was more like \"eh\" milk.\n\n+ Positive Notes +\nService is amazing all the time.\nThe tea is delicious and some even come with jelly!\nThey let you choose sweetness level.\nThe place is hip and always clean.\n\n- Negative Notes -\nThere are only a few tables, so good luck finding a seat.\nParking can be a nightmare in this plaza.\nNo stamp card.
