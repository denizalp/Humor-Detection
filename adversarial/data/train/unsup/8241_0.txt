What else can be said about my favorite place to smoke cigars? And to top it off -- in my favorite town too... in my favorite casino.\n\nExcellent selection -- the house (Case Fuente) cigar here is RIDICULOUS -- an orgasm in your mouth and all over your hot little pink tongue lol. No, but really... that coupled with the mojitos and amazing coffee here = a heavenly experience for cigar lovers.\n\nThey have nights where there are events here, but I'm more about getting my relax on at this place and grabbing a great people-watching seat out front before everyone goes out at night... kind of a \"time-to-myself\" escape for me while in this rabid, hungry city.\n\n5 stars for a great selection, amazing quality of hand-rolled in-house cigars, and just overall ambiance deep in the heart of Caesar's. If you're thinking about hitting Colosseum Cigars and then the craps tables, then that's fine too... but if you've got the time to experience some world class smoke, then stop in at CF.\n\nOh, and prices are commensurate with the rest of the Vegas experience... don't look for the Black & Mild experience here! =)
