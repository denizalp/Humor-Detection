Twenty-two dollars for two people for a lunch buffet? Yes, please.\n\nIt's the perfect way to sample a little bit of everything. The butter chicken was delicious and I had to stop myself from shoveling all of it on my plate. They're also good about refilling the food even though we came in a little close to the end of lunch time. I'm still trying to find an Indian restaurant in SF that's comparable to the price and quality of Little India.
