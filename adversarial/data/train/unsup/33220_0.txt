On a recent business trip, decided to return to Noodle Asia in the Venetian Hotel.  Casual dining with nice atmosphere and reasonably priced for Las Vegas.  However, I do not recommend their \"chicken\" dishes.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken (a.k.a. chicken with peanut).  \n(1) Sauce far too sweet\n(2) Too much sauce.  Chicken and peanuts floating in sauce\n(3) The most important is that the chicken was not real.  This is the so-called \"rubberized\" chicken, which is a highly processed product and not actual white or dark meat chicken.  Stay away!  Horrible.
