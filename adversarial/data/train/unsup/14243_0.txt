Thirsty Beaver is your perfect neighborhood honkytonk bar. The crowd is friendly. The music is loud. And the PBR is cheap.\n\nIt's also smoke-free, a rare find in the neighborhood (though there are smoking areas outside). \n\nThe bar is owned by two brothers, and they've decorated the spot with \"Dukes of Hazzard\" lunchboxes, old records and other memorabilia from their childhood. \n\nBe sure to catch the owners' honkytonk band, the Loose Lugnuts, which often plays to a rowdy crowd of friends and Plaza Midwood regulars. \n\nThe Beaver has two pool tables, but the back room is much too cramped for any serious playing.\n\nA word of warning: The bartenders don't have much experience making complicated drinks. Stick with beer or basics like rum and coke. \n\nThe parking situation needs some work. The adjacent gravel lot is way too tiny and people end up parking across busy Central Street. So walk or bike there if you can.
