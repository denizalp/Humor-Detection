Rudest staff i have encountered in a long time.  I wanted to pay for my food by debit card as i didn't have enough cash, however, i was pointed to the little sign on the wall saying 'cash only', then i was told that i can take out money from their ATM machine that charges $2 for withdrawals.\nI told them that how could i see the little sign from the outside before i entered the building and why i wasn't warned before i ordered my food.  Every restaurant or take out place has debit machines especially on Yonge street. The extra $2 charge for having to withdraw cash from their ATM isn't the end of world but its the principle of it and the inconvenience to the customers. No matter what i said to them they kept raising their voice back at me and pointing to the cash only sign.  Seems like they are big into taking cash to hide their money for tax purposes.\nEventually they gave me $2 off my food as i was going to walk out.  Extremely rude staff and i would never go back there. \nI have no idea why people are raving about the food, it is very average, i had to spit out some hard pieces and fat from my chicken.\n\nMy advice for them is to invest in a debit machine for customer convenience, not everyone carries cash around and work on their customer service.  You do not give attitude back to a customer for any reason.\n\nMy most horrible food experience in a long long time.
