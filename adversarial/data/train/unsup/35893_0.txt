I ordered this in August 17, 2015. I got this from this address, I just looked up the order through grub hub after eating at a different Rosati's today.  It was a huge difference. \n\nThis was delivery so I can't comment on service, just the food.\n\nWe got chicken parm. and fettuccine alfredo with chicken.  Both came with garlic bread. \n\nThe good news was that the chicken in the chicken parm. was very soft and cooked just the way I like it. \n\nWeirdly, it was sliced into thin pieces like you'd expect with the fettuccine alfredo, but not chicken parm, though if that makes it come so soft, then it's worth it being sliced up.\n\nThe tomato sauce was very salty and made this meal not so good because of that.  \n\nAlso, there was only a small amount of chicken for a dinner time portion.  I'd say only one small chicken cutlet sliced up.  There was at least a big portion of spaghetti, though the chicken parm should be much of the meal as I ordered chicken parm., not spaghetti with chicken.\n\nThe garlic bread was very hard and dry, it tasted like a very big crouton.  \n\nThe fettuccine alfredo was awful.  The sauce was really bad tasting (I think it was made with some kind of cheese that I don't like in addition to parmesan which I do)  and the very few slices of chicken were salty and a little on the burnt side. There was also plenty of fettuccine, as it should be as it is a fettuccine dish.
