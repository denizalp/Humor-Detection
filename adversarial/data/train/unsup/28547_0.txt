I do not know what is going on with Las Vegas service this week. It seem that most of the restuarants at  the mgm resorts do not care about service. We come to Vegas about every couple of months and each time we eat at Tender. Last night at Tender it started off with the hostess being rude, the wait staff forgetting that we requested lemon in our water and this was the first time we did not get fresh pepper grounded on our food by the wait staff, but the salt and pepper container handed to us for us to do our selves. The food was great and after ordering the waiter and his bus boy were great. I\/We will think twice though about eating here again when we visit.
