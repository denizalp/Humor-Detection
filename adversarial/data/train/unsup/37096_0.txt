Very dissapointing!  I walked by the front doors on a long weekend when they were closed and the garbage lying on the floors around the check outs told me everything I needed to know.  If they can't clean that area before they close the store, how to they handle the food you are about to eat.  If English is your first language, don't be prepared to have any long conversations with anyone.  The kid that checked me out didn't look up to say 'hi' and was more interested in chatting with the clerk beside him.  They also wore street clothes.  Parking is a nightmare too!
