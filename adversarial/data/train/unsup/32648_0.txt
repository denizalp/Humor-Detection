I went in, was going to be given a lady whom understood nothing I said. A translator came to the rescue and after she realized it definitely wasn't going to work out for her to do my nails due to a language barrier, the one translating was the lady who ended up doing my nails.\n\nLong story short; this lady whom had no language barrier with me whatsoever ended up doing a less than par job. \n\nMy left thumb nail was overly filed down (began hurting afterwords). She managed to miss pushing back not one, not two, but three cuticles. So yes, after I arrived home that's when truly realized the shit job I had done on myself. \n\nI was embarrassed with one of my nails because of thick gel nail polish looked horrendous with an uncared for cuticle.\n\nCan't trust nobody apparently
