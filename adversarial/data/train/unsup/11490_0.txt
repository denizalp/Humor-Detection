Get out now while you can! Don't be fooled or swindled into purchasing a time share. its tooo good to be true and there's a catch! \n\nStay with Air BnB, Southwest Airlines, Orbitz, EBAY's BOGO. I booked a trip to Philippines and Thailand for three weeks RT for only $660 (hotel\/airfare) through Orbitz and air b&b, only because Jockey Club\/Sapphire resorts was charging me $800 a night! then wtf was my timeshare for then? \n\nMy first review was a total mistake LOL.
