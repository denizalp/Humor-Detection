Just a quick update to my rant! I called multiple times to the studio yesterday and of course King would not return my call or emails. Well lucky me I got him on the phone today and I said all I would like is a copy of my SIGNED contract and he replied why you don't get a refund and your the 2000th person who has requested this and are not getting it \nI proceeded to tell him that I was not calling about his new tipping policy rather I would like to know what the cancellation policy was an the renewal policy was (want to make sure I don't get charged) he then told me you know you have taken 125 classes since you started in January and thats less than $3 a class. What Im sorry why does it matter how many classes I take, I pre paid for the year and have unlimited classes. Pretty sure you made up the membership fee dont be mad that I actually come to class regularly. Went to trufusion and paid $549 yes pricey but they have free working lockers with locks, clean showers, a juice bar, and what they clean between classes! Oh what a concept. Two classes down at tru and not one person mentioned the word tip! Good luck to those who stay or join after reading all the negative reviews. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe teachers here are all great. The owner King is a piece of shit! He doesn't care about his teachers and thats why he makes it mandatory to tip them per class! Yes thats right charged to the credit card on file every time you check in. \nBeyond bullshit its because hes cheap and doesn't want to pay his teachers what they deserve! \nThe membership fee changes every month, the facility is dirty and they jam classes in to the point they dont clean between classes. \nWould NOT recommend this place to anyone after Kings email about tipping I am no longer going to go there, I have four months left in my membership and have already paid for it. \nNot about the money its the principle of how this place is doing business
