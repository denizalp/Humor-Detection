I finally had the chance to have a piece of cake from Barb's Bakery and although the five pounds I gained from the cake hate me, my sweet tooth thanks me for finding yet another fabulous Phoenix bakery! Holy moly. If you are a fan of cake and cake that's soft, moist, sweet, creamy and perfect all in one bite, this is your spot. \n\nBarb's is an adorable bakery with a storefront full of everything from cupcakes and pastries to donuts and cookies. But it's her cake that gets her the five stars in my book. My youngest nephew (2 months) just celebrated his baptism and so of course that called for a celebration. I told my sister about Barb's so she grabbed the cake from there and brought it to the party. I could have started and ended with just the cake it was so good. \n\nThe cake was the perfect size for our group and they did a wonderful job of decorating it in honor of the baptism with white and blue frosting, his name, date and blue crosses. It was a three layer chocolate with vanilla frosting cake. I originally asked for a sliver but when I saw how delicious it looked, I opted for a normal size piece instead. Is it bad that I consumed every last crumb in under five minutes? I don't think so at all. I would do it again in a heartbeat! \n\nSo with that, I'm officially adding Barb's Bakery to my list of sweet spots.
