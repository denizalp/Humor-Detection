So my boyfriend was giving me a hard time for being a bratty princess with the need to stay at a fancy place. Ok, fine, I'll show you. I booked this hotel as a Christmas \"gift\" to him just to show I can stay in such \"cheap\" place. \n\nAnd boy was this cheap, as in, cheap in every way. The room was mediocre at best. The floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded. Only the shower and toilet was on tiled floor, the sink is outside in the carpeted area. It  was... stupid. The walls were ridiculously thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. My friend told us about his bad experience with LVH with the maids throwing away all of his stuff had me paranoid so we stuffed our belongings in drawers and closets as well as took pictures of them to make sure we have proof. Luckily nothing happened but I do not want to go through that ordeal of feeling unsafe. \n\nMy boyfriend said we're never staying here again. HA! Proved you wrong hunny and even you were appalled. \n\nDON'T STAY HERE!
