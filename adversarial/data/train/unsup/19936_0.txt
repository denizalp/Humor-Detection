Conveniently located next to The Flamingo and the Linq promenade, open 24 hours, yet the most expensive Starbucks that I've ever been to. The service was fine, and the venue itself was clean. I was able to get my order completed in a reasonable amount of time, as well as accurately. Even the bathrooms were clean. FYI, if you have to park anywhere, you'll have to do it in one of the hotel valet stations. No street parking here whatsoever.\n\nIn hindsight, I can't really complain terribly about the prices when you consider this Starbuck's location. However, there is a 2-story Starbucks on the strip that is located just a block or two away that may either have comparable or slightly lower prices.\n\nAltogether, this is a decent Starbucks location. But remember, this is Las Vegas. Most Starbucks that we are accustomed to outside of Vegas will be lower-priced. Vegas and other destination locations are the exception.
