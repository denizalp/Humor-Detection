One of my most favorite stores in Cave Creek.  We have purchased a number of items from them and have had nothing but great service and have always been happy with the quality of our pieces.  They go out of their way to accommodate our special requests for specific colors, etc. and will special order anything we can't find in the store.  I saw someone complained about them missing deadlines for delivery, etc. but we haven't had that experience and I hope they will give this store another chance because like i said, we've been there probably a dozen times in the past year and we have never had a bad experience.
