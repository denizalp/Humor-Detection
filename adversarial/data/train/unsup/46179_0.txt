Good: The frites are free in Feb if you tweet about them. Remember not to fill up on them! The quantities are huge. \n\nBuffalo wings are very fresh, I like the smokey taste but a bit too much skin\/fat than the usual wings you'd get. Still yummy though\n\nGreat selection of beer as the name suggests. Try something new!\n\nPizzas are really unique, as well as the Farro salad\n\nGood for families and groups. Also if you like sports there's a bar and tvs here.\n\nBad: The famous frites are still good but I think the quality has gone down over the years. Some are overcooked and burnt so not really edible\n\nVeal and steak were mediocre, kind of bland
