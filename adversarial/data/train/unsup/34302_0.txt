We stumbled into this place by accident.  It turned out to be a very good experience.  We ordered 2 pizzas.  One plain and one Napoli (spicy).  Both thin crust, well done brick oven pizzas.  The sauce, the cheese and the dough were all very good. I personally liked the Napoli a little better, but both were great.   \n\nThe dessert was over the top absolutely amazing.  We got their dessert calzone - Dolce Della Casa. OMG.  I wanted to get naked and rub this thing all over myself.  However, my wife and daughter wouldn't approve. I digress, the DDC comes to you in a huge calzone form and it's filled with Nutella, bananas and topped with rich vanilla ice cream. \n\nIt was amazing!\n\nOther than a few dirty dishes\/utensils, this place was great.  Check it out. LEAVE ROOM FOR DDC. \n\nYou've been warned.....
