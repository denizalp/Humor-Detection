Is there anything wonderful left to say about the master  Joel Robuchon ?Our experience was simply amazing, the food, the wine, the service. \n\nChose the $85 set menu with wine pairing, everything was exquisite we were almost ready for dessert when we saw the couple next to us having Pata Negra and couldn't resist to order it. The service was impeccable , the place is so beautiful \n\nIt is a once in a lifetime experience and it is worth every penny
