If I could give this place zero stars I would but of course Yelp wouldn't allow me to do so. We had dinner here and everything was terrible. Usually even if a buffet isn't that great I can normally find at least one thing that I like, but. It here SMH everything was gross. Word of advice don't be fooled with the desserts, they look delicious but everything was stale and tasted like it had been sitting there for days. Not impressed at all, don't waste your $30 on this place.
