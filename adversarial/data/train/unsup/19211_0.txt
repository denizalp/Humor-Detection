This \"chip truck\" * was the 3rd stop on the Yelp French Fry Crawl - Part I.\nThe 1st stop was Jamie Kennedy Wine Bar. \nThe 2nd stop was Beer Bistro.\nThat's some big fry shoes to fill.\n\nLuckily, Mr. Tasty Fries has huge feet. (And you know what THAT means.) The fries are the long, thin variety but thick enough so the crisp exterior yields to the hot tater creaminess that lies within. They're sprinkled with some kind of orange crack seasoning that makes them impossible to stop shoving into your maw. \n\nSmall = $2.50  Medium = $3.00  Large = $4.00 \n\nWe sampled the goods from the other trucks on the block and they should just throw in the towel and call themselves, \"Mr. Non-Tasty Fries I\" and \"Mr. Non-Tasty Fries II\". Their spuds were bland, fat, globules of potato mush. **\n\nOh, and I'm still waiting for my colonic coupon.\n_____________\n* Why do people call it a \"chip truck\" when it's serving up skinny fries and it's called \"Mr. Tasty FRIES?\" I thought chips were those thick-cut potatoes you get in fish 'n chips.\n** We ended up giving them to the \"broke & hungry\" panhandlers that hang out in Nathan Philips Square. Hey, beggars can't be choosers.
