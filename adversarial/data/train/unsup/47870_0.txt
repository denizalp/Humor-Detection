2nd Visit: This time we were a group of 7 meeting up for a 5pm Saturday dinner. No reservations taken and restaurant didn't know we were coming. While waiting outside for the last of us to arrive, the manager came out and welcomed us. She said we would have one of the two tables that seat 8 and she was ready whenever we were. Her friendly attitude was very much appreciated. Wait staff was absolutely top notch. \n\nMost of my group ordered drinks - I think it was called the Ramona and was poured from a can. Whatever it was, they thought it delightful.\n\nEveryone really, really liked their food. A few who ordered entrees asked if they could have a house side salad instead of the grilled asparagus. Yes, certainly! Well, the side salads were huge and gorgeous. Our group ordered the scallops, salmon, burger, brussell sprouts salad w\/chicken and one with tenderloin. We cleaned our plates! Really delicious. And btw, prices are good.\n\nSide note: This time around there was no line to get in. I left close to 6:30pm and the place was not crowded at all. Before leaving, I walked around to check the set up. A waitress told me they have 2 tables for 8 and when I asked how they would seat a party of 6, she told me at one of the smaller round tables (which were really an inch larger than 4-tops) or maybe one of the 8-tops but that was like an afterthought. Apparently, no pushing tables together so if you have a large party better call first to see how they would arrange the seating.
