I always have a great time here. Imad's is very clean, the service is also on point especially by Carly. She is committed you can. She is literally running to get her customers what they want. She is always friendly and has a great attitude. On her game, she is a hustler and very good at what she does. \n\nImad the owner is also nice. He is an engaged owner because is always here. Not only that he comes to each table to check and see how everything's going. It happens every time he is here. \n\nThe hookah is on point. They have so many different flavors to offer and then when you mix a bunch with some of their recommendations it's even better. \n\nThe outdoor patio with the TVs and the palm trees in the background is a great ambience especially in the fall\/winter season. Vibe is good. Music is always going. \n\nThey have a private room area downstairs inside for a more intimate setting. I will be a customer for a long time.
