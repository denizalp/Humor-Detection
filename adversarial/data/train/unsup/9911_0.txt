This is one of the better shooting ranges here in Las Vegas.  The staff is friendly and professional, it is clean and the lane fee is reasonable.  I also appreciate the fact that you can bring in your own ammo.  \n\nThe only down side from my experience is they REALLY frown upon you trying for a head shot. I got yelled at for trying .... boo!  \n\nOther then that minor detail, when looking for a good indoor range to shoot at this is a good one to go too.
