Love Sammy's. This was my first time at this location and the first time at Sammy's for lunch. It was very crowded, but I didn't have to wait. I had the chicken chopped which was delicious as always. I couldn't eat 1\/2 of it because there was so much. One person with us had a pizza. I don't remember which one, but it was tasty. I usually have the BBQ pizza which is GREAT. Another friend had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was delicious. I'm not so sure about the grits. The texture was more like polenta.  If it really is polenta, they should call it Shrimp and Polenta. If they really are using grits, they definitely need to find a better way to cook them. Overall though, it was a good experience. Service was really good.
