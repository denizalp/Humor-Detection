Let me start by saying this review is strictly based on their dinner menu- I can't find anything bad to say about DW bistro! \n\nClean environment, polite \/ informative servers and high quality food. \nI just kind of thought everything tasted the same and was a little bland \/ dry- which was extremely surprising to me because I've heard so many great things about DW Bistro! \n\nItems ordered:\n\nJerk Chicken\nBraised Short Rib \nMac N Cheese with truffle oil \nLight and crispy fried plantains \nDW saut√©ed corn \n\n\"Capri Sunny Slope\" -ok\n\"DW margarita\" -ok\n\"DW Bloody Mary\" -good\n\"DW barrel aged white Manhattan\" -not good\n\nMaybe I just hit this place on an off night?
