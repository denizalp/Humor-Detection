I had no concept of what Genghis Grill was but when they opened in Matthews, I decided to check it out.  It was the first week and I guess everyone else was curious too.  The place is loud - like the cafeteria in a night club loud.  Lots of hard surfaces, tall ceilings, loud tv or music - just noisy.  \n\nWe didn't have to wait long for a table and was seated in the back.  The kitchen is open and there was a line what I assumed was a salad bar.  It wasn't.  The concept of this place is that you take your bowl, stand in line, and then fill it with as much raw stuff as you want.  Then you hand it over, someone else cooks it, and brings it to you.  \n\nFor people who know what they want, you might like this...but why.  The concept of a restaurant is to have someone give you a menu of items, you choose what you want, and they prepare it for you.  This place requires a bit of imagination...imagination I don't have.  As a result, my meal was terrible.  No one to blame but myself since I chose the ingredients but if I want to screw up my dinner, I can eat at home.  \n\nI took my son hoping there would be something for him as well.  They have the requisite kids items (pizza etc) but he wanted to be like me so he grabbed his bowl and stood in line with me.  Raw meat looks gross - it just does - so he was unimpressed.  He ended up with some imitation crab and an egg in a bowl.  They scrambled his egg and give it back.  \n\nNearly $40 for 3 people to eat and I have to make my own food and if I make it lousy, it's my own fault.  Yeah...no.
