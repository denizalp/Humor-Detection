Having been to Harold's for lunch before, I figured it would be a great place to come to again when in the area.\nI was wrong.  Oh so wrong.\n\nWe (my husband and I) were seated right away, which is great!  No wait!  However, we sat waiting for ANYONE to acknowledge us after that for at least 10 minutes.  Another couple was seated after us and was greeted before we were... By the same server.  \n\nWe ordered drinks and our food at the same time in hopes to save time since we allotted about an hour for lunch, and our drinks came out within a few minutes.  And then we waited some more. Other servers, a guy that looked like a manager, food runners, OUR server (Kylie is her name) they all walked by numerous times. 40 minutes with no update about when the food might come, another table updated on their to-go order, and FINALLY our order came.  I asked for the bill right away in order to expedite things further (which was the smoothest process of the entire visit).\n\nThe food left a lot to be desired. My husbands \"BBQ burger\" had no BBQ sauce, was missing toppings, and was incredibly unevenly over cooked (an edge was pink-ish, the rest was well done and was ordered medium).  My BLT was fine, but the bacon wasn't consistently cooked and my fries were room temperature.  We would have sent it back, but we might still be there 5 hours later.\n\nI won't be back anytime soon.  Even locals know not to come here unless there's an event because apparently that's the only time servers know they'll make money.  Sad.
