This was my first experience coming to this business. I had read reviews online and figured they were a good company. I came in to get some new HID bulbs installed on my vehicle. The service started of pretty well. Friendly staff greeted me and told me the wait would be about 1-1.5hrs. It ended up taking them much longer. \n\nMy new headlights looked good when I inspected them. \n\nHowever, when I got back into my vehicle, I immediately noticed that my leather steering wheel had very large scratches that were not there before I dropped the vehicle off. When I spoke to the manager, he was downright rude and condescending. He even accused me of being the one who made the scratches and asked if I had taken a before picture of my steering wheel to prove that it was not there before. When I asked if he could cover any cost to repair the scratches he responded by saying, \"absolutely not buddy.\" Totally unprofessional. Then when I asked him not to call me \"buddy\", he said \"I can call you whatever I want to.\" \n\nBe VERY careful taking your car here. If they damage it, you are out of luck. Worst vehicle service experience I've ever had to go through.
