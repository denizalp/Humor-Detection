VERY different experience than everyone else. Party of 10, not one of us will set foot in there again. \n\nOrdering off the AYCE menu, we made it clear that due to my dietary issues, my rolls HAD to be on a different plate. My order included the salmon tempura roll, which Kris, our waitress, verified and then went into the kitchen to stress to the staff there.\n\nWhen my order arrived, delivered by a different server, it was on a platter with two others. They didn't identify them, just dropped them at the far end of the table. Since so many different things had been ordered and everyone knew my food was coming separately, they were eaten before we realized the mix-up.\n\nThe manager jumped in and assured me the rolls would come again, on a separate plate (they did). While I had him, I asked about the Spring Rolls and veggie tempura I'd ordered 30 minutes earlier; he said they would be \"right out.\" I waited 10 minutes and asked again, and he snapped they take a little while but would be right out.\n\n20 minutes later, I asked our original waitress (we being a party of 10 were getting food delivered by everyone) *again* for my Spring Rolls. She was horrified and ran to the kitchen to get them and the tempura. Which I ate while my party had dessert!\n\nWhen I finally got to eat my ice cream, I almost swallowed a piece of rubbery plastic. The manager tried to convince us it was a piece of cabbage and just forget it.\n\nMy tablemates suggested based on the fact it took me over an hour to get food and that everything had to be ordered one to three times, that I got fed when everyone else was done, and when I finally got to my ice cream it was adulterated, my meal be comped. He said he couldn't do that and insisted all the problems had been fixed (he kept focusing on the replacement Salmon Tempura rolls and shrugging off or even denying our having to order the Spring Rolls three times).\n\nWhen we insisted, he offered 15 per cent. Not to the table, to me.  So, $3.75 off a $25 meal in which I barely ate after watching the group around me eat for an hour and that ended with plastic in my food.\n\nAlthough moments earlier he'd said HE was the boss, he now said he'd have to go talk to the boss when we said that was insufficient. He came back moments later and said he could go as high as 20% off. \n\nFrankly, I was stunned. In general in my experience, the customer service at Japanese restaurants is some of the best around. We weren't asking for a comp for all 10 of us, but a minimum half off for the person whose entire experience was farcical.  \n\nTwo people of our group ate there regularly; for the price of the $12.50 that would have been a good gesture of customer service, they've lost potentially thousands in revenue from visits by those two and their guests. \n\nIf you have ANY sort of special request, just don't go there. If you do, ask for Kris as your waitress - she was the one shining note in the entire farce, she's great.
