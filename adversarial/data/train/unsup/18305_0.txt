After dinner at a nearby casino, we took a stroll on Fremont Street. Known as The Fremont Street Experience, it consists of five blocks from N. Las Vegas Blvd to N. Main St.  in Downtown Vegas.  This was where the main area where all the casino\/hotels were located, such as the Golden Nugget, Fremont, Four Queens, Plaza and Main Street. \n\nAs \"The Strip\" was developed and became the go-to destination for visitors, Fremont Street was rebranded to draw back visitors.  As part of the Experience, a canopy was built to cover the five blocks of Fremont St and it became pedestrian only mall. The canopy over the mall is a video screen and features the Viva Vision Light show which last approximately six minutes, and run every hour starting at 6:00 pm to 1:00am.  All the neon lighting on all the buildings are turned off during the shows for a better viewing. Oher attractions added included the Slotzilla zip line where you can Zip down the mall sitting style or Zoom down superhero style. There are concert stages set up on Main St., 1st and 3rd St. for your music enjoyment.  \n\nOn weekends, the street gets pretty crowded with various performers, people in costumes inviting you to take pictures with them, for a fee of course.  Some people can get pretty wild and loud with many people drinking. \n\nFremont St. needed to reinvent itself to draw back the visitors and they have created their own distinct style with The Fremont Street Experience. The vibe is different than The Strip and it might not appeal to all.
