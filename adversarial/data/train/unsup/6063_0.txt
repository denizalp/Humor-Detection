It's a fine, upscale addition to the neighborhood - but way too upscale for the residents of the nearby modest apartments and the adjacent extended stay motel, and frankly too upscale for me but for the occasional item.  My perception was that it was generally extraordinarily expensive - but that may be an unfair comparison to regular grocery prices as opposed to those for organics.  Note they carry a selection of supplements, natural soaps and cleansers, and natural health & booty aids including natural makeup in addition to the all organic produce, natural and gluten free this and that. I'm giving it a big 4 stars for quality, cleanliness, attractive interior, and a good selection of not just natural and organic foods, but other natural lifestyle oriented products as well. as convenient location and parking.   \n\nI'm looking forward to bringing home one of their all natural \"free\" chickens: They're cage-free, hormone free, free-range.  Everything is free except the cost.  Regardless of cost, i have a feeling I'd better do that soon: I don't think this place will last.
