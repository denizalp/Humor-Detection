Best vegan Mexican tacos I've had so far and that's comparing it to quite a few, both high-end and fast food.\n\nMy girlfriend and I went for $1.99 taco Tuesday without really knowing what to expect. But here's what I concluded after my experience:\n\nWHAT I ORDERED\n* veggie taco - 5\/5\n* mushroom taco - 4\/5\n* bean & cheese taco - 5\/5\n\nPROS\n+ $1.99 taco Tuesday, yes please!\n+ super cute little place, welcoming environment \n+ entire staff was on their A game, you all rock!\n+ flavor, flavor FLAVOR, it's like a party in your mouth (yeah I said it) need I say more?\n\nCONS\n- I live in Henderson, or as my Summerlin friend would say, \"Hender-tucky\" so it was a good 20 minute drive for me\n\nThanks Tacotarian for bringing awesome vegan food to our community!  I'll be back next, Tuesday =)
