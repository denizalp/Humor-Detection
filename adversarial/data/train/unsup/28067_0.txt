A great performance and mainly, a hell of a lot of fun. Just one of those shows where everyone walks away smiling and humming and feeling really good.\n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous to buy your (expensive) tickets online then have to wait 30 minutes crammed in a tight line to actually get your actual tickets. Not a great way to treat people paying $200. for a ticket. However, that doesn't seem to be stopping anyone. Blame The Mirage, not Cirque du Soleil for that major inconvenience.\n\nSeen over a dozen Cirque du Soleil shows in Los Angeles and Las Vegas and this was very different but maybe the most fun.\n\nIf you can see one show in Las Vegas, I'd recommend seeing this show before any other.
