I love Tiffany's their cake is amazing the ho ho cake is one of my favorites and of course the classic white cake with strawberry filling or even without it is so good. The chicken salad is amazing! When they have the mom's mom's butter cookies they are so awesome! The donuts are amazing as well. During the summer when they have their custard it is one of my faves
