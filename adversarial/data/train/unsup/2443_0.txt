The reason I am giving 2 stars is because the car was repaired and even though I had to battle with the service advisor John yachuk as to whether or not I was correct about charging me for service without consulting me, though he wasn't happy about it, he resolved the issue. But before he resolved it he felt the need to say \"I see you've played the game before\" when I am not playing a game, I was just concerned about paying for service I had not been consulted on.
