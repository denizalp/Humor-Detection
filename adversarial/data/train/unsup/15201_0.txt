REVIEW FOR NATHAN'S\n\n  Nathan's is to New York what Pink's Hot Dogs is to Las Angeles. When Nathan's opens up a new eatery it is a big deal to New York transplants.\n\n  This is the first Nathan's Famous in Las Vegas to open outside the Resort corridor. It is located in Aliente Hotel and Casino. \n\n  The Grand Opening of the first local's Nathan's never made Vegas Eater or the news. I'd find out about the new Nathan's from my brother. And so, today after hiking up in the Las Vegas Ski and Snow Resort, I made Nathan's my post hike dinner.\n\n  Nathan's serves one of the best fast food burgers that I have ever eaten. In my opinion, they are even better than their World famous hot dogs. The only thing is that the New York -New York Nathan's appears to be the only Las Vegas location that serves them. In my opinion, Nathan's also serves one of the best fries. Their crinkly cut fries are out of this World delicious. I'd enjoy their crinkly cut fries with a chicken club sandwich meal.\n\n   Unlike the resort corridor Nathan's, a standard meal isn't going to cost you the equivalent of a casual dining chain. Here, the chicken club meal that included a Large crinkly cut fries and Large Pepsi was less than  $10. On the Strip, it would be around $15.\n\n  Nathan's weakness is that many of their locations are poorly managed. Recently I gave the Bally's location one star. On my visit, the employees were on top of their game. I was greeted right away and the wait was minimal.   \n\n   In closing, I hope that this location does well and that it is the start of more Las Vegas openings. And I hope that it doesn't fall into the hands of bad management.
