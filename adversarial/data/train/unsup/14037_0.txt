I will begin this review by saying that I am an open minded person, and I usually find at least one thing to like about a bar or club. I am also aware of the variety of subcultures that are popular now. With that being said, avoid this toilet at all costs! We paid a $10 cover on a Saturday night to be jam packed into a hot, sweaty hipster hellhole. Drinks we're expensive and came in the crappiest plastic cups ever. If the bottom floor of pseudo artists, dancers, models and intellectuals bores you, go upstairs and indulge in a second floor of the worst people that society has to offer. Also, if you're a guy, avoid the bathroom at all costs. Find a pseudo artist or model and give them your bowels as sustenance or as art; the bathroom only boasts one stall with no door, and the stall walls are waist high. Forget about dropping a deuce here, just do it on the floor, the art crowd will appreciate you! Also, avoid making eye contact with the bathroom attendant from Mogadishu; he will insist on a tip for creepily watching you do your business. Why the fuck does a shitty little club need a bathroom attendant anyways? Music was ok but its too hard to be able to get into it when the club is dangerously overcrowded. All in all, if you fancy yourself some kind of scholar of the arts, or if you think you're a model, go here. If you went to college for a journalism degree, or a fine arts degree, come here. If you think the Cornish Pasty in Tempe is the greatest thing ever, come here. If you wear v neck t shirts out in public while sporting an amish hat, come here. If you just started riding motorcycles and consider yourself a 1% outlaw, come here cause you'll think you're the toughest biker in the world. For the rest of you, skip this shithole and go to Sanctum instead.
