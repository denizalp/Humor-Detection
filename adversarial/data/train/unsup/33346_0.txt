Went for the first time and had my haircut from Kumiko. Even though I personally thought her skills were kind of mediocre, she is really sweet and attentive! I could tell she was trying her best and was very focused. I'm happy with the final result of my haircut but I feel like there are some areas she could have worked on more.. Overall it was a pleasant experience though and I WILL be returning to Maya.\n\nI also wanted to mention that the lady at the front desk is kind of mean. Lol when I called she was kind of rude. And when I showed up that morning she didn't even say \"Hello\", she just greeted me with \"what time\". -____-\". It didn't bother me too much though because I was greeted with Kumiko very soon after that and she is very sweet :)
