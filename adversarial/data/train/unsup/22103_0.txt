Had crazy allergies! Couldn't sleep, chest wheezing, shortness of breath, the whole nine. Looked up urgent cares open on a Saturday and saw through the Southwest Medical app that this place opened at 7am. Jumped in the whip and headed over with wifey, got to the front door by 6:56 and there was three people in line. \n\nDoors opened on the dot, definitely pays to show up all DMV style and beat the rush. I saw a check in associate within 15 minutes, super friendly and courteous. Told her what was going on, I gave her my ID, insurance card and $35. Signed a few sheets and sat back down. So efficient as I'm already in their system from previous visits, helps to set up an account online also. \n\nI sat in the waiting room another 10 minutes when the nurse called my name, surprisingly he got it right, most people screw my name up. Got my vitals checked, waited in the exam room for less than 10 minutes when the doc came in. She actually paid attention and understood what was going on. Some doctors generalize and everything you say goes over their head, not here. \n\nGot my breathing treatment, steroids and singular script. Oh and also got a shot to the ass that hurt like a mother. I asked for it though! All in all the whole visit with the waiting times lasted about an hour and 20 minutes, beats UMC or the Rancho office. Definitely will be returning here if further issues arise.
