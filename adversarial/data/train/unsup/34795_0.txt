Best asian food around. They re-opened and you can eat from the floor in there. They're going to change their name and sign soon. Great ambiance - you can dress up and won't feel weird! Biggest portions ever!! (So totally worth the price!) They will add SUSHI to their menu on April 22nd :-) Can't wait!\n\nUPDATE: Tried sushi-tasted awesome! Ask for their daily deals!
