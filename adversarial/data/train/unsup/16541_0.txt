After two consecutive, relishing visits, I have declared La Condesa as my numero uno taco joint in the valley of the \"Bertos\". The obscure and hoody street it resides on has always kept me hesistating until one day! Before I immersed myself into the unknown, I had to do some Yelp investigation.  I wanted to know which taco(s) in particular people were raving about.  Coincidintally, the ones people tipped about were the ones I also adored! \n\nI kept seeing Yelpers talk about them dogfish shark tacos, so I knew I had to order those first along with the can't-go-wrong carne asada! First thing that happens upon entering the cool, wooden door, you place your order at the counter and find an open seat once a number is assigned to you. \n\nBeing that they specialize in tacos, I focused on just that (for now)! They do have burritos and other things but its all about the tacos!  Here are your options:\n\n1 Taco: $2.99, will not fill you up, but it is still a decent size.\n\n2 Taco Plate: $6.99, you get 2 tacos of the same core ingredient (ie. Carne Asada, Fish) plus 2 sides (refried beans and rice)\n\n2 Mix Taco Plate: $8.29, you get to choose any 2 tacos from the menu, plus the sides I mentioned.\n\nBeverage is additional.\n\nWhat I have tried thus far:\n\n1. Dogfish Shark Taco:  Killer! What makes these so awesome is in the beer batter!  They are super crispy, hot and the fish itself is still soft and moist!  \n\n2. Shrimp: Again, Killer! Comes out very similar to the shark tacos, except it is shrimp!\n\n3. Carne Asasada: Holy cannoli folks! Some might argue that America's Taco Shop are better but I would say the quality and taste is near even!  Condesa might edge them with its overall composition and various salsas!  It had that mesquitte, charred off the grill kind of taste and cut perfectly to fit into a taco!\n\n4. Cochinita Pibil (Pork): The first three tacos I mentioned were pretty darn good! But this one stood out quite well on its own.  It was savory and packed with excellent flavors!  As the menu stated, it was slow-cooked, fork tender!\n\nThe 2 sides-\n\nRefried Beans: Excellent! \nRice: Excellent! perfectly cooked!\n\nThe cool part about dining here is enjoying their Salsa Bar! If I recall correctly , there were about 10 different salsas to choose from!  The tricky part is pairing it with the taco you just ordered! Experiment, I say! As part of every order they bring you a basket of warm, house chips!\n\nFrom the outside, you would never assume that such a great taco place existed, but once you step inside you know something good is about to happen!  Every wall has some sort of hip and contemporary Mexican art, from flowers to people.  The overall decor is very tasteful and upbeat!\n\nStaff members are very friendly and courteous!\n\nI took my office colleagues out during my second visit and they have nothing but positive responses and is begging to come back for more!\n\nWhether you are a connoiseur of Mexican cuisine, tacos or just love eating good food, I highly advise you stop by!  For the overall great taste and value, its hard to beat this cool taco spot that will please all your senses!
