In all the times I have dined here, never have I been so irate. \n\nFor all the dim sum go-ers, if you've visited Blue Lagoon, then you're well versed on how extremely slow this place is. Dim sum for two people can easily stretch out into 2 hours, simply because you're waiting 40 minutes for one dish, or all the forgotten items. Not to mention, the 15 minutes wait to pay after you've asked for the bill.\n\nWhether it's a table of two, or a family of 7, service has always been terrible. \nI will admit, quality of food is fair, and one of the better places in Mississauga. However, unless you're able to order Happy Hour before 11am, prices are hella steep compared to the rest of the suburban dim sum joints. \n\n$2.60 for small, medium, large - happy hour\n$2.60 (s), $3.60 (m), $4.60 (l), $5.5 (xl), $6.50 (sp), $7.50 (j)\n\nOur visit this time around, was instantly dampened by their own manager. A waitress tending to the table next to us, asked in Chinese what tea we would like - before we could even respond, the manager setting our table muttered racist remarks, advised her to give us whatever, we're not even Asian. \n\n...sorry, what?\n\nIronically, we are very much \"asian\", and had been speaking Chinese to the rest of the staff from when we walked in. \n\nAs someone who has been recommending this place to patrons of all races, this makes me weary of how they were\/will be treated. \n\nAfter looking past the extreme waits, order issues in the past, this was the icing on the cake. I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing clients or non-chinese friends here! It's sad. The wait staff are pleasant, but management needs to seriously clean up their act.
