Went there today 6-21-15 for lunch. Stood awkwardly at the front for about 5 minutes before anyone could be bothered to take my order. \n\nI got a three piece chicken tender combo. When I hear \"combo\" I automatically think fries and a drink....not the case here. A combo is just the tenders,  fries, and cole slaw. I thought that was weird...especially since the combo was over $12.  So I got the \"combo\" with a root beer and asked for my fries loaded (topped with sour cream, cheese, and bacon).  The total was almost twenty bucks...more than I want to spend for lunch.  \n\nThe place was pretty busy and there were only four open tables but they were all dirty.  I just sat down anyways...cuz' that's how I roll.  A little chicken crumbs never hurt anybody and I don't want to be \"that lady\" and ask to have the table wiped down.  \n\nThese tenders were not good, ya'll.  Yes they were fresh, they were hot, they were moist, but there is a weird dry rub on the outside and the inside is really bland.  I could easily make these in my kitchen.  They have many sauces to try to disguise their bland chicken:\n1) Habanero hot sauce - Just gross.  No tanginess at all...just sweet and slightly spicy.  Skip it. I much prefer Frank's Red Hot or buffalo sauce. \n2) Barbecue- Standard barbecue sauce...tastes just like the kind you get at the grocery store. \n3) Wasabi honey- This is literally wasabi-flavored honey.  It is watery and disgusting and I don't know who in the world likes this. \n4) Wildflower honey- Once again....this is just plain honey.  Who is dipping their chicken in honey?  This place doesn't even have biscuits so I dunno why they have honey. \n5) Chipotle barbecue- See #2\n\nThe coleslaw was awful.  I actually spit it out.  It's just cabbage, carrots, and vinegar.  Yuck.  \n\nThe fries were delicious.  The root beer was delicious.  \n\nCane's is about twenty times better and half the price.  I have no reason to go back here.  If I ever did end up back here I'd try something else...like maybe the wings or a sandwich.  The tenders are not worth it.\n\n*update* When I ate there I asked the cashier if I could substitute the cole slaw for the pickled cucumbers and I was denied but I've read a couple of yelp reviews where yelpers were allowed to do this.  Eff you, too, blue ribbon chicken.  Why wouldn't you let me?
