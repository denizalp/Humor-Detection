Pleasantly surprised.\n\nI came here for dinner the other day, thinking I will try American Japanese food based on some pictures I saw on Yelp.\n\nI came during peak dinner time without reservation, but I was able to take the last bar seat available. Table was about 20 mins wait, is what I was told on a mid week night.\n\nHappy hour price was very nice, I ordered a couple of rolls and enjoyed them. Nothing authentic, but still good to eat.\n\nMy surprise was noodle. Both udon and ramen. Udon dashi broth had a very good bonito flavor, unlike other udon broth from nearby restaurants in the valley, it wasn't too soy saucy, it had actual great dashi flavor to it.  Ramen (Tokyo chasu soy ramen) broth also had surprise flavor to it. Ramen noodle had nice chewing texture to it, I had to ask the manager about ramen.\n\nOne of the Sakana restaurant makes the broth and ship them to other locations in the valley. Noodle is special order for Sakana. A noodle company uses recipe especially created for Sakana restaurants group. Trust me and try once. You will know what I mean by the noodle texture.\n\nI knew this place was here for a long time. I just never though of trying. Now I know what they serve, I might stop by here for a quick dinner whenever I feel like it.
