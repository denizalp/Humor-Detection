I like shooting out here, which is saying something, because 9\/10 of the time I LOATHE shooting at a controlled range with the public.\n\nAt first I was set to hate this place. I rolled in, found the first distance range I could, and started to unpack. I asked the douche bag next to me \"Hey, where do I check in?\" And I swear to you, in his best Thurston Howell III (AKA the \"Millionaire\" from Gilligan's Island) voice he told me \"this is the private range. You need to be over thereeeee....\"\n\nI really wanted to kick him in the wiener, but he had as many guns as I did. A bit of life advice from your Ol' Uncle Ian kids; don't go kicking people in their junk if they have as many or more guns on them than you do. It will end poorly. Thank me for this nugget of wisdom when it saves your life.\n\nSo I went to the \"public range.\" \n\nAnd it was great. I paid my $7, found the shooting bench that grabbed my lustful attention, and proceeded to get myself situated. I found I had two sand bags, a welded steel rest that held them so I could place my gun on them, and I was able to rent a spotting scope for $2. \n\nMind you it would have been a six star day if I had been able to hit more than air from 200 yards, but that's operator failure, not a range shortcoming.\n\nPeople here were easy to deal with. A pretty good \"I'm here to shoot, so leave me alone and I'll do the same\" vibe was going all around. No overly chatty Cathy's, some people with some fun guns, and the range staff was on a good system of shoot and no shoot. \n\nI'll be taking my green to shooting vegetarian girlfriend out here sometime soon when its not so hot. I think she'll even like it, and she's my new standard when it comes to shooting spots. If she likes it, you and yours will love it.
