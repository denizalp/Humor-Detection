This place is awful.  After seeing the good reviews on Yelp, I was excited to try it. I came during a time I thought it would be dead but it was actually really busy.  I went to take a number and someone said, \"Oh no, you don't need to do that, just have a seat.\"  Oh, ok. I waited over an hour.  Other people came in and sat right down.  I guess they had an appointment.  Sorry, most barber shops are walk ins.  This isn't a dentists office.  They could have at least told me it would be over an hour wait.  I finally got up and left after being ignored for so long.  I can't believe I waited an hour, and still no haircut.  They wasted my time and ruined my whole day.  I hate this place so much.  Please don't give them any business.
