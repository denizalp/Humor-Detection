You'd be hard-pressed to find better bang for the buck.  Prices range from approximately $15 - $20.\n\nYou will rarely wait more than ten minutes to get the outside of your vehicle washed and dried, the inside cleaned, and your tires shined (if desired).  You can also leave with that fancy \"new car smell.\"\n\nThe employees are quick and friendly.  Make sure you tip them...and not the one-notes...Scrooge.\n\nThanks for being my go-to car wash Quick C!  I'll be back as usual.
