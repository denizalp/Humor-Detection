This is the worst parking service that exists. Very unorganized as to how the shuttles pick up and drop off. It's completely up to chance as to how long you will wait for a damn shuttle to pick you up. I waited for 18 minutes until a shuttle showed up. Once they do finally arrive, the shuttle drivers randomly drive around picking up others which means you will ride around the lot for over 20 minutes picking up other patrons. Thank god my flight was delayed! I've parked in a lot of lots before, but none have ever been this bad. I would not recommend this service and will definitely not park here again!
