The first thing you will notice when you enter is the traditional Japanese seating to your left. Not only that,  this impressively sprawling restaurant has a sushi bar,  casual seating,  and more intimate seating in the back area that can be used for large parties. \n\nThey truly stick to their namesake and treat you like a VIP. We were brought two menus,  one Chinese and one Japanese.  The Chinese menu had Sichuan fares as well as your typical Asian-American dishes to please everyone. The Japanese menu features sushi and familiar bento, hibachi, noodle and rice dishes.  They have a very reasonable sushi and sashimi lunch special every day of the week. This seemed to be popular among other tables near us. \n\nWe ordered the futomaki roll, vegetable tempura roll, egg rolls, Dan Dan noodles,  west lake beef chowder,  sliced pork ears, steamed white meat chicken in chili sauce, and Chinese sauerkraut with tilapia soup.\n\nI was let down that the Sichuan dishes did not taste authentic.  While beautifully presented, the traditional hot chili sauce was lacking.  The dishes were not spicy as real Sichuan dishes are.  The Dan Dan noodles were also disappointing,  too much chili oil but no flavor to back it up.  All the Sichuan dishes seemed to shy away from the spicy, numbing, deep complexity of flavors from true Sichuan. Perhaps this is done on purpose to gain wider audience to their menu items. \n\nThe sushi rolls are comparable to Takara quality in price and taste. \n\nI still give this establishment four stars because it offers a wide selection sure to cure any cravings, has great ambiance,  relaxed, but friendly service,  and is a good introduction to those who want to try Sichuan cuisine,  but don't want the tears and running nose that goes with real Sichuan flavors.
