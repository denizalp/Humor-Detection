I have returned to UFC after leaving almost 3 years ago.  I've officially been back for about 3 months now.  I will say I've seen the front staff change within that time, but at least this time around I'm not seeing it effect my workout schedule.\n\nTo be fair, I have only been attending the AM classes, pretty religiously Mon- Fri. The classes have been hitting the bags and light sparring and other days are  boot camp\/hiit style workouts.  I was really happy they added 5 am classes and hope more days are added as it works better with my schedule.  Those classes are more weight training, almost CrossFit style. The classes are definitely different from years ago, but it does give variety to change up the same routine.\n\nThey also have a 6 week challenge which has become popular in the fitness world in general and I think it's a new concept at this  gym.  I'm NOT in the challenge.  Let's get this straight, it's not free, you must put up money to be on the challenge.  You can look at it as incentive for you to reach your goals, but remember that money has to be upfront.  If you need to be held accountable to lose weight, then this might be a good route. OR you can just join and realize your monthly is your accountability to get to the gym.\n\nThe rates are a bit high for month to month.  When you join you pay first and last month and if you leave, you must give 30 day notice. Your payments really end 60 days later.  I made sure I understood those terms and you should too.  \n\nI decided to rejoin because its conveniently closer for me and I enjoy hitting the bags, I miss hitting mitts more, but I'm here to better me after having two little ones.  Oh, I even see a few people that have been here since LA Boxing days!  Is it worth giving this gym a shot, sure, they do have trial periods.  Do what's best for you to get to your goals.  Variety of classes is what this gym offers.
