Service was quick when we dined here and I've never had any issues with pick up. I'm from the east coast and this has become my go to spot for ny style pizza. Have also picked up some of their calzones for a parks and rec night! Bonus, they have little italian ices in their freezer that are way better than the kind you get at the supermarket.
