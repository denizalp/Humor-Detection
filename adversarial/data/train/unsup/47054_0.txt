Editing this review to add - So 5 months after the recheck on my toes (and shortly after I left this mixed review), I receive a bill for my co-pay that I was told was not necessary the day of my appointment because it was just a recheck. Which it was. I spoke to the doctor for maybe 2 minutes. He checked its healing, I asked why it looked terrible and was give the \"give it a year\" line. So I called and was told any time you go into the office you are supposed to pay the co-pay, recheck doesn't matter, but they would go ahead and waive it this one time. So minus another star for inconsistent billing and communication. If anything, they should refund me for my right toe procedure and the hack job that was performed on it.\n\nI've had problems with ingrown toenails my entire life. I finally decided to go to a podiatrist and see what my options were. I ended up having the procedure where the nail is cut and a chemical is applied to the nail bed to inhibit future growth. My first appointment was with Dr. Garza and he was amazing!! My left toe looks perfect. I followed all after care instructions as written and I couldn't be happier with that toe. My second appointment was with Dr. Brewer who was less than stellar. He was very personable, but my toe looks like crap. I did the same after care as my left toe, so it's not due to my negligence. When I questioned its appearance in follow up appointments, I was told to keep soaking it in Epsom salt which I did. I was also told it would take a year to grow out. So my left toe looks perfect after 2 weeks yet my right toe requires a year to look normal? It has been 5 months and my right toe looks so disgusting, I have to keep it painted all the time or it just irritates me. So if you come to this location, be sure to request Dr. Garza if you have ingrown toenails and you want your toe to look somewhat presentable after your procedure. 5 stars for Dr. Garza, but only 1 star for Dr. Brewer.
