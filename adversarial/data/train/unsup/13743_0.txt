The Naz.  Although it occupies a space in the neighborhood as a requisite stop on the cheap eats tour, Nazareth is certainly not among the better Ethiopian restaurants in the GTA.  Hell, it's not really even among the better Ethiopian restaurants on Bloor between Christie and Dufferin!  Still, there's something about this place that provokes an odd, almost instant defensive loyalty from their far-flung fan base. \n\nLarge portions, excellent prices and service that ranges from moderately disinterested to moderately annoyed make this a spot for eating with friends.  The small, randomly \"decorated\" space isn't going to impress anyone other than the recently paroled, still there is an intangible vibe to the place....  \n\nIt's worth a shot, particularly during off peak hours.  If I had the waiting experienced by other Yelpers during my first visit I would be decidedly less kind in my review.
