I love going to this hospital for my doctors but just like a previous yelper my issue is with the parking services.  Yes I work for the clinic at a different location and have their parking sticker on my car but the parking services keep giving me a parking citation for parking there when I'm there as a patient not an employee!!!!  Where do they expect me to park when I'm there for my surgeries and follow up appointments.  My last surgery kept me there from 6 in the morning to 6 at night.  It's not my fault that I had to stay there for so long, but to add to my misery of physical pain, you had to throw in a parking citation?  Just ridiculous!! And I'm not going to pay for a valet to park my car at a hospital.. this hospital already takes thousands of dollars from me, so adding more to it just to park, sounds ridiculous...
