The bad:\n-Nobody at the door to greet or seat us.\n-The waitress sat down at our table and read the specialty drinks to us off the menu.\n-The host had to hold a flashlight for the waitress while she was reading the menu to us, as the lights were so low she couldn't see it. Seriously. A flashlight.\n-2-for-1 drink coupon was not good on specialty drinks.\n-The waitress did not tell us our coupon wasn't good on specialty drinks until after delivering the drinks.\n-No restrictions are listed on the 2-for-1 coupon.\n-When I pointed all this out to the waitress, she just said \"Oh.\"\n-No effort was made to turn this into a better experience.\n-$50 for 2 cocktails is way too expensive!!!\n\nThe good:\n-Ummmmm.......\n-Hmmmmm......\n-I can't think of anything. My friend's drink was good. Mine was mediocre.\n\nThe bottom line:\nI'm never going back here again. I feel ripped off, and no effort was made by the waitress or anyone else to try to save the situation.  I'm going to tell everyone I know how bad the service was that I received here.
