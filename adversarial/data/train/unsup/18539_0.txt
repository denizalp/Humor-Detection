I've been to this place a few times mostly because my friends love coming here. They like about two blocks up so whenever we're in the mood for cheap food, and lots of it, we come here.\n\nPlus, if you want some fun after..you can always go to Zanzibar next door (lol jk) \n\nIt's your standard indian buffett items, nothing special.\n\nBut on the plus side, the prices are so cheap its ridiculous. \n\n10.95 for lunch, and 12.95 for dinner? \n\nEverytime i come, I feel like we're robbing this place blind.\n\nThe food is not the best I've had, but it's not the worst.\n\nThe best part though is DEFINITELY the fresh naan brought to your table whenever requested. It's fresh and hot and delicious and my mouth is dripping saliva as I think about it.\n\nAnother great note about this place : There's a handwashing station right next to the buffet. Perfect because we eat our indian food the authentic way...with our hands! \n\nThree stars, mostly because of the Naan.\n\nSide note : Smoking is not allowed on their patio. Lame.
