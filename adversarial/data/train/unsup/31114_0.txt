I wanted to love this place. I did. The menu looked outstanding but it just under delivered. \n\nOur server was a doll, super sweet. Nice atmosphere. \nWe ordered some tapas and drinks...the dishes were very hit or miss. \nA few came out cold despite the restaurant being almost empty.  One was so over salted I could barely eat it. At this price point all the dishes should be a home run but these unfortunately were not.  They got a lot right (service, menu, atmosphere) but they didn't get the most important part- executing the dishes-right.  I can't say we will return any time soon.
