Met up with a friend for Happy Hour at the Vig, it's another place I have been meaning to check out.  I didn't do any research on the place so when I pulled in and my door was opened by some strange man I was sorta thrown off, but overcame that quickly as I walked toward the restaurant.   I didn't see any signs saying it was valet parking, so that's why I was a little caught off guard.\n\nOnce inside I got to check out the place , its retro with a cool vibe, I could see how hanging out at the Vig has become popular. My friend and I were headed to another event so eating wasn't really what we were into, but after a quick look at the menu we decided on some guac & chips and grilled fish tacos. The guac was fresh and creamy; the added pico went great with it. The fish tacos though stole the show, the tomatillo & avocado salsa on blacken white fish with spicy slaw, explosion of flavors! I might have to go back soon just for that! So good!\n\nThe Vig is a great place to start your happy hour off at, nice drink selection and food choices! Look forward to coming back
