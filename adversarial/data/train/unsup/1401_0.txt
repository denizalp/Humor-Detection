Not too bad. \n\nEach skewer was cheap. About $1-$2 each. \nEach skewer is brushed with some bbq sauce. The sauce wasn't too bad. Not too tangy nor empowering. Tad of spice.\n\nI feel like we made the mistake on ordering all the skewers at once. So by the time we got to the 2nd or 3rd skewer, it was already room temperature. \n\nThe Yangzhou fried rice was pretty good. Had shrimp, peas, carrots, and luncheon meat aka spam. lol. Yum yum. About $7-8.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant was simple. Drawing\/painting on the wall. Sort of reminded me of a daycare type of painting, but it was still cute.\n\nThe service was alright. I had to keep getting the servers attention when we needed anything, but that's alright. There was only 3 tables out of like maybe 12? booths taken. It's a small place. \n\nI'd try the place again if given the chance. \nIt was tasty! Get the lamb skewer, it was really good!
