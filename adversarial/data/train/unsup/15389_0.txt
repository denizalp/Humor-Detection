Horrible service and this place isn't what it used to be. Came here on a Tuesday night right before closing time. We waited in line for 20 minutes, we finally get to the front and was denied service due to closing. First of all, if you want to close down your place then lock the doors, there was a lot of customers still coming in. \n\nSecond to avoid disapointing your customers you need to let them know that you're closing when they first come in. Making them wait 20 mins then saying its the last order when the store isn't even close yet isnt fair. There was still a long line-up behind us. They close at 11pm. When we got to the resto it was about 10:40. When we got to the front of the line it was 10:59 exactly. During that time they should take a second to lock the doors and serve the remaining people who got there before closing. It's common courtesy\n\nThe boyfriend spoke up and they served us and the people behind us. Another problem is the people behind us got their  order first...what the... Second, we ordered the chicken on the rocks x2 half fries half rice. And they only put fries on the first order but it wasn't enough fries and they couldve easily moved the fries and gave us rice in there. Third,  their fries was super soggy... yup won't be coming back here.\n\nLazeez is the clear winner here in terms of chicken on the rocks. Even their white sauce wasnt as good as lazeez.
