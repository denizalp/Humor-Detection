Terrible experience! I paid over $200 for a Japanese straightening that didn't work. Then I went back and was offered a keratin straightening treatment and that didn't work either. \n\nWhen the man was putting the treatment in my hair he was talking it up so much but when it didn't work he blamed the \"cheap\" brand the salon buys. My hair is thin with big waves\/soft curls so I can't understand why neither treatments work on my hair, they didn't have an explanation either. After 2 failed attempts they would not give me my money back. My hair is still wavy, feels damaged, and with all the fine tooth combing the man did, super thin. Please don't waste your money here. It didn't look like anyone knew what they were doing.
