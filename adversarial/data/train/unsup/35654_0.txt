I may be long winded here...but this is the BEST cabinet and countertop company to work with! JOHN (owner) sincerely cares whether his customers are satisfied with the work that they entrust him to do in their homes! He is a humble man who gives you more than fair value for your hard earned money! John came out to our home - personally measured this very tiny 80's kitchen and provided a design, listened to our design ideas\/needs - and came up with a design that was so beautiful! His installer spent days here - with his level hooked to his hip! he made sure every cabinet was level, was exactly to the design we signed off on! His counter top team installed our quartz counters beautifully! NO mistakes!! this kitchen is breathtaking! a couple pieces (drawer etc) were missing. john got them ordered asap and they were back out installing them within days of them being delivered (2-3 weeks ...just one drawer). then we hired west coast cabinets and John to build us an entertainment center to house my husbands 1970's 42\" tall speakers! and a place for me to have family pics...he built a perfectly matching (in color and design) entertainment center to our kitchen cabinets! So you would think this must be most expensive place in LV? NO! do not stress yourself out by going to a do it yourself place and then having to hire an independent guy to install everything...John has experts who install cabinets, counter tops, entertainment centers! EVERY single person who entered my home was kind, professional. Will you have a hiccup or two? maybe...Its not the hiccup...its the man behind the company and does he stand by his craftmanship! John WILL care whether you are a happy customer...do you get that at the \"do it yourself places\"??? BEST price in town...and we shopped. Most honest man to work with.  I trust John with my home needs! Thank You John for everything you did to make this \"retirement\" home the best home i've ever lived in:)
