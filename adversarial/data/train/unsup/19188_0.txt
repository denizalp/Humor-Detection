(Lyrics - Kings Of Leon - Arizona)\n\nThat taste\nAll I ever needed\nAll I ever wanted\nToo full to keep eating\n\nShe serves\nLike the Farmhouse Saisons\nChecking it out\nWith PB & J Burger\n\nThe ales\nSophomoric IPA\nI must be feeling awkward\nBrewing Arizona\n\nI go\nWrite up for a Yelper\nSay that I am happy\nToo drunk to remember\nWilderness.......\n\n\nI love this place.  The craft brews here are strange, but once you taste it; it makes sense.  The also have an interesting burger that I heard much about that I had to get.  The PB & J with jalapeno burger!  \n\nFor my beer I shot for the Sophomoric IPA, definitely not my cup of tea since it was a tad bit too sour for my taste.  Then again it was made with Mexican Lime which I should have known. However, next time I'm around I'm shooting for their flights; can't wait to taste them all!  Again for my entree I went for the PB & J burger.  Sounds totally awesome since I love peanut butter.  In the end, the burger was perfectly cooked and the ingredients worked.  Who'd thought a creamy peanut butter with a kick of spice went together!?  The fresh cut fries was good too, but what really surprised my group was the ketchup with siracha and mayo sauce that came with the onion rings.  \n\nIn the end, AZ Wilderness Brewing Co. definitely is a new spot I would totally recommend!  It's  quite a popular spot in Mesa so prepare yourself to wait for seating, but once in; go for what sounds interesting to you! - Enjoy!
