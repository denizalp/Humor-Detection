First off our server #Andrea was super information , amazing and attentive.  She is one of those 3 P's I tell you about professional , pretty and polite.  She informed us on all of the meats.  Right away I told her I'm a snob in regards to Korean food.  Though the Kalbi marinade is not your traditional Korean marinade it was sweet light tangy and super delish.  The quality of their meat is hands down the best of any Korean restaurant in town.  To be honest however I was not a fan of their kimchi at all but that was not enough to take away any stars.  Each server chipped in helping other servers it was great! Like one big happy family helping wherever they can.   The  ban chan or side dishes , first off their dweanjang soup was so yummy, the bean sprout salad was my Absolute favorite and those  Bucheen Gae pancakes made with potatoes wow those are to die for.  You won't be disappointed eating here as a matter of fact I won't eat at any Korean restaurants in Vegas but Hobak for sure we'll lets just say I will be returning.  Make sure to ask for Andrea she was an absolute delight and the prettiest of all servers !  I love women who are gorgeous and super kind and not in that uber fake way. IJS
