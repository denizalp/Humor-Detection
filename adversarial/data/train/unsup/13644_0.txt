I always missed this attraction on my past trips. For this trip, I told Jesse that I didn't want to miss it again. We waited fifteen minutes before the show started and got the front row. \n\nIt was spectacular. The Volcano was really hot. It was an awesome attraction, however the Bellagio fountain is still on top of my list but the Volcano is one not to be miss.
