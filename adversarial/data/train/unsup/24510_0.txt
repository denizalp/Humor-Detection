Bought a NEW truck and took it to Llantera Tropicana for window tinting. Guy said IN ENGLISH it would be $140 for limo tint on all side windows and back window with 2yr warranty. After 2hrs, went to pick up truck and it had 3 razor cuts on the outside of window. The biggest one on the driver side was a straight 6 inch cut. On the back driver side it was another straight line 4 inches long. And third on passanger window about 1 inch. When I confronted tinting guy about scratches, he then began to act like he didn't speak English. So another guy came around and they started to speak in spanish about what happend. We argued back and forth all while the guy denied the scratches on a NEW year truck that doesn't even have plates yet! After what felt like forever, we paid what we felt the guy deserved and took the car to a glass repair shop who told us that we needed to replace the whole window. WTH? NEVER, I MEAN NEVER go to this place to get work done unless you stand there and watch them! Or you might find yourself replacing a WHOLE window for MUCH MORE. I guess I can say I got what I paid for?!\n\n****UPDATE**** 4\/17\/2012\nKeep your receipt!!!! About 2 months ago, only 1 1\/2 years into my warrenty my tint is peeling and rippling BAD!!!!!
