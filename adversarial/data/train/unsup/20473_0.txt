Chapter 1: Bourbon Street As A Roller Rink\n\nBourbon has all the charms of your childhood roller rink. Black lights! Vending machines! Watered down soda! Popcorn!\n\nChapter 2: Bourbon Street As Mount Everest -- Act One\n\nThe women's toilet is located deep inside the strippers' locker room north of the DJ booth, due east of the vending machines. You really need a Sherpa to help traverse the mounds of hair extensions and treacherous piles of Pleasers. \n\nChapter 3: Bourbon Street As Mount Everest -- Act Two\n\nIf you're lucky, you can also happen upon the most entertaining conversations (usually about money, material items, estranged children, etc.).  Then, breathe a sigh of relief as you emerge from the clouds of cheap perfume and glitter -- you've conquered it. A regular ol' Jon Krakauer, and hopefully you still have all your limbs.\n\nChapter 4: Bourbon Street As A Courtroom\n\nLadies and mainly Gentlemen of the Jury, for the record, no \"22 year old\" likes\/or even knows WHO the Meat Puppets are. Furthermore, I submit to you, anyone who chooses 'Possum Kingdom' by the Toadies as her main stage song is well into their thirties. Guilty. I rest my case.\n\n[Exhibit A: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EkwD5rQ-_d4]
