If I won Mega Bucks, I would open a Steak 'n Shake right next to every In and Out Burger and drive them out of business. Having grown up in Beef Country and not California, it constantly amazes me how low Californian's and Nevadan's standards are for burgers, poorly cooked fries, and shakes from a machine (like McDonald's) that they line up 20 cars deep to get them.\n\nYes, in a land where Taco Bell wins \"Best Tacos\" in the RJ's poll, In and Out is the Emperor, but it's not easy to see that he is naked.\n\nNow, this location isn't as good as the ones back home that have been open since the '50s, but they do a good enough job when we go. Their constant wait to get a table or place a Takhomasak order is baffling to anyone from an area where SnS locations have drive thrus or carhop service, but it's worth it. I admire the fact that they have the exact same prices and policies as the rest of the chain, including half price drinks during Happy Hour (2-4). There is no \"casino bump\". Want a double steak burger with cheese and fries for $4? Sure thing.\n\nFor the uninitiated, they \"get\" it. That's why they've been in business since 1934. Steak is ground fresh for the burgers. They are served on plates with silverware. Milkshakes are made the right way: by hand and served in tall glasses....MADE FROM GLASS! MILKSHAKES ARE NOT WATERED DOWN ICE CREAM MIX AND SHOULD NOT COME OUT OF A MACHINE!\n\nThat also understand another concept: value. Show me a better deal for a better burger in this town! (Here's a hint-you can't.) nothing on the menu is over $6. Even the top shelf burgers with lots of dressings are $5.75 with fries. Heck, the milkshakes, while approaching the fabled \"five dollar shake mythos, are well deserving of the price difference between them and the dreck from the places where quantity is more important than quality.\n\nOh yeah, then there is the chili, Chili Mac, and rest of the menu. Get chili and cheese on your fries. Totally worth it, since getting here is enough hassle that you won't be doing it often.\n\nThe place is always full when we go, so the wait staff is slammed. Adding things to the initial order might be a bit of an ordeal, so try to get it all in one shot. Shoot for Happy Hour and get the shakes for a stupidly low price of just over $2.\n\nThis isn't an \"ingrained love from growing up on it\" like folks around here have for In and Out. We didn't have one in my hometown. My love for Steak 'n Shake developed after I was an adult.\n\nNot even ordering from the Super Secret Menu can make me understand why people settle for less at the pretender to the throne that's just a stripped down version, founded 15 years after the original.
