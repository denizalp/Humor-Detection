CRAZY expensive. Like, eye-gougingly pricey. But it was daddy's money that funded my morning spa session, so at least my eyes are still intact.\n\nMy father booked a weekend vacation at the NYNY hotel back in october for my 21st birthday, so it was us two and my mother and twin brother that went. Yes, double the trouble! On the second day of our stay, the patriarch had so generously funded a morning spa session for both my mom and myself. This included the ENTIRE package: massage, facial, pedicure, etc.\n\nService was very prompt considering we were one of the first appointments of the day, so we were both able to get out in less than 2 hours. We both left feeling loose and relaxed with baby soft faces, and with cute nails to match. Just thinking about the massage right now is putting me in a trance...........
