I guess it's safe to say that the reason why it took me this long to review this place is because it truly did not leave an impression. Going through my Arizona 'To Review\" bookmarks, I have finally gotten to writing about Bunna Coffee-- located in a strip mall in  (very) south Tempe. From what I remember, their coffees were fair trade. The prices were a little steep, and each time I went there (usually in the middle of the day), it was mostly empty. The espresso was decent. Nothing mind-blowing or anything, just good honest coffee. I think I was really annoyed with the barista for whatever reason, but I bet she doesn't work there anymore...or maybe she does? Who knows? Either way. If you're looking for a caffeine fix in this area, grab something from Bunna. It beats supporting the big guys, and hey, it's a little on the artier side, too. 2.5 Stars
