Chocolate covered, banana filled donuts? Sign me up! Got a mixed half dozen to go. The donuts were light, pillowy, with a slight outer crispness from frying. The chocolate glaze was not too sweet, and covered evenly. The only negative was that it was slightly more oily than other donuts I've had. \n\nI also had some taro smoothie with boba. The smoothie was very sweet but refreshing, and I could definitely taste the taro in the drink. The boba was nicely soft and chewy. They also have different popping boba flavors and jellies.\n\nService was great- fast and friendly. \n\nOverall a good place for donuts if you're in the area.
