Came here to meet up with my classmates to plan a presentation for class. It was very quiet and not a lot of people were there so that was good because it's nearly impossible to find a quiet, study space for groups on the York Campus. But, it's also sort of hard to find if you're not familiar with the area. I had to ask a couple of people where it was and many didn't know of it.\n\nSince this is a food review, I would have to say the food wasn't amazing. I had their daily special, Roast Beef Melt on a Toasted Ciabatta bun for around $6-7. It was really salty. If it weren't for the mediocre coleslaw and the tough-skinned pickle, I don't think I could've gone through it. But I was also hungry so. It had a lot of dijon mustard on the inside though and the colour of the cheese was too artificial looking but I guess it didn't both me that much. I liked that the bun was really crispy though and it tasted a little garlicky which I also liked. The cutlery (knife) had some crusty bits stuck on it still but I had to use it to cut my sandwich so I just rubbed it off and forgot that I did just so I could continue eating it.\n\nOverall, I guess it's a nice study place for a quick, cheap bite to eat. Especially for campus food, what more would you expect. There were a couple of students that got beers so maybe that's what keeps it going.
