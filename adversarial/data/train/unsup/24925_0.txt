The memory of going to a Marriott in NJ for breakfast on a business trip and expensing $15 for what basically amounted to an unimpressive continental breakfast with an equally unimpressive omelet bar had not yet faded when my parents suggested coming to Blue Sage, the main dining room at the Desert Ridge Marriott, for Christmas Day breakfast due to a lack of a large group to justify making a complex meal and most places being closed. Even beyond that, I don't generally think of hotel restaurants as anything besides overpriced and above average at best, so I was... skeptical.\n\nArriving at 11:30, we were presented with a choice between the lunch menu (sandwiches around $14 + a la carte drinks) or the breakfast buffet ($22) since regular breakfast was no longer being served. After looking around at what can be best described as the expanse, we all opted for the latter, despite fears that this might be a breakfast redux of Todai. This feast, which is perhaps an understatement, included:\n\n- continental breakfast offerings (scrambled eggs, yogurt, cereal, basic pastries)\n- made-to-order omelets with an array of fixings from feta to spinach to cilantro to smoked salmon to jalapenos to mild roasted salsa, egg whites available\n- succulent, flavorful chicken jalapeno sausage (and smoked bacon)\n- oatmeal with accouterments (brown sugar, pecans, dried fruit, etc.)\n- cheese blintzes with berry compote and roasted potatoes\n- better side of average apple cobbler, not overly sweet cinnamon rolls\n- fresh waffles and pancakes (included and ordered from the server)\n- myriad fresh fruit (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, melon, pineapple, etc.)\n- fresh whipped cream\n(NB: Combining the last three options can and will be hazardous to your waistline.)\n- standard morning beverages (coffee, juice, soda)\n(NB: Despite the habits of a sizable portion of the Yelp community, mimosas, wine, Long Island Iced Teas and\/or 151 are NOT standard morning beverages.)\n\nThis is by far the best as well as largest Christmas breakfast I've ever had. It's also by far the most expensive Christmas breakfast I've ever had, but the quality and variety justified the occasion splurge. If you want your clothes to still fit, be very careful if you are staying at this hotel, especially on an expense account.
