What can I say- who doesn't like saving money.\n\nSo here are my money saving, awesome deal, scrumptious, yummy, down right darn good and cool stuff you need to check out:\n\nWine aisle- So Costco has everything from Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc on sale (as of this post $10.16 per bottle, which is by far the cheapest around) to an off the hook first growth Chateau Haute Brion.  Did you say Argentina, France, US, Italy?  Don't for get the Port from Portugal.\n\nSpirit aisle-  Who in their right mind wouldn't want a 3.5 gallon of Patron Silver Tequila?   Okay, exaggerating a bit there, but 750ML is perfect.  And again can you say $11,000- yes $11,000 bottle of Scotch?  Check that off your list.  And don't forget to visit with Jimmy, Jack, Jose, Johnny,Don and the others!\n\nSeafood tastiness- Crab that is that huge for only $20.00 per pound?  Precooked and big as something off Deadliest Catch.\n\nBakery- Today they had pumpkin pie, a fruit tart, a super chocolaty huge a$$ cake and other stuff that makes you say \"Yummo\".\n\nSamples- yes i got hooked in on some fresh flat breads that were off the hook.  So sample away, eat away and spend away!!\n\nCheese in 40 lb blocks- Okay, exaggerating again but good quality cheeses at bulk prices you can't beat.  \n\nSocks\/Underwear and Tee's.  Let's face it, buying Ralph Lauren underwear is literally..ah let's not got there, but for the basics, gym socks, gym shorts, gym t shirts or gym anything this is the proverbial one stop shop.\n\nMedjool Dates-  hmmmm, okay I tried it and loved it and where else can you get them without paying the equivalent of your cable bill?  \n\nSo in short, Costco rocks, people are cool, parking sorta sucks sometimes but hey your saving a S&!% load of money so you can't complain.
