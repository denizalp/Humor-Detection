Awful!\n\n3rd time we have tried this crappy chain. Our order was wrong and was basically told \"Sorry, do you want to wait 45 minutes for the right one?\" by the manager. Service was slow and unengaged, we had our salad before our drinks. \nThey treated us like nothing but a tip and a waste of their adolescent time. \nManager tried to smooth things over with a cookie, and over heard him doing it with the table right next to us! We were walking out the door, giving up on waiting for said cookie that now my 5 year old had his heart set on (THANKS waitress), when she magically discovered it was ready. Not to mention spent $75 for a &15 Little Caesar's meal.  Last time, I will never recommend this over priced McDonald's version of pizza that rides on their brand name instead of service and quality. There is way better ANYWHERE you go try, Maize's, St. Francis (great for kids), Postinos up the street or Pizza Bianco.
