Absolutely the best restaurant around. We were here on a Thursday night and had the linguine carbonara in the cheese wheel! Oh my goodness, best I've ever had and we lived in Italy for 3 years. Chef Rudy's gastronomical creations are imaginative and extraordinary. He blessed us with a desert of Lemoncello sorbet! Amazing! We live in the Aliante area and will make the trek to Henderson over and over again for this amazing place. Thank you again for a great experience Chef!
