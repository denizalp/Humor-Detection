My car door wouldn't latch shut and I brought it in for service. 24 hours later, car was good as new and door latches properly. Repairs done under warranty. Friendly staff and good waiting area with free WiFi.\n\nI bought my car originally from Thornhill Hyundai (which I've also reviewed) and the service department here is much friendlier. Whereas Thornhill refused to tighten a few screws in my car (I had to go to an indie shop and borrow a Torx wrench), DVN Hyundai completely replaced my door actuator in a day and under warranty.\n\nWill definitely be coming here next time.
