Yet another tourist trap as I indicated with the Hershey's and M&Ms worlds.\nHey, Coke should pay ME to wear their merchandise! \nThere is definitely quite an array of items to choose from - clothing, accessories, novelties, kitchen items, ornaments, etc.\nThey do have international cokes but it's so expensive . . for 9 \"shots\" of coke, it's like $12. Why not put out free machines that give shots and then sell bottles with the flavors? Coke doesn't make enough money to do this, do they?
