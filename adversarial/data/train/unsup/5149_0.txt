Pizza is A-OK and the toppings were surprisingly generous for being in the middle of the casino floor. Great spot for late-night eats, located in the Caesar's food court - it's perfect if you are just leaving Omnia and cannot be bothered to walk far. \n\nRolled up around 2 or 3 AM - really long line, but it moved fast. You may order by the slice or pie.We ordered a full pie ($29), half mushroom & half pepperoni. The wait for them to make it was only about ten minutes, which was really nice considering how busy they were. \n\nNow onto the pizza - I'm a fan of greasy deep dish but pizza is always a good choice. Their crust is nothing to write home about and a little floury tasting. The cheese had a decent \"cheese pull\" but there could've been more. As mentioned, there were a whole lotta mushroom and pepperoni (on their respective sides, of course). Every bite was accompanied with some topping and I never just got a full bite of cheese. \n\nThis place is great for late-night (especially if you're in or very close to Caesars). But I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
