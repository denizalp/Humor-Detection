Big B's BBQ boasts the ambience of a real backyard BBQ, including the smoky stench you'll leave with afterwards.  Employees were friendly, but the food here was just A-Ok. \n\nItems tried:\nBrisket\nTri-tip\nMac n cheese\nCreamed corn\nBaked beans\nPotato salad\n\nI preferred the tri-tip over the brisket in the flavor department, but I appreciated the tenderness of the brisket. The meat was kind of dry side and absolutely needed sauce. I was a bit disappointed that the tables offered only one kind of BBQ sauce.  It wasn't bad, just didn't have the wow factor. The mustard sauce at the table was tasty, but didn't really go with the meats we had. \n\nThe sides were pretty good. I liked the baked beans the best and the creamed corn the least. \n\nI'm glad I got to finally try this place since I was nearby for an appointment. It was the most reasonable fast, casual food option that didn't have a drive thru in the immediate area. I will have to tackle on the pork options at a next visit. Looking forward to some ribs, pulled pork, and hot links! \n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n31\/100
