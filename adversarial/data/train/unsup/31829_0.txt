Had some douchey 20-something brunette guy skip me entirely to greet and tend to the guy in line behind me. Thankfully, the customer was chivalrous and fair enough to ask me if I'd ordered yet to understand why I was being skipped...\n\nOrdered two cold pressed juices, Bee Cosmopolitan and Bee Grateful, at $12 a bottle. You can imagine the hike in the prices (compared to off-strip juice bars that average $7) being attributed to its prime real estate location inside the posh Cosmo Hotel, right next door to tourist-ravished breakfast eatery Eggslut. The juices were delicious and refreshing but not at all worth it after the cashier's shitty service.
