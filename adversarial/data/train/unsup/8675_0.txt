I couldn't be more excited about this place opening! It's a VERY short walk from my apartment which could bode well for them, but not so much for me...\n\nEverything is consistent with what I've experienced at the W. 25th location, but better (because it's in walking distance and I don't feel the need to hold back...wow, I'm sounding like a lush now). I really prefer the open space and the windows all around. It just feels like a great summer spot, with the doors open and the friendly bartenders. \n\nThe food is good. I really like the burger and that's what I get every time I go to W. 25th, so I went for it at this location. Consistent, though I must say, there seemed to be less grease here, which is overall a good thing because I got a little more burger \"crunch\" on those thinner edges. Also worth checking out are the homemade potato chips. They're quite the treat and a nice starchy snack that's a welcome change from the typical bar fries. \n\nThe beer selection is fantastic (no surprise, considering the loads of options they have at the original location) and I'm always happy to find some of my favorite brews on their lengthy list. This is also a good place to try something new (happy hours run long and the specials are worth it). The staff is usually pretty helpful and happy to aid in decisions. Worth noting, as well, is that they run specials on different beer combos and amounts, as well as unique food selections--just ask and you shall receive the rundown with a little backstory, too, if you're nice enough! \n\nOverall, GO HERE. Have a good time and chat it up with the staff. They're good people and this is a great establishment.
