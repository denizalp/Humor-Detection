I had to drop BillyB. off at the airport 630a Tuesday, (gads) so I decided to try Carolina Prime, never have I eaten there, just curious of the large sign that reads: \"breakfast, lunch & dinner! hmmmm, really nothing to lose, I often wonder why we take food so seriously. \n\nI walk in and it's dark, with booths of red vinyl. Seems like the kind of restaurant that would have a buffet. It was cozy and quiet upon entering, but then the organ music kicked in, it would have been very pleasant if they weren't rockin' the house with freakin' organ music Jingle Bells, I Saw Mama Kissing Santa Claus, there should be rules about holiday music and stricter rules if the sun isn't up. \n\nI ordered breakfast and coffee, very reasonably priced. Typical fare of waffles, pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, steaks and hashbrowns. I will go back, maybe I will wait till January, when this madness is over. Suck it, Jingle Bells.
