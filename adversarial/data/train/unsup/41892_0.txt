I'm giving one star because I have to in order to start this comment. Absolute horrible customer service every time I've been to the store. I went to the drive-through last time young man was very rude and after his rudeness I did not feel comfortable eating food that passed through his hands. As I walked in to speak to the manager I saw him run back to the managers office before I can get to them so I walked back outside to my car and just called. The manager gave me the same line of shit you would hear any place that he will have a talk with the young man which I doubt.  I will never go to this location again and I would advise you not to even bother!
