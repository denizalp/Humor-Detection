Wow. Terrible obnoxious. Rude. Told us they need us to hurry so they could go home on time. We arrived at the restaurant@10 and by 10:15 they're telling us to hurry or.  This place sucks rocks.  \nPlates are all chopped. Glasses chipped. Dirty floor. And we haven't ordered yet.  Waiter is amazingly slow with his tablet while taking our order.  \nSuburbia shit hole.\n\nOk, I've never before edited a Yelp review. The waiter barely spoke English;  few of the staff do. The waitress' poor English was excusable until she made fun of one of us for being too old to read the extremely small, 8 point tan print on a darn brown menu in dim red light. Then the owner put his hands on top of two glasses, covering the rim with his palms. Terrible manes,  terrible service. All in our group agreed we will not be returning.  I wish there was a no-star rating
