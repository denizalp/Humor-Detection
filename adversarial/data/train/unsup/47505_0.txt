crepes made with care and precision. Quick turnaround, too.\nThis isn't a waitered place -- you place your order and wait for them to call you name. \n\nSweet and savory, they're all delicious. I had the apple caramel crepe. My friend had the ham and cheese. They accidentally gave him a tomato and onion at first, which they let him keep once they quickly realized their mistake, so we both were able to sample 3 crepes total. They were all delicious.\n\nBig servings, perfectly executed, and delivered quickly. This place is a gold mine!
