I came here on Saturday night and it was my first time at the Keg!\n\nThe food was phenomenal. I genuinely didn't understand what all the hype was about until this night. I had the NY steak which came with twice baked potato and greens\/red pepper on the side. The steak was cooked exactly how I wanted and VERY tasty! I couldn't get enough! The double baked potato is a must try!!!!\n\nI gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because our waiter disappeared a lot. We had to flag down other waiters in order to get help\/pay for our bill.\n\nOther than that I will definitely be returning.
