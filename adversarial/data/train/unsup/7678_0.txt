As I walked into Pavement...breathing in the well-made clothes and shoes, refined rustic country decor and quirky accessories, I quickly thought \"wait, am I in New York?\"\n\nI mean this in the best possible way. Pittsburgh is way cooler than people give it credit for (well, you all know that in Pittsburgh, I'm just agreeing with all of you!). Pavement is high quality, best of the best in boutique class.\n\nFirst off. THE SHOES. Holy heavens...quality rich leathers in all sorts of beautiful colors and shapes and sizes. This is where you come to buy shoes that you'll WEAR. A lot. Shoes that go with everything. Boots that make people turn their heads. And unfortunately for me, price tags that made my mouth drop a bit. Not that I find them to be overpriced, just out of MY personal price range for the day. C'est la vie, I'd know where to find them when the money hit and I needed t foot fancy fast. \n\nAs Rachel mentions, it's a carefully culled lineup of clothing...and usually that means I find 1-2 things I \"might\" like. Well, I ended up trying on 7-8 things, and coming out with 3 \"YES!\" items. A black striped cotton half-dress with ruched sleeves ($36), a orange\/cream print maxi dress that is perfectly flattering for an end of summer wedding ($68) and a bird dress that I talked myself out of, but someone please go scoop it up. SO cute. \n\nTheir accessories range from cheap ($14 sunglasses, $16 fedoras with feathers) to pricier local designer pieces. If shopping for a gift, this is a surefire hit with the ladies. (hint, gents). Go!\n\nAll in all, just exactly what you want out of a boutique. Friendly, comfortable, classy and a little bit quirky to keep things real. I'm a huge fan.
