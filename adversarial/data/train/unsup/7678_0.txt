Near to Pitts and CMU. The waitress could speak chinese, that helps a lot to order the meal. The tastes of the dishes are not bad. I would recommend fried rice first, mixed with beef, chicken and shrimps. Dry hot pot shrimps is ok, a little spicy. The restaurateur is nice and give us a card to save five dollars for orders over 35$. I will go back again to try their sushi next time.
