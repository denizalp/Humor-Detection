Great variety on the menu, even lots of vegetarian options!!! The kids menu was great as well. The salad bar looked amazing. I had a spinach veggie wrap and it was nice. I didn't love that there were a lot of employees, including the manager, sitting around while most of the tables had crumbs or trash. My strawberries were a bit slimy but they did give me chips and salsa as well. Unfortunately the chips were a bit stale. My wrap was great though and my kids were happy with their soup, baked potato, and pizza. We loved the free ice cream at the end. All in all a good experience and we will definitely come back again.
