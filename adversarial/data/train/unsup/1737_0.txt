We live in the general area and have been here several times before and after the DDD show. They always have good food. Always. \n\nWe had 3x bean and cheese burritos, 1x shredded beef taco and 1x chili releno ,meal with rice and beans. I could only eat one chili and some rice and beans. That thing was good. The burritos an d taco were devoured by the rest of the family with hardly any speaking. That is a feat in my house. (3 girls) \n\nI heart Robertos.
