Great prices. We were able to get the deal we wanted with next day delivery. The sales person was a little pushy...but in the long run I'm happy with our purchase. Only possible negative with our experience is that the delivery guys accidentally tore off the warranty tags on our mattress. Otherwise, they were very nice and quick with setup.
