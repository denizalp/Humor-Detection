My boyfriend and I spent a fantastic Friday night drinking at this bar while on our recent mini-vacation to Calgary.  Tasty non-traditional bar munchies including garlic fries and corn on the cob. \n\nBest bartender ever. I'll say again. The BEST bartender ever. \n\nWe enjoyed free entertainment with the quazi-country band upstairs and could've gone downstairs for even more rock & roll had we wished. As a tourist, I was too absorbed with the local flavor happening all around me as the night wore on and the patrons got more and more intoxicated and the bartender got less and less willing to tolerate their insanity. \n\nThanks for making our trip to Calgary more awesome Palomino.
