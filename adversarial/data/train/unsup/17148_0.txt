Ugh. Just got back to town and decided to give Marty's Market another try on a Monday, for breakfast. Went in and stood for a few minutes and noticed one frantic server running around. It wasn't that busy but definitely too many tables for one person. She finally sat me, by telling me to take a seat at the breakfast counter. There were 2-top tables available and I thought about asking but decided against it to spare the poor woman even the slightest extra exchange. Her stress level was all over her face. I sat at the counter for awhile looking at a very messy steel table full of restaurant stuff that really shouldn't be showing, certainly not in that state of chaos. Looked around and saw lots of people with menus still on their table, so decided to just go get a coffee and maybe get something to eat if things slowed down a bit. Over at the coffee counter, I was shocked by what a mess it was. Then when I saw the Barista cleaning out the espresso apparatus by blowing into it, I had enough. Goodbye Marty's. Don't think I'll try again.
