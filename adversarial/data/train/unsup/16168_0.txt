One sentence. The cashier got me so upset that I went into labor! That right as in had a baby.  I was checking out with a WIC coupon. Which I know can be a pain and nobody likes doing them or being inline behind either, well nobody like using them either.  Anyway the cashier, who I'd gone to many time before with the coupons argued with me about whether or not an item was allowed. The same item she had checked out for me in the past. She refused to even scan it to see the the computer would let it go through. The line had to be closed and all the other customer moves to a different line, while she straight argued with the supervisor who told her to scan the items. She still refused. I can't for the life of me understand why that kind of insubordination was tolerated.   after the supervisor checked me out, with the items in question, which scanned just fine and were clearly listed in the allowed items book, I was driving home and started having contractions. My baby was born hours later healthy.  I sent letters to the store and the headquarters and haven't heard one word about. If the cashiers are going to argue with customers to the point where they go into labor, if someone had a heart condition and was through into a heart attack?  And they don't even have the manners to contact me in response.  This happened  in December of 2013, I have not been back to this store since and try my best not to shop at ant giant eagle when possible.
