Love this place!!!! The owners are absolutely wonderful, very friendly and love what they do! Every time we come here there is a line out the door, but it's worth the wait and they work very fast to make sure the line is constantly moving! There are a ton of different flavors to choose from..... you cant come here and not find anything you don't like! There is something for everyone!\n\nAbsolutely recommend the Sea Salt Carmel...... never tasted another flavor of gelato better than this!\n\nKeep it up Frost!
