Come here for greasy, no frills, no banter diner breakfast. If you weren't reading this review you might never notice this place - it's on a side street in Leslieville and is barely perceivable on a neighbourhood stroll.\n\nNOTES:\n* As soon as you walk in and sit down, the owner starts making your breakfast. There is a menu, but no point in looking at it. Unless you state otherwise, you're getting two eggs (over easy), bacon, home fries and toast. So if you want to deviate from this, best get your words in within the 120 second timeframe between entering and sitting down on a barstool.\n\n* This is a relic from the past - the decor hasn't been updated since it opened in 1946, and the owner\/cook has maybe been working here just as long. There are about ten seats in the entire place and they're all at the counter, so this place is not good for groups. \n\n* Note the hours - 7am to 1pm (sometimes earlier) weekdays only.\n\n* I don't need to tell you that it's cash only, but you won't need much of it. Our breakfasts were $6 each. The cash register looked like it was from the 19th century, and it probably actually was.
