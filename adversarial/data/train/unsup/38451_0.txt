We have always love Village Inn..but the last year we had had several customer services where we felt they were lacking extensively..  we haven't gone back for almost 6 moths...and decided to go there this morning to give it one last try. To our surprise... it was a complete turn around in customer service... warm greeting.. Happy faces and the manager John was amazing and restored our faith in VI... we will be back and will again sing their praises as we had done in the past. Great food..great menu and great service!!!!
