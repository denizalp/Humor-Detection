Clubs, cocktails, casinos, crazy weekends ... if you love Vegas as much as I do there is no better place to stay than Caesars. \n\nCaesars is located in the heart of the strip, right next door to Bellagio, and a short walk from both the Venetian and the Cosmopolitan.  \n\nThe casino is huge, filled with blackjack and craps tables. Bring your friends, bring your chips, and enjoy the night with free cocktails. If you have never played craps before this is the place to learn. Be careful though, your first roll of the dice is intoxicating after one night you will be hooked. \n\nCaesars also has the best sports book in Vegas. If there is a game you want to watch, this is the place to come. You can bet on anything and the environment cant be beat. \n\nCaesars I love you more than you will ever know, I miss you dearly, keep a light on for me, I promise I'll be back to visit soon.
