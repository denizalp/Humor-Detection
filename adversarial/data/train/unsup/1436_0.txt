They close at 5 30 and I made it there at 5:27.  I run up to the door and.... it's locked.  If you close before 5 30 than change your hours to reflect that!    \n\nWorst part is I saw someone inside, obviously not doing anything, and they didn't acknowledge me as if it is normal for people to stand bewildered in front of their store.  \n\nI knew exactly what I wanted and would have been out in a no time.  If you plan on going near close make sure to call ahead and make sure the employees aren't trying to duck out early.
