This place was 5 star all the way until our Main Course. We stared with Pea Soup it was Amazing. Our second course was the New England Clam Fry and that was also good. Nice presentation and flavors where Perfect.  We ordered the Burger Med Rare. It was cooked Medium Well. The bun was soggy it was covered in Ketchup? We also had the Vegetable Juices and that was Good. Nice to see that on a menu.  I will definitely be back.  I think we are going to give them another try for Dinner.\n\nLoved the Check presenters and the Ketchup Bottles Very Creative.
