FINALLY! I have found a place where I can truly enjoy a nice bowl of pho! If you know anything about my pho searching journey in Vegas, you'd know that I've been pretty disappointed with every experience I've had at a Vietnamese restaurant thus far. But eureka! Pho Annie does it for me. \n\nFirst off, we need to cover location because it is not an easy find. Complex is rather odd. It's almost like the complex curves toward the street with Pho Annie tucked on the inside hidden from the street view.  Just look for Chee Burger Chee Burger, it's in the same complex.\n\nRestaurant isn't large 5-6 booths on the left, 3-4 tables on the right. First visit was during lunch and it got packed fast. Second visit was on a Sunday night and it was much slower. I order the Annie Special pho that includes all meat additions (tripe, fatty brisket, tendon, meat balls, flank). In Houston, we are given the option of small bowls or large bowls for pho and this would definitely be considered as the large bowl. The bowl costs around $7. I order the egg rolls as an appetizer and they're great -- comes with 4 large egg rolls. Keep in mind pho doesn't take long to prepare at all so your main course will most likely follow the app within 5-10 minutes. \n\nIt's really hard to describe the taste of the broth. All I can really say is that I truly enjoyed it. It had the perfect amount of flavor and I actually sipped on it after I ate up everything else. \n\nAnd if pho isn't your thing, they have a wide selection of other dishes. Can't go too much in detail of that for ya cause I didn't pay close attention.. sorry!\n\nMy favorite pho place so far! The only downfall is you have to spend a minimum of $10 to use your credit card.
