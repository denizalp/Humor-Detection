Since Casino Royale doesn't do the cheap Margaritas anymore, Fat Tuesday is your best bet. You actually have to ask for the cheap version ($1.50? don't quote me) but our party went for the $10 cocktail glass Margarita which I found a bit expensive. \n\nThey have different sorts, the RED BULL INFUSED MARGARITA wasn't too strong but you could feel both the Red Bull and the Margarita after finishing it. \n\nA bit pricey after all and I wouldn't go out of my way to get that frozen booze again. Only when passing by.
