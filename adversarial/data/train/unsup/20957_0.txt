What can I say about Danny's that could possibly do it justice?  My father has been going here since he was in high-school, and a trip to Steel Town isn't complete for me without a visit. The picture of Italian Hoagie perfection that this place paints is, quite simply put, the best on the planet.  It is breathtaking...it's like if Leo Da Vinci and Lidia Bastianich had a baby, and that baby created this sandwich in a stroke of weird chef\/artist baby-genius.\n\nI salivate like Pavlov's dog when I get within 50 miles of this place.  Always perfectly assembled, with even meat\/cheese distribution and proper application of vegetables AFTER toasting, this hulking sandwich is a pleasure to eat even in your Sunday Finest!  Every bite is an explosion of flavor, but I rarely need a napkin.  Nothing should be added to or taken away from the \"Original Hoagie with everything.\"  It can not be improved upon.  Period.\n\nIf God ate hoagies, this would be the only one she cared for. And she wouldn't call ahead either...she'd know that they are best fresh out of the oven, and that the wait is never too long. You can never wait too long for a Danny's Italian hoagie. God says so.  And I say so.  And I told God about this place, so there.\n\nThe satisfaction I feel after eating a Danny's Italian Hoagie is not unlike what I feel after the best, most opulent holiday meal.  Only I can get that satisfaction any day I want by eating a Danny's Italian Hoagie...imagine that!  It's like crack, only better.  Food crack.  Or maybe food heroin, because once I eat one I want to take a nap!  Nod right out...\n\n\n\n\nThey also make pizza.  I've never had it.
