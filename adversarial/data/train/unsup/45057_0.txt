This place is the bomb! Best Thai Coffee ever, and they are buy one get. #Winning \nI stumbled across this place one trying to kill some time. I tried the Thai Coffee and I have been a fan every since. The Bento box special is delicious as well as the Miso Ramen. Babe tried it for the first time and loved it. Haven't tried much of their sushi. I did have California roll however, that was pretty tasty.
