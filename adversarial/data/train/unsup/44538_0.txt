This place was just alright.   I expected much better quality food being that it was in the Venetian.  We had dinner here and then breakfast the following day.  We ordered the burrata an tomato as an appetizer with a flatbread for dinner.  The appetizer was good, just not $14 worth.  It was a very small portion.  Only three slices of tomato.  The flatbread was not a flatbread at all, it was just a pizza.  It was under cooked and lacked flavor.  The next day, we were looking to find breakfast on a Sat at 11:30 am and most places had stopped serving breakfast, except for this place.  The breakfast was so bad.   We thought we were getting a good deal by ordering the combo that had eggs, hash browns, bacon\/sausage, pancakes\/ french toast and toast. I mean how can you go wrong with the basics?  Apparently it's really hard to cook hash browns, so they serve lil frozen triangles, the kind you might find at La Quinta Inn's continental breakfast.  The toast was gross, and they served really old bread that crumbled, and the pancakes were two silver dollar bland nothingness.
