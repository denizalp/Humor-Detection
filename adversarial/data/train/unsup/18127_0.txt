THE ONLY GOOD THING ARE THE DONUTS.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure they were Entenmann's brand that they just put in the buffet. The soda doesn't even taste right. It's way too sugary and not bubbly enough. Everything here is stale. I made the MISTAKE of buying the all-day pass. My friend conned me into it, saying how awesome it would be. (I'm looking at you SNFX). $24.95 to eat pieces of shit. Literally like eating pieces of shit. It all looks okay from far away but once you start eating it, you feel your life force floating away from you. I could literally TASTE the disgusting stick of butter in the fried rice. It was so disgusting. Nothing tasted right here. Worst freaking food ever. Seriously. Don't go here.
