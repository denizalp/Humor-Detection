I had the Mac and cheese burger, and my girlfriend had the turkey burger.  She described it as the \"best turkey burger she has ever had\".  My burger was really good as well.  The fries that came with it were pretty cool... They gave you an assortment of types (waffle, shoestring, curly, etc). It was a lot of food... We also had the s'mores monte cristo .  Not my favorite dessert... The description didn't say that it was deep fried (like a doughnut) but it was.  We didn't finish it.\n\nThe restaurant itself was really pretty cool... But I think most of the restaurants I Vegas are... They certainly charge enough.  We had 2 specialty cocktails at the bar while we waited for our table (that we're really good and the bartender as really cool)  that cost us $24 plus tip and then our burgers,  1 more rail drink and a dessert for a little more then $60.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this restaurant if you want a really good burger while your on the strip
