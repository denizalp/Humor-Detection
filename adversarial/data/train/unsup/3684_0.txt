I spent one night in the cylindrical tower.  \n\nI was leaving Vegas after a rough weekend.  An ad on the radio promoted rooms at the Sands for $20.  Why not? I hadn't abused my sick time. I pulled a uie and headed back into town.\n\nI asked for a room in the tower, but Philomena the desk rep said there was nothing available.  No problem.  As I turned from the desk to head for my room in one of the annexes, I told Philomena I thought she had a pretty name.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" she said.  \"Let me check again.\"  Sure enough, she had overlooked a room available in the tower.  Flattery?  Not at all.  I still think Philomena is a great name.  I got to watch the Mirage volcano from my room.  Thanks Philomena wherever you are.\n\nThe sands had a great pool area, with lawns I imagined like a venerable beach & tennis club. The grounds and facilities were aging but lovingly maintained like a historic racetrack or ballpark.  I visited the empty Copa room, where the Rat Pack shows took place http:\/\/www.songsbysinatra.com\/stories\/stories72a.html.  I didn't see a plaque or exhibit commemorating the legandary performances. There was an attractive coffee shop.\n\nThe Mirage or course ushered in the megaresort era.  The day the Mirage became a glimmer in Steve Wynn's eye, the Sands was doomed.  Vegas is all about the latest and greatest. There is no place for architectural treasures or historic preservation.  Vegas only looks forward.\n\nSomeday the Mirage will be imploded to make way for the next New Thing. Some will not be happy to see it go.
