Around 3pm, I left here satisfied as I checked out, but once I was going to return the cart, there was an older looking lady with blonde, short hair with glasses who was giving me the rudest attitude! I was respectfully putting my cart away, but she spotted out that the cart doesn't belong here and want me to take it outside. I have been using an Office Max cart this whole time without even noticing. Maybe you should have checked all your carts if it belonged to your store, rather than \"assuming\" I brought the cart in myself and not blame on me?? Overall she was just all around RUDE. Instead of a, \"thank you, have a nice a day.\", she pretty much made me leave here with an awful experience. Does she treat all customers like that?? Looks like I lost respect for this location.
