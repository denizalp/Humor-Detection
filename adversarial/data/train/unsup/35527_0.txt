My wife and I wanted to try something different so I looked up restaurants on Yelp around us and found Don Michael. We arrived at the location it was a little hard to find since the sign at night is hard to see and should be lit up. We entered the Resturant only one other couple was eating it was empty on a Friday night I could understand why there really is no signage the interior could be remodeled to look Italian not brown walls and a red painted chair rail and plastic covered table cloths. \n\nAs for the food I give the taste five stars but the presentation could use some help. Over all the food was great the service can us a little help and a Italian remodel.
