Wow, we had a late lunch at this location on Sunday. Stefan was excellent, friendly, helpful, attentive and really provided above and beyond amazing guest relations\/service. What a wonderful experience and the food was great! The Satay Chicken Skewers took a bit too long to  come out, but no complaints on flavor once they arrived. Thank you for making a Sunday Funday Lunch SUPER AWESOME!
