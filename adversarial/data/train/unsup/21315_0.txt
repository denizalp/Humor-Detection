We were waiting for a friend to meet us up for lunch next door so, we killed some time by checking this place out. They just recently opened so, they only had a few items in their fridge\/freezer. It's a good sign that they don't mass-produce their product. Their dog food are freshly made in house. They were in the process of making some when we came in.\n\nThe ingredients they use are all natural. Salmon, rice, sweet potatoes, etc. I remember when I was little and that's what we would feed our fur babies and none of the pre-packed pellets and wet chunks of unidentifiable gunk in a can.\n\nRalf enjoyed the salmon jerky and the punkin balls. They have meal plans for your pups. The guys here are very helpful. They have some cute puppy paintings hanging on the walls. Check this place out and get some treats for your pooch!
