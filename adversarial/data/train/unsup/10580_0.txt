I'd leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions)\n\n1. Nobuo at Teeter House.\n2. Fez.\n3. My friends in various parts of the valley\n\nand \n\n4. Mekong Supermarket.\n\nI consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.\n\nMekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar. \n\nThis place has it all.\n\nI usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? It's yours.\n\nTo me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want. \n\nMake the trek. You won't regret it.
