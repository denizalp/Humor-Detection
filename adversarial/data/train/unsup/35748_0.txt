This is a real Quebecois dining experience. Venison tartare, Elk steak and all. Maybe I was expecting more or whatever , it just fell a bit short for me. Great atmosphere, tough steak with a little grizzle, and I think the waitress was not digging on our Brooklyn accents at all. \nWe did have an interesting vegetable called fiddleheads which was great. If it was less expensive, they would have gotten a higher rating. I expected better for what I paid.
