This place was highly recommended by a local. We arrived and were a little skeptical because it was almost empty. Turned out that we had just missed the rush! Our luck! This place does not look impressive at first glance, but let the food do all the talking. Everything was absolutely great. This is a family owned restaurant and our waiter was a great host.\n\nI had the enchiladas de mole. Wonderful. The Mole sauce is great, a rich red color and they claim, made in-house.  Others in our group had the costillas en salsa verde and they were very pleased. Tortillas were great, not store bought stiff tortillas. \n\nWe didn't have margaritas, but I was told that they are wonderful, too. Next time in Phoenix, we will definitely drop in once more and try something else on the menu. Great job keeping Mexican food true to its roots.
