Honey Salt is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It is a cute venue. The inside has that trendy, funky vibe to it. It's good for dates. I was outside since I brought my dog with me. The employees were really nice and accommodating. They brought a bowl of water for my dog.\n\nWe got the gnocchi and the grilled chicken. Two separate entrees. The gnocchi was good. It was my first time tasting it and I thought the sauce was good. It was the right size. I don't really like soft textures like that but it was bearable because of the size. The grilled chicken was so good. It was juicy and the flavors were great. It wasn't overdone or anything. It tasted just right.\n\nThe servers were great. They were really attentive and nice. I definitely recommend this place. I don't know if they rotate their menu though because last time I was there, I had a burger but they didn't have any burgers this time.
