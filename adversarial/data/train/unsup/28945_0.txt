I normally wouldn't leave review twice for 1 place but what happened tonight made me want to write another one. Since My work is far from this store (40 mins drive), i had to drop my car off to be fixed and pick it up after work (8pm). The store is closed at 7pm but when i arrived at 8pm, i still see the store manager (Laura) and couple other mechanics working on customers' cars, which impressed me by how hard they work. So what happened was i wasn't able to unlocked my car because my key fob doesn't work for some reason (and that's the only way I can unlock my car for now). I knocked on the door and Told Laura what happened. I felt so bad because it's out of their business hours. Without thinking, she ran right out to my car and helped me to open the trunk as requested, with the hope that I can get in the car when the trunk open (my car is an SUV). She even showed me to get a new battery and where to get it for the key fob. Without any luck, she grabbed another mechanic (I forgot to ask for his name) to help me open the trunk. He tried and tried and tried for a good 15 mins and finally got it open. I was so happy that almost cried. If only they didn't work hard and still be there when I came, if only the manager and the mechanic wouldn't have a strong work ethic, i would be stuck there still and waited for AAA (and who knows what time they will come). thank you very much Laura and the mechanic, who could have turned away and said \"sorry it's out of our business hours\/ i don't know what else to do for you\/you can get a new key fob battery\/ call AAA\", but didn't do so. I did, am and will continue to bring my car here to fix because i know this is the place i wouldn't be taken advantage of for being a girl, who doesn't know much about car. Plus this place offer great deals often and you can find them on firestone website. Highly recommended to everyone.
