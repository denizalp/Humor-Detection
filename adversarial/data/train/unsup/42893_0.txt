S. W. Welch is one of my favourite stores in Montreal. I'm lucky that I live and work closeby to the store because even if it's closed I'll always stop and look at the new titles displayed in the windows. The owner, Steve Welch has his finger on the pulse for what readers want- you won't find any \"microwave cooking\" books or 7 copies of a best seller from 1999. What you get here are everyone's favourite authors, all the books you know you should read at some point but haven't yet, beautiful and interesting coffee table books, GREAT cookbooks and a surprisingly large collection of graphic novels. And of course, being second hand- the price is always right. ($5 for a paperback pocketbook to $100ish for first editions or rarities)
