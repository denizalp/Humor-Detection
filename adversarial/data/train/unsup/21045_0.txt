Now I don't go to the hospital very often (try to avoid that) but my travels do bring me to them from time to time, in the 10 years I've lived in sin city I've been to UMC trauma several times. First time I've actually checked in here to leave a review. \n\nI know I know Nevada is at the bottom of the list when it comes to medical care, long term or short term. But when it comes to our trauma center they are up there with the best. Las vegans should know that if they ever get shot or stabbed they are in good hands, I wouldn't go anywhere else in southern Nevada. \n\nUMC trauma has helped saved countless lives that otherwise would have been homicides, if it wasn't for them we'd have a higher number of murders in town. The staff is very professional and keeps you updated as often as possible. The security is very friendly and informative as far as visitors and house rules. \n\nWhile I don't know how their ER or rest of the facilities are like I can rest assure the trauma center is on their game.
