My lovely yelper and friend had their tenth anniversary some years ago and thought it would be nice the day before NYE to eat here before year ends.  She made reservation months in advance so dinner was set for four.\n\nIt was a busy night as we enter into what looked to be a bar\/entrance to the restaurant.  There, we were acknowledged and were said to wait until our table was ready.  We sat near the bar and to our non expectation, nobody came to take our orders.  One of my dear friend had to hop onto the bar and asked to be served with cocktails.  \n\nI got the pink velvet.  That was awesomely refreshing alochol drink that hit just the right spot.  The other flavors were gin and tonic and martini by the guys.  Low and behold, we were finally seated a not so great table but nonetheless, overlooking a post wedding dinner and a family celebration. Oh well.\n\nOur waiter for the night was nice and pleasant. Got our menu as well as our order of the the fine wine that we all love Cab.  Cost us $155.  It was exquisite and worth every penny.  My table had the usual, foie gras and meat was the order of the night.  I went for the braised shortribs.  Very tender and delish. The lamb and the muscovy duck were good I was told by my eating companions that complimented very well with our wine.  \n\nTo end the night, we four shared two souffles--chocolate and pistacchio.  I preferred the chocolate.  Overall, a great night of food with wonderful friends.  A romantic night out with a great couple. Nice ambience. Tab was steep but well worth it. Hey, we are in Vegas so we should eat like one--at least once in a while.
