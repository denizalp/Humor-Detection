Not a great experience   We bought our tickets with the show ticket and got out of the show and they told us they were closing!!  We came directly from the show so this was unexpected.  After my husband jumped up and down, they let us in, but it was very rushed. I always had a good opinion of this buffet, but this was unfortunate
