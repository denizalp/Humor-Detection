There seems to be a trend here... Dr webber has bad reviews and people love Dr Mendoza.  Well following the trends... we see Dr Mendoza haha.  We love him, He was the pediatrician on call when my daughter was b born and we hit it off right away.  He takes his time to explain things, discuss options and is very open to what the family's wishes are and isn't pussy with his opinions. I love that there are separate entrances for sick and well visits.   The wait to get in can be a bit long, I was very ill after my delivery and we ended up a week late for our 2 month shots because I couldn't get in sooner... the only downside is that the rooms are in need of a deep cleaning
