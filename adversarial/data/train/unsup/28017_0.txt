If I could rate this place a 0 I would! The staff is unprofessional and rude. I brought my car in and waited 30 mins before even being acknowledged (I should have just left). I asked for help and the service manager couldn't be bothered, he wrote down the wrong car type and then passed me off to some poor kid who the staff was yelling at across the store. I explained that a screw had fallen out of the steering column, that it had happened before, and all I needed was for it to be reattached. I also explained that the bumper hung low and to be aware of it. The next day when they called and said the car was ready I arrived to my car having a crack in the bumper and the screw for the steering column sitting in the cup holder and the column still not working! After explaining for a second time what was wrong three days later they called and said the car was ready and it was on a lift when we got there! WHAT A JOKE!!! This is a poorly run establishment with incompetent managers and staff. Go to the Pep Boys on E Tropicana to avoid a headache and get your car fixed appropriately.
