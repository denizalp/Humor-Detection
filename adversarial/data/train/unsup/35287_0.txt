Howard is amazing!!!  Although I never met him we had several conversations on the phone about my 1956 Nash Metropolitan named Petunia!!  He took great care of her and fixed just what needed to be fixed and I never felt that I was being taken advantage of at all.  When I had to ship her back home Howard was so helpful in getting her loaded and taking pictures of her so that if there was any damage once she arrived I would have proof of her condition before she was shipped.  Howard even texted me when she left as well as made sure she arrived safely.  The car runs great once again and I would sure recommend Howard to anyone that is looking for an honest and trustworthy mechanic. \nHoward thank you again for taking care of Petunia!
