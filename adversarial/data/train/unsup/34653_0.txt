This place has a family restaurant feel. It's definitely not your typical American style restaurant. We had the shiro, vegi combo and timatit Fitfit (tomato salad soaked with their flat bread And lemon and sauce) As a vegan I get a trill from discovering new restaurants and Ethiopian food is a vegans best friend.
