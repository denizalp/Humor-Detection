The Woods is long on atmosphere, so long that we tend to forget that it's not completely kitschy. Had dinner there tonight with a couple friends, and was reminded that this is a decent Italian eatery. \n\nWe had the appetizer platter to split among the four of us, and the chicken strips were very tasty, as was the calimari. The brushetta went untouched, though, because it was so thickly piled with...stuff...that it looked unappetizing. The artichoke dip was tasty: not so lost in gooey cheese as to be greasy. A definite winner.\n\nThe kitchen served me the best Chicken Marsala I've ever eaten. Just sweet enough, no heavy sauce, beautifully cooked chicken breast. The Chicken Florentine and Chicken Parmesan that others had were also good, but I think my Marsala won hands down.\n\nThe restaurant is quite cozy, and the temperature control could have used a wee bit more control: I alternated between a bit sweaty and shivers. But the staff was friendly and helpful, and our dining experience pleasant.
