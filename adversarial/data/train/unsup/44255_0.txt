Finally! A matcha soft serve in Vegas! We tried one mixed soft serve (vanilla & matcha swirl) and one Maiko special (matcha sponge cake, red beans, corn flakes, jelly topped with matcha soft serve and comes with 2 mochi balls and half a chestnut). \n\nTheir soft serve is goooood! It's creamy and has the right thickness. The matcha flavor really shines through. You can tell they use high quality matcha. For the price, I wish they'd give bigger portion of the soft serve. The mixed soft serve we ordered only filled half of the plastic cup it was in and the Maiko special only looked like it had a lot of soft serve because it was sitting right on top of the sponge cake. We ran out of soft serve to eat with the rest of the toppings and those toppings were not good to eat by themselves.\n\nI'm not a fan of the maiko special, as the sponge cake and jelly were flavorless. The cake was on the dry side too. I do like the corn flakes in it, as it gives that extra texture. Personally, I won't order the special anymore, but I'm definitely coming back for more soft serve goodness!
