This place is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Whenever visitors come, i tell them they should stop by this place. In fact, we went this past Saturday and had the stuffed dates, the Machengo mac and cheese, the ceviche, 2 orders of the sliders, the chicken skewers, and the mussels. There was a pitcher of Sangria as well as several other desserts. Oh and somehow we fit in banana-nutella sandwiches, chocolate bread pudding and lemon berry tarts. Everyone loved everything. This is no joke. I do not lie about food lol. For 6 adults, this was sooo filling and our bill was about $120.
