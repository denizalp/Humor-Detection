Fran's is a typical diner that's right by Yonge & College and close to College station. I went once for a buddy's birthday. \n\nThey have a bar which is nice with Mill St. PBR and I think Heineken on tap. Unexpected for a diner. \n\nThey have an all day breakfast and I had breakfast for lunch, I ordered the pancakes which were nice and tasted pretty good but the price was pretty steep. I paid $10 including tip for pancakes, seemed a bit expensive. \n\nI'm not a diner person and typically avoid them but for what it is Fran's isn't bad.
