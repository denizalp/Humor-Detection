Being from New York and just moving here to Pittsburgh I am not used to such small post offices.\nI walked in there was only one person on line and only one clerk.\nI waited about 5 minutes and then it was my turn.\nI dropped off a 4 packages that were prepaid.\nThe overall service was fine and the person behind the counter was fine.\nI would say seems like your average small town post office.
