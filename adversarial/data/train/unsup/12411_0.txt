It's OK. This is Thai food for White People. Is it good? Yea it's ok. It's about on par or maybe a little bit better than their sister property in downtown Chandler called Latitude.\n\nThe service is fairly sterile and there wasn't any foods on Happy Hour, just a few drinks. Horrible Mai Thais as they premake them all and they are sitting in a container not stirred. Quite bad.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice and they did have live music. Would we go back? Yea, probably for the beers and to sit outside on the patio on a nice day.\n\nOther downside, horribly uncomfortable seating outside.
