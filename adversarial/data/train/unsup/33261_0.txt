Each time my wife or I visit Mephisto in Rosedale we really enjoy the selection and  experience in general.\n\nWe've found the staff the be very helpful and accommodating. The shoes have, over time, greatly helped alleviate my wife's plantar fasciitis. They're also the only shoes I trust when I know I'm going to be walking a significant distance in the city.
