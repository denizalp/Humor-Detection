Technically 3.5 stars-we came here last saturday after my gf's wedding. The wait time wasn't bad around 4:30 but when it hit 5-6pm the line was super long ( appx 30-40 min wait). Everything was pretty good;the crab legs were a hit or miss as some were sweet and others salty.I really enjoyed the prime rib and garlic mussels\/clams. The desserts could've had more variety-no creme brûlée ...major fail.\n\nNext time I'm in town I'd like to try the wicked spoon..but overall for the price it's pretty good here if you can't decide what to eat since it's an international buffet.\n\nTotal per person: $34
