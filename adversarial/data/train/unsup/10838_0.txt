First of all, whenever you have a restaurant located within a casino, expect prices to be a bit higher, as Rod U. would put it, \"resort pricing\".\n\nI ordered the lamb burger and it was competently done, right temperature, fairly juicy, very good grill flavor.  Unfortunately, you would have to spend close to $20 and this doesn't include fries.  Order a milkshake, btw which was excellent, your bill swells up to close to $30.\n\nService is excellent and the place is well kept.  Also, this place takes your player's cards.\n\nUnless you are doing very well on the tables, the prices will give you some pause.  Not really a great value and there are better choices elsewhere, i.e. Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay.
