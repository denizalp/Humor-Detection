I called to make a same day appointment for me and my mom and although the owner was unable to accomodate us for that day she offered other suggestions that worked. \nWe were greeted by a friendly receptionist who's also a stylist. \nThe owner showed us around the space which is serene and inviting. \nMy mom and I thoroughly enjoyed the facial and massage. The ladies tag teamed which is apparently the way to go. I started with the massage while my mom got a facial. We left feeling light as a feather. The massage was top notch. We didn't feel rushed at all. \n\nI took mom to the airport and I went back to my room for a nap. Mom never sleeps on the plane, but her massage relaxed her so much that she did on that 3.5hr trek to FL.\n\nI will definitely frequent the Scottsdale location now that Phoenix is my home.
