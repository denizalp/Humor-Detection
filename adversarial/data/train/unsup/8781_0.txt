The Michelin two star restaurant, Guy Savoy, is located in the Augustus Tower of Caesars palace and features French masterpieces created by the famed chef. \n\nWe chose the Innovation Tasting menu with premium wine pairing. \n\nWe had an engaging view of the Vegas strip from our table. Once we were settled in, we were offered a selection of champagne to start the meal along with an amuse bouche of mini foie gras and black truffle bread.  \n\nA large bread cart appeared along side our table with a voluminous selection of fresh French bread along with a presentation of various butters, salts and peppers. I choose to go with the bacon bread. Always go with bacon bread #Steventology. \nBut I hold off on consuming my bread choosing only to butter it while it's hot because I'm not falling for the oldest trick in the book - filling up on bread! \n\nThen like waves relentlessly crashing against the shore unable to resist the moon's pull, the onslaught of awesomeness began. Course after course of the most delicious food I've had the pleasure to taste.  My photos don't do this meal justice. This was by far one of the best meals if not the best meal of my life. The combination of great food, great atmosphere, excellent service, engaging talented chef and good friends .. oh and a lots and lots of wine made this a night I will never forget. \n\nAmuse bouche - lobster candy, seaweed granitè\n\nLangoustine tartare, heirloom carrot petals, poach-fried quail egg\n\nDry ice was on the bottom of the dish to create the smoky effect in the presentation.\n\nSalmon Iceberg - the Chef prepares it tableside by hand searing it on dried ice and seasoning it with Himalayan pink salt. The dry ice doesn't really cook the salmon but rather changes the texture of it. Rich creamy texture that melts in your mouth.\n\nCaviar, Frozen Cauliflower Mousse\n\nSea bass, crispy scales, sauerkraut, and kusshi oyster\n\nBlack Truffle Duck Consommé prepared at the table for the Foie-Gras\n\nFoie-Gras, Celery Serpentine and Black Truffle Duck Black Consommé\n\nPan-seared quail, stuffed baby turnip, and smoked sabayon\n\nJapanese wagyu, sesame seed, and terragon crust, artichoke salad and barigoule, sponge cake\n\nArtichoke and black truffle soup, toasted mushroom brioche and black truffle butter.\nBelieve it or not ... this was the highlight of the meal. The artichoke soup with black truffles and shaved parmesan is his signature dish. The warm brioche layered with black truffle and topped with truffle butter that is meant to be dipped in the soup. The soup is made without cream or milk, simply thickened with truffle juice. The layers of earthy flavor cannot adequately be described with words.\n\n24 Months Aged Comté, Beets and Black Truffle Napoleon\n\nBrie white truffle. Delicious creamy brie combined with white truffle.\n\nFrozen Lava Cake\n\nDessert cart\n\nThe lesson of the night was You can never have too many truffles #Steventology\n\nChef Mathieu Chartron invited us back to the kitchen to tell us more about the preparation of the meal\n\nExecutive Chef Mathieu Chartron signed our menus for us.\nYou can check out more of his creations on his Instagram feed.\nhttp:\/\/instagram.com\/mchartron26\/
