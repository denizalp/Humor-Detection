Came in to get some gift cards for my two boys for Christmas. I'm trying to cultivate their love of reading. What better way to do that than to let them pick some 2nd & 3rd grade literature. Anyway, this B&N is in a very busy shopping center at Shea\/101 fwy. They have Fry's, Home Depot, Flower Child and a ton of other stuff in here. Getting in & Out is easy & there are alot of parking spots. The B&N is very large. We didnt really explore the store in its entirety but I'm sure its standard faire. We walked up the cash register area at the front of the store and decided on two gift cards, stepped up and were greeted warmly. We purchased the gc's and left. I would def go back. The store appeared clean & the employees we talked to were friendly.
