Hands down the worst Dining experience. As a party of 3, we were sat in the back with literally not another table filled. The entertainment was in the adjoining room and when we asked to be moved to experience the show (the reason why you come...) - our waitress then proceeded to not come back to our table -- finally having to ask for her manager... 45 minutes later he showed up.\n\nJASON Carr -- please get another job. Hands down the worst customer service. What a shame - for an expensive meal, I would rate this the worst dining experience I've ever had.\n\nThe only positive - was the water girl -- Jade. \n\nOh yes. Also there was a hair from the kitchen in our scallops and they refused to take it off our bill... \n\nInterestingly - my best friend is the head writer for Forbes career. Here's to an article about how NOT to run a restaurant.\n\nGo somewhere else.
