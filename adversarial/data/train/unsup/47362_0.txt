I will start by saying that not only are these guys scammers but are jerks too.\nI went to change my summer tires to the winter tires and the first thing out of the guys mouth was that the tires were no good and yet I had bought them last year and to boot the tires still had the strings on the side.  he proceeded to tell me that the tires were cracked and that I needed to get new tires and threw in that my family would not be safe and he was concerned for my safety!  I am a neat person and had my tires all in a row in the SUV trunk when I got the SUV back the real seats were down the baby seat was out and the tires were just thrown one on top of each other.  i am so pissed at the way I got treated and the fact that they have no respect for peoples things.  I felt so sorry for the girl who came in with the SUBARU! all they saw was $$$$$$ signs. All I have to say is don't go there I will never step foot into that place again!
