Dear Guy: your breakfast should be called BreakSlow.... Took 20 minutes to get our drinks after ordering and then another 15 for the food.   Considering how small the menu is (8 items) it certainly shouldn't take that long, especially when the place wasn't even full.  Watch Diners Driveins and Dives at home and order pizza.....
