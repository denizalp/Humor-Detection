I can't believe I'm giving Polish Deli two stars.  I used to love this place.  Alas, something has gone horribly wrong.  Rows and rows of empty shelves.  Diminished selection.  What happened??\n\nI used to stop by Polish Deli regularly.  Then, I got lazy, and ended up just going to Euro Delicacies because it was closer to my house.  In the interim, however, Euro Delicacies has surpassed them with selection of Polish goods.  Polish Deli still has the biggest selection of pierogi and Polish meats in town, but that's not saying much.\n \nYou can also pick up Polish teas, over-the-counter drugs, and Wedel chocolates, something I haven't seen elsewhere in town (which are in the refrigerators because it's like 90 degrees in the store).  I'll still stop by for my blueberry pierogi and kapusta czerwona (red cabbage salad) but, then again, maybe I won't.  Seriously depressing.
