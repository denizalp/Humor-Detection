It's a cute spot and they give you a little piece of waffle cone with all ice creams. But, the flavour options were a bit weird. I appreciate having options that are not boring old chocolate, vanilla, but out of the 10 or so, it took me 5 minutes to decide on one not because there were so many that I wanted but because I wasn't really into any of them. And I really like sugar and ice cream, so that's saying something. \nI went with the early grey which was nice, but not incredible. \nIt's a nice place and the people were nice and though I wasn't loving the flavour options, I liked that they have so many different kinds of options that you don't usually find so I'm definitely going to give it another shot.
