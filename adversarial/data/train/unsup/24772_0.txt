Hands down, Sage is probably my most favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. From the service to the food, you won't regret it. I have been here a couple times and I am amazed at what they can with just an egg. \n\nSaturday night we had the signature tasting menu with wine pairing and was excellent. We had plans to go out after so we asked to share our waiter was nice enough to allow to do so.\n\nAmuse Bouche - Sunchoke soup with tarragon -- great start, chilled and light.\n\nFirst course - WAGYU BEEF TARTARE -- Crushed Caper AÃ¯oli\/Slow Poached Egg\/Crispy Chocolate. My favorite dish of all the courses. So light and went down way to easy. (paired with a vouvray.) perfect match. \n\nSecond course - MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS -- Braised Oxtail\/Wild Mushrooms\/Salted Caramel Reduction. I never knew that Dayboat scallops have a more sea flavor. I loved it. The dish was very asian influenced almost teriyaki flavor.  \n\nThird course - IBERICO PORK LOIN -- Brussels Sprouts\/Crispy Confit Shoulder\/Smoked Dates. Almost bbq flavored, you could taste the smoke. \n\nFinal course - WARM CARROT CAKE --Roasted Coconut Sauce\/Candied Ginger\/Cream Cheese Ice Cream. I normally am not a carrot cake lover but this one will change your mind. Light, moist and rich. \n\nThe best part of this restaurant; the Absinthe cart. Who wouldn't love an entire cart of Absinthe?!!  ha ha! Our server suggested the Germain-Robin, USA. This is the lightest out of all the ones listed. Great for beginners, such as myself.\n\nIt food is unforgettable and so the absinthe. ;)  I can't wait to go back.
