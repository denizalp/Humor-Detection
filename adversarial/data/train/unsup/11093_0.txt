Where to begin....another day in Toronto, another food experience, sat outside on a brisk afternoon and looked at the menu. Our waiter, tall guy, nice with a strange affect, kinda like is he high or hungover, his speech and lack of speed....yea. so we started with the lobster bisque which was presented with the croissant like bread baked over ontop of it ( cute) bisque was hot and thick. We ordered two entrees, the shrimp pasta dish and asked for scallops on the side, we were craving seafood. It took 45 minutes to get a dish that takes 12 minutes to cook. We looked for our waiter who was now overwhelmed. We were the first table in the restaurant. We watched as orders hot the table out of sequence and to wrong tables. My gf and I agreed that if the plates didn't come out in 2 minutes we were done. Lucky for Fred and company our meals finally came out. It was good, but not worth waiting for. I would never come back here based on service. it was a weekday and we were the first table. The free glass of wine didn't help....well maybe a little. We still tipped our waiter.
