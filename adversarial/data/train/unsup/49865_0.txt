My husband and I visited Cantina 1511 last weekend. When we walked in the door we were immediately pleased with the decor, its fun and bright and the restaurant feels spacious. I ordered off of the brunch menu, Eggs Benedict served in avocado slices, it was fantastic! My husband ordered the Mexican street food sampler and he loved it. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and we will definitely be back!
