We had been looking for a new Tundra Crewmax for several weeks, and had almost closed on a few.  Went to Right Toyota and worked with KYLE DAVIS.  Kyle was very helpful, and went into detailed explanation on all of our questions.  He was a very down to Earth guy that worked with us from 7pm to after 11.  Seriously, after 11pm.  Yes, I am a hard customer to please, but he and his team got us the truck we wanted in the price range we could afford.  I cant say enough good things about Kyle, this guy was awesome.
