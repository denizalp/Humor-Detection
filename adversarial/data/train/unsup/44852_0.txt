As a party of 3 we tried Smokin Fin for the first time. The fish & chips are delicious and the fries nicely crisp. The bison Cobb burger is beyond tasty with bacon and Gorgonzola cheese.   Service is friendly and efficient. They even have 2 patios if you enjoy dining al fresco . Plan to try the sashimi on my next visit
