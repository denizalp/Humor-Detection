I did Station M with three friends and 7 strangers. The room is beautifully designed, and the actor did a fantastic job. The story line was great, and everything worked exactly as it was supposed to work. However, I would still not recommend this room to anyone who has more than a couple of escape rooms under their belt. \n\nAlthough twelve people are allowed in at a time, based on the number of puzzles in the room, this number should be decreased to no more than eight. In fact, I would say that six people would be the ideal number. For significant portions of the game, there were no available puzzles for people to work on. And standing around when you are paying $36+ \/ hour does not feel good.  Moreover, even though the puzzles are very polished, they were not particularly challenging.\n\nI expected much more from Company & Co. I have done their other escape rooms around Toronto, and always been impressed by how they managed to keep a large group busy. Here, I felt disengaged and frustrated.\n\nOne easy fix for this room, which I hope is implemented, would be providing enough paper for every participant at all stages of the game.
