Everyone has their own experiences with every visit, but we had a great experience staying at Caesars for the first time. With the Total Rewards card and some online promotion, I got a great deal for about $60 per night. But with the help of a single Andrew Jackson bill (the 'ol sandwich trick), a suite with a view of the Strip and Bellagio fountains in the Augustus Tower was bestowed upon us. Fabulous.\n\nI found everyone to be super friendly, even the dealers and cocktail waitresses. Of course, it helped to be in a good mood since things were good at the blackjack tables. As a kid, Caesars was always one of those hotels that was the creme de la creme. There was no Wynn or Venetian back then. I was used to staying at Circus Circus for most of the time. \n\nBut now, there are some great deals. Also check out their Twitter page, which you can find promotions. Sure, you'll find your stereotypical, loud-mouthed douchebag or 10-inch heeled hoochie tramp, but hey it's Vegas. Would you rather see mostly Ben-Gay smelling retirees? I think not.
