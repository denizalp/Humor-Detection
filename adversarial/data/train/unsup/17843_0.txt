stayed here for 2 nights in a standard room. no flat screen tv, the shower head was low (im 6'4 so i had to slouch down pretty far) the water came out like a fire hydrant, and something was wrong with our bathroom because it smelled like sewage... from the moment we walked in there to the moment we left... only good thing about this place was that i was comped 2 nights and its located pretty much in the middle of the strip... If i get comped again then maybe i might come back, back until then i'm going there only for Tabu nightclub and Fat tuesdays. thats it. you would have a much better experience if you stayed at the MGM Grand Signature.
