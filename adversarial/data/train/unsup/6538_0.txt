How the hizzle is this show getting negative reviews?!? It was truly AMAZING!! My wife and I saw KA the night before and we thoroughly enjoyed it. BUT Zarkana was at least 4 1\/2 times better, AT LEAST! So much more entertaining and stimulating! I think I had a smile of appreciation on my face 90% of the show. \n\nThe acrobatics were so much better than expected, the best I've EVER seen! Better than Mystere in my opinion. I really enjoyed the music and was even more impressed that the music was preformed live. The band was TRULY awesome and I wish they were in better view of the audience. \n\nI will definitely be going again and hope to convert some the haters to a more accurate opinion, because truthfully, this show kicked arse!! I don't understand how somebody could say it was BORING!?!? \n\nIf you are a decent human who appreciates good live music, mind-blowing acrobatics, and extremely talented individuals who know how to put on a good show, you WILL NOT be disappointed! \n\nWARNING:\nIF YOU ARE A WHINNY PRICK WHO HATES PUPPIES, then you may have a negative opinion of this show so just stay home and watch Wheel of Fortune with your crotchety old grandma.
