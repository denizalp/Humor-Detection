When I first heard the idea my bf wanted us to go Vegas, I immediately thought we were probably gonna be staying in Hawai'i's other downtown...Downtown Las Vegas. I would have totally been fine with that. I've never been to Vegas before, so what did I have to lose, right (well except for my life savings at the penny slots)?! \n\nWell to my gosh darn surprise, he tells me nonchalantly, \"yay, Russ booked us at Bellagio.\" \n\nWell hot damn. That sounds mighty nice. And indeed it was very nice. When we arrived in Vegas at 6 am Saturday morning, our room was already prechecked in the day before so we could take a much needed nap and shower as soon as we passed the massive casino floor. \n\nWe stayed in the main tower, deluxe suite. It had such nice appointments thought out that I honestly did not want to leave. But since it was around 45Â° outside, I wanted to soak up some winter chill while I was here. Khai and I really liked the jacuzzi bath tub and all the bath products associated with it. They really left nothing to chance. There was even a razor and shave gel for me in there. \n\nI think the best feature of the whole room, besides the automatic curtains, was the bed. definitely one of the best I've slept on. I should've checked what brand it was since I may be in the market for a new bed myself. \n\nAlthough we didn't have a view of the fountains, we had a nice view of Caesars from one side of our room and the Palms out the other. Those fountains are loud anyways and I probably would've been up all night watching them in awe. \n\nI enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it to anyone who is probably going to spend more time in the room than in the casino, which was particularly ashey. I Think I lost and gained about $100 playing the slots here. It was fun, but I'm definitely not a gambler. Especially being unemployed and all!
