We took our crew of 11 here (6 kids, 5 adults). We were worried since there were only 2 tables inside and 1 outside. The owner was so accommodating to us. The food was delicious. We got garlic knots and cheese fries as appetizers. They were both delicious, but the knots were my favorite. We also ordered 3 types of pizza, a calzone and 2 types of pasta. Everything was delicious and the service was above and beyond for any food establishment.
