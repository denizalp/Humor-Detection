These guys are the best. I've experienced several tattoo shops, but nothing compares to Black Lotus. From the email correspondence, to the front desk, to my tattoo artist - every point of contact was great.\n\nTyler Nealeigh was my tattoo artist and he was phenomenal. I brought them the artwork for the next day's appointment, and by the time I arrived he'd already significantly enhanced my design. My design was good - his was phenomenal. I never even asked for an art enhancement - he just proactively did it.\n\nThe experience at the shop was great - Tyler did an amazing job on two Roman numeral tattoos on my forearms, and I couldn't be happier.\n\nI'll undoubtedly get more tattoos. But there's not a chance in hell that I won't go to Black Lotus.\n\nIf I could rate them more than 5 stars, I would. Keep it up guys!
