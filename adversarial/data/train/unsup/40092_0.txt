We were seated right away and our server was attentive and friendly. I was going to order the Ginger lime iced tea but I forgot. But I did remember to order the Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce. :) It was good, but I wouldn't say delicious. The chips were freshly made, but a little to hard for my taste and the sauce was creamy but didn't have enough of a blue cheese kick. I also wish the sauce wasn't drizzled on but as a dip because if you didn't eat it fast enough it becomes sloggy chips.  Our friends had the cheese pizza which they said was delicious. We had also ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi, Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese. It was good especially the sausage bolognese, I just wished there was more of it on the plate. The gnocchi was good but after having a couple it became too heavy for me. Then we also had the Grilled Prime Burger, Vermont Cheddar, Smoked Onion Marmalade, which was a good hamburger, but nothing special. The decor of this place is pretty cool and you do feel like you are in the middle of the gambling action even though you are eating. \nI would love to go back and try their desserts and some other dishes.
