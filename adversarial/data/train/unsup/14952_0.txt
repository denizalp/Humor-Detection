Very bad experience.  September 2017.  I would not recommend this company.   Jay (one of the movers who came to my house)  kept going into rooms in my house that I specifically told him had nothing in there for him to move and that I didn't have anything valuable for him to steal.  When my stuff didn't fit into the POD Jay lost his temper with me and refused to move anything else or repack my POD without charging me $195 an hour.  The price they quote online and over the phone is not what the driver (Jay) wanted to charge, (scam). The  woman who quoted my move over the phone said I had 3-4 hours with the price she quoted and the driver (Jay) said I had 2.5 hours and then it's $195 an hour after that.   I used this service because of the good reviews but I have no idea how they got these reviews. I will be contacting PODS regarding my experience since they recommended this company. The one star is because they did do a good job securely packing my stuff into the POD.  \n\nUpdate:  The owner of this company (Brad) called me repeatedly to give me a full refund if I would take this review down which I said no.  In speaking with the owner (Brad) it is very clear that he is more concerned with saving money on the help he hires than the customer's safety.  I want to help protect the next person who is home alone when these people show up and feel absolutely helpless to protect their things from being stolen and have to worry about their well being.
