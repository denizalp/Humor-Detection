SO FREAKING ANGRY!!!!!\n\nIt's subway! We all know what subway tastes like. The one star isn't for the food. This location is actually really clean and open late. It's for the two ladies that made our sandwiches.\n\nOne lady was making my BLT while the other lady was making my BF's sandwich. They kept talking to each other the whole time while making our food so they weren't paying attention. I had to wait until they were done talking to say what else I wanted on my sandwich. And when I said a little bit of mayo, she wasn't paying attention and ended up putting a thousand calories worth of it. The other lady making my BF's sandwich was just as bad. My BF had to say tomatoes and onions 3 times because they kept chatting!!! PAY ATTENTION HOLY FUUUUKKKKK!!! And to make it worse, they were talking about us in Spanish while we were paying. I freaking understand you!!!!!!!! \n\nOmg I'm livid!!!!!!!!!! Never again at this location!!!
