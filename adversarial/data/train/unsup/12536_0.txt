I got so excited I forgot to take a picture of the rare sliced beef pho I ordered :\/\n\nBut I will share a picture of my app which was just as scrump-dee-lee-oh-so.\n\nAll of the folks I interacted with were at least bilingual.....a few with thicker accents than others. But, who cares about that?\n\nI came for the pho-n of it!!! ;) ;) see what I did there? :p \\(^_^.)\/
