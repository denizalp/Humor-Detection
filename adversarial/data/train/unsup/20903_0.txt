My mother-in-law told me these cupcakes were to die for. I smarted off, \"I don't really feel like dying today.\"\n\nFrom Red Robin we walked quickly across the parking lot in the June desert heat to The Cupcakery. \n\nA cake in the shape of the cutest sandcastle caught my attention immediately. Then rows of colorful cupcakes started yelling, \"Pick me, pick me.\" So, I bought 4 different ones. \n\nCUPCAKES - $3.50 each\n- carrot - we ate this one inside the store. It was so soft. Delectable.\n- hummingbird - this is the one that we had to keep cold. There's so much fruit jam-packed in this little baby. Mmmm, mmm good.\n- Lemon Berry - hands down my favorite of the 4 I tried. The guy that helped us declared that this flavor is very popular with kids. I'm such a kid for... \"zesty lemon cake topped with a fruity blueberry frosting\"\n- strawberry - this one was of course mainly for our kids, but they let me try it. It was certainly a hit for them. I didn't mind it, but it wasn't close to being my favorite.\n\nThey also make the aforementioned custom cakes and cake pops (saw some super cute \"BB-8\" ones on their social media). Plus, they sell candles and other last minute items.\n\nTIPS\n- they didn't offer it when I was there, but I noticed that there is a Yelp checkin offer - \"20% off in store assorted cupcake orders\"\n- there's another location on Mead Blvd.\n\n2018 Challenge #109
