I want to put Tim Hortons' Double Double in my mouth!  \n\n(Pause for everyone to digest the homo-sexual innuendo)\n\nOkay, you immature bastards, are you done?  \n\nAnyway, for us Californians, the double double is a hamburger, from In N Out, that has 2 beef patties.  However, in Canada, the double double refers to coffee from Tim Hortons with 2 creams and 2 sugars.  I know what you're thinking, \"big deal, I can get that at McDonalds!\"  But, you're wrong.  I can't exactly put my thumb on it, but it just doesn't taste the same.  After having this coffee, I visited all the conspiracy websites in regards to concoction and the theories range from putting nicotine in it, having very little caffeine in there so that you want more, using special cream (don't let that mind wander again), or putting roasted mustard seeds in the grind.  \n\nUnfortunately, Tim Hortons is only in Canada and a few cities on the Eastern part of the US.  So, either I develop an affinity for snow and move to New York, or forget what I learned from South Park The Movie and not blame Canada anymore.
