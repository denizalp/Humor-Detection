DO NOT GO HERE! Very rude and unprofessional. I have a Suzuki that has a different layout as far as the converter is concerned. I told this to a worker or owner there. A certified Suzuki mechanic told me at the dealership: I have 2 converters on my car and they're in the front. The owner or worker told me, \"I don't care what the mechanics at the dealership told you, I'm looking right at a converter in the back!\" \n\nYou would think they'd treat customers with more respect than that. I told him that he was very rude and I'm taking my business elsewhere. If you want to be treated with respect, then I'd advise you stay away from this place. I'm telling everyone I know to not take their vehicles there ever. It's a shame.
