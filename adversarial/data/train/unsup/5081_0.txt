First things first, I'm obsessed with eyebrows! Then again, which South Asian girl isn't!?! Heck, nowadays, guys are in competition for nice eyebrows with us females. Ok, maybe not. But still...\n\nAnytime I move to a new city, I have to find a reliable eyebrow person. Having said that, I was in the area, and saw some girls around my age, and decided to scope out their browline...creepy, I know! Being the social butterfly I am, we started chit chatting and she pointed me to Anjuman's. I decided to go treat myself to some eyebrow threading & waxing galore. As painful as it can be, it's quite a liberating experience!\n\nThe ladies that work there are quite social, but the owner always seems to be quite stressed\/a little uptight. Even still, if I were you, I'd wait for her to do your brows. I didn't even have to tell her what I wanted. She has an eye for these things. Overall, great experience, have been there twice so far, and will definitely go back. (I grabbed a flier on my way out, so I'll post up the price list for y'all soon.)\n\nP.S. They charge a fee for using Credit Cards, so you might as well bring cash. ;)
