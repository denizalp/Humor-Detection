This place is a joke. Another overpriced fake establishment going for trendiness over quality. My muffin had no flavor other than the undercooked bits of apple that still had the peel on. The coffee was ruined by the non-dairy creamer that was NOT labeled as non-dairy. For a place to have only two pitchers, one of which is 2% milk and the other non-dairy creamer not labeled as such, is unforgiveable. I ordered regular coffee; I knew upon seeing their super-auto poseur espresso machine to avoid any espresso drinks. I also haven't tried their cooked food, but judging by the prices, I don't think I will.  $8 or more for a sandwich is more expensive than Romancing the Bean and most items at Essence Bakery, and it's unlikely to be as good as either. If you want a muffin, walk across the street to Romancing the Bean (located at the base of the KPMG building), if you want good coffee or a croissant, get one of the best ones in the state at Essence (Hardy & University), and if you want an awesome breakfast or lunch, try either. For espresso you'll have to go Cartel Coffee. It's the only good place within a mile of Mill Ave. Whatever you do, don't waste your time or money on NCounter.
