Love the place and love the food.\nTHEY HAVE TO FIX THE NO RESERVATION POLICY !\nMy time is valuable, I should be able to book a time and spend my money $$ on what is very expensive food (which I don't mind). But I don't think any restaurant should be so high on them selfs that they can make people willing to spend a lot of money $ and make anyone wait 1 to 2 hours to get a table. There are restaurants better than this and I can walk in with my reservation and spend a lot of money. I may not be back until they change the policy.\nAlso, I am a business man. If things are so good why wouldn't you open for lunch ? I guess the owners don't need the business, they must be almost retired or this is just a hobby. Just saying.
