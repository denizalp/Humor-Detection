Not reviewing the food as I've never had it but how they conduct business. I don't know if it's their direct employees or people they just pay on the side but It doesn't matter either way they should not be coming onto private property\/no soliciting (with signs!) gated communities at 10 o'clock at night coming up to residents doors and putting their menus on them. They act like they have no idea what we were talking about upon calling. Obviously it's either their employees or people they are paying to put out their menus. How would they feel if I came up to their door at that time of night sticking things on their doors?
