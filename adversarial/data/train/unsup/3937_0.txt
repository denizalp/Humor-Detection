This club is pretty wicked in the sense where there's spectacular lighting, amazing dj's, acrobatics coming from the ceiling and so many rooms and places to explore. However do not get a table! It's a waste. A group of us went Vip so we could walk right in and not wait in line. Our bill for 6 was 4k which is fine except I left completely sober. It was so weird. We weren't allowed to touch the table. I moved the tray of strawberries closer to my gf so she could have one and the server came out of no where and moved them back and snapped at me that everything had to stay where it was. My other gf was noticing and moved a napkin to the side jokingly and the server went and got the bouncer and he flipped out on her. That totally killed the mood and we had a hard time sticking around for much longer. With so many killer clubs in Vegas I say avoid this one.
