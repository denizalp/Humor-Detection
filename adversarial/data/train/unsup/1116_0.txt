\"YEAH, Gold Spike!\" has become the battle cry of my friends and I, ever since our trip to Vegas about 2 months ago.  \n\nThe Gold Spike is off of, off of Fremont Street.   Our room was teeny, but it was cheap and clean.  The room decor was almost IKEA-esque, so I was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant is actually pretty good, especially their breakfasts - solid diner-type food.  The servers in the restaurant are hysterical and helpful.  The bartenders are fantastic, especially Chris. \n\nThe patrons...oh, my the patrons! \n\nI walked in the door after an 8 hour drive, took a look around and thought, \"Oh, WOW.  This is where the new locals come to drink, and the old gamblers come to die...THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME!!!\"\n\nSo the elevator is a bit rickety, and during our first night we noticed...um...feces in the ground-floor hallway.  My friend had her phone stolen off of the bar our second night there (A witness pointed it out, and though the phone was never recovered, the security staff was very helpful and did all they could).\n\nDO NOT LET THESE SMALL NEGATIVES DETER YOU!  DO NOT DISCOUNT THE GOLD SPIKE!!!\n\nI won $110 playing $20 on a video poker machine at the bar.  I'm not much of a gambler, but that's the most money I've won EVER while gambling! Victory!\n\nI'd never been to Vegas before, so I trusted my 3 gal-pals to give me an adventure.  Wow, they did not disappoint!  \n\nOh, Gold Spike, I miss you so.  Although, I hear this girlie road trip may become a yearly tradition, so...I'll see ya next year!
