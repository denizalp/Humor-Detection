Most dive bars have a stench of stale smoke, barely-passable food, and sucky service. Based on my visits, Blue Ox must not be a dive bar because none of those things can be found here! Space is a bit dated but clean, and staff is downright peppy. Food is low-priced and fresh. \n\nCOBB SALAD: Generous portions of all ingredients, wish the dressing were served in a cup and made in-house rather than takeout packets.* But having the calorie count handy does make me use less.\nALL BEEF JALAPENO CHILI: Ask to add sour cream, onions, and cheese to make this meaty dish into a meal. Good flavor without being spicy. This would be even better if they had some sort of cornbread.\nFISH & CHIPS: Two smallish pieces of fresh-fried fish, crispy and flavorful. Fries are crinkle-cut but also surprisingly good. House-made tartar sauce is just right, malt vinegar available too (in a packet again).\n\nThey have a few specials, like walleye on Fridays and ribs on Saturdays. Ask about their Mules Around the World drinks. Back of dining area has a separate meeting space available to reserve. Staff is always cheerful, music is a good mix of 90s alternative and radio hits.\n\n*I stand corrected, the ranch dressing here is made in-house. All other options are currently served in packets.
