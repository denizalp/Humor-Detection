8pm dinner on Friday night, there were five people dining in the entire restaurant including us! And after our meal, we understand why. Service was great, but the food was just the worst I ever had! The sushi restaurant down the street from my home makes better food than this place! We didn't fly all the way to get this crappy food! They have more servers than customers. I hope the owner reads this and do something about it, or you'll be out of business VERY SOON!
