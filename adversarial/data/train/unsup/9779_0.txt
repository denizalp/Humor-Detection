I've never been to Montauk but if this is what it's like, I'm all in! Came here for a quick work lunch and fell in love with their lobster roll! It's priced at $18 so I'm glad that there was a nice kale side salad that came with it. Sometimes lobster rolls can be overloaded with weird mayonnaise sauces or butter, but this one was perfect! The roll was soft yet slightly crisp on the inside from being heated on the stove top and the lobster had the perfect flavor and texture. I was really happy with my choice and honestly could eat this every single day! The restaurant was not busy during lunch and service was on point. Our waiter was really great at checking up on us throughout our meal and even when there was a mix-up with one of our orders, he handled it like a champ! Looking forward to coming back here on my next visit to Scottsdale.\n\nPhoto of my beautiful lobster roll: (https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-montauk-scottsdale-3?select=u1TEv2cJaBZov8-JmKOHmA&userid=fgwI3rYHOv1ipfVfCSx7pg)
