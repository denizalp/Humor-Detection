I absolutely love this gym, the coaches and the people who workout here. This was my first Crossfit experience coming from a background of traditional gyms. There are so many different class times to choose from throughout the day. There are classes as early as 6:30am up to 7pm, active recovery on Thursdays have incorporated a favorite of mine...YOGA, plus open gym all day. Saturdays are so much fun because there are usually team workouts. The coaches focus on form to ensure that no one injures themselves. The membership fee is inexpensive in comparison with other Crossfit gyms and is well worth the price. Another of my favorites is the holiday workouts, people usually dress up and the workouts are sometimes done in larger teams. All in all, you should definitely drop in and do a workout. You'll never want to go to another gym again!!
