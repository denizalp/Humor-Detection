My first cupping session with Paul was by far, the most effective I've ever had. I'm already feeling more mobility in my shoulder and neck. My back muscles feel somehow lighter and more fluid. I am returning next week for a follow up appointment complete with acupuncture. I cannot wait! I'll report back on that.
