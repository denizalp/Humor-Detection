This will not be a happy ending for me. My husband had to send his steak back. I had to send my pork dish back it was very under cooked. I Did provide pictures of all the dishes We had. I'm doing this review as We wait on our cheese cake. Ugh the soup and chopped salad was great even the bread was good. But the last dish they are just falling on they face.\n I came to eat! So the manger telling me my food is done but I don't want to eat it is such a dumb statement. She made me so angry I didn't even respond to that remark. I guess she thinks I'm at the mall yeah that's it...I came to buy shoes because noone in they right mind would come to a steakhouse and wonna eat. \nIt's like little mama look here as hungry as I am you not going to get my plate back because I'm as hungry as a hostage. You have the dish back ONLY because I don't wish to die eating from eating under cooked pork.\n Oh as always I provided pictures u can see I spit out bits of under cooked meat...  No I don't think I will return. She was more into telling me how the dish is cooked how its so called slow cooked. Look I'm gonna tell it how it is...Its not my job to care how it cooked its my job to order, eat,  pay, and yelp...she made me so mad I took the picture just to show you all I spit the food out. This is the only picture Ive taken of its kind. To prove a point. Even a 3 year old knows that if someone spits out food its NOT good. Pffff! But they get 3 stars for the soup salad and bread.
