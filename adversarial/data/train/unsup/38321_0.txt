These guys are brutal. I brought my car in for an oil change and they told me my brakes needed to be replaced. They told me the pads were so thin that I had to do it right away. I decided not to do it because it seemed fishy and after taking my car to a mechanic he showed me that the brake pads were still at 50% life. \n\nI will never under any circumstances bring my car back here.
