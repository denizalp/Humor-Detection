Beautiful restaurant with a pretty interesting story behind its creation. Thank you Mayor Oscar Goodman. \n\nWe arrived early so got to enjoy a drink at the bar first. Soo. After we were sat a beautiful round table right in the center of the restaurant. The view was gorgeous with an open roof and windows all around the site of downtown Fremont was a nice way to enjoy the evening. \n\nCrab cake and meatball appetizers were tasty and a generous portion enough to share amongst the 10 of us. Shrimp served with the shrimp cocktail are huge!\nI had the sea bass and was shockingly surprised by the size of the fish. Definitely do recomend the seabass if you prefer seafood for dinner. Again, generous portion. Unfortunately the bone in filet was a disappointment, very dry and little flavor. Desserts were a nice way to end the evening. The cheesecake was soft and moist and the creme brulee was delicious. The tiramisu on the other hand was good but the presentation horrible. It looked like slop was just plopped down on the plate. \n\nService was par. Our server didn't smile once, we looked for her a few times to order another drink and our main entrees arrived about 25 minutes after our appetizers had been cleared from the table. \n\nNot crossing this place off as a possible return however...
