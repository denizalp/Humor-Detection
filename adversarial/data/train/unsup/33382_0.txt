I really enjoyed getting married here! When I first pulled up I was NOT impressed. It looks small from the outside, and you have to park in the back empty lot. But once you get inside, you see that they make good use of the space and that they are GOOD at what they do. Tony the minister, and the photographer have it down to a science. They make eye contact with you to show that they are listening, and the ladies at the front desk answer your questions and calm down your jitters. We got married inside and it was beautiful!!\nWe really liked our pictures. I do think that they are a little pricey, and a little posed- but you are emotional and the scenery is pretty. Their packages are reasonably priced for the whole wedding- but the pictures are extra. Real extra! AND you tip the photographer too. \nFor a small, intimate wedding I would definitely recommend this place. Thanks!!
