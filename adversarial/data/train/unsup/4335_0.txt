Road tripping through Vegas when I woke up in the morning due to the extreme pain in the right side of my mouth. Spoke to the concierge at the resort who gave me a reference to this dentist.\nI called just after opening figuring they wouldn't get me in for at least 24 hours.  Didn't happen, they said come over immediately. I got there 20 minutes later and was in a chair 30 minutes later with the skilled fingers of Dr. Joe Zamaora in my mouth. I was x-rayed then the Dr. came back in to explain the results. I needed a root canal immediately. After discussing options, I opted to do it right there and right then. \nI can't call a root canal fun, but this Dr. explained everything, he was the most painless dentist I ever visited and he was quick.\nI don't think I have ever been more satisfied with any Dr\/Dentist visit in my life. \nI don't live in Vegas, regardless, I cannot recommend this guy, this place enough.  Fantastic everything from pain free to reception.  Man, these guys saved my road trip and my mouth.  Thanks doc.
