We come here regularly when visiting our daughter in this part of town.  The food is great and the service is excellent!  The folks here are always friendly and make us feel welcome. The prices are reasonable and my wife loves looking at all the items for sale while we are waiting for our table. Overall, an excellent little cafe.
