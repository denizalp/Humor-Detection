I got an appointment within one day of calling and requesting one. This is definitely a nice change from the other groomers that book you a week or two out. I even called a little later asking to add a nail trim for another one of my dogs and she said it was no problem. Two groomers came to the house and one of them was in training so the owner herself came out to help with my dog Chewy (a Skye terrier mix). The new hire had never groomed a dog like him, but Alicia came and talked her through it. \n\nI've been to SEVERAL groomers around town as well as had other mobile groomers come, and this is the ONLY TIME anyone has ever cut him the way I described. He looks SO CUTE!! Even my fiance said that this was the best haircut he has ever had. He's had Chewy for 4 years and has never gotten his hair cut the way he has been trying to explain. Last time I took Chewy to a groomer (Groomingdales and Clip N Tails), they expressed his anal gland wrong and his tail was droopy for a week and a half, they also forgot to cut his toenails and I had to take him back. It also cost me over $100 in vet bills to fix his tail. This time, with Alicia' s crew, I had none of that hassle.\n\nThey trimmed my other dog's nails (a boxer puppy mix who HATES getting his nails cut) - and let me tell you, he is DIFFICULT! Even my vet won't do his nails unless I drug him. They brought Dexter back into the house and he was happy as a clam. Last time I took him to the vet he was so nervous when they gave him back, I have just been filing his nails since. I asked the girls if he gave them trouble and they said he was really good. I was floored! He won't even let me do it! \n\nI will never use anyone else,  this was the best experience I've had with a groomer ever.
