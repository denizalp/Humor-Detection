I found nothing particularly special about Pi-Tom, the name itself is quite unique and I had purchased a deal so the \"deal\" is valid for everything on the menu except for the lunch specials.\n\nThe restaurant was easily located just in the corner, the server was friendly and we were immediately seated. We ordered the Appetizer Platter, Pad See Iew, Pad Kee Mao and 2 smoothies (Mango\/Strawberry). We expected the food would take a fair amount of time due to what we ordered. We waited and we got our appetizer platter, the spring rolls were greasy and the rest of the food was nothing special. After awhile longer we received our smoothies, both tasted the same even though they were difficult flavours. \n\nWhen we received our food it was average, nothing \"amazing\" about the experience and the food tasted like \"Chinese food\" nothing like Thai food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, it's just terrible.
