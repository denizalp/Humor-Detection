After picking up my car from the body shop, I decided to get myself a lil treat. Urban Cookies came to mind since it has been one of my bookmarks for a few months now. Since this was my 1st visit here I tried a lil bit of everything; cookies- simple (chocolate chip), snickerdoodle & the April special peanut butter, a bag of 6 perfectly sized brownies & a brown velvet cupcake. I sampled the simple & snickerdoodle & both were delish, I had the entire pb cookie & it was so yummy. I also had a brownie & it was super soft but almost too rich. The winner of the bunch was definitely the brown velvet, OMG was that cupcake amazing! I am not a big frosting fan, but I could have ate this cream cheese frosting by the spoonful. Total for 3 cookies, bag of brownies & 1 cupcake was about $19. Next time I am getting a dozen brown velvet cupcakes, that I may or may not be sharing...
