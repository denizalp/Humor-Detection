We received a recommendation to go to Blue Martini.. The bouncer at the door was nice, the cover charge was $5 for women and $10 for men. Not bad when its accompanied by a live band.....\n\nThe band was fantastic!!!!! Every song was well planned out and executed... \n\nThe drinks were a little pricey but for a Saturday, it's to be expected.  Two Martini's were $24..... But they were good! \n\nIf your looking for a sexy young thing. This isn't the place for you. It's definitely for the mature crowd...\n\nI would surely shake my booty to the entrance of Blue Martini again!
