Really nice mall that isn't huge. Lots of high end stores. It also has stores like Old Navy & the Disney Store too. It has popular stores like Apple & Lush.\n\nFood court is good, very clean...and Cheesecake Factory and Maggianos are at the mall too. \n\nGet there early on weekends or it'll feel uncomfortable walking around or go during the week.
