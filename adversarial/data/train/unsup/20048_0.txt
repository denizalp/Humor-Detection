I don't even know what to say.  Between our crowd of four we managed to check off the following from the menu:\n\nCauliflower: Not your grandmother's cauliflower.  I mean SERIOUSLY. This dish was so delectable, I'd consider an all-cauliflower diet forever, if this version was on standby.\n\nMac N Cheese: A lovely little cast iron pot of tender mac n cheese. Who doesn't love THAT?! Could've used a little kick of some kind, but I enjoyed it just the same.\n\nPig Candy:  I couldn't remember this dish too well given that I was caught up in my Santa Cider from Arsenal at the time, but as Jonathan D. reminded me, it was \"Big ******* piece of pork belly.\"  A little crispy around the edges and all-around delicious.\n\nCountry Ham:  This isn't Honeybaked. This is fresh from the Charcuterie kinda stuff.  A little salty; but that's the ham's fault.  Still, a worthwhile dish I might consider again.\n\nDirty Pasta:  Pasta.  Meat.  Sauce.  Sausage?  Don't know, don't care. Delicious.  And I don't even like pasta. Yeah, that's right. \n\nMussels:  I ordered the Mussels & Brussels; two separate dishes, one hilarious joke.  The Mussels were reminiscent of the mussels at Meat & Potatoes - not surprising given their owners.  Just like M & P, these mussels did not disappoint.  Bathed in a creamy curry, they are \"slimy yet satisfying\" (quick, name that Disney movie). \n\nBrussel Sprouts:  I'm one of those people that eats strange things in the car.  Some people eat McDonald's, I eat olives or entire cans of Reddi Whip.  If I could somehow manage it, these grilled brussel sprouts would be top of that list.  These bad boys of baby cabbages are so wonderful, even the most passionate brussels naysayers will fall in love with them.\n\nRice Cake:  The best.thing.EVER.  I don't know WHAT this is or HOW it's made, but I would eat these amaze-balls balls any day of the week.  They defy description, so I kindly ask you to take my word for it.\n\nThe moral of this visit was, I don't know how these dishes are prepared, nor do I know the majority of what they contain.  Regardless, each of them was a culinary masterpiece fit for any Pittsburgh palate, if you dare.
