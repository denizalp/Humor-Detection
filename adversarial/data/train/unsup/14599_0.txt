I can't believe this GEM of a sausage maker has yet to be reviewed. I thought this town was filled with foodies who search out the refined, obscure nuances of gastrointestinal culture. I guess they're mostly 'fakirs', hyuk! \nI am not Polish so I cannot spell or pronounce things, but I think the owner\/maker is called Miertek. Anyway you slice it, this is the guy to come to if you want locally produce cured\/smoked meats and sausages. His fatty hungarian is the winter bomb, and the roasted bacon (that's right, ROASTED BACON) is a gift from the gods of meat preparation. I suggest that you peruse and randomly choose what looks appealing your first time. There is sooo much, you WILL be back. This guy is the sausage man for Calgary.\n     Regarding his cuts of meat, I have only done his pork tenderloin -- it was exactly what I wanted. They also offer lots of other Polish things. Their fresh sauerkraut and pickles are better than almost anywhere else (Jan's gives him a run though), his smoked mackerel is as good as Jan's, and his scratch perogie selection is a cut above -- avoid the sauerkraut ones, they don't freeze as well as the others (sauerkraut perogies are best fresh). Lots of canned goods, spices, sweets, preserves et cetera. \n     Just remember -- this is THE sausage guy. Closed Mondays, go to Bon-Ton then. Only then. Or wait for Miertek to open tuesday...
