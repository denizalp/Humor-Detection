Tokyo Discount is pretty cool. It's very fun to look around in. They have virtually everything: Hello Kitty, Disney, Pucca, anime\/manga, house ware, t-shirts (a few), and those cute little erasers that look like animals and food.\nHowever, I have reasons to believe that they can take the word \"discount\" off of the name. the erasers are $2.50 each. You're probably thinking, \"they're unique and Japanese. Why make a big deal out of it?\" In California, you can get them for a dollar or less. Then again, I never see them around in Vegas. Other than that, they have some pretty good prices (considering how expensive I hear stuff is in the land of the rising sun).
