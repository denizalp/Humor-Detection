I wanted to take advantage of the awesome free oil\/filter change offer on Veterans Day. There was a several hour wait at the time and when I returned two hours before closing, I was turned away because they didn't think that they could complete it in time. Unfortunately, they would not take my appointment for the next day to honor the offer. Disappointed.
