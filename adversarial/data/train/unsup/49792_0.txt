Be careful with this place - they are super expensive to begin with and will try to up sell you. Check your receipt: I agreed to a wash and clean for $39.95 and they charged my card $79.95. When I caught it and confronted them about it they lied and told me I was the o e who was wrong. $80 to run it through an automated wash and have someone do a quick vacuum, wipe down and window cleaning? I don't think so. They lost me as a customer - BUYER BEWARE!
