The Sugar Factory is a great place to eat in Vegas. Located right on the strip, it offers a fun atmosphere and is connected to a bakery\/sweets shop (Sugar Factory). Surprisingly, the food was very good despite the fact that you would think it would be know purely for it's baked goods. I didn't try any dessert while there except for a Strawberry Malt, which was delish.\n\nTheir burger was really good, and compared to many of the other restaurants in Vegas, the service was decent as well. Unfortunately, many restaurants in Vegas have a cute atmosphere and poor service or poor food, but this place has it all.\n\nIf you are looking for some good food, a great atmosphere, and a good time, head over to the Sugar Factory :)
