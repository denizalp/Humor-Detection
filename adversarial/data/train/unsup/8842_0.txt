The preserve is also good to take your dog for a leisurely walk through nature.  There are lots of stands with poop bags (Although all the ones I checked were empty), and there are both paved and unpaved trails for you and your dog to go through.  On our journey today we saw some songbirds, hummingbirds, ducks, a soaring raptor, and a hopping cottontail.  My dog enjoyed sniffing all the plants and staring at all the various wildlife!
