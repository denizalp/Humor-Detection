A friend of ours from Hong Kong recommended this restaurant as the best in the city to enjoy Chinese style lobster crab and fish at a reasonable price. After reading reviews, we opted to come on a weekday lunchtime so it would be less busy. Good decision, we just sat waiting 10 - 15 minutes. We enjoyed the unlimited Chinese green tea while waiting for the dim sum trays to arrive. \n\nThey tend to use celery in most dishes with vegetables including the shrimp dumplings. Other Asian restaurants we've been to tend to use green onions or chives in the dumplings instead of celery.   \n\nI didn't mind doing it, because we had come at lunchtime, the traditional dim sum time instead of dinnertime, but we needed to call a waitress over to order something other than dim sum. We then needed to give the numbers off the takeout menu so my daughter & I could try the spicy fried lobster I had read so much about, & so hubby could have his 2 faves, hot and sour soup--the small will easily fill 4 - 6 cups servings-- and chicken and cashews, so piping hot and you can taste the fresh ginger. Everything was well spiced and delicious, dim sum very reasonably priced. I'm so glad I finally got to try this place and we're coming back to try more seafood and their black pepper beef.
