I've been coming to this airport since we were allowed to park at the east end of the runway and hang with our girlfriends. Then there was terminal 1 now gone for years. We were allowed to go up on the roof and watch the planes take off and land like a scene out of Mad Men. Five terminals now and top of the line. Even has the best name of all airports Sky Harbor.
