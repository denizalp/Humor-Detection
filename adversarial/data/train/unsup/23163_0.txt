Last night, I had the realization that I am a true Scottsdale girl and I'm quite alright living in my Scottsdale nightlife bubble. \n\nHere are some differences I noted: \n\nScottsdale: If you look good and are female, you get in for free and probably drink for free. \n\nHurricane Bay: If you look good and are female, thug looking dudes will stand outside of your car making sex faces, causing you to make your male friend come and get you for fear of what happens if you open that door and walk out there alone. Then you pay $10 to get into a not so hoppin Halloween party. Guys hump your ass without asking and without buying you a drink first. \n\nDress code for males in Scottsdale: Nice jeans, button down shirt, shaved or carefully groomed, and they usually smell like nice cologne. \n\nHurricane Bay: wife beater and jeans that haven't been washed in weeks. Hair that says I just got out of jail and tats to match. Standard cologne called BO. \n\nDrinks are strong but their well vodka has to be a step above Gordon's. \n\nAlso, I think there may be dealers right outside selling rohypnol. Needless to say it is a creeper's paradise. \n\nI'll stick with Blue, thank you!
