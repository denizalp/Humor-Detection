We had heard so much hype about this place that we knew we just had to try it. And it lived up to the hype! We thought we would split 2 donuts and ordered a peanut butter cup and an apple fritter. The peanut butter cup is a chocolate donut with gooey chocolate frosting and peanut butter crumbles it was good but the fritter which was a special that day was so huge it could easier feed a family of 4. This massive donut was soft inside with lots of small apples pieces throughout but more apple pieces in the thick soft center. It had the right amount of crispiness around the edges and the perfect amount of glaze. The absolute best fritter I've ever had. We couldn't finish it so I took some home to my mother who also loved it and said she thought it was a mix between a fritter and a strudel. It is a must have! We also ordered a iced nitro coffee and it was very good. There is lots of seating inside so if you want to eat there you can. It is kept clean and neat and the prices are good.
