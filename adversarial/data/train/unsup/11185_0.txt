For my European friends on yelp. This is a beautiful place, its not big and some events are happening here it can be great for those who love crowds.  Its not a Park as we consider parks over here, i consider it more of a venue near South Park Mall. i wold not go there to read a book but i would go to attend an event and much food with a easy walking distance if it is easy for you to walk
