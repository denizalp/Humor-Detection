Running into this filipino restaurant was hilarious! I was with family and uh, my cousin was a little drunk walking into this place. Singing and everything! It was only 3pm!! That's what Vegas does to you! haha! Anyways, not only were the owners\/employees and even some other customers laughing, they were singing too! haha! The food was really good and satisfying! I normally don't have to pay for my sabow (sinigang soup) with my meal but Kapit charged 50 cents? or was it 25? I forget so I was a littled bummed it wasn't included. We enjoyed our meals though! Great prices and good food!
