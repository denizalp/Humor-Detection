Great brunch!  My friend had the omelette of the day, which was cheddar and sausage, and a drip coffee.  I had (sorry I can't remember the exact name) an eggs benny variation with smoked salmon and spinach, and a cappuccino.  The drinks and food was all excellent.  My friend's omelette was served with toast, which is normally so boring, but this was delicious!  \n\nThe service was spotty for sure.  For some reason the server did not do a quality check after bringing our food, although she did walk by us several times.  I can only assume it was an oversight - maybe she thought she did it but really didn't.  Also, a previous reviewer indicated that the drip coffee is bottomless, however my friend finished his coffee half-way through his meal, and no offer was made to refill it.  Perhaps the bottomless coffee is discontinued?  (If anyone knows, can you report on this please?)\n\nI also took a date square to go, after reading Kat's comment about it being the best in the city.  It was very tasty, but I'm not sure I'd describe it as the best.  Sorry Kat!\n\nAll in all, great food, even if a less than perfect service experience.  I will be going back to check out the dinner menu.
