I wish I could give this place more stars but the problem I face is that- to me- this place is Bac's identical twin in the food realm. Now don't get me wrong, I love Bac and the food they offer but I was hoping for at least a little bit of a different variety at Ninja City. \n\nOther than my own thoughts about the food options, I think the restaurant is a perfect addition to Uptown and it has a great vibe. The service was tentative and well knowledged about the beer\/sake\/drinks the restaurant serves.
