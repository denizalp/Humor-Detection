Mmmmn...paellas!\n\nWe were seated al fresco under the messy palo verde tree.  Not too bad, just had to make sure the flowers didn't become part of our meal.\n\nSangria time...to go with that, the Calamari Soda Batter and Crab Stuffed red pepper was perfect.  My hubby and little cutie pie loved the bread and dip as well.  I had to have one with my Garlic egg drop soup.  It was reminiscent of French onion, but garlicky.  We shared the  Paella Arroz Negre (squid ink and seafood) which we were too full to finish.   We had zombie mouths while we were eating.  Brains!!!  Little cutie pie thought it was way cool!  \n\nToo bad we didn't have enough room for desserts, a good excuse to head back over...
