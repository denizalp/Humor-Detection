I'm not saying anything original to observe that Wolfgang Puck has over-extended his brand.  Anything Puck-related, thank I've experienced, suffers from the same problem.  It isn't hard to stumble on to something excellent, but there isn't a level of care that ensures excellence at every turn.  You also get the added problem of the snobbishness of a fine restaurant coupled with the incompetence of a chain.\n\nI'm not sure if I ever had great bread at a Wolfgang place, it seems that they'd rather do something \"interesting\" rather than delicious.  It's the sort of bread that was popular in the 80s, and it's a habit worth breaking.  The waiters, as far as I can tell, do not write orders down.  When this happens, the body language of the waiter lets you know if he got the order in his head.  This time, his clueless expression led to our being unsurprised when a soup went missing.  He returned well into the meal, long after soup time. We also ordered a cured meat platter with toast and burrata, although completely delicious, was served without explanation of the types of meat.  \n\nKeeping with policy, I won't comment on other's dishes unless I have a taste, so despite other's disappointment, my veal ravioli with brown butter, mushroom and sage was amazing - and the portions were far more than I could handle. \n\nIn all, an uneven and overpriced experience, but it's a nice, casual meal when one of the stuffier nearby eateries won't work.
