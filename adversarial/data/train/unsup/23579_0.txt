The first review was dead on!! My wife and I came in to see if this was another false recommendation, but to our surprise it was dead on. The food was out of this world and the prices were spot on. You definitely got what you paid for everything was so fresh and a lot of pride was taken in the perpetration. The only down fall was the lap dance going on between the bartender and what we found out later to be the owner good thing it's 21 and over because it was definitely a nc17 show. We will be coming back again to try more of the food. Maybe lunch next time.
