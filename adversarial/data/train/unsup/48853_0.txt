Our first day at the hotel we got in a little late and didn't have any idea on where to go. So we decided on the Buffett. So we all get what we ant and it didn't seam so bad for all the food you can get. They had crab legs and prime rib. I joked and told my wife where else can you get crab legs and tacos on one plate.  I like this place. Also my kid liked the deserts and ice cream. So all in all it was a win for the family. The food was good quality not your typical bland Buffett food.
