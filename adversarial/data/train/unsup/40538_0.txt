I tend to go to nail salons for pedicures all over the valley, and they are all pretty comparable from one place to the next. I haven't found one that I go back to regularly, not because I don't enjoy it. They are all just very similar and nothing stands out about them. That was until I discovered Tiffany's! Tiffany's is a league above! For the basic pedicure, which is $22, you get a very long massage (wish I would've timed it!), nice scrub, hot stones, and hot towels. Everyone was friendly and the chairs were comfortable. I will be back to this one for sure!
