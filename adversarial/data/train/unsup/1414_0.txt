I got my yellow lab groomed here today and I've found my new groomer! She smells amazing and her nails are clipped!! In the past Petsmart called me after 15 minutes of dropping her off for a groom saying that she was too nervous and they were unable to complete her groom and there was no way they could get more than her back paws clipped. And I love that its a cage free and home environment at Lori's. She was very nice and welcoming! I will take my pup there again and will recommend to my friends!
