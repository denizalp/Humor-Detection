The theme feels a little lost on me, considering I thought it was kinda dirty inside. \n\nBut the weird thing is, once you make your way past the grimy floor, the small dance floor with three people dancing and a creepy back hallway, there's a really cool outdoor patio (we'll call it a patio, but it's more like an open space). This is where house music is playing, they're serving beer out of an old motorhome and the hipsters are hovered together clutching their PBR. \n\nThere was also a video screen projecting weird images that I thought would be cool if they played old movies or something (they may, not sure). This is where I'd want to hang out for a chill, warm night out. Just for people watching alone! There was some preppy white dude doing some weird form of breakdancing in a v-neck argyle sweater. What is this alternate universe? Who knows, but it was intriguing!
