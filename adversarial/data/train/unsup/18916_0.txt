So my wife is allergic to dairy, not lactose intolerant, but straight up deathly allergic to cheese. Being poor college students, we have always ordered pizza from Little Caesars one- half no cheese, the other half normal to share. But when we came to this location the employees, the manager, and the district manager freaked out on us and rudely stated that they will never serve us or anyone halves on a pizza. This is ridiculous, they have always done this before, but if they wish to alienate all of my family, my in-laws and everyone that I will tell, then shame on them. \nGo to any of the little Caesars or local pizza places that will cater to your family's needs.
