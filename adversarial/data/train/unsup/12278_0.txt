I love target. I think I spend a good portion of my paycheck here. I've given you all good business for many years. I had to have surgery recently. A family member took me on a pre surgery shopping spree but I've lost 50 lbs very fast and the clothing was too big. I brought it back and just wanted store credit to get other clothing. I was told the policy is that you can only return one item without a receipt. Now we all know that's not target policy and you are not a franchise so I don't know what utter lunacy was going on. I drove to another location, did my returns, got an $80 credit, spent $500 in the other target. Do you guys see where your math and customer care failed?\n\nI will never be back. Just a horrible experience.
