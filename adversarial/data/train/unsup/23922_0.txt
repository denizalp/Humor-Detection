There are probably 10 places that I frequently visit that i havent wrote a review for. I found out just now that Cambodican is one of them.\n\nMy first ever experience with Dan, those wontons & the moon sauce was around 1am over a year ago walking sloppily through southside (judge me) We ordered seafood wontons and continued on our walk... then turned around and ordered another batch. I've been back quite a few times since then (sober of course). \n\nMy go-to is the chicken shish kabob- which surprisingly isnt served on a stick like a kabob. It's just chicken laid on rice. The chicken has their moon sauce on it (the sauce is great by the way) I've also tried some of my friends general tso's which wasn't bad. You can the general tso's sauce anywhere from mild to blazing. I've also tried bobby's keilbasa kebob which is also delish and i believe it has moon sauce on it as well. We are always sure to add an order on of seafood wontons.\n\nI only head to southside twice a year now for a night out instead of every other weekend, but its still a go-to for those late night drunken munchies. \n\nCash only
