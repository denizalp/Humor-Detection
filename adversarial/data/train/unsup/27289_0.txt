It's been a while since i have had a  brazilian. \nOn the plus side, it was very clean everything. \nThey do not double dip on the wa, and my overall experience was decent. \nNot very helpful with explaining the products, but she pushed them on me but i did decline. I wasn't sold on why i really needed them at all. \nAt the front desk, i wasn't thrilled having to go back to the front desk in front of everyone talking about how i liked it and then the sales pitch again.products and then the whole buy the package sh-peal. I would really like it if they had some kind of punch card. \nI did make another appointment, its worth giving it another shot.
