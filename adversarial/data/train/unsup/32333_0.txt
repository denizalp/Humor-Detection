My husband has been coming to Donut Hut for years! He has bragged and bragged about these blueberry donuts...  THE GREATEST BLUEBERRY DONUT EVERRRRRRRRRR JUST HAPPENED!!! The donut man was so pleasant and even threw in extra donuts!!! The donuts are crispy on the bottom melting away in the middle they're so soft! This is a must try spot for donuts!!!!!!!!
