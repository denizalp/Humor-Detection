I just got a plain burger for take out and let me tell you about it. This burger is not your dad's burger... That is unless P.J. Marley is in fact your father. THIS burger was like an angel came down from heaven and brought a heard of cows with her to make the burger of the gods. Eating THIS burger was like having a conversation with God about how to make the best burger in the world. The pickles tasted as though Jesus pickled them, himself. Yes. The angel also brought down the heavenly Jesus pickes with her too... And pretzel buns... And all the other heavenly burger ingredients too. Then there were the French fries. The French fries were so good I swore that Fran√ßois Hollande, The president of France, cut down a forest of trees with an axe, used those trees to build a boat, sailed said boat across the Atlantic ocean and then walked to the kitchen of P.J. Marley's to hand cut the potatos and fry them himself... With the help of Jesus. If there is perfect form of hand cut french fries that exist, these are them. FACT. But the moral of the story is that this isn't JUST the best burger I have ever had, but the best burger in the world. Amen.
