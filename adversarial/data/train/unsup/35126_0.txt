19 months ago I had a fantastic buying experience getting my first bike here. I have had all my service done for my bike here and bought all my parts here with the best service ever! From the front door to sales, parts, service and management Go AZ west has been fantastic. \n\nSeveral weeks ago I began to have some issues with my bike, it was in an out of service for awhile and finally the manufacturer bought the bike back. During this time Justin in service did everything he could to facilitate my bike being fixed, he went above and beyond and made a bad experience with my bike the best he could. T seemed like we talked on the phone everyday and I always new what was going on. When the manufacturer bought my bike back Kyle the service manager got all the paperwork over right away and made the process as smooth as possible. Sean the general manager kept tabs on everything and helped where he needed, overall making the process as smooth as it could be and got a great outcome.\n\nThen after it was settled Kelly in sales stepped in and got me on a fantastic bike. He and the finance manager Kevin worked hard to get me a great deal and got me back on a new bike fast. No hassle sales for both my bike purchase. I would never buy a bike anywhere else. I am relocating next year and when the time comes to buy a bike I will fly back AZ to buy a bike here and break in on the ride back up the pacific coast highway back to Oregon. Everything about this place is fantastic!
