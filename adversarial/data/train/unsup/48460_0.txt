Don't waste your time here. They don't care about you. I went to the Gilbert office one time and my experience was awful and I'm still dealing with it and my appointment was months ago. 1) Took months to get an appointment. 2) You spend an hour answering all of their questions online and then go into the office with their predetermined diagnosis and they don't even care to get to know you or ask what's going on 3) They put me on a medication and then told me \"come back in 4 weeks to do a follow up, but actually wait your dr. Is going out of town so you will actually have to wait 8 weeks, but wait again, she's booked up so we will see you in 4 months so hopefully you don't have any terrible reactions to this new medicine, oh yeah also we are only giving you a 30 day supply and won't refill it until we see you again so good luck!! WHAT?!  4) got blood work done, they never called with the results, I called them and the results were awful but that's not something I would have ever found out if I didn't call them. 5) Don't expect a call back in a timely matter. \n\nIf you're having any type of mental health issue, save yourself the frustration and go somewhere else. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy, it's a joke.
