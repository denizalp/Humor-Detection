SOOOO DARN PRETTY!!! \n\nI wish I lived closer to here to just walk, bring the nephew\/niece or just take the dogs. I love Vegas and Vegas life but, lets be honest and say that all the casinos and Strip madness can get old and played out.\n\nBeing here at Symphony Park makes me feel like I'm in LA or SF just enjoying the outdoors and culture of the city. Especially when it's next to the beautiful architecture of The Smith's Center. Ugh, I'm so in love with that building and it's Great Gatsby feel. \n\nThe park alone is strewn with lite lightbulbs on lines that go from palm tree to palm tree and it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo profile picture worthy!\nAlong with the various art lying across the grounds.\nCame here during sunset and it was perfect. No filter needed. \n\nCan't wait to have a picnic here!
