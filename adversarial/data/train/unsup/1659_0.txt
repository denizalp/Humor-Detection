I go to this place often. It's always a friendly and non pushy environment. My wife and I have made really good friends there. We also love that we can free HIV testing there every month. \n\nThey also have a boutique that has a lot of cute outfits there at great deals. The wife got a couple outfits there and loves them. \n\nThere is so much to do there, it's a very nice and clean place. The lady at the door is a sweetheart. If you're looking for a good crowd to mingle with this is the place to be.
