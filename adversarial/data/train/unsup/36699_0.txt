The Buffet at Bellagio is the best I've had in Vegas and I've eaten at most of them.  Some may think that the $30 price for dinner is too expensive, but not for what you get.  I had Beef Wellington, Jumbo Shrimp, Alaskan King Crab, Chilean Sea Bass, Sausage & Peppers, Red Chicken Curry and for dessert I had cheesecake and tiramisu.  I was alone, so I just walked right up to the bar and skipped the line.  Best way to go if it's crowded and you have 2 people or less.  What a great experience, I had 3 plates and loved every bite.
