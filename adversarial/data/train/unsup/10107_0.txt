How annoying that you can't just call into the store directly without being routed to Apple Care first.\n\nNot sure who decided on that shit but seriously, it's BEYOND annoying.\n\nI worked in mobile for 3 years - I'm not one of those idiots who don't know how to work electronics, especially something as easy as the Apple OS. I still have the same stupid issues now as I did before going to this store. Yeah, everyone is friendly. But they need to train everyone THE SAME. Both in store and through \"apple support\" because this run-around shit is beyond annoying.\n\nI swear, they spit shit out of their mouths half the time. I asked multiple times, \"Isn't the restrictions passcode going to be on my backup? because it says right here 'it backs up settings' and restrictions passcode is under the settings.\"\nSure as shit, I was right. Here I am, unable to reset this stupid shitsicle of a device. \n\nWhy the hell aren't users able to see what's \"backed up\" WITHOUT using another Apple device? Maybe I don't want to restore some unknown backup to my iPad. So then what? It's a guessing game that is full of shit.\n\nI don't understand how a company that's so \"above and beyond\" technology doesn't offer something so god damn simple. THIS is why I miss having an android. I can see what the hell is on my memory card and Google backs up shit without me asking.\n\nIt's interesting how the new phone and IOS come out and all of a sudden the older devices start crashing. It's almost like it was an accident at first, but Apple now uses it to con morons into buying the new shit-piece.\n\nI have to go back here tomorrow and oh man, I'm raising hell. Nothing like wasting HOURS in a fucking Apple Store because they want you to use their open wifi network that's slow as shit to \"back up\" into the fucking mysterious iCloud bullshit.
