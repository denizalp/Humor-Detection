We must have gone on an off day seeing all the great reviews.  I ordered the egg sandwich which is supposed to come with bacon, avocado and cheese.  It came with just egg.  Sent it back, it comes back with avocado (under ripe) and this lame piece of bacon and no cheese.  After trying to get ANYONE'S attention the manager finally comes and I show him and he says \"oh do you want more bacon\" like this piece was acceptable for an $11 sandwich?  Then they bring over done bacon, but I stopped complaining.  Then they didn't offer anything like a dessert or comp for the sandwich!  I was at California Pizza Kitchen recently and they burnt my pizza and saw it, took it back and brought a new one out and took the pizza off the bill.  My sister had an order come out wrong at Rubio's and they took it off the bill.  A place like this should do SOMETHING when the screw up.
