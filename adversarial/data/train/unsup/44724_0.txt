A coworker brought me here for lunch. This place is awesome!!! The oysters were FRESH and their shucking was perfect. I didn't get any broken shell or anything! The sliders were awesome as well. The chef and Erick Martinez gave great service and were awesome! Thanks guys, I will definitely be back and I will bring everyone I know here.
