We went here with friends a couple of weeks back for dinner. \n\nMussels are great here.  We ordered a couple of plates, and everyone loved them.  Everyone had main courses as well.  \n\n As others have mentioned, the beer list is extensive. However, they have only a few beers on tap, and when we were there, a large number of them were Ontario Craft beers.  The international selection was mostly bottled, but the prices were equal to other places that had them on tap.  I compare this place to Bier Markt (where I go frequently) and BM has far more beers on tap, and at the same prices as Beer Bistro charges for their bottles.\n\nThe ambiance was nice, and the wait staff were friendly.  \n\nI would recommend this as a nice bar to eat, with a good selection of bottled beers.  However, for anyone interested in beer, I would recommend the Bier Markt any day.
