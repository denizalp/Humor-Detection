The selection and service of this store is amazing.  I made two trips into the store.  First to look at the appliances, second to verify and order.  The staff is very knowledgeable and I felt absolutely no pressure to buy.  Before my purchase the installers came out to verify the opening sizes to see if modifications had to be made.  Once I had selected all of my new appliances our installation was scheduled.  The installers did have to modify our existing openings but they did an excellent job.  Our granite had to be cut on the sides as well as the oven opening.  One installer cut, the other ran two vacuums to minimize the dust.  Excellent job!  I am very impressed with the entire experience with Best Home Appliances.
