Stopped in here with one of my vendors who was treating. I mean, free food is always a great deal. Somehow it just tastes better. I ordered the fresh toast with banana. It was just ok, I actually thought the banana flavor was going to be part of the fresh toast dip, but it was just carmelized bananas on the side. The french toast itself was a bit dry, which required extra butter and extra syrup. I've definitely had better.\n\nService was good, the place wasn't too crowded on a Tuesday morning around 11am. Its a big restaurant with what looks like a good sized center bar. I think I still prefer the location on Sahara.
