This place is a few steps away from the intersection of St. Clair Ave and Yonge St on the SW side, and St Clair Staion. It's a cute and modern place with a section that can convert into a patio and accessible entrance and unisex bathroom.\n\nI went with my friend and were both able to find something good that fit our dietary restrictions. They have a good selection of vegetarian\/vegan\/gluten free options. There are a lot of healthy greens in each dish, even if you order a meat\/fish dish. You order at the counter and take a number to any table you want and the food is served to you.\n\nIt is a bit expensive, so I wouldn't come here regularly. The food is also bit bland but overall good. Also keep in mind that this is a true brunch place and closes at 3pm on Saturdays.
