My wife and I like to go out for a good meal and a good atmosphere we choose Desert Ridge Mellow Mushroom , the service and the atmosphere is phenomenal it exceeds our expectations every time we go there and we have been going there for over 3 years , when You go there ask for \"Joe\" he is the best and we recommend the place to all of our friends and family .
