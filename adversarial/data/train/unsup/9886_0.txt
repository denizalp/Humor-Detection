There's a location closer to my home but I was in the area and decided to come in. It's always a good time for pok√©! This place has a really cool setup; most poke places have their counters against one side with a wall behind and you move along the line and order. Here, the employees are in the middle of a square setup and they have two sides for maximum efficiency, though only one side was being used today. This creates a more open and inviting atmosphere, and they had booth seating on both sides of the place. \n\nIt was nice that once the gentleman finished up with a group, he came to assist me. I got my standard base of half white rice and half spring mix in a smol bowl ($10) with salmon and Hawaiian tuna. They also have lobster here, for a steep $4 extra. Avocado is $2 extra, phew! Toppings are similar to those of other poke shops, and I got my favorite: edamame, green onion, avocado, cucumbers, and crab meat. Dried toppings include onions, furikake, and garlic. But the sauces, ooh wee they have some good ones. I went a bit wild and got their spicy shoyu, sweet chili lime and spicy house aioli. So much sauce, I really like their chili lime one, the sweet flavor added a nice dynamic. The seafood tasted fresh and all the ingredients worked well together, though my bowl was so full that it was hard to mix them (not the worst problem to have).\n\nThe folks here were so welcoming and friendly, I was glad to see business was steady during early dinner time. I look forward to visiting their sister locations and signing up for their rewards program. FYI: one bowl is one point, and 10 points gets you something but the best part is the points combine from all Koi Poke locations you visit. Very cool!
