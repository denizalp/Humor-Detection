Pizza sauce is \"non-remarkable!\"  The owner works the bar and is a very nice fellow, but the food we've had is just not up to snuff. Locally, there much better pizza just around the corner at Joey's NY Pizza and if you go a little further to Green Valley, Settebello rocks.\n\nIf you want top quality food, and incredible service go to \"Giada's\" at the Cromwell on the Strip!
