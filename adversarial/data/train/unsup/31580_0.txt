Another visit and I am STILL IN LOVE!  Had lunch with my husband and my son, Mika took care of us, and not only did she take care of us, but she was the only one on the floor and she took care of EVERYONE!  Again the food was PERFECT! I had my shrimp \"as usual\", along with extra sauce, I dip my fries in it and my husband and son dip their sandwiches in it!  Smokin' Crawfish has never let me down!
