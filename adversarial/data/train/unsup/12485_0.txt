All the ceiling fans were set to max, the best part is that the lights in the restaurant are above the fans.  Great strobe light effect from the fans and lights.  Could not get over that part of the restaurant.  It was similar to a flickering light effect throughout the restaurant.  \nI was unsure of food safety after reading Ryan's review so with the light\/ceiling fan issue I headed for the door.
