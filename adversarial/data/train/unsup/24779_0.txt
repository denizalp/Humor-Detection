I'm done. I am officially throwing in the towel. This foodie will eat no more. Why you might ask? Well isn't it obvious? Nothing will ever be as insanely delicious as Beet Jar's coconut bacon sandwich. So what is the point in living if you've already peaked?\n\nOk ok, so that's a bit dramatic. But seriously though, have you had this sandwich? If you haven't you need to literally stop whatever you are doing, put some shoes on (if you aren't wearing any), but some pants on (again, if you aren't already sporting some) and get yourself to Hingetown, STAT. I think I saw my life flash before me when I first bit into this sandwich because I am fairly certain my heart stopped for a moment.  I don't know if it is the perfect avocado to coconut ratio, or the beautifully toasted bread, but this sandwich should be illegal it's so addicting. \n\nThe sandwich isn't the only reason to go to Beet Jar though, as you may have guessed by the name, they have juice too! I got the grapefruit\/cayenne\/lemon\/orange juice when I went and it was so refreshing I had to force myself to not down in all at once. \n\nBasically, if you are human\/breathing\/alive you need to hit up Beet Jar. If I could I would give them way more than 5 stars so seriously: Go. Now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm serious.
