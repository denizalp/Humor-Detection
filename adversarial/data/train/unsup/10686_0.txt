Driving by I decided to stop in Mordeo for dinner. That was the best decision of the day. This great little Spanish tapas restaurant is a great option and Jewel in Chinatown. I started off with the Maine Lobster Ceviche that have lemongrass mango habanero salsa and an incredible plantain chip. Delicious I followed that up with a very delicious snow pea leaf with garlic ginger and miso sake that absolutely exploded in my mouth. Next was the Papas bravas very tasty and a pork belly skewer as well as a kuzu chicken skewer with a scallion sweet soy reduction. All the food was done excellently however more importantly the service was outstanding my server North Rico and then the two partners Luis and Brandon came by multiple times made suggestions and just interacted and had great conversation not to mention the wine bar which is outstanding I had a sangria to compliment my meal. This place is a can't miss for a great time they stay open late and have a great chef's table that would seat 12.
