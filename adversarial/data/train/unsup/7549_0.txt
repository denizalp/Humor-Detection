Delicious authentic Thai food. \n\nEvery time we come in we get what they call \"the crying tiger\". It's steak on a bed of lettuce that comes out with these 2 sauces. The sauces are the highlighters! This is why you cry when u eat this dish. Lol it is spicer then anything but it's also extra delicious so you just can't get enough of it! One sauce is red (my favorite) and one is green (burns your whole mouth). I honestly love spicy foods but the green sauce might just be my limit! \n\nThe dish comes out with rice. I usually make like a little lettuce wrap with it. You can just dip the meat in the sauce and eat it with rice. Which ever way.. It's extra delicious. Also you can substitute the meat with chicken which is what my beau does because he's on a diet and can only eat chicken. But if you want chicken breast you have to call ahead and check if they have it because they don't always carry chicken breast. But either way it's still bomb.\n\nI've also had the chicken Pad Thai which was amazing as well. I actually ate the whole dish by myself which NEVER happens! Lol \n\nThe staff are really attentive and nice. They make sure they come and talk to us and converse. Waters are always full. And one time one of the species took over my throat and I was coughing up a storm and they Gave me a free Thai tea! Which actually helped with the heat. \n\nLove this place and usually come in once a week or once every other week!
