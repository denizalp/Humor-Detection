Horrible!  I always thought this was a cute local store... looks like it.  Walked in with my husband and son with the intent of purchasing a natural gas grill.  The person working was talking to another customer and failed to even acknowledge our presence!!!!  We walked through the entire showroom and not once did the worker even say hello.  Customer Service is everything.  As much as I would love to support the local store, we left and headed to Lowes.  The guy at Lowes immediately greeted us and managed to work several customers on a busy saturday!  GET with the business of CUSTOMER SERVICE OR CLOSE YOUR DOORS fireplace shoppe!
