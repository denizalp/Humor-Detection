This was the company I was told by BEAM to contact regarding my warranty issues for my central vac... I am 110% UNSATISFIED with the results and the outcome of this whole process. I called BEAM to find out what to do because my power head was not working. I was told to drop off my central vac hose and power head.  I was within the 3 year warranty guidelines but I was told it is up to the certified dealer to decide what is covered under warranty. The person reviewing my hose and power head wanted to charge me $330 to fix my machine because he said \"I must have sucked up something sharp\". The man said he counted all the holes in my hose and it was my fault there was not enough suction in the hose. The hose alone cost $330 and everything worked fine when he used another hose. I could by a whole new vacuum for that price and I would have rather done that then pay this company any money. I took my power head and hose to another certified dealer in the valley turns out to be faulty wiring and I was charged $26 for labor. Talk a scam or someone not being educated enough at their job to determine the source of the problem.  Bottom line I will never buy a central vac through BEAM\/Electralux with these crappy warranty guidelines and I will never go to 35th ave.
