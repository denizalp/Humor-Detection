For the price this is a great buffet.  This buffet is 1000 times better then Golden Corral. They really have decent quality food.  There is a reason the cheap cab drives of Las Vegas eat here.  Please live a decent tip if you eat here.  The servers really deserve it.  They don't get many good tips from those cheap foreign cab drives.  Get a club card sign up is free and go during the week and the buffet for dinner is like 8.99.  Please make sure you don't forget your club card.  Or you will have to deal with Hitler attitude cashier.
