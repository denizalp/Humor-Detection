Would actually give 3.5. Came on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 3. The restaurant was quite empty at 12:30, but once 1 ish the whole restaurant was packed and a bit too loud.  We ordered one appetizer, 2 pastas, one pizza and a slice of cake.\n\nAppetizer was the escargot. The cheese was $1 extra. Enjoyed the butter and garlic flavour but a bit bland. \n\nAngel hair surf and turf, and chicken soemthing. The surf and turf was flavourful but a bit too sweet. The chicken dish was a bit lacking in flavour but both was okay\n\nMeat lovers pizza was a tad too salty but then again it's all meat. Also it was a bit too oily, however it came out hot and the cheese was stretchy \n\nFor dessert we got the chocolate truffle cake. It was good nothing too special.
