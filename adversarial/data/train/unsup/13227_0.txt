Sometimes you find a business that seems to be purposefully lowering the bar: hence, The Palms Resort!\nUpon arrival and meeting my friend, I was jostled by a display of rudeness and sarcasm by the front receptionist, Mathew. Usually, it's expected that you'll be greeted with amiable customer service and appreciation upon Hotel arrival... but not at The Palms!! You can forget it, Mister, just ask Mathew, the salt master! \nI had a wonderful time with my friend over the weekend, but that was because of her, not The Palms' amenities. Don't be jealous, salty Mathew. The only still decent thing about The Palms (reason for 2 stars instead of 1), is that the views from the top restaurant are nice and the oysters are good. The waiters, however, are pushy and annoying.\nThe room service is a joke, NO PLATES ladies and gentlemen, just boxes and plastic utensils!! I kid you not!! (Bar just got lowered... Ask salty Mathew about it) \nI was told that I couldn't walk into the pool area, even check it out, without a bathing suit on. The pool closes incredibly early, around 5 or 6, pretty ridiculous. Rumor has it that Mathew pees in the pool at night all by himself. \nAll in all, I had a great weekend in Vegas, but I'd probably never stay at The Palms again unless things substantially changed and Mathew took a sugar bath. Poor Mathew.
