First let me say that the food we were served was ultimately  very good, I just thought that we were an afterthought\nThe table side guacamole had good flavor but it would have been nice if the pieces of avocado were broken down to less than silver dollar size\nWe have noted a trend recently where waiters try to memorize all the food orders and always get something wrong .  That was the case here; red and green sauce are not the same\nAgain the food was good; the experience would have been better if the wait staff took the time
