I usually have a good experience at this store, but yesterday, not so much.\nI went in for just a few things, one being eggs. I really dont like buying large eggs as they are more like smasl. But lately, everytime i go in, all they have is large. No extra large or jumbo. I have to use more eggs in recipes, as I said, large is like small.\nThen, we had decided to have fried chicken for dinner. So, i went to the deli snd got the 8 piece pak. WORST Chicken ever. It tasted like it was a week old. No seasoning, dry, tasteless. We ended up picking the meat from the bone and feeding the dogs. Wont buy chicken there again.
