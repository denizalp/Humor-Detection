I want to like Sunflour, and if you look at the name and the bakery case as a piece of modern furniture, and maybe - just maybe - the cool blackboard-ish menu, then I probably do like it.  But then you look at the contents of the bakery case, rather than seeing it as an admirer from afar, and I get all antsy because I really see very little that excites me.\n\nIf you watch How I Met Your Mother, it is much like stated by Barnabus Stinson in the Cheerleader Effect: Get a bunch of semi-decent looking stuff (women, or baked goods) together, and as a group they all look better\/hotter (paraphrasing here).  Once you look closer, however, they all look quite a bit rougher.\n\nLuckily, Sunflour has no pastries that look like Marshall Eriksen.\n\nRegardless, the selection is decent, if not great.  And the food is decent, if not great.  I just find myself wishing that it was better, while at the same time I am glad that it is not better because I could totally see being there more often.
