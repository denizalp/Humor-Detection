I don't care what anybody says, you get what you pay for and since the produce here is super cheap sometimes that means it's not going to be top notch BUT who cares?!  You can fill a whole cart with whatever you need for about $30 and I mean your cart is totally filled to the top.  We actually stopped juicing for a while b\/c produce is so expensive, since we've found this place we can juice all we want.  It's true that most of the produce won't last longer then a week but when you're paying .15 for 4 onions who cares?  \n\nHere's a tip for you Saturday shoppers - don't do it, I've actually seen fights break out in line on Saturday mornings.   If you must then bring a shopping buddy and have them stand in line while you do the shopping - by the time you're done they'll be at check out. Also skip the carts and bring some cloth bags. You'll be able to weave in and out of the crowds easily and get your shopping done super fast.
