I shop at this Ross when I need to find a quick gift for someone.  It seems to have a nicer selection in their housewares section than most of their stores in Vegas.....so, when I'm in a pinch and need a gift, I stop here.\n\nThe store is relatively clean compared to some of the other ones in town.  It does get very busy though and the lines can be atrocious.  Not much else to say about the store....it's a Ross.\n\nWill I come back?  Chances are good.
