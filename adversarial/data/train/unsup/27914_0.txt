Good food but very poor service, this location also feels very un-inviting as I am a Hispanic man and stopped by to grab a bite to eat with my family but as soon as we walk in we received uninviting stairs from not only the customers but they employees as well we were taken to a table and sat there for 10 to 15 minutes without being attended to at this point we decided to get up and go somewhere else.
