Walking through this market makes my head spin with delight. All of the different produce, the pungent smells of Asian cuisine. I love this place.\nI stock up on my sauces, and noodles, as well as getting my favorite fruits & vegetables, and all for a reasonable price.\nI can spend hours in Kim Phat, looking at the stuff no other store has and debating which product to buy and browsing. \nTo me a day at Kim Phat is a treat.
