This place is always busy. Would recommend for 2 to 4 people. The quinoa onion rings are delicious - order it with chipotle mayo. My go-to dishes are the tangled thai salad which I add crispy tofu cubes to, the tiger bowl on soba, and the buddha bowl on soba or rice. I also love their hot sauce. I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I've enjoyed everything I've tried.
