All the horrible things you hear about this company are true and worse!  I signed up at 29.95..now paying 82.00..? Nothing extra..hasnt really worked in over two months,  no internet, no netflix, everything is off and on, five technicians out on the last month..mostly idiots from another country. Last guy..an american said the system is overloaded on valley view and basically down untill they fix the shelf?  Meanwhile i was told on ph i would get a credit..lol..billing hung up on me and actually said how do we know to trust you that your Internet doesnt work!  Gee i just love wasting hours on the ph w\/their idiots and having to stay home waiting on their techs that sometimes show and sometimes dont and nothing ever gets better. Why you ask dont i change?  Unfortunately its the only thing i can get here. I am forced to move. WARNING do NOT use this company!
