I recently heard this new restaurant opened in Old Town Scottsdale, so we decided to try it out when one of my coworkers was in town this week.  We were warmly welcomed upon arrival and quickly seated on the patio.  Our server, Rob, was beyond professional and so helpful with his recommendations on the menu.  We shared the sweet potato gyozas and the grilled octopus with tomatoes and pomegranate seeds to start...not a bad introduction to this lovely restaurant as the flavors were great and the presentation was beautiful.  For my entree, I enjoyed the sea bass with pea puree and sauteed vegetables...again, fresh and bursting with flavor.  The decor of the restaurant is lovely, the staff is top notch and the food is fantastic.  My only recommendation is to up the game on the wine selection...not very impressive currently.
