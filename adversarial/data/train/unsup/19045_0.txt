On a whim went here for dinner. Sits in the Pollack Tempe plaza close to the cinemas, comic store, etc. the restaurant is decorated with large Thai art like the huge floating market painting and huge faces of the Buddha and notes of bamboo dividers between some tables and the entrance walk-in. Smells of the food resonated from the nose to my tummy. \n\nSo much to choose from: March specials and regular menu items. I had to try the Drunken Noodles and the Panang Curry which are my Go-to dishes. \n\nDrunken noodles: Mild. Chicken. Onions. Bell peppers. Tomato. Napa cabbage. Thai basil. Flat noodles. Sweet. Savory. $10.50\n\nPanang Curry. Medium. Chicken. String beans. Red bell peppers. Lime leaves. Coconut milk. One small bowl of rice. Sweet n savory.  $12\n\nFried Banana with ice cream. $7.50\n\nSmall bowl of rice: $1.50. Disappointingly a little overpriced especially since the Panang curry came with only one small bowl to begin with. I personally think the Panang curry should have at least come with 2 small bowl worth of rice. The rest of the curry liquid needs the rice to complement the dish. \n\nI originally wanted the March special dessert: mango and blueberry stuffed crepe for $5.99 but unfortunately they were out!! \n\nWaitress and staff were smiley, polite and helpful!
