BACKGROUND\n\nWell, let me just say that Postino owners, the DeMarco couple and Bailey couple, co-owner's of LGO Hospitality sure have a grip on restaurants AND social media.\n\nAs per usual, I'm never oblivious to social media trends and where Yelp sends it's minions, and it's no accident they've been sent to all of the LGO Hospitality venues (including Chelsea's Kitchen and Buck & Rider) and all of five of the Postino's.\n\nIt's due to the fantastic vision of it's co-owner Craig DeMarco.\n\nCraig DeMarco is responsible for some of the Valley's best restaurants, including Postino, Windsor and Federal Pizza. As founding partner of Upward Projects, he, along with founding members Kris DeMarco (Craig's wife) and Wyatt and Lauren Bailey, have brought a dozen restaurant projects to the Valley. \n\nTheir passion re-purposing classic Valley buildings and invigorating neighborhoods, such as North Central Phoenix, Arcadia and downtown Gilbert has not gone unnoticed. \n\nThey're killing it and I am a fan.\n\nTHE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE\n\nWhen I first visited Postino's Highland 10 months ago, I IMMEDIATELY LOVED it. This location is my favorite, although I also love the ASU location.\n\nIt's just cool and sexy. I feel happy here.\n\nI've been all different times of day and night, and it's just fun.\n\nMy last visit, I went with my BFF Whitney. We shared one of their bruschetta boards and had some wine.\n\nI've tried almost everything on the menu, and I've never had a bad meal.\n\nThe offerings seem simplistic but have a sophistication and maturity to them.\n\nThe wine list and draft beer selection is impressive.\n\nAnd the service is ALWAYS on point. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDoes it seem like I'm promoting Postino's Highland? \n\nWell, yes, I am.\n\nThat's because I'm very selective and I can't find anything bad to say.\n\nIsn't that what Yelp is for? To promote businesses that we've enjoyed?\n\n4\/5 RECOMMEND\n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Plenty of parking out front.\n\n*For more information: postinowinecafe.com
