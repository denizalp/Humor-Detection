The staff starts out really nice before you purchase, but after that they change. I ordered a bedroom set online the store claimed it was brand new. Well when we went to open the night stand drawer the entire front fell off! I called\n the store and a sales person said they couldn't come out until Monday at 11am. So at about 1:30, after waiting all morning I call the store and was placed on hold for 20 minutes only to be told someone will be there before 3. Also when they put my bed together they used these huge screws that made the headboard wobble really bad. Again I was told someone would be here by 11 and again no one came or called. Horrible customer service!
