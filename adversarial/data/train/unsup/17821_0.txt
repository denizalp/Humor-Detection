New store now open! Don't wanna miss it! It's right next door to a Scooter store. Everything is expanded and lots of lighting. Great place to just lounge and vape! Their new juice flavors are coming out. I'm looking forward to the Guava Nut. Nick, Felix and Trish are very helpful to their customers. Oh and I'm not just doing this review for a free 30mL ;) they genuinely are great people running this shop.
