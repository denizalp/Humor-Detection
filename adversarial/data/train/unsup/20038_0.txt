I'll start by saying that I'm reviewing this for what it is: a Walmart. Of course Walmart is shitty. That's the point. Shitty cheap shit at low prices.\n\nBut even for a Walmart, this is a total dump. As many have noted, the employees are the rudest, most incompetent people I've ever met. I mean, I know working for Walmart is terrible, but you could at least try. The lines are always really long, even when there are plenty of employees there. I once had an employee, who was wandering in the aisle I was in, tell me that she could not help me because she was on break. Terrible.\n\nOnce you exit the food section, which isn't particularly awful, the rest of the store is a war zone. Several of the aisles just have shit strewn about on shelves. It looks like a hurricane just hit. The electronics section has almost everything locked up, but usually only one employee to unlock things for you. If you want a good laugh, go to the pet toy section. My dog could do a better job stacking those shelves - WITHOUT TREATS.\n\nDon't go there unless you ABSOLUTELY need to.
