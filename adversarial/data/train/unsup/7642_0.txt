When you get right down to it, it's a chinese buffet, and as we all know, Pittsburgh and the yinzers with their stretch jeans and sweat pants mentalities, loves them some Chinese buffet.\n\nOn Jan 1st I took charge of my life and health and went vegan, it wasnt long after that Lesbian friend of Joe who eats meat with every meal and snack decided that for her birthday she wanted to come here for her celebration. we hit the place and she took off for the crab legs, shrimp, and anything she could find that used to be an animal that was sitting under heat lamps and oozing of juices that used to be blood.\n\nI went to the sushi station and asked one of the sushi chefs if he could make me a california roll and anything else without fish. He smiled and said that he could put his creative mind to work. I was floored with what he came up with. He took many different vegetables and made me a sushi platter that was both beautiful and filling. Using brown rice and white rice, cucumber, carrot, and scallion, he created a wonderful meal.
