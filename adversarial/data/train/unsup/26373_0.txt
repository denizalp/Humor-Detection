Clean, brightly lit and busy for being in a low-visibility location. Mindy was really friendly, quick and neat. Got a single-color mani\/pedi plus sugar for around $30 incl tip. Oh, and the massage chairs actually work really well. Kudos on something which seems to challenge a lot of other nail places.
