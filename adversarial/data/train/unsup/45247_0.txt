Real Greek food is surprisingly difficult to find in the US. Yes, it's easy to find generic \"Mediterranean\" food, but Estiatorio Milos serves *real* Greek food. It's delicious, and at least for lunch, a very good deal.\n\nThe octopus and meze plates were both fantastic as appetizers and the highlights of the meal. They were high quality and refreshing. The taramasalata on the maze plate is particularly good.\n\nThe shrimp main we had was delicious, fish with capers just OK. The Greek yogurt dessert was delicious -- thick, creamy, great berries. The honey cake was a little too sweet for our taste, but had a fascinating flavor profile (with something somewhat bitter as a component).\n\n\n\nReally amazing for lunch. Octopus and meze plate were amazing, high quality, refreshing. Fish filet with capers, shrimp dish was much better, Greek yogurt was yummy, not set, other Greek honey cake a bit too sweet
