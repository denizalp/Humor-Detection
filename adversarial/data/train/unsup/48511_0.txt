Very authentic Taiwanese food. We had three cup chicken and bamboo shoots with pork. The dishes were very flavourful, but not over-powerful. It is a good balance of the original taste of the food and spice. Portions wise was not too large.\nGood service and good environment. Overall a very good four star restaurant!
