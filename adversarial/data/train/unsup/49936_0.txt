Stopped by for lunch today and was surprised at the new decor!  The whole place got a face lift and was very inviting.  I especially liked the Champaign wall featuring the Virginia Theater in town.  It was a nice touch. Although the tea should have stayed out on the counter.  Having it away from the soda machine was just inconvenient for staff and customers alike.  I had to wait to order while a refill was given.  I ordered the half and half with broccoli cheddar soup and the new black cherry ham sandwich.  I also got a sweet tea which was of course delicious. The soup was good with cheddar cheese melty and amazing on top, but the sandwich was underwhelming.  The proportions seemed off with a lot of ham and very little onions and spinach.  The onions were soaked in cherry juice and provided a nice addition to the flavor profile when I got one in my bite, but it wasn't consistently in every mouthful.  I ended up pulling it apart and rearranging them to spread the joy.  I will say as I was nearing the end of my lunch the gal that took my order, Lakishma, stopped by my table and got me a refill.  That was very nice.
