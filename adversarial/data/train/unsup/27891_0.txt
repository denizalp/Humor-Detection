This place is definitely worth the trip and time (if you have to wait). We live in Henderson but made the drive over here based on recommendation and I can say I will be coming back frequently. \n\nI have lived in Vegas for over 15 years and have been to many of the Mexican restaurants in town. Although, there are very many different styles of Mexican food and a lot of great hole in the walls, this place beats the best of them. If your on the fence just go! \n\nUpdate: round 2 was just as good as the first. Love this place.
