Great friendly service.  I recommend a reservation though if you are coming with more than 2 people, even during the week.  \n\nHappy Hour is from 3 - 6.  Enjoyed my mojito - it was very strong.  Also the $5 happy hour garlic fries and the $5 brie cheese with bread and jam.  Loved the jam but not so much the walnut bread.\n\nShared two flatbreads.  Didn't like the Italian that much (though it was my two friends favorite) but the Vintage was amazing!!!  So so so good!
