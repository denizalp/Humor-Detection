This is my \"Go To\" spot for exchanging foreign currency.  Whenever I travel abroad I do some research on exchange rates in the country I'm visiting vs this joint.  9 times out of 10 they are very competitive with their rates and I'd rather exchange large sums of currency in Vegas than in a foreign country.\n\nI was here the other day to convert some US Dollars to Chinese RMB in preparation for an upcoming trip to China.  I called prior to driving down here and asked what the exchange rate was.  They were offering 6.53 RMB to 1 USD.  Luckily, I had a classmate in Beijing that just exchanged some currency the day before and she said the exchange rate at banks in Beijing was 6.45-6.75 RMB to 1 USD.  Not a bad deal!  I'll pay the small vig for the convenience of dealing with someone in my home country where communication is easy.\n\nOne of the bad things about this place is the parking.  If you're a visitor, you have to park in the underground parking garage.  That's the last place you want to walk to after converting a lot of currency.  \n\nWhich leads me to my second complaint about this place.....there's no privacy.  There is a large counter in the office where you conduct your transactions and a large window facing the street where people can look inside and see what you're doing. (see pics)  Not a cool situation if you're counting a lot of money on the counter.  I've always felt uncomfortable in that sense.\n\nOverall Value - they offer great exchange rates, I'm always satisfied with the value they offer.\n\nWill I return?  Unless a better option presents itself, there's no doubt I'll be back!
