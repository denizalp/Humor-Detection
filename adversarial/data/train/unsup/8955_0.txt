This was one of my favorite restaurants for a date night. Everything was awesome at The Vig (Fillmore)... Start to finish. The atmosphere, service, and food were perfection. I love the various areas that you can sit at The Vig. We started off in the bar and watched a bit of football, and ended our night on the patio listening to live music (shout out to Vinyl Station who perform on Sundays). We enjoyed a bottle of wine (50% off on Sundays), and our server helped us select a wine that we absolutely loved after we told him wines we enjoyed. The wine was Pine Ridge, and if you enjoy a white wine, it was a lovely choice. My husband had the Prime Vig sandwich with a side of pozole. He raved about his sandwich and shared a few bites of his beautifully flavorful pozole. I had been dreaming of the steak salad since the last time I enjoyed a dinner at The Vig. I went to a different Vig location the first time I ordered the salad, but the consistency was seamless. This steak salad was just as stellar as the one I had a year+ ago and from a completely different location... Not always easy to achieve when restaurants expand like that. I'm not sure I will ever order anything else at The Vig because I am so hung up on that particular salad. We treated ourselves to strawberry shortcake for dessert. It was not your typical strawberry shortcake, as it was served in a mason jar. I am a dessert lover (as in I look at the dessert menu first) and this one goes down as one of my top-five favorites. It had a cinnamon sponge cake, similar to the flavor of a churro, with fresh strawberries and whip cream. It was the ideal ending to our meal.
