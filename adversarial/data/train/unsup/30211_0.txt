Came here a couple of weeks ago. This place had a trendy atmosphere (gray walls, red chandelier) and the service was quick. Also, I heard that the owner was the prior sommelier for Lotus of Siam and thus promises good wine pairings in the future once he obtains his liquor license. For the time being I appreciate that they allow you to bring your wine with no corkage. \n\nThe down side of this place was that the portion size for the price was rather small. I believe another person on Yelp stated japanese tapas size and I tend to agree.  The food was good, however, we ordered soup, appetizers and entree and they brought it out all at the same time.  However, that being said when we told the waiter they offered to have the entree dish re-fired.  \n\nWe had the oysters, an appetizer (I can't remember the name) that was similar to chicken lettuce wraps, the braised pork belly and Thom Ka Kai.  For three of us we spent $60 for dinner, with no drinks. We left full, not stuffed, but okay. \n\nOverall the food and atmosphere were good but for the price and quality I would rather go to Lotus of Siam.
