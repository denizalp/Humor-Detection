My husband and I went in last night (Friday) to give this place a try. We got there early enough to avoid a wait but it was already full. We were glad that we did not have to wait for a table. The atmosphere was great and they had live music, which we weren't expecting. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp Alfredo and my husband got the stuffed Poblano, which our server recommended. We also got the asparagus as an appetizer. Both of us were very happy with our dishes, the food took a little long but our server brought us bread and we had our appetizer to munch on. \n\nThe reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 is that we had to wait over 15 minutes for our drinks, which we ordered when our server greeted us. Our appetizer made it out before our drinks and by the time we got the drinks, we both were already frustrated with having to wait so long. I ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir and my husband got some type of margarita from the specialty drinks menu. We both normally get 2 drinks when we go out but we were only able to enjoy a few sips of our drink before our dinner made it out. The waitress was for very apologetic and explained that the bartender was backed up. However, as a table of two with pretty easy drinks, we both thought it was a long time to wait. It worried us both that our food was going to take even longer but the food came out in a timely matter (with the appetizer before the drinks!) \n\nOverall, we both decided we would still go back again because we did enjoy the atmosphere and the food was delicious, just most likely would not be getting drinks.
