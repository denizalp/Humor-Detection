I took my 9 yr old daughter to lunch- I was happy to see new sandwhiches added to the menu-- hostess pointed out kiosk on table - my 9 yr old immediatly scans it and checks out the kids games link -said to me O it says 1.99 I tell her O don't touch- we ignore - of course bill comes there is $1.99 charge snuck on there- waitress seems annoyed I asked for it to b removed- beware of these table side kiosks it's a rip off scam and it's completely redicioulous- food was  good- server was ok-
