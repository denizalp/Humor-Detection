One of the best dim sum I have ever had! \n\nThis is my third time here, unfortunately, they did not have any specials anymore, but I'm glad I came, because the dim sum is THAT great. Coming in at 9:30am, we thought that seats will be taken already, but we were one of the earliest ones there. \n\nPrices are: \nS- $2.90\nSM- $3.50\nM- $3.95\nL - $4.95\nXL-$5.75\nSP- $6.99\n\nFood:\n11) Steamed Pork Wrapped Bean Curd in Soup\nDelicious rolls. The bean curd was soft and soaked with delicious soup. There were three rolls in here, a little smaller in size than other dim sum restaurants, but definitely great quality. I think I tasted a piece of pork skin in there as well.\n\n15) Steamed Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf\nThere were two medium to small sized sticky rices in here. I thought this dish was sort of average, but I didn't think it was very fattening, which is a bonus.\n \n18) Steam Shrimp Dumpling with Coriander and Chives\nThis was delicious. I can't believe the chef BLENDED the coriander and mixed it as the skin of the dumpling, making the colour of the dumpling green. The skin was not think and the filling was fairly full with DELICIOUS shrimps. This didn't taste very oily either. \n\n28) Steamed Vegetarian Rice Roll\nThis was delicious as well, I loved the greens that were added. They were young greens, not hard to chew. I do wish that the soya sauce was warmed up before this is served though. \n\n34) Baked Chicken Pie with Portuguese Sauce\nMY FAVOURITE dish. The chicken pie was delicious, not overbaked with cute fork lines on the top. The filling was my favourite park. This was FILLED with scrumptious and savoury Chinese styled Portuguese sauce. I was so surprised because the chicken pie wasn't very thick and yet this pie did not leak any sauce out.\n\n36) Deep Fried Pork Mashed Taro Puff\nThis was another one of their stuffed fillings. Absoloutely delighted to see fillings that are stuffed. It wasn't too oily, the taste is not too sweet or salty either, one of the more average dishes. \n\nHeard that this place is owned by the TVB star, Aimee Chan (陳茵媺).
