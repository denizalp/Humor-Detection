Thanks to fellow yelper, Daniel S., I found out about this Nathan's located in the food court of Aliante Hotel and Casino. On my first visit the employees were friendly, helpful and got my order to me in a fair amount of time. The second visit I was the only customer yet it took a frustratingly long time to get my order and there were 3 employees working that seemed to care more about talking to each other. The prices are not bad for being inside a casino and the food court area offers a good amount of seating. \n\nI've never been a huge fan of Nathan's hot dogs. The best one I ever had was surprisingly from the snack bar at the drive-in on Carey. The bun on the hot dog I had at this Aliante location was nice and soft, but I didn't care for the taste of the hot dog itself or the watery\/soupy chili. I could only eat a couple bites and was done. The chili was just not good and certainly not \"famous\" if you ask my tastebuds. One thing my tastebuds did like was the Crinkle-Cut Cheese Fries I've now had a couple times. The fries were perfectly crisp and there was a fair amount of liquid gold on top that not only tasted great, but didn't make the fries soggy at all. You can get a good sized portion of cheese fries for around $3 with tax and they have draft beer for $2 to complete your meal which is very reasonable given the location. They also currently have a promotion for a draft beer and hot dog for $5. I'll pass on the hot dogs in the future however will stop by at times for cheese fries.
