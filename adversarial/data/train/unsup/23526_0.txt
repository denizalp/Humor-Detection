At first this place has a lot of potential. Free peanuts and all, like an upscale five guys. But then the sauce on our order got mixed up. I ordered the sweet and zesty sauce to go with my burger, but that sauce ended up at another person's burger. Then the well sought after(though i have never tried until now) steak fries were soo salty i could not consume more than 2. The smokehouse burger was equally as salty. I love mushrooms but these sautee mushrooms were drenched in salt. Even the burger buns were salty. The meat on my burger lacks flavor. \n\nThe best part of the dish were the free rolls. Consume them right when they come out, if you wait, they are not as good. Sweet soft and buttery.\n\nMajor stomach ache and food poisoning the night after my meal. Oh gosh, never again. Was it because I had my burger medium? But why present it as an option if it would not be safe to consume? I was sick for 1.5 weeks. Never have I had such a bad food poisoning experience. That night my stomach started to cramp, then I could not hold any food or liquid down the next morning. I had fever and chills and diarrhea.
