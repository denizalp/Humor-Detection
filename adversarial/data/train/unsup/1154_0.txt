They have most of the basics re: Apple products, but the most lackluster employees I've seen in a long time.  The guy who \"helped\" us seemed so massively distracted by the phone call another employee was making (I think via skype) on an iPod touch, that he literally didn't hear us asking questions right next to him.  It was very weird.  His attention span lasted for about 40 seconds max. \n\nThen again, I'm used to LA, where most (if not all) sales associates are wannabe actors.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by their unnaturally sunny disposition and extra-attentiveness.
