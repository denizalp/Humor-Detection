We were guests there once in about 2003 for one of the morning services.  We are used to megachurches with lots of praise and worship and messages where many Bible passages are referred to and explained with practical, applicable and content-rich teaching and even some humor.  We are used to churches that are ALIVE.  I felt like I was at someone's funeral.  I didn't feel the Holy Spirit there at all.  In fact, I felt really strange like I couldn't wait to leave not only the church but the grounds.  The greeters smiled a lot; I'm sure some of them weren't fake.
