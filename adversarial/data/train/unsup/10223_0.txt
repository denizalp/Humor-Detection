I went there for dinner and had a very bad experience. First this place is expensive compared to other good Indian restaurants in the valley. Second this is another Indian restaurant which don't have the real south Indian flavors or food varieties other than dosa's and vada, there is nothing special. Third - Bad service, we waited for almost an hour to get the food. And some of items which we ordered were not delivered. Just one person handling the entire crowd so we ended up getting wrong food items. Fourth - They don't have enough space for big groups, unfortunately we were a big group and ended up sitting in two different set of tables. Fifth and final is food, very regular food. Spicy Andhra chicken gravy was not at all spicy and it was like butter chicken and for the first time I saw a chicken 65  with full of bones guess it should be named as Bone 65 :P.  Gopi Manchurian was even worse were it was simply a fried cauliflower with ketchup coating. And please never order a Lamb biryani it was uncooked and not edible. And lot more including the chlorinated water .....\n\nGood things - Ambiance, Lassi, Frice, Dosa
