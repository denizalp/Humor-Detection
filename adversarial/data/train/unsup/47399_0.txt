I was pretty disappointed tonight when my wife and I went and ordered our food, sat down for 20 minutes and then for them to grab our number and say that they ran out of food and to come back to the front to get something else. After waiting back in line to determine what to get, it was frustrating so we got a full refund. It took another 10 minutes to get a refund and a few others starting to line up for not having food for the orders purchased.
