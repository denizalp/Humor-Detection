Stepps is my go-to shoe store here in Toronto. No matter whether I'm looking for a sexy new pair of boots, or a comfortable pair of flats, I head to Stepps.\n\nWith constant promotions such as the one they have on now - buy one, get one free - it's not uncommon to walk out of this store having bought 2 beautiful pairs of new boots for around $100. Score!\n\nThey carry women and men's shoes alike and although the store is tiny, they are staffed well enough so that you can always find someone to help you with sizing.\n\nThey are about to undergo renovations and are having a special renovation sale in which 'Everything Must Go.' \n\nIf you've been putting off buying new shoes for spring, NOW is the time to get 'em. They're disappearing quickly, so be sure to get there sooner rather than later.
