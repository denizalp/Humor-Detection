There was a recent 60% off for 100 hand picked Lindt chocolate truffles ($30 for 100 was the stated sale) so I decided to drop by this store again since I really enjoy Lindt chocolates. Normally I will buy a box of 150 which is advertised as \"55% off\" but this is the amount off their already inflated prices when you compare the price to what you can get for the same chocolates at a pharmacy or a store like Walmart\/Costco. The only difference being that you get to pick your own variety at the Lindt store.\n\nUpon entering the store, I was given a Lindt truffle to try. The store was very crowded\/busy as there were a lot of people at the chocolate truffle bins due to the 60% off sale. I asked about the 60% off sale since I saw a card next to the bin which indicated that it was 50% off for 100 and 55% off for 150 and was told that I would be given a special bag to fill up.\n\nI started to count the truffles as I put them in the bag but the lady told me that I just need to fill it to the top while still enabling the bag to be closed with the tie wraps which were part of the bag. I filled up the bag with the Lindt truffle varieties that I liked and then paid for it. The lady weighed the bag and then informed me that it was $30+taxes. Unlike during my last visit, I didn't see\/notice the weight on the scale this time. I paid with my credit card and got my bill. Looking at the bill, I saw that the price was actually over $30 ($38.99) and they deducted $8.99 from the bill giving a grand total of $34.49 after taxes ($1.50 GST and $2.99 PST).\n\nWhen I got back to work, I counted the truffles that I had in my bag and I had a bit more than 100.\n\nThe thing that I don't like about the Lindt stores is that they overcharge on their chocolate truffles in their bulk bins for the luxury of being able to pick which truffles you want but I believe that this is the same as any chocolate store that also sells their product in retail stores (like the M&Ms store in Las Vegas or the Hershey's store in Las Vegas). I also don't like that they advertise their truffle sales by the piece but consumers actually pay by the weight.
