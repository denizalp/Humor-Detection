My first colonic.  I had researched colonics at length, but I still wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  The first place I went to, I arrived and filled out the forms.  I asked her if I could use the restroom prior to the colonic (as I had to pee) she told me that I could just go in the room.  I was a little horrified, but told her that I'd prefer to use the bathroom if it was alright with her.  After, she led me into a room and I was to get naked from the waist down, and straddle the machine and put a sheet over myself. She came back in and showed me how to insert the \"pencil thin tube\" and turned on the water.  She handed me a hand massager and placed a heat pack on my belly.  Turned on Sex in the City for me and off she went.  She checked on me a few times while I was in session.  \n\n\nColonics are not for the faint of heart.  I think they are pretty awful, but I appreciate that they can be very helpful especially in my situation (Candida).  It seems important to let as much water go through as possible (holding on tight) and then letting go once it starts to hurt, or you just can't hold on any longer.  The place was clean and organized, and they seem to have a lot of services.  \n\n\nI did like the fact that you can watch TV while doing your colonic, makes the time go by faster.
