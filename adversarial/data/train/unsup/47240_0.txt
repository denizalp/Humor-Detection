When I first started going here I thought it was great. It was excellent quality and my food was always awesome. Lately every time I go and order everything is just Meh (super average\/basic) The meat quality is on the same level as Robertos and it lacks flavor. The new corn tortillas are dry and pretty much disgusting. The last time I ordered the carnitas the meat was dry and pretty gross. Personally I don't like thr Al Pastor or thr chicken here but that's just my opinion and the shrimp doesn't taste fresh. The prices keep going up yet the quality is going down. The breakfast burrtito was flavorless and really needed salt. The rolled tacos are still amazing. Now on to the customer service. The owner is quite frankly rude. At first his over talkative ways were funny but he talks ENTIRELY to much. He's rude and disrespectful to other businesses. He makes rude comments and his jokes are borderline racist. He doesn't know how to run a business. He makes you not want to go in and wait because you know it's going to take FOREVER and you have to listen to him tell the same tired ass jokes and bash the same places over and over again. Sigh....get new material please. 6 months ago this would've been a 5 star review. Now I'm only giving 2 because there's still a few redeeming qualities
