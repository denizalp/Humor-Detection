this review is based on a weekday afternoon at the tao beach.\n\nthe bf flew in to meet me in vegas today since i'm here for the week for work. i had some down time so we decided to hit the pool and check out this tao beach. it's a wed around 1pm and we heard that it's definitely a more \"chill\" scene during the weekday than the weekend. \n\ntao beach has its own entry way and you need to be 21 and over. apparently they also have their own towels so don't bother picking up any from the other pool areas.\n\noverall i liked the decor and setup but i think they need more umbrellas otherwise it's just too damn hot. speaking of hot, the waitresses are all very attractive but the service could use some serious improvement. we waited at least 20 minutes before we could flag down our hostess. then we waited another 20 min to get our drinks. i think i was about to melt by the time we got our booze. i did enjoy the tao-hito (their version of the mojito) and the spicy tuna on crispy rice (not quite as good as katsuya). \n\nalso i wasn't too fond of the loud music playing in the background. or maybe it was the competing noise from the construction next door.\n\nanyways after we finished our drinks and food, we headed over to the other Venetian pool. defiinitely check out the shallow pool with lounge chairs. it's awesome! there,  we ran into my other co-worker and she said it best:  \"tao beach attracts meatheads, douchebags and euro trash.\" yeah she's right, it's definitely an interesting scene on a random weekday afternoon.
