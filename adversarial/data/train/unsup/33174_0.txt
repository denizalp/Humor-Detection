The line was a little outraegeous. More an an hour or so. Food was decent. Huge selection: sushi, barbeque, american, dessert, chinese, soups, salads, etc etc\nThe server took about 12 mins to bring drinks and there were dozens of empty tables despite the hour long line. Def frustrating. \nI've had better in Vegas, for sure.
