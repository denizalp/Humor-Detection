Spoke with the manager don and I was amazed to find how honest he was about the repairs that I needed done. I had gotten several opinions from other places regarding the issue I was having with my steering wheel shaking while applying the brakes and all of them came up with the conclusion that I needed new rotors and brake pads for the front two wheels. All of the other places quoted me with prices that I knew were to high for the labor that needed to be done so I decided to take a chance here. Don had them check out my car first to determine if I even needed new rotors and he found that the brake pads and rotors were fine. So he told me to go return them and that the issue was with my inner wheel. He fixed the problem and now my car is back to normal. His price for this was also very reasonable! I will be taking my car back to get my a\/c looked at. I highly recommend this place!
