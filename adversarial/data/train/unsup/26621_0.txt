The room we got was pretty clean and nice. Also it looked like it was one of the recently renovated rooms. The service here is friendly and they also give you free complimentary bottled water in the room which is a rarity these days. \n\nThey also offer complimentary breakfast and it was pretty good. Considering I only paid $60 for all of this, this is not a bad deal at all. I hiked the camelback mountain and wanted a hotel in the area which was budget friendly.\n\nThis hotel met all of my expectations and the drive to the trail was only like 15 minutes from there. Also they let you checkout at 12 instead of the usual 11PM. This gave us ample time to hike camelback come back and shower. The only thing which I didn't like was the housekeeping was in my room getting it ready for other people even though we never checked out at 11. Again we never had a do no disturb sign on the door, other than that our stay here was fantastic.
