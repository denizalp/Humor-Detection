I've been to steakhouses from NY to LA and from Vegas to Boston and back again and this restaurant gets a top ten ranking. In general the crowd is a bunch of pretentious pricks, which I'm not crazy about, but the food here is impeccable! It has an awesome wine list and great service. Consistency of preparation with fresh ingredients are what has made Morton's one of my favorite places in The Valley. The food there was prepared exactly as I had ordered it, and the wait staff is most accommodating. The bar scene is your average young, scantily-clad women with the older men wearing jeans and trying to look relevant. All in all Morton's is a safe bet.
