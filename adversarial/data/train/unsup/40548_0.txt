Everything about my experience with carpet monkeys was EXCEPTIONAL!!! I requested a quote and within 20 mins I had a response, 5 minutes later I had a NEXT DAY appointment confirmed.  They gave me a 4pm-6pm window. Called a little after 4pm and said they'd be arriving in 20 mins. None of this wait all day and show up at the last minute. The guys who cleaned the carpets were so friendly, asked about each area of the house to confirm which rooms I wanted serviced, and got things done so quickly. My carpets look amazing and the price was beyond reasonable. These guys are awesome and I would definitely recommend them to anyone and everyone. I know I'll definitely be calling them up for my next deep clean!
