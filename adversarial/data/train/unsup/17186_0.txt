This was my first time eating at this location in the Old City, I had previously eaten at their downtown location several years back so I new what to expect, or did I? For a starter I ordered escargot stuffed mushroom caps with garlic herb butter which I have had in countless locations but nothing like this, the mushrooms and snails worked perfectly together and the garlic butter herbs was more of a rich emulsion, thick, decadent and a flavor that will have you swooning. My Salad was mixed field greens, garden vegetables with a vinaigrette and I asked for goat cheese and walnuts. The dressing didn't have quite enough vinegar for me but I had a lemon wedge from my water which took care of that, still and all, it was a wonderful fresh nicely presented green salad. The Keg is known for it's Canadian beef, especially It's Baseball Cut Top Sirloin which I had not had before, so I ordered it cooked rare with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. This cut of meat is so thick it can only be guaranteed rare or a medium rare without burning the out side, so don't try to order it any other way. It was cooked to a perfect rare with all the tenderness of a Filet Mignon and the wonderful intense beefy flavor of a sirloin. The garlic mashed potatoes were perfect along with the green beans. This was a very good steak dinner and the escargot...well you will have to go and see for yourself because words are woefully inadequate to describe this rich garlicky buttery herb flavored delightful escargot preparation!!!
