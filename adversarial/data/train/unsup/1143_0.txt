I don't drink often enough to be a regular at any bar, but Inn Zone feels like it could be that kind of place for me. The staff are friendly without being obtrusive, there are tons of tvs and a couple of pool tables, and lots of space to sit around the bar or away in a corner. The drink specials are decent, the atmosphere is lively during a game, and there's even a restaurant in the corner- which is what first brought me in. They must open the doors to air it out pretty regularly, as it wasn't too smoky. Proximity to work will likely bring me back.
