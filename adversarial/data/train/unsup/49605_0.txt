Tried this place for the first time with just a take-out order. The server was incredibly kind and pleasant. \n\nI ordered the red Topoki in *extra spicy*, not even thinking twice about the heat level. HOLY CRAP: extra spicy here is REALLY FREAKIN' SPICY, to the point where I could only eat a little bit of the meal, then had to chug an entire bottle of water before I could attempt a bit more food. \"Extra spicy\" at Go Topoki is HARD CORE! But despite my apparent wimpy-ness with the heat level, the dish was really good, and I look forward to going back and trying it again -- with muuuuuch less spice ;) \n\nNice touch: plastic utensils are neatly wrapped in a cute serviette 'pocket'.
