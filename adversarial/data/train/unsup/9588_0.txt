We were browsing the food truck line up at First Friday's on May 2, 2014 and there were so many trucks I didn't know where to begin! We didn't have any cash and luckily this cute little Filipino food truck accepted credit cards. We are so glad this was our first stop, since it was the best truck that we tried of the entire night. \n\nThe BBQ pork belly sandwich sounded like it was right up our ally. The sandwich looked simple and there wasn't anything else inside the sandwich except for pork belly, but it was love at first bite! It was packed with delicious flavor - salty, sweet, really moist and tender like butta! It was satisfying and addicting. I enjoyed it! If sandwiches aren't your thing, you can totally get it on top of rice as well. \n\nWe've also tried their lumpia which are Filipino egg-rolls filled with savory meat. They were bite sized and absolutely addicting! Hot, crispy and filled with bold comforting flavor. They also came with a tasty sweet and sour sauce to dip them in.\n\nI would love to try their other offerings, their menu isn't big at all - probably 5 items at most.\n\nThe service here is like family! Oming (the chef) and Naz (runs the front) are super genuine and awesome foodies as well! We loved chatting it up with them about great local food finds and about where we've eaten since we moved to Vegas. Their passion of food shines through in their delectable bites that they offer on their truck! I even overheard customers eating in front of the truck saying their chicken adobo is crazy tender and flavorful. Definitely come check them out!
