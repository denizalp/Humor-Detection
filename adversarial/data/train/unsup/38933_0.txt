DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY...They were scheduled to come out on 4-22-2017 and they canceled stating the windshield was distorted and since the factory was closed they would have to reschedule me to 4-29-2017 (appt was canceled by a man named Frank)  and then on 4-29-2017 they didn't show up. My confirmed time was from 1-5pm and within that timeframe I called the office 3 times trying to get an ETA....I was told the technician was Tito and they would have him call me, he never called. The girl at the office named Lexi stated she had sent numerous messages out to a manager and no one would call her back.  Horrible customer service
