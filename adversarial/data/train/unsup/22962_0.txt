Not that I have ridiculously high expectations for a laundry mat but I do expect:\n\n1. The laundry mat not to totally WREAK of pot every other time I do my laundry (I'm trying to get that smell OUT of my clothes, not put it IN my clothes...jk)\n\n2. To feel safe there doing laundry at night.  There should be an attendant at least part time.  This economy needs jobs and here's a perfect opportunity!\n\n3. Most importantly, that my clothes actually get clean.  I pay a fair amount of money here to use the washers and dryers (especially the washers) and usually my stuff is only half-clean when I take it out (using the correct amount of soap and everything).  Damn!\n\nDamn you Parktowne! I wish I had laundry in my building.
