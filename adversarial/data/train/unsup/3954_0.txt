I have dined here a few times throughout the years. They have always had excellent to good service here.  The manager even came by to ask if we are doing OK and needed anything when we visited a few times during my visits which I thought was a nice surprise at an Asian restaurant. They are fast here too and there isn't a wait if you come here early.\n\nThe dim sum selections are decent. I think Ping Pang Pong's dim sum tastes better but they are quick and nice here and it's closer to me.
