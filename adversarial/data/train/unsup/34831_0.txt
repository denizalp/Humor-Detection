IMO, one of the best pho I've had in Las Vegas. Maybe it tasted better because I wasn't too busy being pissed off at shitty service I usually get at the other more popular pho restaurants?\n\nMy last time here was a LONG time ago, and I've been waiting to be around the area to go again. Tonight, I noticed they redesigned their menus and made some other changes to the decor. It looks nicer than last time.\n\nThe boyfriend and I normally get #28 the Special Rice Combo which comes with rice (duh), grilled pork, grilled shrimp and 2 fried eggrolls. Has a small side of vegetables (pickled carrots and daikon radish on top of lettuce, and tomatoes and cucumbers). I'm in love with pork and theirs is scrumptious. But their grilled shrimp is pretty amazing also... one of the best shrimp I've ever had AND THEY DE-VEIN THE SHRIMP! All this for $9.50!! And they make the shrimp look pretty... If that matters to you...\n\nWe also got the spring rolls.. they could use a little more \"umph\" since there was only like one slice of meat in it but their peanut sauce is good.\n\nI told my boyfriend I don't think I want to go to any other Vietnamese restaurant other than here from now on. He HATES pho (yeah i know, who hates pho?!) but he took a small bite of mine and liked it so that means something, right?\n\nAlso idk about during the normal lunch\/dinner hours because we normally come here around 9:30pm but we've never had to wait to be seated and they have pretty good customer service. Not extraordinary service or anything but they check in often, take our orders in a timely manner, refill drinks, etc. which is way more than what you're going to get at places like Pho Kim Long or Pho So 1.
