I've been taking my 6 month old here for a couple months and although he's still very young, Vanessa, our instructor is always so positive and encouraging.  She's amazing with the children she works with and really pays attention to detail when she gives us our feedback at the end of each class.  The facility is clean and the employees at the front desk are always helpful and willing to answer questions.
