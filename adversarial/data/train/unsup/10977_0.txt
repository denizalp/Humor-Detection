So this is what's considered \"alternative\" these days? Nu-metal, big-label punk, and a little bit of reggae mixed with loads of grunge, Guns N Roses, and Metallica?\n\nMan, I can remember when you couldn't get Metallica on the radio. Then it was just stuff from the s\/t  \"black\" album. \"One\" from ...And Justice For All was a special favor. \n\nCould they find a more obnoxious, slovenly host than Mark Madden, whose sports insight (as if we really need that much insight into pro sports) consists of him namedropping and imitating pro wrestlers while insulting his callers, most of whom must hate themselves? I've heard better post-game analysis from cab drivers.\n\nIf I didn't have to listen to this talking sack of lard at work everyday, I might be a happier person. \n\nSpeaking of pro wrestling, didn't he tank as a heel announcer when he worked for WCW? I mean, Bobby Heenan and Jesse Ventura were actually funny and were only pretending to be jerks. Madden just makes you wish he had another heart attack because he really is a rich, miserable jerk sans an ounce of true humor or wit. \n\nPoor Abby Krizner. She likes Arch Enemy, Lamb of God, and is obviously a true metal fan and musician (she plays in the Motorpsychos), yet has to play such garbage from bands like Drowning Pool, Paramore, and Three Days Grace. She also has to produce misogynist Madden's show.\n\nYes he hates women, unless they work in the sex trade of course. Listen to him talk about which female celebrities he wants to \"degrade,\" his adventures at various strip clubs, and his defense of Dubbya-as-an-NFL-QB Ben Rapistberger. The only women he ever has on his show are porn stars. \n\nWhen you're as offensive and embarassing to the city as Madden is, what other way is there to get hot chicks to sit on your lap but to throw money at them?\n\nI also couldn't give a damn if we like the same bands, UFO included. \n\nThere must be a lot of douchebag middle-class white guys out there who eat Madden's stuff up. It's kind of sad really, especially when there are truly thoughtful sports pundits out there like Dave Zirin who deserve a wider audience. \n\nThe rest of the X's hosts kind of blend together as does the music they play. Breakdowns, hip-hop beats, suburban kids screaming about breaking stuff and why their parents suck. There are few if any guitar solos and a poverty of interesting riffs, choruses, lyrics...ugh.\n\nRadio is dying. Clear Channel holds the smoking gun.\n\nOh well, when I go home, I can listen to what I want, making my musical tastes all the more special to me.
