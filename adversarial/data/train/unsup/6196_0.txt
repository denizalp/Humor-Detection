I just remembered that I ate here. I had a breakfast pastie which was sort of the breakfast equivalent of a calzone. Mine had I think egg, cheese, tomato, and sausage.The shop is probably only large enough to cater to 2 or 3 customers at a time, standing room only. Above the shop in the window is a drumset, presumably Myles Teddywedger gets up there and pulls some serious Shelia E type shit. Did he die? Someone here says he died? Oh god. He died?! \nhttp:\/\/host.madison.com\/wsj\/news\/local\/article_b7363ca4-e78c-11de-8a3a-001cc4c002e0.html\n\n ;_;
