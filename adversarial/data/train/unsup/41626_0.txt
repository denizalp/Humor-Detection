We stayed at the Venetian again this time and everything went by wonderfully, this time around. Everyone was super friendly and all our questions and tiny requests were answered promptly.\n\nWe stayed in the Venezia tower, which is 10 floors up. It is slightly inconvenient since we need to go through the elevators twice to get to our room. On the plus side, the Venezia tower lobby had a much shorter line when checking out. Noelani even printed out our southwest boarding passes for us. That saved us the inconvenience of having us check in at the airport. \n\nTwo cons - they knock on the door to check if you got your chocolates. There's another time they knocked for some odd reason and woke me up in the morning. I think someone stole our privacy sign.  I was oh so tired and cranky.\n\nA few pluses. They honored the $40 off per seat on our Phantom tickets since it was a promotion for staying at the hotel. We booked the seats after we booked the hotel but didn't get a promotion code back then. Everyone was super friendly. The security guy by the hotel elevators are all very nice. When I was rushing back from the pedicure at canyon spa for dinner at Tao, my flimsy spa slippers broke and I was walking barefoot, as not to mess up my pedicure and he told me to watch out for fallen glasses. Everything was well communicated and just overall pleasant. Getting a taxi was never easier. Doors are always opened. Questions always answered and when they forgot to print coupons for the offer that came with the room, they did that as well. \n\nVenetian was one part of our trip that went right. (Though maybe they could try influencing Tao to stuff fewer people in their night club)
