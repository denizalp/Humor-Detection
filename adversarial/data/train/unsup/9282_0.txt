Unfortunately didn't have a great experience. At first, we were impressed by some of the decor, and all the sauces were delicious. However, came here for drinks on a Saturday after a bike ride. Got there a half hour after it opened and it was already pretty busy. We stood at the standing table and pulled chairs up, however got yelled at because chairs aren't allowed at that table. We ordered the bumble fuzz cocktail and it was so sugar and tangy, tasted like dish soap. We asked for the check and told the waitress our thought on the drink... we couldn't even drink half of it! Her response was \"if the drinks suck, at least the food is good\" and didn't do anything to rectify the situation, despite sending the drinks back all over halfway full. She still made us pay full price for the drinks and we just felt that as a new restaurant they should've tried to make our experience better. We won't be back again.
