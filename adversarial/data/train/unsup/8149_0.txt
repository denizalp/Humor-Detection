I purchased a Buytopia voucher for $29 for a shellac mani-pedi, and it expired February 1st, 2015. I don't know how I missed this, but you cannot use the voucher for the value you paid for with Buytopia, nevertheless, Buytopia suggested that I contact the salon and ask if they could honor the voucher or allow me to use $29 towards a regular priced service. I contacted the salon, and to be honest, I did not expect them to say no because I have never had a business decline either one of these 2 suggestions. Well, I was wrong. The business said no to both my suggestions, though they offered 20% off a service because I am a new customer. \n\nWhat?! \n\na) their regular prices are on the higher end, and no guarantee that they are any good\nb) why the hell would I want to bring you business when you are 1) using Buytopia and no one has bothered to review their experience; 2) and you would not honor a very reasonable request?!\n\nSo the lessons I learned: \n\nNEVER buy from Buytopia again (at least Groupon lets you use the value you paid when the groupon expires)\n\nDon't give business to a vendor that will not accommodate a reasonable request - you already got $29 from me!
