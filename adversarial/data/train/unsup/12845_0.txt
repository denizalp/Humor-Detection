We came here last Sunday to see one of my favorites, Tiesto! As with most clubs in Vegas, I think your experience is all about how you make it. We were told by our promoter to get there at 1- we got there at 12:30. We knew no liquids\/gels\/etc., were allowed in- we made sure not to bring any (seriously people, they even checked under the sew line of my friend's hat). This meant applying a ton of SPF right before you head to the MGM and pre-gaming enough so you can keep the buzz going. It's like a science Lol. We knew it was an elite day club- we wore cute swim gear\/cover ups, etc. \n\nFast forward about an hour, I am starting to feel thirsty, so we head to the bar. It was $41 for a drink! I know Vegas is expensive, but instead I just offered $20 to have a drink from a bottle service table. Here is why Vegas is my favorite: the guys at the table refused my money, poured me a strong goose cocktail, and let us stay there for the whole afternoon! Their table was about 10 feet from Tiesto, in the shade!! Maybe we just got lucky, but it was just an epic day. The crowd was hot, rowdy, and just FUN. The drinks were GOOD. The music was the BEST. \n\nI high-fived Tiesto!! Lil Jon was in the bottle service table in front of us and let us snap a pic with him!! ONLY IN LAS VEGAS!
