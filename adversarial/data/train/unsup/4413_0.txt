How is this place even still in business??\n\nThere are girls in huge head dresses posted outside for photo ops to lure people in. They girls are either super old or not very attractive. They also have signs posted at the entrance for deep fried diabetes (Oreos and Twinkies). They don't even allow kids inside. So if your kid wants some deep fried crap, better leave them outside with all the weirdos and get it yourself. \n\nUpon entering, it's super small. The machines still use nickels that you have to go enchanted back at the cashier. The bar is cash only. The employees look like they hate their jobs. And guess what. They close at 1 am! Isn't that crazy?! In the whole Freemont experience, there's a place that even closes at 1?? And drinks are pricey here. I can go across the way to the Golden Nugget and get a better drink for less money. \n\nNow I know why this place sucks.
