This branch opened not too long ago, multiple locations already in Toronto. Since they're fairly new, they're quite understaffed. However, food quality is still great. I had the cheese booldak and cold buckwheat noodles, both very delicious and with fair prices. Friends have told me the regular korean bbq is quite good as well.
