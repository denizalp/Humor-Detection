Stopped in for a gel fill in and a pedicure.  The service was attentive, fairly quick and the three nail technicians that worked on me were friendly.  \n\nOverall satisfied with the quality of their work, but I wish I went for a no chip manicure instead of regular polish. My nail polish began to chip same day, but it doesn't matter that much to me to go back and ask for them to fix it. \n\nThe prices are reasonable and the location is convenient,  I will definitely be back to try a no chip gel manicure.
