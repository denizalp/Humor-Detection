I had just concluded my tour of the pleasant little Monet Exhibit within the Bellagio Gallery. After you leave the Gallery, they funnel you past a tiny sales area and then deliberately into the Jeff Mitchum Gallery. What a lucky opportunity!\n\nThe Jeff Mitchum Gallery features a stunning and diverse collection of fine art photography of nature and dramatic landscape from around the world. Some have referred to him as the Ansel Adams of color. He also has his own line of eco-furniture that I relaxed in as I happily paged through his Seasons of Light (Volume II). At at $175 it's most probably worth every penny.
