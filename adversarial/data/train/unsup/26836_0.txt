Ravi Soups was FANTASTIC!! My wife and I each ordered a soup and wrap combo and both loved them! I had the butternut squash soup, which was amazing!! The grilled flank steak wrap was very good. Like I think they put crack in it. I hope Rob Ford was not in the kitchen. Ravi's tasty offerings left me wanting more and I was stuffed! My wife had the corn chowder, which she raved about. She had a chicken wrap which she also loved. I hope to get back to Toronto and we'll sure stop back at Ravi Soups if we do. Very much enjoyed this little gem! Go eat out back on the patio. It's lovely. The service was very nice too!
