From 5\/13\/15 \nThe Palms is located on West Flamingo and is an off the Vegas Strip Hotel and Casino. Even though, the Palms isn't on South Las Vegas BLVD; it's not far, you can literally see it from the hotel.  It's so close you could walk over to The Strip, or if need be, take a quick taxi over there.  Once, you get inside you have a decent size casino floor to come around. There are restaurants, bars, lounges, a food court, and a movie theater. Also, they have a psychic who does readings here, who knows next time I come back I might get one.
