Went on a Tuesday night. The cashier was pretty friendly. The style was build-your-own burger.\n\nI ordered a Little Bacon Cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, and pickles. My friend order a Little Bacon burger and we shared a regular cajun french fries.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 on freshness of produce I'd say it was a 5. The veggies were a little sad.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10 on the meat quality I'd sad they were a 4. The meat didn't have much flavor and there was barely any bacon on my burger.\n\nThe fries had amazing flavor but were a little soggy. I went up to ask for ranch and the guy said, \"No,\" and gave me an annoyed and irritated look. That's cool!\n\nThis place is okay. If anything it just satisfied my hunger and that's it. Lol
