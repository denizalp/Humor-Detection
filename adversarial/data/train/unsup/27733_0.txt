I have to agree with Patricia. I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and 2 days. It was bad... very old school. We always woke up with the noise of people and kids running thru the hall ways. The bathroom was very small and the shower didn't have any water pressure. The curtains are always open. The pool said it was open till 10pm but they closed at 6pm the whole time we were there. Free wifi only in the lobby and starbucks. The fridge did not kept drinks cold. the old school tv was the worst thing. I went to the lobby to ask why didn't my room looked like the pictures they had online, and there response was that only one row got remodel. I did feel the holes in the floor that were covered by carpet. I will never satay there again. People go to Vegas to have fun and the luxury of food and nice places to stay, This place is far from that. The only pro is that is located right next to the freeway.
