Our first time visiting, have been wanting to try them since they opened. We went in for lunch around the holidays. It was pretty dead, so we got great service. We got the buy two rolls get the third free (In and Out Roll, Winter Roll and Crunch Shrimp Roll) and an order of Jalapeno Tuna Poppers (not sure what they call them). Everything was really good. I can't wait to go back and try some more.\nPrices on par with most for a Special Sushi Roll.
