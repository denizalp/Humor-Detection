I totally recommend Scottsdale Muffler right on the Scottsdale\/Tempe border.  As a female who has been mistreated and ripped off from many auto places (and dishonest mechanics) over the years, Scottdale Muffler is a very welcome relief.\n\nIt is run by two brothers, Chris and Fred.  Crazy auto racers after work hours, but extremely nice, honest guys who will do right by you.  I've been to them many times, I tell people about them and now want to get the word out to all.
