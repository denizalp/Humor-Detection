Like rapper Ice-T says \"Don't hate the playa, hate the game.\"\n\nWell that eloquence pretty much sums up my feeling on Caffe Boa and their dynamite happy hour deals.\n\nIt's a great day when you can meet up with friends after work on Mill and load up on delectable appetizers, $2 pints and $3.50 glasses of bubbly cava without dodging frat guy chodes and chodettes.  Five of us gathered here the other day well before their 7 pm HH last call and made a meal out of it.  Final bill?  $12 each.  The appetizers here are delicious and well presented.  I'm a fan Boa's mix of Italian, Slavic and other influences.  It's a well done fusion that you don't find often here in Phoenix.  \n\nThe Shrimp Adriatico appetizer is my favorite and was the crowd favorite at the table.  The wine tomato garlic reduction it comes in is so addictive and sometimes forces you ask for more bread to nosh on.  We also ordered the caprese platter, bruschetta and salsiccia -- sliced sausage in a zesty red tomato mushroom kalamata ragout.  \n\nMy five stars are for their happy hour.  As a victim of their own success, making it on time and with a seat at Caffe Boa's happy hour requires some good organization, leaving work early and\/or both.  Beyond the happy hour I find hearsay on dinner to be a toss-up, however, I've never done it so I can't say.
