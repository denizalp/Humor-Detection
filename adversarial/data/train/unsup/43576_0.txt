I've been here before and it wasn't that great. But this time when I went, I didn't even step outside to freeze to death like last time due to there being too many people - but my experience here this time was phenomenal!\n\nWe found our way here after chilling at Marquee for a couple hours. We decided to bounce and check out Surrender since the crowd at Marquee was getting a little boring due to the average age of the crowd being around 30 (at least that's what it seemed). Luckily that night's theme at the club with Aoki's House which featured Steve Aoki as the DJ. Score!\n\nSteve Aoki is such an intense and interacting DJ, I lovedd it. \nCrowd was definitely better here - however it is a smaller club and I felt like the VIP\/bottle service area was a little too crowded for comfort. But all in all, Surrender made it a good way to end the night.
