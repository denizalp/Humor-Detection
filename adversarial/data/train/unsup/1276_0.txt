Ever since watching my first Rick Sebak tape, I've made attempts to develop myself into the ultimate Pittsburgh tour guide--not for KDKA, but rather for my friends and family members that came to visit the city. Casually known to my visitors as a place of despair, consistently lame weather, and awful sports fans, I take pride in hearing the variations of \"Holy wow, I never realized Pittsburgh was so awesome\" at the end of visits.\n\nAnd so, in my quest to spot out everything worth it in Pittsburgh, I stumble in to Tootie's on a Saturday afternoon. Greeted by the owner, he initiates friendly conversation before telling us that this is his mother's beef recipe straight from Chicago. I go ahead and order the smallest option, not expecting too much.\n\nBiting into the sandwich was kind of like that part in the Wizard of Oz where all of a sudden everything bursts into vibrant color. Notice that the menu has one option: beef sandwich. Yeah, you can get a sausage, but that's just a small filler on the bottom of the delicious beef sandwich. If you really want (and I am wont to really want), you can add provolone, green pepper, onions, or even marinara sauce (they call it the Benny, named for the guy who runs the Rex and goes wild for the combination of marinara\/onion\/green pepper). \n\nTootie's is the perfect addition to my Pittsburgh tour. Convenient location, open late, friendly atmosphere, and unbelievable sandwich. Ask for it dipped. You're welcome.
