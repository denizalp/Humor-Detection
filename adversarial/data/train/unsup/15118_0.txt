Not my first choice\n\nFull Service Autowash prices are very competitive. However,  I have to be honest, on more then one occasion I have been more then disappointed with the quality of the wash I received. Usually, after my wash, my vehicle has streaks on the windows, side mirrors are really ever cleaned, and tire dressing isn't noticeable. If you ask one of the staff to reclean the areas, they do so without hesitation. It's just frustrating to have to ask to have noticeable areas re-cleaned. This carwash is not my first choice but I guess it will do in a pinch.
