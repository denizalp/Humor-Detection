It's 2:00 pm in Las Vegas. We are sitting at Corcoran's with about 2 hours to go before our flight is scheduled to depart. We find the last seat in the tiny bar area. \n\nWe sit down and take a look at the menu. Aside from the usual domestic suspects, draft beer selection is Guinness, Harp or Stella. After waiting for a long time I realized that despite menus on the table they must not have table service. \n\nI went to the bar and ordered a Sauvignon Blanc and a large Guinness. The good news is both were very good. Bad news is this set me back $25 plus tip. \n\nThe man behind the bar seemed angry. Was he angry that the owners required him to charge outrageous prices?  Was he angry because the floors needed to be cleaned?  Was he angry because he had a lousy gambling streak last night? We will never know. \n\nSo, based on price and overall feel, I will choose another airport bar over this one. \n\nUnless this is my only choice, no thank you.
