Brew Tea Bar, beloved by most Yelpers and many of our local social media influencers. Just look at their collection of positive reviews over the few short years. And the regular IG postings of Ninser_the_foodie when he stops by 3+ times a week, on his own, to grab a cup.\n\nBrew Tea Bar is pretty much perfect. Except their typical long lines out the door, especially on super hot days that would normally keep most sane people to shelter indoor. So how do you improve on this business?\n\nOpen a new location!!! \n\nSo that's exactly what happened. Today. Starting at 11am! In Henderson!!!\n\nIt is in the same Plaza as Taco y Taco and Twin Peaks on Eastern (just off the 215). So if you reside or work or hang out in the SE, there is no excuse not to stop by and grab a dessert tea to cool you down as we close out this summer (or have any of their teas served hot, besides the slushes of course, once the weather gets cold).\n\nEven though this location is brand new. There are not a lot of tables and seating s to fill the entire \"dining\" area yet, and the crowds are not yet aware of this new location yet, the service is still efficient and great like their SW location.  They still want you to try their tea to make sure the sweetness is to your liking, if not they will remake it for you. But my Coconut Milk Te was good and required no further adjusting. But thank you for asking and referring me by my name too!  \n\nAttention to the  little details and doing them right consistently by the entire crew here and at the original location is what made them so popular.\n\nSo consistency, personalized service for a quick service food business, reasonable price point and convenient location all adds up to a perfect 5 stars experience for me.\n\nBtw, no more stamp cards. The new system just needs your phone number and the order will be credited to you once you completed your payment.\n\nAnd Brew Tea Bar, congratulations to the successful opening of your newest location!
