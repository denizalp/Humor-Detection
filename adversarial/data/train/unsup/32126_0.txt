This is as good as it gets!   We found out about Dr. Jen just by chance last Thursday and could not be happier.  We have multiple rescue dogs, most elderly, and the care and caring as we worked through some mysterious illness that was raging through our \"pack\" has been extraordinary. All I can say is thank goodness for Dr. Jen and her staff. The only downside is why did it take us so long to find her!!  I would recommend VetweRX to absolutely anyone and everyone.
