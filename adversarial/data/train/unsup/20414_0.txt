OK so first off the the burger was great as far as the taste.  But I got super sick after eating it.  I'm talking throwing up exorcist style.  I try not to look into stuff like this because its borderline paranoia, AND IM NOT accusing the restaurant of anything, but my friend and I walk in and theres a guy in front of us, he orders, then I order, then my friend, then a family of 6.  I ordered the easiest item...#1 w\/o the wasabi\/mayo.  For some reason i got my order last.  After my friend, the family of 6, etc.  I just didn't get why.  The place itself is nice.  \n\nTheres anime playing on the tv and also the football game was on as well.  I love that they tell you to pick a funny nickname for when they call you.  There is trap\/hiphop playing in the background.  Pretty sure this place is ran by a young entrepreneur.  The woman behind the counter was nice.  She said they have a truck still on Fremont usually during the weekends.  If I wouldn't have gotten sick I would have given this place 5 stars but I'm still trying to recover from this food!  It crazy too because this location used to be a taco bell and I got sick from that food as well.  Maybe is just a bad omen on that location.
