So far the most impressive and luxurious hotel in Las Vegas\nFive people were in amazing and huge suite - rialto\nWe had a problem with the internet which was corrected only after 3 days\nNo  coffee maker at the room and an electric kettle would pay more, not terrible but just annoying.\nfor some reason The glasses did not evacuate when they arranged the room.\nParking was neat and very comfortable
