I'd say Agave is my favorite Mexican restaurant on this side of town. Their menu has all the traditional Mexican dishes you'd expect along with traditional Margaritas and beers. The food is absolutely delicious. The dishes always come out quickly and served hot. The margaritas are very tasty (I recommend the strawberry!). \n\nDon't forget to order table-side guac. Although the menu\/food is a bit pricey it's fresh, delicious and fills you up!
