I have been to Fleming's many many times. Mostly, in California. This location was nice. The food was delicious as always. The service was mostly good. The bus boys, male waiter & the manager that came by were all very nice. Our waitress, Lucy, could have been better. Hence the 3 stars. \n\nFrom the beginning, the very first thing that we ordered was the chocolate lava cake. We told her we definitely wanted that. And, we told her because we didn't want to wait a very long time for it. We thought that it would come out right when we were done with dinner. But, she definitely forgot about it.\n\nShe brought out the bread and the two cheesy spreads. Both were good. I ordered the 20 ounce bone in ribeye, well done charred, and it came out perfectly. The Fleming's potatoes and the creamed spinach were both delicious. The creamed spinach had a little kick to it. He had the lobster tempura. She came by and asked him if he wanted more water which he did. But, she didn't ask me. I thought that she was going to ask if we were ready for dessert, which we were. But, she didn't. I had to wait another few minutes to get a refill on my water. The bus boy gladly did it for me. \n\nShe finally came by again, and I told her that we were done with dinner and we were ready for the chocolate lava cake. I also asked her if it was waiting for us. She didn't say anything. Not a word. We were confused at this point.\n\nAbout 15-20 minutes later she finally comes and says that the chocolate lava cake is coming. We wanted to tell her that, we ordered it from the very beginning so that we wouldn't have to wait such a long time for it. But, we decided to let it go at that point. We were having a wonderful dinner. The chocolate lava cake finally came. We were in a bit of a hurry at this point. So, we kind of rushed through the dessert. We did enjoy it, but we didn't have that much time to eat it as slowly as we would have if she would've brought it right after dinner.
