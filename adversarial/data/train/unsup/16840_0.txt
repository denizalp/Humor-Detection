UPDATE: \n\nIn my previous review I subtracted a star because I thought they sold me a joyetech knock off product. After doing some research, it seems like it would be a categorically incorrect statement to say \"knock-off joyetech products\". If you're interested in seeing why, feel free to ask yourself, what's to say joyetechs products aren't knock offs; or google this term: \"joyetech - they aren't the e-cigareet manufacturer you think they are\". Whether or not I'm right, I'm not in a place to actually say they sold me a knock off. Because of that I'm giving them a star back.
