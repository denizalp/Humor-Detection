We have been to Humble Pie a couple times during their 3-6pm happy hour, where they are currently offering half price food and 20% off drinks.  We both enjoyed the thin, chewy crust, brick oven pizzas.  The sausage one was a little heavy on meat for my taste, but I really like the goat cheese and roasted red pepper (we added chicken, too).  Both times we have sat at the bar and had great service.  \n\nIf you had gone to the other pizza place that was in this location (bravo), the new owners have totally changed the look and feel...in a good way.  The service (at least at the bar), and the food are way better than Bravo.  \n\nI would definitely recommend trying this place out!
