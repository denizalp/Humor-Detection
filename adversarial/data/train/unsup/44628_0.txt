An increasing 2.5 stars, considering it's their 1st foray into Canada, they've got their marketing and products downpat considering their crazy lineups.  I just don't get it, such simple products, average pricing, oh well, the novelty.\n\nA combination of the Container Store, Ikea, The Source, and Gap all in one, but with this many different product lines, not much space so you're constantly bumping into other customers.\n\nProbably the only unique thing I would consider getting is this fan that works when playing a CD (who uses that anyways? lol, that's what my ipod is for).\n\nDid see some organic bamboo jeans for the missus, very reasonably priced at $60...\n\nIt is good, not great, quality, give them that much.\n\nNo Amex.
