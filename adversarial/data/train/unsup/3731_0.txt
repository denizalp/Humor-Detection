We were conflicted between the great google reviews and bad reviews on yelp; so we thought we'd try our luck.\nThe sushi here was...questionable. The sashimi didn't taste fresh, the maki rolls were soggy. We tried chicken and beef dishes, they were gross. The tempura tasted freshly fried but was also drenched in oil. Even the cucumbers tasted like they've gone bad. \nDessert was equally as awful as the dinner.  On the plus, the d√©cor was nice and the severs were relatively friendly. But that doesn't take away the tummy ache I had all night after eating at this restaurant. \nI really don't know how this place got such great reviews on google. Trust YELP and find another AYCE.
