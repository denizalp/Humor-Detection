I love this place. The staff are friendly and funny, the food is good and it's super close to campus. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was so good. So is the Thai and spicy fried rice. \nAnyway, the Pad Thai is one of the best I've ever had. Seriously. I mean, it's nothing like in California or Thailand...but for Arizona Asian food, it's super delicious. Anyone just come here to enjoy their food. That's all. They have great food, great service and even though they are close to ASU Tempe, they don't seem to be that busy.\n\nJust come here. That's all.
