I have an old beast of an air conditioner. When I bought my 1960's townhome, the inspector said it had to be replaced. Three years later, and the beast keeps me cool every summer.\n\nUntil it didn't. \n\nYou know how to spot an honest company? Show them your old shit, be a young looking blonde woman, correction ... be a single young looking blonde woman, and see what they have to say. No one tried to up-sell me. In fact, the guy said it was a quality unit. I think he even compared it to an old army jeep: terrible gas mileage, but it keeps on truckin'. #MyHeart (Me + Beast 4-Ever.) \n\nI was like, are you sure? You're not going to laugh at it? I had a guy laugh at it once. \n\nNope. It sounds good, just needed a new fuse. And then he recommended I switch to a different type of air filter. Actually, same advice my mom gave me. Damn, my mom's smart. I should start listening to her.\n\nCame same day. During record breaking heat. Fixed the problem. Did not BS. Answers every call. I wish I could insert a \"praise Jesus\" hand emoji here.
