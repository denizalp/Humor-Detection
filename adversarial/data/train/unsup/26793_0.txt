We had just finished watching Jersey Boys, had dinner, and decided we  all  wanted a nice dessert...off we went through Paris and low and behold we discovered the Chocolate Factory.  We all liked the fact that there is a bar area, separate from the restaurant and store. It seemed like a great place for a post-dinner dessert. The cocktail menu definitely had us wanting to schedule a return visit ASAP. The various concoctions sounded amazing.\n\nOur host seated us next to the bar area, at a large semi-circle booth with fondue table-tops. There are also a couple of small lounge tables with high-back chairs in the middle of the room. This is definetely the spot for some post-dinner chocolate fondue. This also had us excited as we were complaining about there not being enough dessert places in Vegas (particularly on the Strip).\n\nWhat I appreciated most was the helpfulness of our server and Adam Garica.  He manages the Sugar Factory and he went out of his way to make sure we had a good time.    We ordered the Fondue for 2 and although there were 5 of us it was more then enough.  It comes with slices of banana, marshmellow (made on the premises), pound cake, browinies, gummy bears,  rice krispie treats (they have lots, and lots of options to choose from) and 3 different kinds of chocolate to dip the goodies into.  OMG...we were all in chocolate heaven.   We also tried the lollipop and banana martini's.  These drinks are to die for!  We had finished our drinks eaten all the fondue and  Adam came by to thank us for dropping by and surprised us all with a shot of something (we really aren't too sure what it was but it was delicious) that he called liquid marijuana.  It was such a great experience, we felt really special! It was an experience that made me excited to come back and try all of the different things. So we'll see how it all holds up on future visits.
