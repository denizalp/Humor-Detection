Growing up Vietnamese, when the other school kids packed PB&Js for lunch, I had my banh mi. I guess you can say I'm the self-proclaimed banh mi guru. Pittsburgh has a limited amount of restaurants that even offer this Vietnamese favorite, so they get automatic bonus points for bringing me back to my roots. They don't serve up your traditional Vietnamese banh mi, that's for sure, however, I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing. They added a little twist and American flare to it, and surprisingly, I didn't hate it. Sure, it can't compare to my mom's banh mi, but it was still delicious. They have several vegetarian options so I ordered the Feelin Tofu banh mi (not sure about that name though). Usually you would find pickled radishes and carrots, but they mixed it up with shredded carrots marinated in a sweet & savory brown sauce. Nothing I've ever had, but it was unique and actually complemented the tofu well. The tofu itself was very spongy. If they swapped it out for firm tofu, it would've been a winner. If you are actually looking for a more traditional version, Vietnam's Pho (now Maiku Sushi) stays true to the Vietnamese staple. \n\nOverall, I rate them 4\/5 stars. Service was fantastic - all the employees were very friendly and cheerful. The space is very cute and simplistically modern - although, they could use a few extra tables. The food was actually great despite straying from what banh mi is from a traditional sense. Definitely check this place out!
