Stopped in here for a little treat and it was excellent. The place is clean and there is good selection of doughnuts. We ordered the coconut one, it was lightly glazed wtih coconut shavings and a coconut cream in the hole. The doughnut was fluffy and light and the whole thing was delicious and not overly sweet. \n\nLike all gourmet foods, this had a gourmet price tag to match, but if comparable to things you could get at a bakery or Sbux.
