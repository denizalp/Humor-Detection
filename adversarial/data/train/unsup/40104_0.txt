First, the decor and the building itself is super cool. It really gives you that diner feel. The pies and desserts right when you walk in are also a great touch - they look absolutely divine!\n\nWe came on a Saturday at about 1:30. We had to wait for about 15 minutes, not too bad considering how small the space is. Service was okay. Our server was friendly but we had to ask about 5 times for silverware until we actually got some. They have a great selection of breakfast items, I honestly didn't pay much attention to anything else on the menu. They are really good about marking what is gluten-free which was super nice. \n\nI ordered the corned beef hash and it was very good. The hash had great flavor and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The biscuit looked delicious but I of course couldn't eat it (devastating). One of my biggest pet peeves though is when there is food on the plate that isn't meant to be eaten...and they put the fruit on a leaf of iceberg lettuce. Not a deal breaker obviously but something that has always annoyed me. My boyfriend ordered the country breakfast with bacon and scrambled eggs. He said it was really good, especially the potatoes. \n\nThis place is officially on my radar as another great breakfast option!
