Rude front desk. I have been here twice and they just rush you in the appt. I called today to make an appt and I asked if they were open Mondays and she said yes. I asked if I can have a Monday appt. she said we don't have any. I said okay well when's your next Monday I can take that no matter how far away it is. And her response was I don't have any Mondays. I said I thought you were open Mondays? Just overall rude customer service and not helpful at all. Going to another place.
