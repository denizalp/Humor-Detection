Great prices for their combos and great flavors. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the fried chicken! From what my Taiwanese friends say, it's pretty solid for sauga and definitely worth a try at least once. Their logo makes me laugh every time. My only gripe is the atmosphere and colors of the dining area aren't quite the best, and the tables can sometimes be a little dirty.\n\nUPDATE: Sad to say after coming back recently, this place has definitely gone down hill. Service is extremely slow, and it seems the chicken is now lacking in flavor. None of the food that came to my table seemed hot and was only luke-warm\/borderline cold. They give you smaller portions of sides and chicken and much more rice (old, dry rice mind you). I love this place and all, but they've definitely lost their standards. I hope they're able to get themselves back on their feet.
