This place is absolutely amazing! I highly recommend it to anyone with active kids.  The kids all had a blast. We went with 4 other familiesand had 10 kids total. There are plenty of places for the adults to hang out whild the kids jump. It is so neat and clean. The employees were super sweet, welcoming and helpful. This must be a great company that treats their employees right. I could not believe how happy and friendly everyone was. The kids got to climb the rock wall, jump on trampolines, play dodgeball, basketball, battle in the foam pits and just had a blast!  Sade watched the kids closely and was so patient and kind to them.  Elizabeth and Tatsi walked us through the registration process and told us all about the company and how great it is to work there. They even do slumber parties!!!  These 3 girls made all the difference in our experience at this amazing place. \n\nSade, Elizabeth, and Tatsi are great!
