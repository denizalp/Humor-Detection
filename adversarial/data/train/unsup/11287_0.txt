The pizza is excellent. I had one issue with a mis-marked pizza out of their display case recentlyof \"by the slice\": it was chicken barbecue which I cannot eat (I HATE chicken barbecue pizza) but the sign said \"Neapolitan\" too late as I had already taken it home. \n\n\nI went in (May 20th) for a birthday lunch, and was disappointed in the experience. Me and my sister were enjoying our pizzas and one of the staff, seated a full two tables away watching television in the dining area- for some reason was listening in to our conversation! then joined in of his own accord. We politely replied with small talk and went on speaking more quietly to ourselves, which he then later again opined on of our comments which were not of his concern. It was very awkward being forced to entertain a person that I hadn't planned on speaking with.\nI am sure he thought he was being \"friendly\" but most paying customers do not appreciate the staff interrupting the customer and joining in their conversations. \n\nThe cashier also refused to enter in my phone number which gives the customer a free large pizza when they've spent a certain amount there. I wonder if he input someone elses number? \n\nAll of the staff seem to have tattoos all over the place- their arms, legs, what have you. Tattoos aren't cool anymore but I guess they are permanently stuck wearing them.
