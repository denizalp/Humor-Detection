We went here on a Friday night and it was packed!  You might even want to order your desserts ahead of time because it was slim pickings by the time we finished dinner at 7:30pm.  \n\nI got a panini with vegetarian turkey, chicken, onion, chipotle sauce and cheese on nine grain bread which was a special for January and it was tremendous.  I'll probably be back before the month is out just to have it again!  The vegetarian taco salad was incredible as well and would make a monstrous yet healthy entree.  I liked how the taco shell wasn't a deep fried tortilla but a baked kinda pita style bowl.  So much awesomeness.  I'm so ready to go back just thinking about it now.  \n\nThe service was attentive and friendly.  They accidentally switched our sandwich orders and sides but made it right and gave us one free dessert to make up for the mistake.  It wasn't even a big deal.  Talk about above and beyond!  Wow!
