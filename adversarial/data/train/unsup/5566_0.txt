Lived here until May 2012.  One of the best communities I've experienced living at.  My apt unit was great. Parking was never an issue. I really like that this community is a small one. I've lived in other bigger communities and notice the office doesn't remember residents and are more like sales people. Here, the office staff are polite and personable.  maintenance team are fast and efficient! Paying rent was as easy as going online. Service requests can also be submitted online. \n\nMy only issue had to do with a noisy downstairs neighbor that lived like zoo animals but she moved out and new normal neighbors moved in. :)
