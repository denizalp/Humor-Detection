When I was in Phoenix, I didn't rent a car. Luckily, my conference-meeting was in the downtown area, which is not far from my (Lexington) hotel on N Central Ave. \n\nThere is one specific shuttle that will take me to the Valley-Metro Rail line and that shuttle, which runs every 10-15 minutes, takes me to E Washington St. and 44th Ave where I can take the Valley Metro Rail line to my hotel, which also operates every 10-15 minutes. And if you're lazy (like me), that same street car also takes you to ASU, Phoenix Convention Center, Chase Field and American Airline Arena. The ride from the airport to the downtown Financial district area, the sports-venues and my hotel takes 20 minutes and the fare is $1.75.  \n\nSince I was there for two days, I bought a three-day pass for $10.50. The pass gives me access to all the Valley Metro Transit systems for my two day stay.  \n\nThe buses and streetcars are clean with \"strong and powerful\" air-conditioning. Many of the drivers and passengers are really friendly and helpful by giving me UFC tips about the city of Phoenix.\n\nDespite being a bareface tourist, I do feel welcomed and the \"love\" from the city of Phoenix.
