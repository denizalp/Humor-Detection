The customer service here is awful.\n\nThis is a review of my rental from Nov 25-29.\n\nFirst, make sure you call them when you get to the airport. Their shuttle doesn't show up unless they know you are there (this is mentioned nowhere in the reservation).\n\nSecond, the money thing is like a scam! I originally reserved many months early. The price later dropped, so I contacted customer service. They told me to cancel my previous prepaid reservation, give them the number of my new booking for the same dates, and they would issue a refund. \n\nThat was nearly a month ago. They give me the run around with customer service. Everyone states that my refund was issued. Ive been given 3 different dates that the credit will process--all dates have come and gone. Even the girl at the front desk promised to call back in 1 hour and, 4 days later, Ive heard nothing. I have had to resort to disputing the amount on my credit card.\n\nAnd my rental had low tires in the cold weather and I was told just to drive--it was fine. No washer fluid in rainy weather. What kind of place are these people running?\n\nSave yourself the hassle and book a company that is on site and reliable.
