Yes, gas stations need love too and since this Shell didn't have a review, why not? The second closet gas station to Uptown Charlotte. For that reason it should deserve 5 stars, but since it's a gas station it gets 3, as well as being busy all the time with it's corner location at East & South. There are some \"characters\" that are there from time to time, so I really never make it in the actual place as I'm a pay at the pump kind of guy. That said, it's a fully loaded convenience store\/gas station. ATM, ice, beer, etc.
