Seen Beatles LOVE twice, first time I was sober, second time I was um do I need to elaborate? I preferred the sober show. \n\nEver since I was a tween I absolutely loved the Beatles, When I saw this show was in Vegas I knew I had to check it out. \n\nThe 200 Sections are a great view for the price, Beatles love sometimes has a 50% OFF promo via online, that's the best time to grab some tickets. \n\nPrice: Level 3 I paid $88.00 for section 203, row N Seat 1 \n\nOh my goodness the male contortionist with 100 abs got me all hot, Ugh just him alone is worthy of 5 stars. \n\nThe music, Props, Dancing and Acrobatics were entertaining and kept my interest the entire time! I found myself singing along the entire time. \n\nThis show is like a story, I can dig that, If you can appreciate music videos I think you will love this show but if your looking for acrobatics the entire show then look elsewhere.\n\nOh Vegas please bring me Cirque du Soleil Dark Side Of The Moon \nthat would make my year!!! \n \nRANDOM FACT:\nThe first lyrics to \"Yesterday\" were \"scrambled eggs.\"
