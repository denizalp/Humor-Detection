Been here a few times now and love it! My new nail salon. :) My pedicures always look great. They spend a long time on the massage as well, and you don't feel rushed at all like you do at some other places. I've come with friends a majority of the times and they always are on time with the reservations, and we get to sit next to each other. Highly recommend!
