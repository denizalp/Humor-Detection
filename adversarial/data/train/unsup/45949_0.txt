I don't go to Phoenix often but when I do, I prefer Quik Trip. My friend and I were leaving town headed home when we came across this one off the freeway, and being a big fan of the QT we were relieved to see it! Refreshing cold purified soda was soon in hand as well as their locally baked cookies (with little M & M type candy in them!) and sandwiches galore. I will avoid the other competitors like the plague when I am in a town with a QT because I trust this place and love the selection and quality. I love how each store is laid out practically the same and bathrooms are clean and always a welcome site, and so easy to find. No fussing around for a key.
