We have been here few times and never in my life have I been in a place of business that blatantly targets a table of paying customers for their race and their heritage. A group of us sat, not bothering anyone, trying to have dinner, when we were attacked by the owner of the restaurant for being Asian. When we called him out on it, he just continued on. He even finished the night by saying \" I will be here next week but that table won't be.\" What a terrible waste of space.
