I should of never came here. Ruined my Vegas trip.\n\nI went here because the reviews on Yelp were pretty high, now I feel like it was all bs reviews.\n\nI went in at the beginning of my week long trip and just wanted a #2 fade. Plain and simple.\nThe male stylist said ok so I thought, cool no problem.\nHe started and ended up cutting my hair crooked and too much off the top. Like a military buzz cut but with the top longer so made my head look like a bent pineapple with an asian mullet. I mean..wtf..seriously?? I've done a better job cutting it myself without mirrors...LITERALLY.\nAnd THEN after all that bs..he tells me its $25..REALLY??\n\nI didnt want to deal with his bs anymore or even see if he can fix it, not the kind of gamble I was hoping to do in Vegas.\nI actually went down the street to a barber shop and paid more to get it fixed. They did a better job fixing the stupid ass haircut than this \"stylist\" trying it in the first place. AND it was $10 cheaper!\nI cant understand how someone that cuts hair cant do a simple fade. Truely a disappointing experience.\n\nIf you still want to spend your money here..take that cash, go on the strip and give it to one of those homeless people on the bridges. It'll be put to better use, whether food OR drugs~
