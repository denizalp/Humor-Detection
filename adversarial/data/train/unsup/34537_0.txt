I have heard a lot of people knock this place but I don't know why. The pizza is excellent, the toppings are of very good quality and the cheese is outstanding. Try their green olives on a pizza, not something I would order anywhere else but from here it is delicious. The fried mac n' cheese sounds nasty but its surprisingly good. Best pizza in Madison.
