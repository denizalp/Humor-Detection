Hardly go to Arby's ..Ordered thru drive thru  tried the Ang 3 Chz meal. Service good up sold meal . Sandwich was very tasty but the roll is very dry and curly fries was very good n Hot .!!!\n\nRecommend to shop for different roll or maybe it's just rotation or over ordering . \nThere are many Bakery that will deliver fresh daily like Great Buns ..\nThanks
