For the price you can't go wrong! \n\nLocation: They are located off of Sunset road, before the intersection of Sunset & Mt. Vista. It a freestanding building, you can't miss the sign.\n \nAmbiance: Inside it looks like a typical Asian restaurant, nothing fancy. It was clean which was a plus.\n\nService: The waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu. She gave me recommendations since it was my first time. Service time was standard.\n\nFood: I ordered the duck sliders for appetizers. It was pretty good. I ordered off of the special menu, which was buy one get one free. I ordered 2 ramen, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and cold Vietnamese noodles (to go). First of all, the portions was HUGE, which is always good with me. The ramen was pretty good but needed some fixing up. A little soy sauce and Sriracha made it all better. Same went for the Taiwanese beef noodle soup with a little help I turned a 5 into an 8. For the price you can't beat it. The Vietnamese cold noodles I took it home which made a wonderful late night snack. \n\nValue: The special menu is great! Buy one get one free, you can't go wrong. Four meals for $16 is a steal. Especially with the portions being so huge you gotta love it. \n\n*tips: order off the special menu it's buy one get one free. If you are using groupons you can't use it in combination with the specials menu. If you're alone you can still get that BOGO free deal and take one to go.\n\nI gave them a 3 out of 5 because I gotta keep it really. It isn't the greatest, but for the price you can't go wrong. It's a great week night eat with the family when you don't feel like cooking.
