I must say go on record that this is 100% without a doubt my absolute favorite thrift shop in Phoenix. The items are wonderful and priced to sell (unlike so many other thrift shops). The employees are the greatest group of women who never fail to make make me laugh and leave with a smile (not just because of the incredible items I got at such an unbelievable price). \nI also feel good because this shop is 100% nonprofit and every penny made goes to helping the Boxers!!! \nI really cannot give enough praise to this place, LOVE IT!!!!!
