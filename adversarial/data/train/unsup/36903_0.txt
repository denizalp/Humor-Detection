Le 4e Mur has an awesome concept! You're a detective, if you're not in a group you're going to have to go again, there's a huge mystery and it's amazing! Can't say what the answer was, but I promise it's definitely worth going through all the way with the challenge! Service was a little delayed, our waiter came by every 30min or so. That's the only reason it lost a star. But overall a great hangout spot! If you have time and patience and you love mysteries, you'll love this spot!
