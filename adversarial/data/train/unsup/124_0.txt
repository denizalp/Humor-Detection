For those of you that read my reviews you'll notice I don't really ramble on about too much I only write reviews about places that are really good or really bad .i do  check in  everywhere I go.. The reason I'm writing this review just because this place stands out as absolutely awesome. I've been all over the world including the Middle East and their salads tastes exactly like my wife's mother salad who was born and raised in Cairo. The chicken shwarma is absolutely the best I've had in Vegas it's fresh soft and crunchy it's truly the best chicken shawerma I've had. The gyro was great. the bread is fresh and soft it's basically 5 out of 5 stars . You get great service ,very nice people ,good price , and fantastic  food. if you're looking for a a gyro,  or sawarma or Middle Eastern stuff this place is clean and delicious. Extensive menu  grilled meat,  sides. This place ROCKS! !!!
