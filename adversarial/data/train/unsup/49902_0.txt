We were on a vacation stopover and found this spot. We had wonderfully attentive service despite them being PACKED. It was kid-friendly, but also had a good beer selection for the grownups.\n\nWe stuck with the meatballs in marinara sauce and they were delicious. In a bowl or as a sandwich. Yum. There were lots of options of meatballs and sauces if you want to try something a little different. Next time we are passing through I will want to stop there for sure.
