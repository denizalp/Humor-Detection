It's my birthday and all I want is a tasty burrito from the boyz and girls of Burrito Banditos (the cute blond makes it best).  I loved working nearby, calling in my burrito order and having it ready the moment I dropped in.  Sweet that they always remembered me too. Now I'm in Vancouver and there's nothing to compare.  What I would give for a small bean and cheese, heck it's my birthday, I'd probably splurge on halibut all wrapped up in burrito deliciousness.  If I were in the burrito business I'd get a franchise going on the west coast.  Somebody help me!  I need a good burrito in a bad way!
