I've eaten here several times, first because of a recommendation of a friend and other times because people wanted to go here and I was dragged along. The food is underwhelming!  I've tried a different dish each time I've eaten here, and frankly, none were good.  I guess most of the people who give this place 4 and 5 stars are regulars at McDonald's.
