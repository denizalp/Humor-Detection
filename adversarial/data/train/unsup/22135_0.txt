I don't usually like to do buffets because, of course, I have to overeat to get my money's worth, and I never eat enough to actually get my money's worth, so it always ends tragically. I also haven't eaten at any buffet that I could give full stars.. until now. I had maybe 3 plates of food, consisting of what I thought looked good: beef brisket (mini plate with what we thought was grits, BOMB), another brisket from the carving station, sweet potato tator tots, roasted rainbow carrots, chilean sea bass, xiao long bao, curry mussels, clams, and the elote corn. I mentioned only items that I liked. Favorite item was probably the chilean sea bass since that's harder to come by nowadays. There were a few other things I tried that I will pass next time: kobe sliders, mac n cheese, feta & watermelon salad, and ceviche. There was so much more food that I could never possibly sample, including a massive dessert selection. I loved the oreo mousse cake (and the gummi bears!!!!).\n\nWe went for lunch on a friday around 11:45, and only had to wait about 30 mins. You can dress up if you want, but definitely can wear tee and shorts (or other fat pants). Service was great. Our lady was very attentive in removing our plates and making sure we had enough water and other beverages. Also, you can take a hot coffee to go!!! They will give you a huge cup with no lid, but you can take it out!
