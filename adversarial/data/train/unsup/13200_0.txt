This is a continuum of my last review (which is below this one since all you can do is redo your review not add another).... if you are looking at reviews about spa's read all of these and dont go to Oasis....\n\nI spoke to PETER the OWNER today, in a nutshell they changed the info about our appointment so he claims they were right and my friend and I are wrong.\n\nHe also said that he read my review and he basically said I am full of shit.\n\nTHEY ABUSED MY FRIENDS DAUGHTER and he said his staff did not abuse her...\n\nMY FRIEND AND I ARE PARALEGALS AND COMMISSIONERS OF OATHS AND HE SAID WE ARE LYING AND FULL OF IT AND THAT WE HAVE NO PROOF OR ANYTHING...\n\nTHIS IS THE KIND OF PEOPLE RUNNING THIS SPA\n\nWHEN I SAID I WAS GOING TO CALL IN THE LAWYER PUT HIM ON SPEAKERPHONE AND SEE WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT PETER GOT DEFENSIVE AND STARTED BASHING MY FRIEND AND I AND OFFENDING US.\n\nIsn't it funny how he claims no one reads my reviews and he even claims his staff is top notch yet after my last review 2 people reviewed the spa as bad?\n\nI am bound by law to uphold the law and he claims I am lying to get money back, I don't need their money I make good coin that I don't need money back - I need what was done to my friends daughter made right, I don't care about spending $60 more but the ABUSE my friend daughter endured is UNACCEPTABLE but to PETER it is acceptable.\n\nThis spa will soon enough be shut down like all the other stores in Mount Royal. Karma is a bitch and she is after Peter the owner and his retard minion Tanya the supervisor.
