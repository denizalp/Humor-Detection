If you happen to have superhuman mutant night vision and an affinity for good steaks, then this is the place for you.  My filet mignon was DELISH, problem was I couldn't see it.  The place was completely dark save for a few candles and by the end of my spring mix salad (which was fresh and yummy), I was secretly wishing for a Paris Hilton cam just so I would be able to see what I was eating.  Additionally they crank up the music so loud you have to basically shout at your dinner companions.  \n\nThe food was good - the steak sauces that came with the filet were amazing and the seabass was fresh and tasty and perfect.  The presentation of the food, what I saw of it at least - assisted with cell phone lighting, was pretty.\n\nThere were some damn fine waiters walking around, but the service SUCKED.  This place operates similar to a club, where all attention is directed to the cash money millionaires and the wads of paper flowing out of their Prada suits - homeboy at the adjacent table was practically having his feet licked by the wait staff.  Our waiter disappeared after our food was served and a busser served us dessert without spoons which took a good 10 minutes for them to correct, and by that time the ice cream had melted.\n\nSTACK: very trendy place with great food and sucky service.
