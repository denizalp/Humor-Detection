This is for the Monday Night Football season opener. This is one of the best places to go for MNF anytime, but opening night is great with two games. Open bar from 4pm to 8pm, catered food (I had brisket, garlic mashed potatoes, california roll, teriyaki chicken skewers, peanut butter pie and so much more available). Alcohol vendors inside from Belvedere to Fireball to Chada Rum, Jaegermeister, and more serving up free samples. They give away jerseys and prizes (kind of weak this year). A good time, all for $22 for the showroom, and $10 in the main room. Just one thing to note, some people get way too drunk, and stupid. I wish these people had some class but they don't. Only negative of the night.
