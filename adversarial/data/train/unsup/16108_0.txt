https:\/\/youtu.be\/oh3v1kuYzPM\n\nSomeone randomly coming up to me the next day to explain how trashed I was.. even tho allegedly I was so sober that I purchased a very very very cheap bottle of tequilla (which probably tasted just as bad as it looked if I even drank tequilla which I don't)for 233 dollars. Instead of just purchasing the bottle of Jack from the bar in my suite for 30-40 dollars which I would have drank no problem, had I been coherent enough too know what I was doing.  If I had drank it I probably wouldn't be here now able to tell what happened.  And I tried talking to the manager the next day to possibly return said bottle and was met with a manager lady who was very rude and not very helpful at all.  I love MGM casino and the pool and every bar inside the Casino but will be taking my money elsewhere from now on just from the way I was treated in 10 mins at this bar.
