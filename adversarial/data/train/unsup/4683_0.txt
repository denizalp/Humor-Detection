Clean yes. Staff on commission so pushy especially the owners. They will hound you. They never change the bulbs. No wonder people tan unlimited and never get a tan. And it's always busy. Almost impossible to get in without an appointment   I got pressured into buying a membership which was a big regret. What a waste of money and locked into a contract. These people should work for Rogers lol they also made me buy an expensive lotion and then asked me everything I came if I wanted to buy more. And very very high turnover with their staff. Every time I go in there, there's a new employee because someone quit. Hmmmm
