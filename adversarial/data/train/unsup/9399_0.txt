A relatively new discovery, mmmmmmmmmmm! I thought it was like a Rubio's or something...it just never stood out to me. Neither did the Starbucks. No idea it was there for months and months even though I knew there was an Einstein's (Which I've never been to). Anyway, I went for the second time yesterday and got the Huevos Mexicanos burrito...best 1:30pm on a Saturday breakfast burrito I've had! It was about $4? They are $1.99 on weekday mornings. It was so messy and dripping with every salsa known to man that is offered at the salsa bar. It didn't taste like greasy chemicals Ã  la any-berto's. The place is clean and cheap. The veggie burrito is really good too and everything comes with chips. The murals stretched on the walls make you feel like you're on vacation. And if I ever went on vacation, \nI would miss Chico's! \nMi amor! \nTry it! \nPor favor!
