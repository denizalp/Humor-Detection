Great Walmart Supercenter near the Aliante community. Its a huge store and is open 24 hours. They have other business inside the store like Checkers and Wetzel Pretzels. \n\nI visit this location from time to time whenever I am in Vegas and even shopped here during Black Friday which was crazy. You can find some great deals here from time to time.
