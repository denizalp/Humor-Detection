OMG, I am in cinnamon bun heaven. \n\nI love Cinnaholic. \n\nI have been tempted to stop by this  delicious dessert shop, but I've never had the time. However today, I wanted to surprise my husband with something yummy. \n\nGreeting:\nAs soon as I walked into the story, I was greeted by a beautiful women with a warm welcome and a smile. This was my first time here so I had to look over the menu. I didn't have to ask for help becauseI had  yelp to thank, but the employee did offer great suggestions.\n\nOrder:\nMy husband loves peanut butter so I ordered him the highly suggested peanut butter cup and I suck with the classic. Our cinnamon bun was soooooo good. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie that I couldn't eat because I was stuffed.\n\nMenu:\nThe menu is a bit overwhelming because you can customize everything. Whatever you want they have it. They even have a menu of popular cinnamon buns to hell you out like SMORES, Apple Pie etc. They sell brownies, cookies, and even smaller buns.\n\nCinnaholic is Yum and I will definitely be back.
