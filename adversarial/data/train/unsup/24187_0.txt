I have had this guy's BBQ\/smoked meats for the past couple of years at family's BBQs. On this visit, my son-in-law took me to Cody's twice. First had the brisket...which is awesome! Today was smoked salmon which is fabulous! Well this will be a must visit every time I come to visit my family! Hey Cody! Can ya ship me some brisket & salmon?!?
