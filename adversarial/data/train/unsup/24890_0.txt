Circue really delivers with this show!   Instead of the same old thing, 80% of the show was things I have never seen before.  Considering I have seen every Circue and Cirque knock off show that is quite an accomplishment.  The sets used for the show utilized modern technology and were quite impressive.  The best part of the show was a artist who painted using sand on top of a glass screen which was simultaneously projected onto a screen so the audience could watch.  This part of the show was simply amazing and worth the price of admission by itself.  I highly recommend seeing this show.
