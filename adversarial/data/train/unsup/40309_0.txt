It's a typical chinese buffet, only that whenever I go, I seem to notice fresher food than other buffet locations. There is a great selection and even a mongolian grill where they will cook up your creation! \n\nIt's always been clean, never had to wait for service, and moderately priced. Especially since it's within walking distance- it's a quick dinner fix & I am a fan.
