How to attract people into a restaurant 101: Have an Aussie guy outside handing out coupons. \n\nIt worked! My friend and I returned the next week for dinner. Hungry Amoo is a long narrow restaurant with a cozy, relaxed feel. It's a great place to catch up with friends, which from what the waitress was telling us, is exactly the vibe they were going for. \n\nI ordered the manicotti, which was just the right portion of flavourful pasta with mushrooms\/truffles. Very delicious! My friend had the cheeseburger which she said was great! \n\nWe didn't try the cocktails or share plates this time around, but we will definitely be returning to this establishment! Impeccable service and incredible food - highly recommend!!
