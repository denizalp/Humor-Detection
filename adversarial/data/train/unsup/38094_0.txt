It is hard to find a nice pub with actually decent food to eat in the deep SW. So, when Kildares opened, I was very excited to try it. It was a beautiful day, so we sat outside on the patio. They have a really nice patio, so that was a plus.\n\nI got the Kildares burger and my friend got the Steak Sandwich. Both were quite delicious, and filled us up. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the fries were nice and crispy. Our waitress was lovely, and when I asked for a beer recommendation, she not only gave me a great recommendation, but checked up to make sure I liked it. It is hard to find service like that in pubs in this city. \n\nSince it's a 5 minute drive from my place, and I enjoyed my experience there, I will be coming back for sure.
