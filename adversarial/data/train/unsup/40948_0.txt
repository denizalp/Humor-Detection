Not to be missed.  I don't usually eat fish because it is such a hit-or-miss thing to order, but am I glad we went to Milos.  The waitress was super nice and helpful and the food was superb.  The fish was beyond fresh.  It was a very memorable meal.  It is pricey but you won't be disappointed.  We shared red snapper and bass.  Both of them were top notch.
