Was so darn excited to have a new restaurant by my house and was hopeful it would provide some quality, home cooking. Unfortunately, as you can assume, I was really let down. My visit took place mid week, during lunch hour, with a couple co-workers. Upon entering, I was impressed with the restaurant set up and seeing a couple televisions showing a baseball game never disappoints a sports fan. Sadly, that was the only positive to our visit. The hostess\/our waitress sat up promptly and then disappeared. We waited for some time to get waters and she seemed uninterested\/annoyed in taking our orders. As for our meals, they had mussels and pizza and were not impressed. I too ordered some individual pizza slices and they were not good. I was so wishing I was at Bruno's at that moment. The pizza is hard to describe. I have thought and thought and I will just leave it at not good. The icing on the cake for me was the ranch I requested to dip my pizza in. I have never had a dressing so watered down. It literally had the consistency of water. Overall, so disappointed in having to say that I will not be back to the place I was so excited to have near me. Bummer.
