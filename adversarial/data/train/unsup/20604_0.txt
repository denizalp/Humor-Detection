THIS CLUB is my FAVORITE CLUB!!!!\n\nwent here on a saturday night. . .group of 25 mostly guys. . .\nthe line went all the way down mulitiple hallways. . . was a little discouraged on waiting in the that long line. . .even if you on the guest list you still have to wait in the line. . .FYI guest list closes at 1030pm\nI would advise to be waiting in line by 8pm!\ni waited an hour. . .but once i was in. . .it was well worth the wait. . .\nthe ambiance is awesome. . .\nHUUUUUUUUGE place. . . we mostly chilled outside. . .\nbut of course the dance floor is always crowded. . .but i was willing to shake my money maker ;o)\nI had a blast.  . .\nI have been to ALL the clubs in vegas. . .and this club by far surpasses all the clubs in vegas combined!
