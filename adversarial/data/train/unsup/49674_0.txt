Mixed review here, but so are the members of our family.  Good location, yet we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated outside on a beautiful day.  Waited on right away for drinks and we were already to order.  Food came out fast.\n\nWife and son had the Motley Que pulled pork.  Teenager thought it was great, but my wife thought for all his talk about bold flavors it might have been a little bland.  Daughter had a cheeseburger that was very big and cooked perfectly.  All of them got fries 4 ways and were pleased.  My 16 year old got the Double Barrel BBQ Wings and didn't find them tasty and didn't have enough heat.  \n\nI had the Italian Deli Salad and it ranks up there on one of the best I have had.  The \"bowl\" is made of a thick piece of smoked provolone wrapped in prosciutto.  Plenty of different types of olives, cheese and dried sausage on the side.  I wasn't that hungry to start, but ate every last bite of a large salad.  Wish I went there when I was hungry.\n\nSo one teenager didn't care for it, wife and daughter thought it was OK and the other teen and I had a great meal.  In Vegas I thought it was a good value.
