I attended ASU for my last 2 years after transferring in from the University of New Mexico.  This place has grown on me.  Like many at first, I found it impersonal and very superficial.  It takes time to find your niche, but once I found it, I was set.  I joined the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law fraternity (I had been Greek at UNM previously) and found that group of people to be awesome.  But the size and the superficiality actually grew on me.  \n\nThere is a ton to do around campus and you should take advantage of it.  While Dos Gringos has been forced to move and Long Wongs and The Timber Wolf have now closed, I know you can still find a great place to eat or drink on Mill or nearby.  \n\nDoes it have a rep as a party school? Yeah ... but you make what you want out of a university.  But trust me, every time I tell a new acquaintance where I went to school, invariably the reaction is \"Damn, you must've had fun in college.\"  My response is invariably \"Hell yeah I did!\"\n\nDo we have some nationally recognized programs? Yep ... not at the level of Princeton or Yale, but we have them.  I found all of my professors approachable and very willing to help you out with questions about, applications and letters of recommendation for grad school.  \n\nParking sucked but I loved my time there nonetheless.  I still find it amazing that even here on Yelp, trolls from UA will post.  Go Devils!
