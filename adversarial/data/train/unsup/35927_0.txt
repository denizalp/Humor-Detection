This is one of the best Caribbean restaurants on the south side. Most places are only on the North. I haven't tried the others since I live on this side of town but I'm a New Yorker and I know good Jamaican food and this place is it. Their food is always fresh and good. They're jerk anything is usually sweet mixed with spicy, which I've come to like. Wish it would lose the sweetness though. They haven't dumbed down their ingredients to suit the southern folks who may not truly get good Caribbean taste and flavor. So that makes me happy. Also I have noticed that their prices are more reasonable and they have a lunch price. It usually makes me upset when I go to Caribbean restaurants other than NYC because they up their prices in the South all around.
