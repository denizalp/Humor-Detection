Drinks: Upland tangerine, Greenbush Pale Ale (APA), a Stout, Batch #3, and some Irish Car Bomb shots.\n\nFood: Chicken Caprese bites ($10), 2x cheese curds ($9), walleye sandwich ($12), chicken sandwich ($10) and beet salad ($9.5).\n\nThey were out of Mosquito Bite, which is they only IPA they had on tap. One party in our group is an IPA loyalist and was devastated they didn't have anything to his liking. Our favorite was the Stout, a nice chocolaty and coffee aroma, it had a smooth and creamy pour. The rest of the beers were not full-bodied and honestly the taste was reminiscent of table beer.\n\nThe food on the other hand were more promising. The chicken Caprese bites were balls of tender chicken encased by crispy, dark brown panko-like coating, dressed in succulent marinara sauce adorned with Parmesan shavings. Oddly, it arrived on a bed of greens which were presumably wilted. \n\nEach Carr Valley cheese curds were delicately coated and fried, the coating was not heavy but enough to keep the cheese from oozing after being fried. It came with a paprika ranch and horseradish sauce, we much preferred the former.\n\nThe beet salad was beautifully presented with both red and golden beets and contained roasted Brussels sprouts which was a delightful surprise. \n\nChicken sandwich came on a hummus spread and toasted ciabatta, both sandwiches were served with choice of greens or fries and a pickle spear. The walleye was thin and lengthy, the ends suffered from being in the pan a little too long but otherwise was well seasoned.\n\nWe ended up with a bill of ~$120 before tip and taking off some coupons we got in the mail. \n\nI rate this as A-Ok because I can't really see coming here on a regular basis or as a meeting place to gather with friends because of the price point as well as the subpar beer.
