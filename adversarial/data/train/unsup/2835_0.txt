I can't even tell you what it's like inside this club because I couldn't even get in. On Friday night, I was stopped on the street before I came back into The Mirage to go back to my room & was given free VIP\/ complimentary passes to go into 1 OAK for me, my sister & her friend. It was so crazy crowded in the lobby that we decided to forego 1 OAK & try again on Saturday night.\n \nFlash forward to Cinco de Mayo 2012. It is a Saturday afternoon & I'm walking back into the hotel from North Valet and am stopped by a staff member, and asked if I'd be interested on being on the staff VIP list for me and my girlfriends. I tell the girl (Jessica) that I'm up for it. After giving her my name & phone #, she tells me she will text me all the info I will need for the guest list. Great, sounds good. Oh, and btw it's free drinks for girls until midnight. Even better.\n\nI attended the Wine Spectator Grand Tour event that same evening & there was a big billboard that said \"Complimentary Admission to 1 OAK with proof of attendance.\" Awesome. So either way, I have a way into 1 OAK. (PS I'm a hotel guest on top of it.) \n\nNow, here's where the story gets good...at around 11:15pm my sister & I walk up to the Staff Check-In\/Guest List line. We tell the guy that we are on Jessica's guest list. HE TELLS US THAT WE CAN'T COME IN BECAUSE OF HOW WE ARE DRESSED. I would like to point out at this point that I am in palazzo pants, a blouse & cute blazer with Tahari ballet flats and my sister is in skinny jeans and a boobalicious blouse. I asked the guy if it was because we weren't in heels and he said that he wasn't going to waste our time because there's no way we were going to get in.\n\nI have never in my life been so offended as I was with the experience I had with the guy from 1 OAK. You have got to be kidding me. 1 OAK it is not. I've never been treated that way by its namesake in NYC. \n\nI will never in a million years go to this club in my life. You couldn't pay me after the douche-y experience I had trying to get into this place tonight. I'd rather go to Tao.
