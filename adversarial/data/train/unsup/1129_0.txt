I just love Greek food and the Fat Greek has my favorite item - the Gryo Plate.  Theirs come with a good amount of meat and we chose rice and salad.  Unlike another spot we have been too Fat Greek gives you a hearty amount of rice and salad each packed in their own container.  \n    We also got sides of Gyro meat and the ever popular Athena Fries.  The fries were a delight and were devoured quickly.  The combination of spices and the two cheeses was so good.  The rice was very tasty and the salad was really good.  Fresh Romaine lettuce tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of feta.  \n   I have eaten in and now taken out.  I think I prefer take out.  The dining room is basic and although clean has a tired look about it.  The lady who has taken our order isn't very friendly and lacks in her customer service skills.  I didn't take it personally and think it is just her demeanor.  \n   So far Fat Greek is the best Greek place for Gyro's that i have found in Vegas.  In comparison to Sharma Plus you get near twice as much food for the same cost.  One thing that also stands out is the Tzatziki sauce is very good and plentiful.  A great price for a plentiful Gryo Plate.  I will definitely be back for my next Gyro fix!
