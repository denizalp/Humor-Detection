I'm calling Aria the best overall Vegas buffet in my opinion. They recently started offering $20 alcohol unlimited drinks for two people. \n\nThey also have two complimentary drinks that will absolutely knock your sox off: THAI TEA and HORCHATA if you don't know what those are, you better do some googling. \n\nIn the past year I've visited these buffets and here's my analysis:\n\nCaesars Bacchanal: most selection, most expensive, and they change up seasonal items.\n\nWynn The Buffet: most decorative, best presentation, good place to impress guests. \n\nCosmo Wicked: best dessert items, good food quality, and the top item for me is bone marrows. \n\nBellagio and Paris both were underwhelming. Especially Bellagio was over priced, dark, and food was on par with country buffet.  \n\nAria had the best balance between ambience and quality. Another perk of being MGM Pearl member and above is to skip long buffet lines. Mlife forever!
