I took my lunch break today and cruised over to check out The Life Cube on 9th Street and Fremont. I felt the urge to participate in this creative venture!\n\nAs pulled into the parking lot, the cube was so colorful and bright. What I observed was artists painting and leaving their creations for all to enjoy, other people sitting in or near the cube taking in the electronic music being played by some cool DJ's. There were also smaller cubes surrounding the Life Cube that were decorated with paint, quotes, cartoons, dates and memorials of those gone from this world. The back wall of the cube was covered with hundreds of hand drawn pictures, wishes and dreams. I\n\nIt was such an upbeat and positive vibe and at one point I just stood inside the cube and took it all in surrounded by cool and unique artistic expressions. Today and tomorrow are the last days to get down there and get your \"paint on\" or you can simply submit a wish card with a goal or dream you may have.\n\nI really love and enjoy the emerging art community that has been developing here in the downtown area and this was a great way to spend my lunch break!.
