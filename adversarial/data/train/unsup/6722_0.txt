HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! DON'T GO HERE!!! Worst service I've ever received!!!! Felt extremely discriminated by the staff. Never coming back and telling everyone I know about the terrible service here. If you have to go and get a waitress named Alex, REQUEST A DIFFERENT ONE!!! Extremely rude!!! Such a shame too because the food was good, but the service experience I received had completely ruined my night.
