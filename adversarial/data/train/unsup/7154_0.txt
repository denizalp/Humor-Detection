I must say that I expected a lot of Aria and the City Center in general. After some recommendations we were convinced this would be a great choice for a friends bachelorette party since we were all on a tight budget and the rates were great at $119 per night. \n\nUpon arrival, the checkout lines are very long and super unorganized. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. \nWe asked for connecting rooms and I must say this was the best\/worst part of the trip. \n\nOne room had MANY problems but the biggest was a a putred smell in the toilette\/bathroom area. This problem was attempted to be cleaned but nothing would help. The room itself was very small for a Vegas hotel room, the lighting was confusing and would turn off during showers, and the TV would freeze every minute. \n\nThe other room was just as small, had TV problems but no smell in the bathroom. \n\nWe were so frustrated with the problem in one room as 8 girls had to use one bathroom for most of the trip, we tried to call several times for an engineer to come up but realized that most of the staff just doesnt have enough training. Every person on the phone had a different answer to the same question and one example being \"Do you have an in house Dr?\" One person says no, the other yes. This is a basic safety question. \n\nSince we were all set up for the bachelorette, on the last day a manager offered to move us to another room but we would have to seperate the group which wouldnt work for us. \n\nIn the end, we told them the entire story, all our frustrations and they comped us the total charge for the one room that had issues. The manager was very professional and we appreciated the comp. \n\nI can tell you that I will not be staying at the Aria again as I also didnt really like being away from everything, no affordable options to eat anything in the hotel, weird scent throughout, small pools and in general, it needs to have more of the Vegas flare in terms of service. Maybe in a year or two it will work out these kinks and I might try it again.
