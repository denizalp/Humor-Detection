Fusion cuisine - Japanese and Brazilian mix - which I, personally, am not particularly fond of. The food there is relatively cheap as compared to some of the other sushi places in Vegas however be prepared to shell out a lot for the quality ingredients.\n\nFirst off, the Kobe (A5 grade) although very good, was not as good as the one I had at Shibuya. Most notable was the Kobe on the rock. (Feel free to skip the Kobe on a platter of mushrooms as it was on okay and not really worth the money as the Kobe was a lot more well done). Moreover the sashimi Kobe was a little to this for my tastes and not as lean as I would have liked. As for the fish you can't go wrong with the Otoro or Yellowtail. As for the rolls the Yamato was decent\/normal, same with the Neo Tokyo, nothing really special (ie. skippable). The service was extremely good as our water cups rarely ran low and the manager was very helpful in getting the bill comped. \n\nAll in it wasn't too bad of a restaurant however it is unlikely one that I would pay for especially with the number of other foods in Vegas.
