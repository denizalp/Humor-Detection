My review is a one star, which is my opinion.  Here are the facts about my business with them.\n1. Came out timely to do estimate\n2. Quote comparable to other companies.\n3. Signed contract with items of importance bolded. \n4. Was called to schedule repair , was told only 2 jobs that day and mine was first.  However couldn't give an exact time.\n5. Workers showed up at 11am ( we ran out quick at 10:30 and we were on our way home, they left a message because the dog ran out in the yard, they left. We immediately called back (less than 2 minutes later) and said we would be there in 5 minutes and the refused to return.\n6. rescheduled ....for Wednesday...4 days later. One day before, they called and said it would be the Wednesday of the following week. I told Almeida that I was desperate to get it repaired as it had multiple severe leaks and we had those big storms coming in  (early June).  They couldn't help, although they left on Saturday. They were suppose to be there by 7 am, you'd think they would find a way to squeeze me in .  Anyway, a family friend repaired the roof the next day.\n7. Almeida requested the 35% cancel fee, which was not bolded in the 2 page contract.  \n35% was to be charged for materials.  I asked once the fee was paid could I have the materials , they said no. They did lower it to 25% of the contract. $250.
