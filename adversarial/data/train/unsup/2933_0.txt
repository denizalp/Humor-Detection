This is exactly the type of place we need more of in Vegas. Friendly people. Local flavors. Casual and welcoming atmosphere. Dog-friendly too!\n\nI bookmarked this place due to all the great reviews. I must thank Chastine V for tempering the hype by providing a not-so-great review. I like to keep my expectations in check when trying a new place.\n\nI will admit, I'm really not much of a coffee connoisseur. Then again, I could say that about everything I ever try. I just know what I like. At Sambalatte, everything I've had so far has been to my liking. On my first visit, I had their Chocolate Cappuccino. I enjoyed the chocolate flavor to the last drop, but was disappointed that it didn't come with any coffee art.\n\nI got to talking to one of the ladies who works there and she recommended the Flat White, so that's what I tried on my next visit. This time, it came with coffee art! I'm so easy to please.\n\nDid I mention that they have board games to play? Nuff said. 4 stars. I'm a fan.
