It is cash-only, but there is an instant teller at the back toward the washrooms. This place is the perfect place to bring people from out of town, as it attracts a wide variety of Torontonians. The best part is that you don't even have to look at the menu prices- they are easily the lowest prices in Toronto. They have a great patio, even though the chairs are plastic lawn chairs, and the background music is always interesting and great (I suspect the employees hand pick it). The servers are attentive, helpful and friendly. There is a wide variety of food and drinks to choose from, and though it's nowhere near fine dining, you still leave feeling spoiled. Especially from the surprise that you get at the end: when the bill comes, it's 2\/3 the price you thought it would be.
