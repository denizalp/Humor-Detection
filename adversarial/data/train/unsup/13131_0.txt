It's vegas and the music is cranked up on a saturday night.  The setting is dim and cool, the hostesses gorgeous and the service attentive.   Adding to that is a great, reasonably priced contemporary sushi\/asian-fusion restaurant.\n\nFor their food, there's a great use of flavor to complement fresh fish; the yellowtail jalapeno and scallop soy (with citrus and chili oil) are great.  Their tartare with taro chips (we tried the hamachi) highlights the fish with less cream and the same to be said about their rolls and sides (wonderful mushrooms).\n\nThere's a decent new world wine list as well.
