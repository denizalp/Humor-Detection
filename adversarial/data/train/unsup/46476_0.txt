Came all the way to NDG for some authentic Turkish kebobs. I had the mixed meat plate, which consisted of chicken, lamb and meatball kebab and some salads on the side. Let me just say, the portions are HUGE. One plate was plenty for two people. I couldn't even finish half of it and gave the rest to my boyfriend who was more than happy to devour it for himself. all in all, the kebabs are alright, not bad for turkish\/middle eastern kebabs, but not quite worth coming all the way to NDG for either. \n  The price was reasonable, around $14 for the large plate, which can be shared generously among two people.
