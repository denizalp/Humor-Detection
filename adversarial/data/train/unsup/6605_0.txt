Conveniently located at the Linq strip across from Ceasar's Palace, this is the one place where my husband and I literally stopped at EVERY DAY we were in town (4 days). The gelato is probably in the top 5 I've had in the United States (and we eat A LOT of gelato).\n\nMy husband went crazy for their affogato. He would get chocolate gelato with espresso poured over with whipped cream. It would be served in a pretty glass dish with a spoon. I stuck with just ordering plain gelato and trying a variety of flavors. Every flavor I tried was really good, but my favorites were the pistachio and good 'ol fashioned vanilla (I'm a classic flavor kind of person). Definitely a must-stop on the Strip! It's 100% worth the calories!
