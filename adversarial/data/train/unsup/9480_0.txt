NEGATIVE STAR REVIEW. My review has been updated because of the continued HARASSMENT I have received since posting a 1 star. \nI DID NOT PAY FOR MY SERVICE & I REFUSE TO PAY FOR A SERVICE I DID NOT AUTHORIZE, NOR WILL I PAY AFTER being INJURED & BULLIED. MY EYE WAS CUT. Imagine going to a salon and asking for a trim and they slice your scalp with a razor. \n\nI utilize Yelp reviews, to determine which places to use and which to avoid. I also understand that making everyone happy is not always possible. I chose Sassy Lashes because they had amazing reviews, with a few negative. \n\nI have seen other one star reviews posted and removed in the last week on Sassy Lashes. (If anyone else has experienced the amount of bullying I am receiving, I can understand why they might remove it). However, I love that Yelp provides a place to share my honest experience with others, and you can see through her response and my photos, proof that I am not exaggerating (owner is cyber-stalking me). \n\nOn 3\/18\/17, Shauna (owner) got me in on a cancellation. I met with Maria who during our conversation said she had been doing lashes for 3 years, 2 of that was just on friends and family (while she was raising a young child \"totally fine\" props to working moms), and now she was here. I showed her a older photo of myself and how I like my lashes to be. She sounded pretty confident she could recreate that look, and showed me a SINGLE option (ONE OPTION, NOT MULTIPLE SETS, which I assumed was because I only asked for 1 mixed set, I assumed that was the one being shown) She said would create a natural look. During the lash application, the tape under the lower right eye slipped up and into my eye. Maria apologized and fixed the tape so I could be more comfortable. \n\nWHEN I SAW MY LASHES, I was SHOCKED (not in a good way, in a 'OMFG what did you do'??! way). This WAS NOT what I asked for, they were NOT NATURAL, I did mention to Maria I was NOT HAPPY with this, it was NOT OK for my job. I asked if there was a way to trim them back a little, she asked me to wait it out and she could adjust it when I came back in for a followup with shorter lashes. \n\nReluctantly when I went to pay, the owner texted that the service was $210, instead of the $130 she had quoted me earlier. She said it was because I had received a LA Lash Box set. At NO time before, during, or at any other point, was ANYTHING DIFFERENT discussed than what I said I wanted. I told Maria I WASN'T going to pay that, she had another customer waiting, and told me to talk to the owner about it because it was out of her authority.\n\nI asked to speak with the owner, who was not on the premises. I waited to speak to someone for maybe 5 mins, everyone was busy. I texted the owner, let her know I was NOT GOING TO PAY this new price she was now quoting me since that was not the price I was expected to pay. I DID AVOID ANSWERING HER CALLS AT THAT POINT since it felt like I was being CONNED, I advised her I prefer to keep the messages to text, so that way I could have proof of the conversation. \n\nI was very upset at this point, my eye was hurting, my lashes were too long, no lash tech available to FIX OR RESOLVE the issue, so I left, I was not going to pay for what happened or how I was being treated. I did not respond to her texts while I was driving (it's illegal), and when I did stop to read the messages the owner had made said she was going to \"call it in\" because I hadn't paid for service. \n\nTHAT'S THE POINT AT WHICH I STOPPED COMMUNICATING. You \"call it in\" and I will YELP my experience.\n\nShe's determined to call me a liar, defame me through false claims, proof?. There is no reasoning with someone who behaves this way. I wish I had saved the other reviews that claimed \"acts like a teenage bully\". Maybe they will be brave enough to post again. \n\n24 hrs after lashes my eye was hurting more, and it felt like a papercut in my eye. On Monday I had to take off work to see the Optometrist. Luckily he said it would heal and should feel better in a few days. Gave me some drops to provide comfort while healing. \n\nWithin a few days lashes were ware already starting to fall out or turn sideways. That is when I decided to YELP:\n\nI have provided photos of the following:\n1. What I asked for vs. I ended up with.\n2. Compare Lash Box LA set, next to mine.\n3. The cut to my eye \/ note from doctor. \n4. Proof of my payment to nail salon (since she accused me of dipping out on my service there, to make that allegation and say that is not the salon I patron without proof to back it up-this is libel defamation).\n5. Text message\/screenshots (to show conversation of price and additional harassment from alternate #, saying she contacted my employer).\n6. A photo where she accuses me of making a fake profile (using personal\/private info and violating YELP policy). \n7. Collected lashes that have fallen out, under 7 days.\n\nI ONLY HAVE ONE YELP PROFILE, but now I question all the pos+ reviews. \nFake profiles? Maybe yours.
