I really enjoyed the food here.  The menu and selection is huge for an all you can eat.  The portions were not skimpy at all--not even for items ordered a la carte.  The people we came with all thought it was good value for the money and we would've paid more if they charged us.\n\nEdited to add:  A group of us went for lunch.  I would recommend going a little early as we did (around 11:45am) as we got better service because the lunch crowd wasn't in yet.  A 1\/2 hour later the place was packed and there was a line up out the door to get in.  It was quite busy.  The staff handled themselves well considering how busy it was that day.
