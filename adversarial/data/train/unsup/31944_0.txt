This review is long overdue.  I visited Slice On Broadway in January of this year and found the food to be exceptional.  Finally made it back and just as I remember .. everything was delcious.  I couldn't decide on a hoagie or pizza .. . so I got a slice AND a hoagie.   I love that slices are available!!  Not many establishments offer \"slices\"  **** AND I am a huge fan of nyc pizza ..since its thin.\n\n$4.50 for a slice of pepp.  Onto the hoagies.. just the word \"hoagie\" puts a smile on my face.    I like the selection of hoagies..  pretty interesting.   I was sold on the \"Gonzo\" after I read steak, bacon, and Gorgonzola !  The hoagies are $10.00 and served on a bagquette roll.  Smaller than a regular hoagie size but just slightly.  Everything was fresh and was very pleased with my meal... but the only thing missing they could've made a perfect steak hoagie was if tomato was added..Ok so the price is slightly above average but its worth it. \n\nyes yinz..the pizza slice was \"life changing\".   I look forward to my next visit!  Thanks Slice On Broadway!
