I find the pho here to be ok. But what strikes me most about the place is just how terrible the service is. They bring food out in whatever order suits them. Twice I've found myself watching my soup cool while waiting up to ten minutes for my companion's to arrive. Appetizers are a bit dried out and the dipping sauces are watered down.  Greens for the soup are skimpy. So despite decent soup, they've really find a lot of ways to leave me I unsatisfied. I managed to pay at the cashier without even a hint of smile, eye contact or other human kindness. \n\nGiven how little effort is put into the front of house, I'm concerned about what goes on in the kitchen. Not going back.  What a waste.  It would would have taken very little effort to have made this a five star review.
