Visited this place with cousins \n\nFood was good \nHave a good spread of meats and vegetables\nDecent pricing for Saturday night\n\nSeafood not part of the buffet but you can order seafood \ndishes on the side if u r really craving seafood. I did that and \nthe fish dish was amazing.\n\nThey also have Pani puri which we all thought was the icing on the cake.\n\n(Wish if you don have to stand and make your own pani puris)\n\nHope they can get the Pani puri section in another area and not \nwhere the salads are kept so people can take their time to make \nthem. \n\nOverall was good food and service. Until the next Indian craving ........surely will visit
