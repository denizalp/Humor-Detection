Took me a while to find this place the other day but glad I did.  The big sign on the building was \"pineapple express\" which was funny.  Only gave three stars because the posted price on yelp and other sites for the manapua (which was very good, almost as good a Libby's in Kalihi).  Internet price is $2 but when you go here it's posted at $2.75--that's a .75 cent increase which is very high just for manapua.  Three guys running the place and they were very friendly and open to wala'au with the customers-good feeling.  Don't go by the yelp menu prices because they are so wrong.  I'll be back for the ono manapua sometime down the road but with the price it's a little to high for a constant buy.
