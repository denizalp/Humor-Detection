It's a cute place.  The service was excellent. It was hard to choose from all the great-sounding items on the menu.  For the first ten minutes of my visit, I was really happy with it.  Then the food came.\n\nOhmigod, it was GROSS!  I ordered fettuchini with goat cheese, expecting a pile of noodles, some alfredo-ish sauce and cheese over the top, and maybe if I was lucky a few pine nuts or tomato bits or herbs.  Nuh-uh.\n\nIt was like somebody took a huge glob of cafeteria noodles, rolled them around in a cup of grated cheese, put a stick of butter on top and microwaved the whole mess on high for a minute.  The garlic bread was the kind of roll you'd use to make a sub sandwich dipped in some garlic butter.  My dog has deposited more appealing piles on the back lawn after gorging on leftovers.   Checking out the other tables, I doubt anything else would have been a better choice.\n\nThis is what they call comfort food--what Mom would give you to cheer you up after your Little League team lost or something.  I suppose people like this stuff because of the emotional connotations, I don't know.  My actual mom knew how to cook.  She would have called this stuff \"white food.\"  The servings are huge, except for the side salad which could have fit in a teacup.\n\nMany people love this diner.  If you're a mac-and-cheese type person, you may very well love it too.
