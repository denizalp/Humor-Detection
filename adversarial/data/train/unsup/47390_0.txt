Went in to just buy a 9.5 degree driver to replace my 10.5 degree.  Planned to get in and out quickly and be on my way.  When I got to the register the guys suggested that we swing the driver to be sure.  The good news is after hitting 3 drivers and adjusting the length of the club I picked up a new driver that fits my body and swing.  I know it is the indian and not the arrow, but I am really pleased with the process.
