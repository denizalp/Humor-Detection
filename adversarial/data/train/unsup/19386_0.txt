I live 2 blocks away from Taco Mich.. rolled in one night wasted and ate head and tongue tacos and was in LOVE!!! Came back a couple days later to see if it was cause I was drunk... NOPE!! Taco Mich is the real deal people!! Get over the fact its kinda shady lookin and try it out.. its Central Phoenix afterall but I love my hood!!! I get 4 tacos (doesnt even matter what kind) and a Horchata for 6.66 almost everyday haha.. one thing to add that I think enhances it all is the lime, jalapeno, and carrot bar.. make sure every bite contains these ingredients and I promise you your journey in finding the ultimate\/best street taco will be complete.
