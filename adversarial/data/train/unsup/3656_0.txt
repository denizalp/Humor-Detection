I have yet to eat at bad restaurant at the Red Rock hotel. They're doing something right. I had a really satisfying meal at Cabo. Not to mention, HUGE. Talk about Las Vegas portions, all of the plates were bigger than my face. \n\nThis is the first Mexican restaurant I've been to that gives you 3 different salsas and refried beans with your tortilla chips to munch on before your meal. The beans were awesome although I was farting all night. I should have taken one of those Bean-O things, because supposedly \"there'll Bean-O gas.\" Anyway, it was worth it. 3 huge tacos w\/ rice and beans for 12.99? Not too shabby.\n\nAlthough I didn't quite feel like I was in Cabo, they don't rush you out of the door so it's a great place to come eat and hang out with friends for a couple hours. I also saw good number of people on dates here as well. I'll be back to eat at Cabo again since I'm at the Red Rock pretty often as of late.
