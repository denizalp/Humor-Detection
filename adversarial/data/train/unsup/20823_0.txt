Second time there and last...\nI didn't have cash so I paid with my debit and \nI can't stand when the nail tech ask you for cash even dough you are giving a debit card on their faces, it is soooo rude, it is not right and over that they make not a good face.. The good news is that I report them and soon they will have a under cover visit,  (actually I report 2 different Chinese places for trying to void taxes).\nThe guy who seams to be the owner siting in front of my face with his feet up and watching a Video out loud on his phone.. He need to realize that this is his work and not his house...RESPECT!!!!\n\nAnd the best part is when I have to tell my nail tech \nthat I hope she realize that she forgot and skip to give me the massage..What a visit.. Never again!
