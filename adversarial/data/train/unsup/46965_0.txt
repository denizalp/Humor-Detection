Dr. Linder is an outstanding dermatologist. She is thorough and personable.  But I do have a serious problem with the individuals who answer the phone for appointments and the work at the front desk.  They act like they are doing you a favor and I'm never sure if they are truly giving me the first available opening for an appointment.  \n\nOnce I tried to purchase a product but I couldn't remember the exact name of the product. I asked the woman at the front desk to look up my file to see if it was listed. She said that I had never purchased the product from the office.  I knew I had.  I went home found the empty container and took it back.  Low and behold when I showed her the container she was able to find that I had indeed purchased it.  I'm not sure if they are consciously being difficult or just don't care about the quality or lack of customer service. I wish Dr. Linder would take the time to make sure that the individuals who greet her patients and answer the phone behaved as professionally as she does.
