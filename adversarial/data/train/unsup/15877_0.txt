Friendly service and food was made fresh when we came in to order. The only downside is portions are small and the macaroni salad was horrible! I wanted to give this place a try because it isn't a chain hawaiian BBQ place and I'm a big supporter of mom & pop shops, but Golden Hawaiian wasn't as good as L&L or Aloha Hawaiian BBQ. We got the bbq chicken & chicken katsu combo as well as spam musubi. The musubi had way too much rice so it was thick and tall, the seaweed was falling apart and couldn't hold the musubi together. I was so disappointed with the mac salad that I stopped eating it after the first bite. The bbq chicken was good, but I wished they gave us extra sauce on the side. They only gave us the katsu sauce. Their chicken katsu was good! Very nice crunchy exterior and not too oily. I've been to a lot of hawaiian bbq places back home in socal so maybe I had too high of expectations after a long hike
