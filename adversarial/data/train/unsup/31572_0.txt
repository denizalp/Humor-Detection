W. T. Freakazoid.  For the price it is not with it.  Service was fast and friendly but the food was lacking flavor and the selection wasn't all that great for a buffet.  The money they ask for would be better spent at one of the regular restaurants (or just spent on drinks at a bar) with a good entree and drink.
