We stayed here on a Thursday night for $28 (Used a Groupon deal)\n\n- No Resort Fee! I love this! \n- Free Wi-Fi at Bistro 57\n- No Longer a Station Casino! 11\/2012 \n- 4 Diamond hotel! Great view and very clean hotel room. Lots of pillows and sealed shower. Comfortable toilet seats with a V shape made with the toilet paper! \n- One of the most comfortable sleeps I had in a long time. \n- Phones say Welcome to me personally!\n- Fancy and spacious fitness center on the 2nd floor. Impressive view of the pool. \n- Nice pool. We got in at night for free rather than paying $10 :)\n- Player's Card\n*$3 to $1000 in free slot play\n*10k points on your birthday week. Equivalent to $10 credit. \n- Even a 6 deck blackjack has no mid-entry! WTF. No $3 Roulette machine.  \n- Great value! I hope they do it again sometime.
