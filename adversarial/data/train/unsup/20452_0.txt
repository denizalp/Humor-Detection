I love Jimmy John's but I simply despise this location. Service is always horrendous, delivery can take up to an hour (which is deplorable for a company that advertises \"freaky fast delivery\"). They are unable to follow simple instructions on how my sandwich should be prepared, every single time without fail they forget to do something as simple as no tomatoes, cut the sandwich in half or take mayo packets. But today was the icing on the cake, since delivery can always take up to an hour I got sick and tired of giving them a tip if it was late, so lo and behold the last two days I have ordered a sandwich the delivery guy REFUSED to leave my office until I came down and gave him a tip. When our receptionist told him that she could sign for it he informed her he was waiting until I gave him a tip and that he was an hourly employee and could wait around all day. Just wow.
