I went here ages ago and accidentally left my rant on their other page...you know, the separate restaurant that is literally physically connected but somehow a totally separate business entity. If you have to explain to your customers on your OTHER Yelp page that they've left a review at \"the wrong restaurant\", you done messed up on your branding, yo.\n\nAnyway, you'd think after all these rants about your dumbass dress code bullshit you'd try to loosen up a bit. After all, you're located near Ghettrocenter. But nah, you stick to those guns! Bring that 2-star review down to 1! You can do it!
