Horible experience with this company! They called me several times untill I finaly accepted their offer to tune up my HVAC and add up to 1lb of freon for $19.95. Today the \n\n*Tech comes out an hour after the 3 hour window quoted.\n\n* Quotes me \"$1500 in much needed repairs\" but tells me he is such an honest peson that he wouldnt allow himself to do these repairs \"on such an old unit\" and the the \"right thing to do would replace the whole unit\" and he can get me a great price of $9800, abviously their goal all along is sell new units. Quick to provide a price but can't tell me the name brand or model of the unit he is trying to sell me \n\n*Breaks the exaust\/ output pipe on my system doesn't even tell me until I point it out and then tries to charge me $180 to fix what he broke.  Really?? he asks me what to I expect the system is old ... Does a Micky mouse tape job before leaving\n\n* tech absolutely refuses to add any freon to my system even though he said it reads low\n\nThis company is pathetic. My wife did not want me to pay them the $19.95 and I shouldnt but like i told the tech (i will not call him Man) I am a Man and have integrity and payed what I had agreed to pay.
