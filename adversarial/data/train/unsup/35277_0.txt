I had a bad experience here, and won't ever be back. The food is good, the servers were efficient, but the managers made me feel very unwelcome. \n\nI went for dim sum, and got there by 10:20, to make it for the pre-11am discounted dim sum price. I was seated by 10:50, but was charged full price when the bill came. Apparently, they announced early that the discounted price time was over, but in Chinese, so I was unaware when my number came up. It didn't matter that I was seated before 11am or that I couldn't understand their warning. They had entered it on the iPad, and that was that. I was polite but insistent that this wasn't right, but they went with the, \"we told you\" line and then walked away and ignored me until they saw me pull cash out of my wallet, at which point I suddenly existed again. \n\nBottom line, it's good food in a restaurant run by bad people. Whether you go or not depends on what's important to you. Just don't expect them to care about you if you're unhappy.
