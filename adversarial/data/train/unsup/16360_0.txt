So this really breaks my heart to do this as this has been my go to grocery store for a few years now. First and foremost this has absolutely nothing to do with the amazing staff who are always friendly and helpful. I used to shop at Albertson's until I caught on to there Buy 1 Get 2 Free scam. For example... Their baby back ribs were $8.99\/lb. but at other stores it was only like $3.49 at Von's. Nothing was \"free\" because they just jacked up the price. So I started shopping at Von's and really liked the increasing variety of organic produce. About a month ago I noticed Von's had a Buy 1 Get 2 Free. Before I got to excited I saw that they seemed to follow suit of Albertson's and also high jacked the price. Boo! But I still continued to go as I really did like their produce section. Well, they seemed to be out of a lot of the fresh herbs lately as well as organic lemons. Didn't think much about it since sometimes it's just a timing thing. But after several trips and they still didn't have any organic citrus I finally inquired about it. To my surprise I was told that they were actually out of a lot of things since the merger. Perplexed I asked who they merged with. Grrr.... They merged with Albertson's!!! Well that explains the new \"sales\"....  Umm... Isn't this becoming a monopoly??? Again, the staff there has always been great and this store is squeaky clean. I will continue to shop there for the time being until I come up with Plan B.
