Preface to review, I am a long time fan of this Vegas buffet. We had a group of 6 on March 26, 2016 for dinner. I enjoyed the quality and taste of food, but half the group considered it slightly above average. Bellagio is not cheap but a few bucks less than the buffets at Caesar's and Wynn. Crab legs were good, caviar ok, prime rib and rack of lamb good, sushi bad, street tacos good, service ok, deserts good to above average.   It's consistent in quality and range of choices, albeit not near Caesar's. $44 a person equated to 2 hours of dining. Definitely a good choice for Vegas buffet. Foodie out.
