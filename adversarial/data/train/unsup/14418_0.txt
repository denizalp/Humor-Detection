We Came here for the Ka Cirque du Soleil show.\n\nAnd while the theater is fantastic the rest of the resort is somewhat old and tacky. It didn't help that it was National Rodeo Finals...talk about drunk cowboys..yikes.\n\nThe casino is old and tired too.\n\nI think there are much better options on the strip.
