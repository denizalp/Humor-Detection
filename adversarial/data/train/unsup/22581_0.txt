Not sure if they got their name from their shady staff or because they enjoy throwing shade. \n\nI'm pretty active in the community when it comes to assisting homeless people. This place is by far one of the worst in town. First of all, if you have a donation, they leave the items outside in the parking lot. What gives? \n\nMen are not permitted here, for obvious reasons (it's a shelter for women and children), but if you say you're transitioning into becoming a woman  then you're welcome. It's kind of a gray area if you ask me, but I digress. \n\nThe service here is atrocious. If I'm a battered woman, then the last thing I'd want to hear is what are you doing? Please lose the attitude and show more compassion for those who are in immediate need.
