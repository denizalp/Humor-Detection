i stayed at this location last friday and i was very upset with the quality of the service there, they were very rude! they food was undercooked and they would not reheat anything after i explained to them the customers always right they put me in a padded room for 72 hours. Once i got removed from that cell they put me in population and it was like MMA tournament had to fight 15 mexicans for a bed to sleep on. After i knockedout 15 people i made bail and got released didnt even use the bed. i would not recommend staying there
