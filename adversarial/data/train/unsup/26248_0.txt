We found this hidden gem one night. We tried a variety of food...garlic knots, pizza, spaghetti, wings, and even a philly cheese steak sandwich. All were amazing!  We spent 4 years living in Europe and this restaurant is the real deal! But the best part was how we were treated. They immediately took care of us and talked to us like family. We will definitely be back!
