Teeny tiny little shop in the indoor middle of Jean Talon Market (next to Wawel) full of the purest goodness: PIE. Specifically: MAPLE SUGAR PIE. It's so small, it's just amazing how much magic is in here. The staff are always so sweet and easy-going and the amount of different kinds of deliciousness stacked into just 2 tiny glass displays is a marvel of science and engineering. For a quick inexpensive dinner we grab quiche or tourtière from here all the time. The pie crust is flakey, perfect, buttery, fresh made daily. The quiches are all super yum but the one with the spinach, feta and slices of lemon roasted on top is my favorite.  The meat pies (tourtière) taste just like the ones my Quebecois friends' moms make, ie; hearty, face-the-winter-worthy, savoury little pockets of comfort. \n\nBut enough of this, who cares about savoury, get to the sugar! \n\nThe caramel chip cookies, lemon bars, brownies are all sit-down-shut-up-close-your-eyes-and-pay-attention level good. The sugar pies come from another planet, which is actually just a forest in Quebec where they tap the trees and add butter and TADAHH the angels sing. \n\nAround the holiday season I noticed folks lining up and ordering pies not visible in the front display. They really crank up the magic mid-December, the entire store area (like 6ft square) gets filled up with these racks of pies of all different kinds and people buy 6 at a time. I'm talking pear and pine nut, chocolate cranberry pecan, mixed nut pie, stuff I don't even know about yet. Fricken holiday miracles every one.
