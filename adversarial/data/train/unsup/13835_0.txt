We've come to know this location as Bad Fry's even though such a connotation suggests there must be a 'Good Fry's' somewhere. Just off the light rail, anchoring a shopping center with a McDonald's and a Verizon store, this store is truely ghetto. \n\n\nCon: EVERYONE constantly hitting you up for money in the parking lot. I'm serious - I've had ladies come up to me as I am getting in my car (\"Excuse me...how are you doing? Hi....I'm trying to.....\") and after I immediately wave them off and tell them no, they turn and get in the vehicle parked right next to me! There is no shame amongst these people.\n\nPro: These people will sell you thier SNAP benefits for pennies on the dollar. Cash is king and there is a Wells Fargo with an ATM just inside the store. Stick it to the manufactured food lobbyists by using those food stamps for fresh produce (their produce isn't horrible)! \n\n____________________\n\nPro: They put a Starbucks inside the store. Right when you walk in. Very convenient for when you know you're going to need to brave these narrow aisles with a cart. There is even a little sitting area with tables and a television.\n\nCon: The seating area is full of parking lot people and often stinks to high hell. Also, people don't seem to get not leaving their carts right in the way, so if you enter and head towards the produce, there will likely be carts which have been left right in the way.\n\n____________________\n\nIn all, it's a dump. But it's a bit of a food desert over there (AJ's doesn't count) for groceries so, I guess, if you need to grab a gallon of milk and have a few bucks for a guy who is trying to catch the bus to get across town and can spare ten dollars to help some lady out with her, I don't know probably liquor, then you'll have a good time at Bad Fry's.
