I love this doctor.  His staff, however, is a completely different story!  He needs to get his staff organized if he expects repeat patients.  I spent 10 minutes on the phone and the receptionist found an appt to squeeze us in.  Was very appreciative! Only to get a phone call 2 hours later to cancel it because apparently the first girl didn't know what she was doing!  I am trying to keep with the dr because I think he is great.  About to leave as a patient because of his staff!
