This place is a true Toronto staple. Everyone knows someone who knows someone who saw the Stones play here.\n\nThe beer is cheap, and the rotation of local and visiting bands is always stellar.\n\nThey must serve some sort of food, but I've never seen it. I'm really thinking hard... and I've never seen it.  \n\nI feel the staff has been here forever, which is bad and good They're pretty old school rock n' roll and don't give a crap, but they're super fast on the taps. \n\nThe bathrooms are the dirtiest in the city, BUT they're not downstairs which I enjoy. (WHY are all Toronto bathrooms downstairs?!) \n\nNB: A lot of people come here straight from work and don't eat, so by 10PM there are some seriously drunk folks roaming about. I may or may not be guilty of this from time to time...
