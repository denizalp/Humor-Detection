Everyone was friendly and accommodating. We came here on vacation and decided to avoid the high prices at the hotel spa. I had an 80 minute Swedish massage. It was a very good massage and I was very relaxed. \n\nThe reason I give it 4 stars is it was still pretty expensive for an average massage and no robes or shoes were offered. I would recommend coming here if you're looking for a bit of pampering, local or visiting. But I think if I came back I'd just do a facial and do the massage back home where I get more bang for my buck.
