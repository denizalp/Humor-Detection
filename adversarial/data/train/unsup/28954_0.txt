A new favorite breakfast spot of ours. It's been here forever and we've never been. But their pancakes are super yummy. The rest of the breakfast food is nothing special but the pancakes are delicious. Kids breakfast portion for the scrambler is pretty good too. And if your child brings a bear with them on tuesday, they eat free.
