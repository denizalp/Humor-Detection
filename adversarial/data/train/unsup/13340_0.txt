Mediocre breakfast. \n\nWe were in the neighborhood and STAHHHRVING so we yelped away and found T.C. Eggington's. Awww what a cute name. And such cute decor. I simply must know where the waitresses got those high waisted pleated khaki shorts. Anyway.\n\nI ordered two eggs over easy with bacon, english muffin and fruit and he ordered the strawberry pancakes. \n\nMy food was just not very hot, the bacon was super greasy and the muffin was cold with only a kiss of butter. It ate it all after covering it in Cholula (which makes anything good) and it was fine.\n\nThe strawberries on his pancakes had clearly been frozen and there was no sauce to speak of. It was all topped with about a liter of whipped cream making the whole thing more like dessert than breakfast. \n\nOverall, the service was good, but the food came out slowly and wasn't worth the wait. \n\nI would not return.
