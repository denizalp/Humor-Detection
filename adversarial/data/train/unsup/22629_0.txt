So there is no dude named Big Wong cookin in the back...\n\nBut they shoulda named it Big Right instead of Big Wrong, cuz they got the food right!\nI had the beef ramen special;\nTender morsels of beef, tendon also available, broth very tasty, they have green onions as a condiment (cool) cuz I luv me some onyawns....\nAnd for 5.95, it can't be beat!  Food came out in like 3 minutes...\nIf you're on the go for lunch, this is way better than any burger or subway!\nThis is an above average rice plate shop, so you have to have a good Chinese palate cuz there ain't any eggrolls here or sweet n sour pork.... Real deal stuff that some peeps may have never seen before... I mean nothing off the wall like intestines or pigs feet or  wax on the nipples, oooops thats a different movie...\n\nNext on the menu is the Hoi Nam chickyy:\nServed 3 ways, white, dark or \ndark w bone in, now that's a Chinese thang....\n\nTo be continued.... \n\nDa Wonger
