We really enjoyed the Insalata della Casa with Balsamic Vinaigrette and the Toscana pizza, we really enjoy a thin \"cracker\" like crust. The white Sangria was a disappointment though, it was not very sweet and tasted weak & watered down. \nAll in all a good dining experience. We will return to try out other fare.
