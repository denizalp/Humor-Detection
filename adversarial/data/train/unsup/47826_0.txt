We visited Bubbas while on a trip east with my daughter's school. After a very long day, we were all tired, hungry, and looking for something other than what we couldn't find at home. We were all incredibly impressed with the quality of the food and the creative ideas on the menu. The kids all found specialty burgers that they loved, and the staff handled our large party with poise and grace. Most restaurants balk at a large group of teenagers, but not your staff. Thank you, Bubba's, for feeding our kiddos and giving us all great memories of a fun dinner out!
