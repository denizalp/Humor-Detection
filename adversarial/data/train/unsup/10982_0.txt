Hello? Where's my scheduled rental car?\n\nCame here to rent a car a few minutes before my scheduled reservation.  I went to the check-in counter, and I was told the car wasn't there yet and would be arriving about 15-20 minutes late as it was arriving from the airport.  This was the first time I rented a car from a Hertz location where the car wasn't there.  I was a little upset, and just waited there until the car finally arrived.  Fortunately, I didn't have to wait too long for it as the car came about 10 minutes after my scheduled pick up time.\n\nThe check-in counter is a bit confusing to get to, as it is nestled in a weird corner of the hotel.  You have to walk through the entire casino, past the lobby\/hotel check-in area, through some double doors, and past the pool.  Once you check in at the Hertz counter, you have to go back outside, past the pool, through the double doors, down a hallway and outside to the garage to the 6th floor.  I'd have to say, from start to finish, I probably walked almost a half mile!\n\nI give this Hertz location 2 stars only because it was pretty hard to find the Hertz counter and the rental car was not there at the time of my reservation.
