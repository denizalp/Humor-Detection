Trader Joe's is my steady dealer that gives me a straight shot of Kashi when I need it most.  So, how is it that Kashi costs 33 cents more in Madison, Wisconsin than it does in San Francisco, California?  Bah-humbug.\n\nOverall, this t-joes is like most other t-joes.  Quality stuff at ok-prices if you have trial-and-error patience ... though you'll be lucky if its still in product-rotation the next time you return.  \n\nYes-yes's include pizza dough, greek yogurt, walnuts, dried montmorency cherries, unsulfured-oh-ya apricots, hummus, valrhona chocolate, frozen green beans, moochi ice cream, stone ground crackers, bubbily waters, and macaroons.  \n\nNo-no's include produce, OJ, chips, TJ brand chocolates, cheeses, wine, most of their overpriced frozen dinners.
