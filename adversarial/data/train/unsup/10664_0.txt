I like the overall ambience of this coffee shop. It has a sense of serious coffee and work feel to it. Lots of laptops and discussions going on.\nI ordered a large vanilla latte with whole milk. No problem. It was served in a huge ceramic cup. Awesome. And it tasted great!\nBecause I had heard (read on yelp) that the food here was excellent, we decided to order a scone. At three o'clock in the afternoon, the choices were slim and we had to settle for a blueberry muffin. This was very moist and the blueberries had great flavor.\nYou can also buy a beer or a glass of wine here so everyone who comes here should be able to get what he\/she wants.\nThe art on the walls is a great experience enhancer.
