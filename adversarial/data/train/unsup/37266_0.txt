Mark was very thorough with evaluating the problem with our heating and humidifier system. He was patient in listening to our observations and concerns to help identify the problem's origins along with possible solutions.  He honed in on what needed correction and took appropriate action. Mark followed up and explained to our understanding what happened and what he did to right it. Plus, he cleaned the area! Awesome. We highly recommend him and will continue to call on Kuna for our future heating\/cooling maintenance. Thank you to our neighbor for recommending him and thank you, Mark.
