I really have no idea how to review yogurt places. They all seem the same to me and they're all delicious. And they're always wide open spaces with neon colors and sparse furniture. \n\nThe yogurt here tastes like yogurt and the toppings are plentiful. I typically go for plain or fruity yogurt and pile on the fruit and cheesecake bites (if they're available). \n\nThe only issue I could come up with here was the semi-melty consistency of the yogurt, but I ate it so fast, it didn't even matter.
