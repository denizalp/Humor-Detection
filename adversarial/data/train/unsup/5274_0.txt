I don't know which Cheesecake and Crime this Poly A. person is eating at, but it's sure as hell not the one located on Eastern Ave in Henderson. I've been here a few times and the food is always nice, the staff very friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. \n\nThe cheesecake here is MUCH better than Cheesecake Factory can provide, and the theme of the place is sort of a 20's-40's thing, with the staff being dressed up to fit the theme as well. \n\nI'm not that much into reading, so I can't give a very informed comment about their book selection or whatever, but I do know food and this place is very good for dessert.
