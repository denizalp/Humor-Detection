Overheard in the Gift Shop. \nLady holding up a T shirt that displays a very memorable scene in the movie: \nWhat is that red thing in Ralphie's mouth?\"\nI waited for her to figure it out, but she couldn't. \nSo I answered: \"Soap!\" Duh! of course I didn't say \"Duh\" but you bet your Little Orphan Annie Decoder I wanted to!\n\nLady, you need to go watch this movie again. Because if you call yourself a fan (as I overheard you saying how much you just LOVE this movie), and can't remember simple facts like Ralphie saying the F word,  you are not worthy to gaze upon this house. \n\nYes, I love this movie. I am one of the few that saw this movie during its first run in theaters (way before it became a non-stop 24hour TBS Christmas staple). I know many people wouldn't even think about coming to visit this house but if you're a huge fan and love attention to detail, you would enjoy your visit. \n\nThe house has been restored to it's movie glory. Although only the exterior and some interior shots were filmed here, it's amazing how many details have been re-created to match the movie. The tour is basically a 10-15 minute speech about the background of the movie, filming of the movie and how the house was transformed back its current state. And then you get to tour the house on your own.\n\nWant to play with the Blue Bowling ball the Old Man got for Christmas? It's here. \nWant to sit under the sink like Randy did? You can!\nWant to pose with a replica Red Rider BB Gun? It's here too.\nTouch the leg lamp or open the Fragile box? You bet.  \nThese are replicas of course and perfect for picture ops. But the original ones lie at the museum across the street. \n\nBetween the house and the museum across the street, there's a lot for fans to look at. The gift shop houses tons of souvenirs (and two bathrooms FYI). \nI do agree that the ticket price is a little steep, but pretty much what you'd pay for a movie anyway. A great little diversion during our trip to Ohio.
