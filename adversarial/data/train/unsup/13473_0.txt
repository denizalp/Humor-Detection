I work near this Jamba Juice, and love to get a smoothie on my break or to substitute for a meal occasionally.  \n\nWhen I first started going here, they were great-Fast, friendly, and professional.  They made suggestions and reminded me I could add free boosts to my smoothies.  I was so thrilled I even bought a reusable cup to get 10% off of all future smoothies. \n\nThis place has gone substantially downhill in the past two months.  It seems grimey now when I go in, and really, who wants to consume something from a place that can't wipe the counters or mop the floors peridodically?\n\nThey have messed up my smoothie order the last three times.  \n\nOnce, they accidentally poured my smoothie into a disposable cup, I said not to worry and I'd just take that, and they proceeded to pour in into my reusable cup...which only ended up 2\/3 full.  So...where did the other $2 worth of smoothie go?  I raised my concern, and the man who made it just shrugged.\n\nThe next time, they forgot my discount, and when I asked they just said \"oops, we'll get you next time.\"  Um...I bought your silly  cup, I don't think the 20 Cents you're ripping me off for is really helping you much. I let it go since I was running late for work.  This smoothie also wasn't blended well and I couldn't get much of it through my straw.  I had to use a spoon on the final 1\/3 of my smoothie to get the fruit pieces and ice chunks. \n\nOn my last visit, the moron who took my order must've been drunk, disabled, or both.  She was completely perplexed by my order, which was straight off the menu.  I had to repeat it multiple times, and then she couldn't comprehend what size I wanted.  I showed her my cup, and she still had to call a colleague order to get it entered right.  She also refused to give me my discount, saying she didn't know how.  She didn't take my cup, and I needed to remind her twice I had a resuable cup.  She then asked \"What should I do with this?\" once it was in her hand.  They then poured the wrong smoothie in my cup.  I had to wait for four other smoothies to be made before mine was finally made, and mixed with the remains of the wrong smoothie they had poured in first.  (Yes, I did request they rinse the cup out, but they didn't.)\n\nI called the store and left feedback on their survey after this last visit, yet I received no response, apology, or even a coupon for a discounted smoothie.  \n\nLove your products, Jamba Juice at Gilbert & Germain, but I can't justify spending my money somewhere that can't get simple products and basic customer relations right.
