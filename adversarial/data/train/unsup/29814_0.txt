Ms. Penny is the seamstress who always does my alterations. She is kind and very warm to her patrons. I have had numberous suits altered and pants hemmed by her and she has consistently given me quality service in a timely fashion. She is the only seamstree\/tailor I use and I will continue to use her as long as I live in this city.
