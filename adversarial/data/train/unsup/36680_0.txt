One star because it is a nice dark room in the traditional sense and it fairly well appointed.  Also, there's something behind those walls that understands restaurants, it's just too bad that it falls into the hands of those that have lost their passion for the people that patronize the place. And finally they Yelp won't allow Zero stars.\n\nDecent bar to grab a glass of Champagne and the hostess seemed nice when I said I wanted to have a drink there and hold the table for 15 minutes.  Needed the time to grope and fondle my date before we stuffed our faces just in case it left me incapable of getting my arms later.\n\nVery supportive of foreigners that come here to work and the attitude of professionalism they normally bring to the art of service.  But these \"Captains\" had to be kidding me.  \"No meat\" ok?  At least 15 times without so much of leaving me feel that he understood.  No bacon, no veal stock, chicken, do you understand? No? Yes? Yes but you didn't hear me and brought it anyway?  Which.\n\nThe bill was only $400 for two so I'm not doing the high roller thing but I expect some decent treatment.  bring us the salad why we look at the menu.  No?  You can't?  The chef doesn't allow that?  What?  No?  Are you kidding?  The salad came.  \n\nTake the tired apps you sent out.  Yes they're free but they lack any assemblance of special. \n\nThis was an aggravating dinner when I should have been able to just keep my hands under the table without worry.  Super Tuscan was good but I guess they wanted me to apologize I only dropped $175 when anyone worth their salt would have went for the other bad selections at triple the price.  I know wine. I know it costs, but this wine list is so out of touch.  Great, it's expensive with lots of overpriced stuff.  Once a list like this establishes itself as expensive they think they can go off the chart and get double what other expensive lists get.\n\nRomance the pouring of the wine.  \"We will jam 10 ounces each of wine in your glass and we know you'll buy another. \" Please you freaken idiot.  I ordered a bottle of water to quench and hydrate.  \n\nCaesar was OK.  Lamb dish the babe had was off the chart she said.  The pasta with seafood I had was so bland and so tasteless and so ugly, that I actually asked for lots of Cheese.  i figured I was drunk and I need to eat.  \n\nyes, I think we should all be tough on Il Mulino.  They charge big, live on a stellar reputation.  They are not Olive Garden.  But truthfully the babe digs Olive Garden more.  Easy uncomplicated, what you expect.  Just give me what i expect and don't make me work for it.\n\nNo big deal.
