After being given the gift of a day off today I took it upon myself to have a \"Kris day.\" Yes fellas we can comfortably have these kinda days as well. I slept in, went to the gym, did groceries and loaded my iPhone with new tracks. \n\nBut with all this me time I needed a little more so I decided that my well worn feet deserved some long overdue TLC. \n\nDriving north on Yonge just past Elgin Mills in Richmond Hill, I remembered that there was a nail salon in the Longos plaza so I pulled in to investigate. \n\nI was totally shocked and thankful that at 6:45pm on a weekday Nails For You was open and well staffed. I walked in and was greeted by the familiar \"hay how aw yoi\" of the staff in perfect unison. (I swear the greeting must be part of nail salon training because every salon I've been to has it down pat). \n\nIt didn't look any different from the countless other places is visited for a pedicure but the one distinguishing factor was their fancy looking new massage chairs. Extremely comfortable and the massage felt lost a good as the rel thing. \n\nAlthough the one rolling massage ball that kept poking me in my backside every 2-3 minutes was a little... Outside my comfort zone!?\n\nMy esthetician Tracy was awesome. Gentle and professional. I recommend you ask for her if you make an appointment. Oh and the calf and foot massage at the end? To die for. My eyes actually got heavy near the end!!\n\nPedicure was also $25. So sits at industry standards!
