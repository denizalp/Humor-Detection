This place was way too cool for me - as in, I'm not cool enough to even have gone there!  I walk by all the time, during the day, when looking in it looks like a little convenience store.  Very unassuming. We showed up around 930 pm on a Saturday, and we put our names on a waitlist for a table, which we didn't need, because there was plenty of space at the bar.  (when they phoned us with our table, we just said we were okay at the bar)  The bartender was friendly and easy going, very pleasant staff all around.  The space was incredulously loud, screaming the entire time, which we thought was odd but we didn't realize this place turns into a nightclub!  I saw the little sign that said, Dinner drinks dancing, and had commented, \"Dancing?\"  Well, at midnight, lo and behold, they take away the barstools and everyone was grinding up all over each other.  The clientele was a mix of King Street vibes and hipster, but everyone was really nice and in a really good mood. The music was good.  Drinks and beer selection excellent.  I had a great time!  Bathrooms are annoyingly down a flight of stairs, which I am not sure is a great idea, and only two toilets in the women's so prepare to stand around.
