Never in my life have I had a worse experience at a restaurant. \n\nFirst impressions show a well decorated swanky restaurant. The menu is small, although catered to hibachi, and the sushi menu leaves much to be desired. \n\nWe had a party of nine sitting at the hibachi table, and while the chef was awesome and his personality made the experience a ton of fun, our actual server didn't even deserve her title. 90% of the time there were at least six empty drinks on the table. In a empty restaurant with MAYBE four other tables and plenty of servers, she had nothing but time on her hands to fill up our glasses. She didn't even have to actually bring out our food so what else would she possibly be occupied with that she neglected to give us proper service?\nI finally talked to a manager and asked for him to fill our glasses, and told him the problems we were having. Unbeknownst to me, our lovely waitress had dropped our check off kindly letting us know the gratuity was already included. Mind you, we were in no rush, and hadn't even been asked if we would like dessert (which we all did). Again I talked to the manager, with him apologizing the whole time. Our waitress brought out dessert menus with an attitude, again neglecting to fill up our empty glasses. \nLong story short, after three hours of dinner, my water and tea were left empty for most of the night even after asking multiple times. The manager was no help, and obviously didn't really care about the service his resultant was giving. I have never been more disappointed and will NEVER go back again. The food was bland and the service would've been better if blind\/deaf children were running it.
