I called this Pepboys because I had problems with another Pepboys and asked if they would honor the work warranty at their shop. They said yes, so I made an appointment. After I made an appointment they gave me a hard time about working on the car there. They made it clear they were \"doing me a favor\". My girlfriend took her car in at the same time for an oil change\/ fluid check. We went and got lunch and came back about two hours later. We sat in the waiting room for about an hour and watched as the mechanics didn't touch her or my car. They talked amongst themselves and texted for an hour. Finally we went up to an employee and asked when her car would be ready. They said \"It's been done for a long time. No one told you?\" No, obviously no one did. When we got her car back we found out they hadn't done ANYTHING to it. The customer service rep said she didn't need an oil change for atleast a thousand miles and then put a sticker on her car that said she needed one in 300.\n\nA few hours later- that night the GM (I think his name may have been Dave) called me and told me that his mechanic had spent too much time looking at my car and that he needed to get paid for doing jobs and that I'd have to go back to the original Pepboys (thanks for wasting my time Dave). Dave was unapologetic, rude, and unprofessional. The other employees seemed to be completely clueless.\n\nI don't know why this Pepboys has such good reviews- they're just as sketchy as every other Pepboys. Save your time and go with a different company.
