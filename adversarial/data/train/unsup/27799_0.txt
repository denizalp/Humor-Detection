I have been platinum blonde for a decade. I've seen a lot of salons. This place is INCREDIBLE. Every detail is amazing. It's sleek and modern and comfortable. They'll serve you a glass of cold wine. And if you see Alex you'll get an exceptional scalp massage. And all of that on top of spectacular hair. I couldn't recommend more.
