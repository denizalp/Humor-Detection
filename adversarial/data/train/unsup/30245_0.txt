This is some of the best gelato I have had outside of Italy.  Seriously it's really good and they want you try as much as you want.  I like that they rotate out several of the flavors every week so that it's not all the same each time.  \n\nThis is definitely a stop in and get a scoop when in Downtown Summerlin.
