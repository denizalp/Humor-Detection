People's reviews annoy me sometimes.  Why are people complaining about this place?????????  You're obviously not paying a lot for the food, this isn't going to be the French Laundry.  Just enjoy what you get!!!!  You're seriously paying as much as you would at Carl's Jr.  \n\nSorry about that, so anyway I got the $7.77 steak and shrimp.  The steak was cooked perfectly to order.  Delicious, and the mash potatoes tasted very real to me.  Anyway, amazing deal.  You have to check it out.  \n\nI have to try the Prime Rib everyone is talking about.  Sounds great.
