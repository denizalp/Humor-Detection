Dr. Wright is a wonderful dentist with a friendly, compassionate staff. He really cares about his patients and has reached out to check on me even over the weekend. His wife Debby is the office manager and her concern for their patients is obvious as well. \n\nDr. Wright is a holistic dentist and able to fill cavities without using any mercury. My health has improved in the last year of my seeing them, not just orally, but overall.
