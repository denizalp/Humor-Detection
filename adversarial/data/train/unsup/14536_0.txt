Much like its sister bars, Hi Fi and Mint, Bottled Blonde does a nice job of combining an expansive outdoor patio with a more intimate restaurant setting inside. The outdoor bar is the clear focal point to this new Scottsdale hotspot that took the place of Axis\/Radius. You'll find many places to sit including low tables with comfortable patio couches. A great choice for happy hour or weekend day drinks.\n\nTheir namesake house beer was this first I tried and could have guessed it was the delicious 5% Golden Blonde Ale from San Tan Brewery! Our server Katelyn, recommended the Magic Hat #9, which is a 5.1% pale-ish ale with a touch of apricot, maybe? It was pretty good and I was pleased to see some local beers including Four Peaks and Papago. \n\nI ordered the Tartufo fries with a killer garlic Aioli sauce. The pepperoni pizza was also quite good and not your typical bar food. It's enough to split with a friend if you're also sharing an appetizer. \n\nWith TV's all around, I can easily see this place becoming just as popular as its neighbor bars. I really dig the sleek modern look, nice staff, and overall vibe. It's worth checking out nearly any time of day. Good work, Bottled Blonde.
