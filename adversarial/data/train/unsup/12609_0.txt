Love this show!  I watched this show at Excalibur during my vaca at Vegas.  My friend is a local so I got 50% off the regular price.  We got to sit in the front middle section and some of the performers were on top of the our table as they completed their routines.  They do allow touching and you do not throw your dollars at them.  Some men had their solo acts, but not all of them.  I do admit that some of the men should retire as I can see their wrinkles, but overall, it was a great show.  It is a must to see this show if you are in Vegas and if you are having a night out with the girls.  After the show, you get to take pictures with them and it's $20\/person.  I think it's totally worth it.  We sat at the bar right outside of the showroom and had a few drinks.  Performers came out and signed autographs and even took pictures with the ladies.  I have to say AIDEN is my favorite!  He is so HOT!!!!!  I already told my friends that I wannna go back to watch this show if I ever get married again!  Enjoy watching these Australian men shaking their booties!
