I dream of this buffet!!!\n\nEverything is over the top, gourmet quality here.  From the salad bar, main entrees and the jaw dropping desserts!\n\nSome of the highlights for me this most recent visit were:\n- Angry Mac n' Cheese (smoky chipotle flavor makes this dish angry)\n- Pork belly slider (I can't stop thinking about it!)\n- all you can eat crab legs (already halved for you so you don't have to struggle getting them open)\n- and last but not least...ANYTHING from the dessert bar!\n\nThis buffet is a must for any foodie out there!
