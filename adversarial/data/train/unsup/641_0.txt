Solid lunch. Simple veal sandwich (no breading\/but cooked in a tomato sauce with onions and peppers) on a fresh bun for 5$. Throw a home-made donut in there for another buck or two and a Pepsi and you've got lunch for 7$. Not a lot of frills, but when you've got Pepsi, donuts, and veal - who needs frills?\n\nThey also sell household items like VIM and Astroglide here.
