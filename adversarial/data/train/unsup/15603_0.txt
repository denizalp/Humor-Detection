Excellent service..\n\nSo corporate decided at the last minute that balloons and ribbons would some how drive business.. okay...\n\nAnyways being the corporate mule that I am I oblige and look up my go to place for things of this nature in the past.. Party City.\n\nIt was a bit of a drive from where I was but hey, I was getting away from work so the further and longer the better. It was blistering hot outside, and when I got there all I wanted was to find what I needed and get out. Luckily the two workers there were both on their A game. One was able to find the ribbons I needed from back stock, and the other was a balloon expert and was able to educate me on what would last through the weekend. \n\nNote: don't drive with several inflated balloons in your back seat, it was a challenging drive back to say the least!
