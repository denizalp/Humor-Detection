Look no further for the perfect nail salon because I found this hidden gem recently and have been here 3 times already. I AM ALWAYS. SATISFIED. \n\nI promise you as much as my trust in this salon for it's cleanliness, service, and nail craft. Considering this place is a fairly small salon with about 5 pedi chairs and 4 mani desks, they seem to have no trouble with busyness-- because it's by APPOINTMENT ONLY. And Vi does a great job with managing the schedule. I've never came in and had to wait passed my scheduled appointment.\n\nThey provide almost everything a person could find in a nail salon-- gels, acrylic, mani\/pedis, fills, fix broken acrylics, hot stone\/warm towel pedis(classic), and other types of pedicures as well. Having options are definitely a plus and this place got tons of them. Even the nail design samples give you more than enough variety & ideas for how you want your nails to be shaped and polished. Oh! and they also have matte coating ($3 more total) so you can make an color\/design matte. Honestly its trending so I'm always getting matte.\n\nMy experience with 24 Nail has always been positive and I know every worker exceeds the customer expectations, no wonder they've got a 5-star business.\n\nI do recommend this to you and all my friends\/family, whether or not you're looking for a place to get your nails done!
