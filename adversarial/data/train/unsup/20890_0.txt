If you know me, you know I love free things... You know what's better, though?  When the free stuff is delicious... \n\nApparently, Chuy's has the happiest of happy hours... Why?  From 4 until 7 on weekdays, inside their pretty, pretty locale is a trunk of a car... Inside that trunk?  Chips, queso, ground beef, refried beans and various salsas... FOR FREE... What's that you say?  Yep... In addition to their tasty drinks (which also have daily specials), they give you some delicious nacho components on the gratis tip... Love it... The chips were light, but didn't get soggy under toppings... The salsas weren't really spicy, but they have hot sauce if you want it... The ground beef had a good seasoning without being salty and the queso was super tasty... The beans tasted like refried beans... \n\nWe tried the frozen and rocks version of the Chuy's Classic Sangrias and they were both delicious... Not too strong, but you knew what was in there...\n\nMy favorite part, though?  Next to the nacho car is a small sink... You can wash your hands right there!  That makes my heart light... I mean, how much easier can you make it for people? Fabulous... I do think they should put a little more distance between the nacho trays and the sink, though, because they're right next to it... Maybe move the upside down salsa bowls over instead so people that don't dry their hands with the available paper products don't shake their leftover water into the nacho trays?  And add a little trash can next to the side... I had to bring my paper towel with me to the bar... Someone could have taken it to empty and forgot to bring it back, though... \n\nOverall, it was fantastic, though... I can't wait to go back and try more things here!
