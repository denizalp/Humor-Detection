When making an \"appointment\" you are not told that really it's not an appointment. They do tell you that it's check in, but they don't tell you that from the time you check in to the time you get to see the vet can take up to an hour or longer.  Also the guy at the front desk is somewhat rude. The price I'm paying isn't that great either. The only good thing is the location is close to me. If I would have to do it again I would go to another location.
