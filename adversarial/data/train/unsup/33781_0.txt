I'm not typically a buffet person.  There's just something about people looking at the buffet like they've never seen food before that turns me off.  We were not staying at this hotel, someone in my party suggested this buffet for breakfast so we made the trip to the hotel (which I didn't mind because the gardens inside the Bellagio are gorgeous ... I highly recommend) We ordered the champagne breakfast buffet which is approximately $49.00. The buffet has everything you would expect. The made to order omelet bar was better than most. The champagne was bottomless. Our party stayed for approximately 3 hours as we were waiting for others to arrive. The servers were very attentive and our glasses were always filled. They never asked us to leave to make room for new guests and were always courteous, which I appreciated. First class service from this hotel as you would expect. Just remember to tip your servers
