Review Update: \n\nIt had been about a year since I passed by Mi & Stu so I walked in today for their chocolate brownie and carrot cake muffin and was disappointed to find that I would have to buy 2xcarrot cake muffins (and not fresh - only frozen) and the fresh daily chocolate brownies cut rather small and are no longer wrapped with care with a little Mi & Stu label that list the contents (a bit of a no no in the land of specialty baked good stores methinks). I got home, steeped a nice pot of mint tea and unwrapped the brownie but the recipe seems to have changed as it was even more sugary than chocolate'y in my book and crumbled apart when I tried to take a bite. Still moist and with tiny chocolate chips but I won't be tempted as readily for this when next I pass by the store front. \n\nThey still stock lots of gluten free bread and frozen to-go cakes, brownies etc. I'd be curious to hear a review of their other wares but don't fancy the trial and error investment in this case.    \n\nPrior Review:\n\nA very minimally decorated to-go bakery - threadbare atmosphere-wise but DANG delicious food-wise. I'm an omnivore who, from time to time, cleanses, modifies my diet and tries to figure out what things I'm allergic to. Well, if I go gluten free (but not sugar-free...) I will be a regular at Mi & Stu's. I picked up one of their gluten, dairy and peanut free chocolate brownies and it was amazing. Chewy, dark chocolate square of heaven. I recommend sharing it with a friend though because it is chock full o' sugar and the effects are felt almost immediately. ZAAAANG! For a less sugary but equally delicious option try the carrot cupcake. MIAM! I believe this one was vegan but you'd never know it...dense and moist and, well, scrumptious! \n\nOther items in demand, according to the bakers there, include the mock rye bread and gluten-free bagels. I'll be giving them a try next time!
