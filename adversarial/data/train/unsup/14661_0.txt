Came to this place for lunch today and would never be back.\nThe waiter who served us didn't really know what he was doing. He was overly talkative and we didn't feel comfortable about it. We ordered the rice on hot plate lunch combo, the picture showed on the iPad menu contained six large shrimps, rice with sweet corn and cheese topping. The order came and it had nothing look like the one in picture. Shrimps were 1\/3 of the size shown and 4 shrimps were only included on the hot plate with NO TOPPINGS on the rice. We then asked the waiter and he claimed that there was a disclaimer written somewhere on the menu that the pictures were for reference only. That was the most ridiculous expectation -vs-reality lunch I've ever had. (I was so mad that I forgot to take a picture which I should have!)\nWe picked the garlic sauce for our seafood side included in our combo and that was way too strong and salty. \nThat didn't really matter since we have decided not to come back anyways... but then what made us really mad was that a manager was swearing at this poor waiter at most time..... in all nastiest words with no respect at all... the waiter was obvious new and needed time to adjust.. poor management..\nGIVE YOUR BUSINESS TO SOMEWHERE ELSE
