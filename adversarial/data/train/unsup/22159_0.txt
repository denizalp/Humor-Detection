What's more fun than running? How about running with a great group of people, visiting awesome local businesses, and choosing your own route to go as far or as fast as you want in one hour. Not enough for you? How about the chance to meet representatives from local runs and other fitness related businesses before you head out for your run, and the chance to demo new equipment from brands like New Balance, Saucony, Brooks, Asics, Zensa, Yurbuds, and others. Still not enough? What if I told you that after you get done running for an hour all the raffle tickets you've picked up that night at each checkpoint give you the chance to win great prizes and that you can drink a beer or two while the prizes are drawn. Want more? After the initial drawings are done, there is an after party at one of the local restaurants with more beer and food and even more prize drawings! Oh, and in the hot summer months, one of the checkpoints Is always Big Surf Waterpark where runners strip off their shoes and socks, remove their electronics, and get to go down one of the big waterslides. Trust me, the 1.2 miles back to Roadrunner Sports feels great in 100+ degrees when you are soaking wet!! Got it, get it, good! OK, I'll see you at the Third Thursday Adventure Run!
