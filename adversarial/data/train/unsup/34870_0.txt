I had not been to Wendy's in.....forever. Went last week and tried their 1\/2 Baja salad. It was really good. Then went again a few days ago and had the same thing and a potatoe. I like that they have the soda machines where you can get any flavor. They even have diet caffeine free vanilla coke and diet caffeine free cherry coke. The yhave remodeled several locations and it really doesn't flow well. Everything is all backed up, no way to escape. How about removing that wall so we can go sit down. Call us up when it's ready. Or for the people that are waiting for their to go order, let them have a special seating area to wait. They do have several seating areas and then some areas with tables and chairs.
