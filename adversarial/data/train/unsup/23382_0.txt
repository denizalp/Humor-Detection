Love the decor.  The awesome color-changing specials board behind the bar is fun to look at, and my friend and I were seated immediately at the bar in the middle of the afternoon, past people who were also there in 2's but who apparently had something against immediate gratification.  Oh well, all the better for us!  \n\nSince I love anything with crab in it, we ordered the crab hush puppies.  They came piping hot, with tasty, tangy remoulade sauce accompanying.  After my friend and I had each tried one, our food came immediately...pretty much turning them into another side.  The waitress did apologize, saying that sometimes they came out early and sometimes it all came out at the same time.  Well, ok.  That's not really how the appetizer\/entree system works, but they're in early days and CRAB HUSH PUPPIES HOW COULD I EVER BE MAD???  They were delicious, decadent and rich.  \n\nI also had the embarrassingly named 'Da Pimp' sandwich, which was my first ever time eating pimento cheese (I'm a terrible southerner, sorry guys!) and it was alright.  I guess I'm just not crazy about pimento cheese.  But, but, but, BUT!  As my side I ordered the beer battered fried squash, and, you guys.  They were.  So good.  Not totally smothered in batter, just a light, yet crispy coating, which allowed the squash flavor to shine along with the delicious crispiness.  \n\nIt was only my first visit but I'll definitely be back.  I have to see how the burgers are and of course the fried pickles.  As far as the whole this vs. the Penguin thing, I intentionally didn't order anything that was the same from both menus, and what I had was delish.  So I suggest going there with no preconceived notions in your head and just enjoy good food and good beer.\n\n(p.s. park across the street by the head shop...it is decidedly very penguin-esque in it's parking situation...)
