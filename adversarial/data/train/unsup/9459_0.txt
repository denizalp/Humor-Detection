Crooks. I trusted the reviews about this place to take my car there for a front strut replacement. It seems like if you are out of town, they will make sure to rip you off. After the work was done and I received a print-out with charges I sat in the car and left. According to the receipt I was charged $73.13 for a Strut Mount Kit and $167.58 for a strut. Fair enough. The next day I decided to take a look underneath the car and when I did, I noticed that the spring itself had never been replaced. Before I dropped the car at the shop, I was on the internet looking at parts and their cost, and when I saw that the spring was old, I became suspicious of the charges, considering that you can buy a complete strut assembly for $167.58. So, I crawled underneath the car with the flashlight and located the part number. When I visited the websites of all major auto parts stores, they all showed me my strut and the price of $80. After I saw this kind of \"discrepancy\", I looked up the cost of a strut mount kit just to find out that I have been screwed twice. The price of that part turned out to be only $34.99. In the end, these guys made extra $125.72+tax on me. Now I see why someone below in his comment said that they could not give him a quote. \nSo, before you guys go there, make sure you have an estimate from some other place or a print-out of all the parts and their cost.
