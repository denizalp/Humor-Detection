Located in the casino area of the SLS hotel this 24 hour cafe is actually very convenient because they serve all types of food ranging from an all day breakfast menu to dim sum, tacos, salads, burgers, and sandwiches. Their dimsum only opens from late night to 6 am so plan accordingly.\n\nWe stayed at the W hotel which is located \"inside\" the SLS hotel so it was really easy to walk downstairs and grab food whenever.\n\nI ordered a Huevos Rancheros for $15 ish and thought it was super odd that mine would come on a hard shell taco instead of the usual soft tortillas which was really my fault bc it did state \"hard shelled taco\" on the menu :(. The meat also tasted like canned minced meat which I really wasn't a fan of...sorry I've been spoiled with the super cheesy, soft, melty ones you find in the mom & pop Mexican restaurants in Cali...\n\nAnyway, its a good place to go for late night\/early morning grubs if you have a group of people who crave different types of food.
