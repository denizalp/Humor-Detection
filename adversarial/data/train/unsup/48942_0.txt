Was there last Saturday afternoon. Not many people in the bar. Music was way too loud (or am I just getting old?). Disappointed that the only healthy option on the menu (an appetizer of chopped veggies and low fat ranch) weren't really served with low fat ranch. And the steamed veggies with my meal were loaded with butter, although the prep notes only mention \"steamed\" to make me think it's a \"good for you\" choice.
