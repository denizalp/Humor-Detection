Terrible customer service!!! Not a single person ackowledged us until we went to check out. The ladies working were too busy socializing with a friend about how she recieved a letter saying she was denied a policy because she was dead! The only words said to us was how much my Mother owed. The store is beautiful, but the women who work there are not kind or friendly.
