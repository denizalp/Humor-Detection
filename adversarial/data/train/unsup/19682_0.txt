This place was really fantastic.  \n\nMy friend had to ship these bicycle frames that he sold on ebay.  It was a pain in the ass, man.  Seriously.  I don't drive a car anymore, so we had to bike over there and pick up these boxes from Tempe Bicycle across the street and lock up our bikes and carry the bicycle frames with the boxes we got for shipping.  It was sort of logistically confusing to think of how we were going to get everything together.  Luckily, we were not hungover or high so it went pretty well.\n\nOur initial plan was to go to the UPS store and ship them out from there.  So we walked across the street and to the UPS store and the goddamn place was closed because of light rail construction.  Ordinarily, I'd have been pissed.  Ordinarily, I would have screamed, \"Fuck!\"  For some reason, I didn't.  Something clicked.  \n\nI told my friend, \"Hey dude, remember when I used to do market research a couple years ago?  Well, I did a study on how all Kinko's are changing their names to Fed-Ex Kinko's and, though I'm not entirely positive, I'm pretty damn sure they all do shipping too because Fed-Ex bought 'em out.\"\n\nHuzzah!  They do indeed do shipping.  And it was awesome.  The ladies working there were helpful and nice.  The cashier ringing us up forgot to charge us for all the bubblewrap that we used and she said that she'd just comp us on it.  Free bubblewrap! Yaaaaaayyy!!  They let us use the screwdrivers they have for sale too; we just used them and put them back.\n\nAbout six months ago, I also printed my résumé out here and was indifferent because it was nothing special, certainly not yelp-worthy.  On this occasion, they really went all out and made this whole pain-in-the-ass-project pretty great.\n\nIf you need to ship something or, like, make a bunch of copies of flyers, go here.
