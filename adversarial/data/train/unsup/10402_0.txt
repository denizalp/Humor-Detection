I think this is the BEST yarn store in Toronto. They are HUGE, SO MANY yarn for you to digest! They carry almost everything, except those INDIES, or something like Koigu, Lorna Laces. Other than that ,they are super! \nPatterns: HUGE LIBRARY, they carry all kind of knitting magazines (but not Phildar\/Rebecca) like Rowan, Interweave, Malabrigo, Elle Rae, Louisa Harding..etc.\nDon't forget to go downstair to check out the roving, the discount sections (two rooms now!) for those discontinued yarn!! They also carry buttons (Not a lot), all kinds of needles, spindles, tools for needle felting, knitting bags, needles cases. \nIf you are a student, bring your ID and they will give you 10% off.\nKEep your receipt and if you don't like the yarn in the future, or you don't need that much , you can bring them back with the receipt, they are happy to  give you a credit note for future use.  (Just make sure that the yarn is unused) \nFew things I dont' really like is: the location is in Downtown area, you need some time to find a parking spot on the street. And there is no washroom, why say that? Because I spent too long in Romni, and then asked if they have washroom, no, they don't. I have to go to the Second cup next to them. HA! \n\nThey don't open on Sunday now, just be aware of that.\n\nThey used to have big sales on boxing day (25% off everything), and winter sales (discount on WINTER yarn) , during July, they will have sales on everything (20% off?)\n\n(if you want to bring your baby in, you have to leave your stroller at the front desk, and then you have to carry your baby around. To me, this is not very convenient. )
