Lenny's was OK but nothing to write home about.  Since I am a vegetarian I decided to stop in because I heard they had a veggie burger.  I assumed that a Burger Shop would be able to pull off a bad-ass veggie burger but I was wrong. The burger, fries, and drink cost me a little over $7.00 thankfully the fries were good.
