Celebrated my birthday with good friends.had The Board,scallops and ruben ribs to start. 3 had the ribeye special and I had the silver snapper.for dessert we shared the lemon bruelle with pepper biscotti and the Apple pierogies.andmaple baon bread pudding. With a bottle of Laurello cabernet. Franc the night couldn't have been better. This place is phenomenal in all their twists on food. Great place for a special occasion or just an evening with apps and cocktails. Susan O'D
