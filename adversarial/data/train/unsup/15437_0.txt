My favorite Zupas by far!!\nFirst time here I was impressed! The staff was everywhere to be found-- one person opened the door and greeted you right away, one person was there to help with suggestions or questions about the food, people going down the \"assembly line\" when ordering and a few more at the register! \n\nThey have a good list of soups, salads and sandwiches to choose from -- and if you want you can do a combo, you choose two for $7.99! \n\nI'm not a salad fan at all .. but I LOVE CAFE ZUPAS salads! I can seriously eat it all day! The few salads I've had are the : Nuts about Berries and the MangoBerry! \nYes! I love the sweeter salads! The nuts, berries\/fruits and dressing mix so well with each other, it's the perfect pair with a more savory sandwich or soup! In my case I like their Clam Chowder! Creamy with just the right amount of clams, chunks of potatoes and topped with bacon!\n\nI've had a couple bites of their sandwiches and they're ok. Good but nothing that stands out!\n\nTheir dishes come with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry! \nThey have a whole display of desserts (cakes, brownies, cookies and creme brûlées) I have yet to try out!\n\nVery affordable, healthy, and great for lunch dates!
