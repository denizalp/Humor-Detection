Was here a few weeks ago and was a cool place. Has a Miami vibe with an upscale feel and loved the rooftop bar area. However, the music wasn't loud enough to enjoy and was overtoned by everyone talking. I guess because of all the condos going up they had restrictions on the level of volume they could play. \n\nSpent most of the night on the rooftop. The guy bartender was really nice and alert to customers waiting and seemed he was also the service bartender for the waitresses. I wish they had more of a selection of alcohol since it looked a little bare behind the bar. There was another girl that wasn't on top of it, maybe she was new? But overall experience was cool ! I would definitely go back again next time we are visiting friends. \n\nHeaded downstairs for a few and the vibe was awesome. Loud, people having a good time and music was good too ! Doormen were dressed very well and provided that VIP service. Thanks for a good time Maison Mercer !
