When the folks are in town, I find myself in search of the best deal in town.  Prime rib was on the menu and Fremont Street was where we were at.\n\nBinion's was offering a $7.95 prime rib when you sign up for their casino card, so of course that's what we did.\n\nI must admit, for under eight bucks you get a pretty decent meal.  You get soup or salad to start, 10 oz. slice of prime rib, a baked potato, and string beans.  The prime rib was surprisingly tasty too, with a nice crust on the outside.\n \nService was okay, it's a coffee shop after all and they are busy at night.  Beers were lukewarm instead of ice cold, which isn't so nice when you've been on a bus all day long.\n\nOverall, an eight dollar prime rib dinner can't be beat. You're not paying for gourmet here, just a chunky size piece of meat!  They also had a few other specials that had our heads turning - spaghetti and meatball special, etc.\n\nTheir daily Blue Plate Specials go for $7.99 from 11 am to 10 pm and ranges from a Turkey Dinner on Sundays to a Fried Seafood Platter on Fridays and Corned Beef and Cabbage on Saturdays.\n\nOpen 24 hours.
