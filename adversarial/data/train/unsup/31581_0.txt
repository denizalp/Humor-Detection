Tried Axia for the first time last night and had a good time. We showed up about 30 minutes before they closed and they seated us with no complaints.\n\nI ordered a bento box meal, which was a good value for $20. The sushi was alright, but the rest was actually pretty good. It's a lot of food, so you'll probably need a takeaway box.\n\nWe ended up staying past 11pm, but our server was friendly and was in no way rushing us. Despite what a few people here have said, there were no rude interactions or awkwardness about tipping the server, even though it was past closing time. Perhaps if we didn't tip so well it would've been different but I can't complain at all.
