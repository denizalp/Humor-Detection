If you like Toro and Engawa, don't come to an AYCE place....\n\nAnyway, 5-stars for being one of the better \"Ichiro Mashita\" style sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. \n\nDon't leave a negative review because it wasn't Traditional Edomaezushi. AYCE themed restaurants and Traditional Edomae style are two completely different styles of cuisine. Yet, I always see countless self proclaimed sushi experts give a AYCE place a negative review because they thought they could get Toro, Halibut, Sea Eel, and Bonito. At a traditional Edomaezushi restaurant they will give you a hot towel when you come in because you are going to have to eat with your hands. You get no chopsticks, soy sauce, or wasabi. You also usually have to take your shoes off. Then you get a piece of unrefrigerated fish that was killed minutes earlier. AYCE themed restaurants were a result of Ichiro Mashita combining aspects of Edomaezushi with other types of Japanese cuisine such as Tempura, Teriyaki, Yakiniku.  It's a completely different variation of Sushi. \n\nThe food here at KRAZY SUSHI is practically identical to all the other AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas. It's on the better side though.  Practically every AYCE sushi place in LV has an identical menu, and identically themed rolls. They always have rolls named after casinos and something called \"orgasm sauce\". \n\nI like the nigri here. You get about 70 percent fish and 30 percent rice. It's a perfect combination. They also have all the types of of fish you would expect to find at an AYCE sushi place. They got everything from Albacore, Unagi, Saba, Salmon-Sake, Sweet Shrimp, Majuro, Yellow Tail and more.  \n\nYou know, I like AYCE sushi places better than Traditional. I always come to an AYCE place at the end of  a long difficult week of working out. I spend at least 3-4 hours a day working out and my body fat is usually only around 4-6%. Therefore, I feel very lethargic and tired  on some days. These AYCE sush places have a perfect balance of carbs and proteins to help replace my glycogen and repair my damaged muscles. If your an athlete, I recommend AYCE sushi.
