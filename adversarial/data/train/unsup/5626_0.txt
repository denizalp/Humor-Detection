Always great friendly service when dining in or taking out. They specialize in thin crust pizzas and The Get Meaty is my favorite. The menu is extensive and you can do half and half specialty pies to keep things interesting. I really enjoy the family owned vibe. Highly recommend and I would eat here again!
