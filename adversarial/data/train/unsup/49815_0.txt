Came here to celebrate my birthday, and this place did not disappoint! The resto had a great vibe to it: DJ with great music, great looking bar, good food and great staff. \n\nWe were seated at the bar, which honestly was spacious and had a great view of the place. With recommendations from our waitress\/bartender, we started off with cocktails, the Rococo was very refreshing and tasty which reminds me of an upgraded mojito. As for food, their plates came in quite generous portions which are great to share. Their truffle Mac N Cheese was very tasty, well seasoned and cheesy. As for their famous fried chicken, they were so crispy and tasty on the outside and juicy on the inside - delicious and simple. But with their sauces, it completely elevated the chicken, especially their jerk mayo which is a slightly spicy Caribbean tasting mayo and their bourbon sweet bbq dip. I also tried my friends' beef short rib, which was so delicious - rich in flavour, falls off the bone and melts in your mouth! \n\nTo my surprise, since it was a birthday celebration, the owner kindly treated me and all of my friends with free shots - which was very nice of them! \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place, especially for events! With a great ambiance, great quality and tasty food and drinks for a decent price, served by a great staff - what more can you ask? I'm definitely coming back, and hopefully get to check out their bar the Hen Den. Also, I recommend making reservations here because the place is usually packed.
