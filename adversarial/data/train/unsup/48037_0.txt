If you love monkey bread, don't come here. I want it all for myself. Love the location. Love the staff. Love the quality and freshness of the food here. Culinary heavenly goodness. Jeb is cooler than most managers. Pick any server, you won't find a bad one in the bunch. Make reservations for Saturday or Sunday brunch however, or you may get your feelings hurt. Good food takes time. But it's always worth the wait. Honey Salt doesn't fail to deliver on both charm and hospitality. 5 stars and no less. Won't leave you broke either, so go ahead and splurge for that extra cappuccino... and perhaps an order of monkey bread to go. Ooo Ooo, Aah Aah!
