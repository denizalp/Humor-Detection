I'm not sure why this place gets so many good reviews because they're pizzas are just Meh... Its just overly hyped up because its the \"secret\" pizza joint at the Cosmo and everyone gets so excited over it because now they get to go treasure hunting. But in the end you find out its not really a \"secret\" due to the long freakishly slow line and the pizzas don't taste like something I would treasure. \n\nI've had it three times already in three different occasions because we were staying at the Cosmo and it was late and we were hungry and I was not about to be on hold for 40 mins to order room service (I don't want to get into that cause that deserves whole another review all on its own). On all three occasions I was hungry and pretty inebriated and not once did I think it was best pizza I've ever tasted in my life. Cause everything taste pretty good when your drunk right? Not really... I just ate it and thought to myself \"Okay, I'm hungry, and this will do\". \n\nJust for the hell of it I will give it an extra star instead of one for being there for me when I needed to satisfy my late night hunger. But really guys and dolls, I promise it wont be the most exquisite pizza you've ever had. The end.
