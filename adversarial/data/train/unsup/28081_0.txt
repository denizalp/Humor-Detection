Sam Woo was one few Chinese Restaurants you'll find in the late 80s and 90s in LV. So if you went there back in the day, you'd give it a 4 star. Now, there are just too many other places to go. \n\nIf you want cheap food and don't mind the hair and cig ashes in your food, then this is the place you want to be. (just kidding, no ashes or hair were found in the food) Quick and easy. I'm not bothered by the place since I can tell me kids that I used to come here as a kid. Pretty nostalgic I guess. \n\nDon't expect anything awesome.
