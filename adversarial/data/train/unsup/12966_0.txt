I was on my way to Chipotle when I remembered I was near Go Raw. I figured I'd do lunch here instead, I hadn't been in over a year. What a mistake. Never again.\n\nI got a \"large\" juice and the enchiladas. When the juice came out in what appeared to be a 16 oz plastic cup, not even filled to the top, I figured I'd been given the small by mistake. No big deal.\n\nI'd give the texture-less, bland enchiladas 1\/10, the accompanying sides 8\/10, and the juice a 3\/10. Beet\/apple\/ginger, it was mostly apple juice.\n\nThere was a funky odor when I went in, I figured it was just something in the dehydrator. After I placed my odor, I realized it was the smell of urine coming from the homeless woman in the other corner. It got to the point where I was gagging on my food. I asked for a box and the check.\n\nWhen I got the check and saw that I was charged for a \"large\" juice, I asked the server how many ounces in a small. She told me the small is 14 oz, and the large is 18 oz. I am certain I was given less than a pint of juice. \n\nI forgot my juice and box of food there and I don't even care. I cried a little driving out of their parking lot. What a horrible experience.
