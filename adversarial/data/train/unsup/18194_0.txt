Came here for my bi-weekly cut. I've been dealing with my hairstylist, Michelle Jankovski, for over a year now and she always made me look like a Hollywood movie star. I love her personality as well; always upbeat, cheery and positive. She's got mad skills: she does my fade using scissors and is always even, no mistakes. Amateurs use clippers. \n\nMy wife comes here as well and yes, she also goes to Michelle. We are expecting our newborn in the first week of July and Michelle will be cutting my daughter's hair, no one else. \n\nThank you Michelle!!!
