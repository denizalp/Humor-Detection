Oh my goodness, That's Amore Gelato! I am in love. We stopped in today to get some dessert.\nMy husband tried this pastry called sfogliatelle, which looked like a shell and had ricotta cheese inside. It was very dense but he loved the taste. It was really crunchy on the outside, but the filling was nice and soft. Not too sweet or creamy; just right.\nI had their tiramisu and it was really yummy; definitely tasted the rum.\nAlso had a pint of gelato to go. It probably took us like 10 minutes to decide on the flavor as they have so many flavors to choose from. We were able to choose 3 flavors to fill our pint for around $10. They really pack it in to fill every space in the container though. Came home and tried the 3 flavors - vanilla, mint chocolate and mascarpone. It was so good, I wanted to throw away the Haagen Dazs ice cream in my freezer.  I can't wait to go back and try all the other flavors.
