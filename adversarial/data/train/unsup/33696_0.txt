I am so glad to have Amy as my wedding makeup artist. She was very easy to work with, skillful and attentive. On the day of my wedding, she arrived early to set up her makeup station. She did makeup and hair for myself and my mother within the timeline we planned. My mom and I both loved the look Amy created for us. Her style is very elegant, effortless and timeless! Amy remembered the smallest details that I told her during the trial and she made the look even more perfect on the day of!\n\nWe got a lot of compliments on our makeup and hair. \n\nI would definitely recommend Amy for any brides who want a talented and reliable makeup artist. She is everything you want in a makeup artist: punctual, polite, friendly, hygienic, accommodating, pays attention to details.
