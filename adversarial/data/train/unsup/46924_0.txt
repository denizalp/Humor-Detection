Checked in from a Friday to a Sunday. It was cheap and conveniently located. There were also nice amenities provided. The only downfall is the smell of the room. It was so horrible we bought Fabreeze and air fresheners to help make the smell go away but it was unsuccessful. The smell stuck to all our clothes.
