This was my 1st trip to @BlkMtnGrill. It's A lodge-like bar & grill with seperate dining room the kitchen is open in the dining room so you can see your meal being made. Really Cool:)\n\nAfter taking a minute to clean up and check the place out-which if you are a hunter you will love it. Very cozy with a fireplace front & center big comfy seats and lots of great decor;-)\n\nSince we arrived just before 11- we could order breakfast or lunch and decided to do BOTH.\n\nWe started off with the cheese plate(cheese & fruit really)-then ordered a 3 item omelette with ham,bacon & cheddar-potaotes & english muffin-also a burger with grilled mushrooms and french fries.\n\n(NOTE: Drinks-they serve PEPSI)\n\nService was OUTSTANDING-our drinks were filled quickly and the food was brought out in a timely manner.\n\nWhen the food arrived we knew immediately we were in way over our heads-it was ALOT of food!!\n\nThe burger was good a little-bit over cooked, the fries were great.\n\nThe omelette was insane-the was a whole hog in there soooo much ham & bacon:) maybe a little too heavy on the cheese but that was an easy fix:) I like shredded potao hashbrowns myself but the kids loved the country potaotes!!\n\nThe cheese plate was fantastic with strawberrys,granny smith apples,grapes and raspberries and several different cheeses-my favorite was the smoky cheddar-yummy:)\n\nYeah I know I only tried the bar food but it was damn good.\n\nThey serve a much more sophisticated menu than the items I ordered so I'm gonna have to go back some Tuesday evening (2 for 1) and try their dinners. Maybe the Stuffed Alaskan Halibut of Petite Beef Wellington;)
