Gonzo Cafe is pretty much my wife's and my favorite cafe \/ brunch spot in Montreal. The food is outstanding, the vibe is incredibly chill and the service is totally spot on. I highly recommend folks come and indulge in the Mac Benny with a coffee and fresh pressed orange juice; promise you won't be disappointed. All around, we have nothing but good things to say about this place. Highly endorsed and hope more people swing by as everything this place is doing is so solid.
