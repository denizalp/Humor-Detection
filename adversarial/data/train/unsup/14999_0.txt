I walked in and wanted to get some sushi to go.  \n\nInstead, I stood at the door for about 10 minutes until somebody was told to come out of the kitchen and help me.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't believe in giving a business my money if they don't appreciate my service.\n\nThe food might be okay, but the service is terrible.\n\nPretty depressing considering the lack of options in the West Valley.\n\n*sigh*
