Had the falafel - make sure you specify the size otherwise the upsell you the bigger 'Villa' one. Sadly the food looked tired: tomatoes looked melted and old, the hummus was getting crusty til the guy mixed it back up....too bad because the Lebanese crepe they serve it on was very good. Not fresh... At least not at 4:30 in the afternoon
