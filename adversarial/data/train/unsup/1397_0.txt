After dancing the night away in NYE's parties doing the Locomotion, my New Year festivities came to a stop when I discovered I had lost my car keys. Yay! \nDoing the locomotion now are we? A quick Google search later, I found Autoplateau. \nThey are located in the Sherbrooke metro station, when you take the left exit, right next to a little restaurant\/chocolate shop. I had noticed the chocolate shop, but never the rental place! Go figure. \nThey were so helpful, starting with the fact that they close at 5:45. In less than an hour after my phone reservation, I had myself some wheels! Location for 24 hours and 200kms, including insurance was 55$, payable by credit card. I have never been so happy to see a Corolla before.. Thanks guys!
