I love this place. It is over run by the blue hairs in winter, but if you go after 6pm, you are pretty free. The food, fruit and veggies are fresh. They carry an awesome selection of bread, and I am addicted to the chocolate covered honeycombs.....YUM!\nAlso, the employees are pretty cool, never had a bad experience!
