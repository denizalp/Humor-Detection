I give Chinos 5 stars.  Well, 5 stars for a lunch place, dinner places require more ambiance than what you get at Chinos.   The place is a lunch dive, but a very delicious lunch dive. The best dishes are the spicy ones, so if you don't like spicy, shame on your tasteless life, and you should not go here.  \n\nFor ordering, you can get the food \"as is\", melted in a quesadilla, or wrapped in a tortilla as a burrito.  I get the two-item plate; Jerk Chicken as a quesadilla, the Jen red pork, the black refried beans and the jerk fried rice.  The food is served in an aluminum pie pan and you get your choice of chop sticks or plastic-ware.  This is a lunch place, don't expect fancy.   Also, they serve you a top-notch snickerdoodle with the meal, although on the weekend the choice of cookie is expanded.  \n\nOverall, it is my favorite lunch place in all of Phoenix.  Afterall, in my opinion, lunch is about the food first, price second, and lastly ambiance.
