Me n 3 freinds stayed at club de la solei and it was only for 1 night. 1st time in Vegas... we got back to our room around 1030 maybe a little after and realized our door is not shut... walked in and noticed my cell phone was no longer charging where i left it. A suitcase was gone along with 2 backpacks we used to carry on the airplane with our beats auto headphones, change of clothes incase our luggage gets lost. makeup, eyeglasses, portable speakers, and so on .... we informed the front desk, security gaurd , manager, and police. the hotel did a door lock investigation n it showed we did shut the door on the way out and it was opened with a key! it was opened @ 9:50 mind u we didnt get back till 10:30\/later. so SOMEONE THAT WORKS THERE OPENED OUR DOOR AND HELPED THEM SELVES TO OUR BELONGINGS!  For club de la sloleil to be a time share u would feel safer.Boy were we WRONG! SO if i were u dont even attempt to stay here. They WILL NOT do anything about it if something does happen even if it is someone that works there n police cant do anything about it because it has to be more than $ 10,000. By faaaaaar the worst experience I eeeeever had @ any hotel\/ timeshare\/ resort. waht ever u wanna call it. I Will be letting everyone that is willing to read or listen everyday because its not RIGHT! An employee can just go in your room and take your stuff but its your fault according to every single person @ club de la soleil. If u want to risk your stuff being taken clothes dirty underwear and ALL then go ahead stay there but after my experience there NEVER again.
