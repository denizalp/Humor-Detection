Very disappointing.... the food is decent, but the service is sub par.  Our server never came back to check on any course and we had some issues. The cocktail was awful... tasted like cough syrup.  When I asked him for something else he laughed at me like I was trash and didn't appreciate good alcohol.  However, as someone who has bartended their way through school and came out with a degree in food science; I can tell you that the melon pineapple martini is possibly the worst drink I've ever tasted.  The oysters were not served with any vinaigrette or cocktail sauce.  The entrees were okay, but very lackluster for the price.  I would have liked a salad and more water, but no one ever came back to check on us.  I'm very very disappointed, especially as I've b en sitting here waiting on a dessert menu and more water for over 20 minutes.
