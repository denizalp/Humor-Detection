I attended this club upon recommendation from my friend (a fellow fitness fanatic) and she promised me a \"good\" workout. I think killer workout better describes how much this class kicked my @$$!\n\nGreg (the founder of Fuel Training), was a great host. I say host because he gave us a very warm welcome. Like VIP guests, he took the time to give us a tour of the club and familiarize himself with our fitness levels\/injuries - always extremely important as an instructor. What's also impressive is the equipment, including a manual treadmill that leverages only your energy to get started and extremely challenging to stay on!\n\nNow for the class review: I've taken so many different types of \"high intensity\" classes from CrossFit to Circuit  to the crazy \"Insanity\" videos. Fuel Training Club sets themselves apart by offering a more personal approach and smaller class sizes - Greg remembered everyone's names (all 10 of us!) and truly offered personalized training. The classes are intense but Greg is so motivating and fun that it doesn't feel like torture when you are burning those calories and working your muscles. You WILL be sore the next day.\n\nThis is a gem of a studio in downtown Toronto. I hope many more will be able to discover how wonderful the staff are and experience this incredible workout.
