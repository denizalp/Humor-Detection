- Love this salad and usually order it to share with friends. The dressing is just spicy enough, and the fact that the veggies are julienned, including sprouts makes this a great summer salad.\nAlso, the Margherita Pizza (fresh tomatoes atop w\/basil) is a delightful selection, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese!\nTry it!
