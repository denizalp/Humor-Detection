Very funky and modern looking, it's a great place to have some great food.  They have great variety with their menu, with some Greek and Italian inspired dishes to go along with the more American ones.  But they are all very well done, I really liked their Greek salad.  The service was pretty average, the waitress was nice and attentive.  Not bad, but not spectacular either.  It was definitely a fun experience though.
