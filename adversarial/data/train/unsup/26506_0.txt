The wings were ok but got mostly legs. I prefer wings. The cheese dip was cold but flavors were Ok. The staff is funny and friendly. The fish and chips were over cooked.   \n\nEverything was overpriced. For 2\nCokes, 2 small margaritas, chips and cheese salsa, fish\nAnd chips, and wings , the price was $85 !
