One of the best Chinese\/Canadian buffets I've ever been. What makes this buffet different is the live cooking and the freedom of serving yourself soft drinks and juices. There are so many different options to choose from. Everything is so fresh and tasty. They need to open a location in Toronto. The staff was friendly and efficient.
