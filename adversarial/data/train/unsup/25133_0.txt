Started my experience with a massage. They take you into a shower room where you can take a steam shower. This was AMAZING. you get out and feel all around relaxed. Put on a robe and some sandals and head out. They then soak your feet and give you a drink. My massage therapist was Paul and he was wonderful. Extremely professional and gentle. I told him that I like it medium, not too hard, not too soft. He was great during the entire massage making sure I was comfortable. He even let me pick my oil scent out. The entire experience was completely wonderful... I had previously had a massage on my honeymoon in Mexico and it was nowhere near as relaxing as the massage I received today. I highly recommend Paul it is very much so worth a little bit more money to have someone who has experience like him. I will definitely be returning for another massage with Paul in the future.
