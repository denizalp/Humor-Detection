Well this is awkward. I do not take a bad review lightly. So, I just called to order a pizza from here, as it has been a while, and was told that I was red flagged in their system to not have my order taken. For what you might ask? Well, let me begin by saying I am never rude nor do I not pay my bill. I am polite and always tip very well. That being said let us go ahead and explore my last experience with Papa Pinny's Pizzeria. I ordered a pizza, it arrived late and cold, I accepted the pizza in my hands and tipped the driver, and upon opening the pizza box in my kitchen it was very apparent the top of the pizza had shifted as if the delivery driver took a very, very, sharp turn...  Like a U turn... which led to the pizza topping shifting a good third worth over. So when I saw this, considering how much was spent on the pie (They are by no means a cheap pizzeria), I called and politely said that I was not satisfied with the quality of the pizza as it arrived. I mean.. Hell yes I want a pizza to arrive looking like a pizza with the toppings intact, who doesn't? The person who answered the phone said they would sent out a new pizza, when the new pizza arrived the delivery driver curtly requested I return the damaged pizza, which I did. I did not choose post anything at the time because I do not like to post negative reviews and understand that sometimes things just happen. We were satisfied with the new pizza and its condition. So, this bad review is because Papa Pinny's Pizzeria clearly does not take responsibility for a poor product that was clearly their error. Shame on them.
