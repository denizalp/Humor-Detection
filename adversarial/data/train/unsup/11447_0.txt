I was eager to try this place after reading several good reviews.. Must say I'm pretty disappointed. After a day of school orientation and car shopping I was eager for pastry heaven. My bf and I ordered various pastries and a soft cresent pretzel to try. \n\nI was not blown away by a single one. The pretzel was okay. It did taste authentic, but nothing I'd ever go out of my way for. The cheese danish was lack luster and heavy. You could barely taste the cream cheese in it and it was doused with an obnoxious amount of powdered sugar. The macaroon was not stellar. I was extremely disappointed in that, since so many people swear by those things. \n\nKind of a cool store, I like the authenticly german selection, however all of it is overpriced by a landslide and is scarcely displayed. \n\nI wish I was more impressed, but Old Heidelberg just didn't do it for me.
