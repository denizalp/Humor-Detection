C-Street was one of my first experiences with nightlife!! :D\n\n\nI went with a group of friends a couple of times in summer 2010. I didn't drink at the time so I can't really comment on the bartenders, bar or quality of drinks, but I had a relatively good time.\n\nThe only downside I noticed was that it took forever for the crowd to start dancing, and then once they did it was so overcrowded that the heat became unbearable and not only were the people in our group sweating buckets, but we began feeling faint too D: \n\nWe went onto the back patio to take a break, and though it was raining really hard everyone stood around under the overhangs and tattered umbrellas and talked and hung out for at least an hour. \n\n\nThey really should expand, or limit admittance after a certain point since it gets so crowded and unbearably hot. They play great music though and the drink specials and cover charge were pretty well priced. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 since I am sure I would have had a loooot more fun had I been inebriated. \n\nI would definitely go back!!
