I've been back a few times since my initial review. Dropped a star for one reason, well, two: they've changed the au gratin and mac & cheese offerings that I requested both dishes be made the way they previously were. Both of these sides include items such as jalape√±os & capers, 2 things I despise. Why they would ruin two traditional dishes this way is beyond me. \n\nI checked the menu prior to updating my review. They either reverted back to the old ways OR they've not updated it since the change. \n\nRegardless, it's still my fave steakhouse & I'm looking forward to returning. The service is great, can't beat the price point & menu selections are fantastic!!  \n\nVegas J posted an awesome tater tot pic...maybe I'll try those next!!
