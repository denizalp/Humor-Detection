The Bellagio gets a 5, yes ladies and gents they do because the service was so amazing! My best friend and I took the hike from MGM grand because we wanted to have some \"cushion calories\" for breakfast, and window shop a bit. After about 40 mins (you get caught up in Vegas) we finally made it and we were starving! We were mesmerized by the gorgeous light fixtures and beautiful floors, but still.....hunger was upon us and we were frantic! Andrea G. Kept screaming \"where's the buffet, where's the buffet ?!!\" Finally, we found it but only to be disappointed by the huge line, I read tons of reviews and no one told me this! \n\nWe were favored of course, when the bar tender came out asking around for how many people were in their party. I noticed him fast so I yelled out 2 please....., \"come with me ladies\" :))) yes! We were seating at the bar and wereoffered the specials, $13 gets you all you can drink mimosa, champagne, Bloody Mary, and beer. That's a deal! We put our stuff down and headed towards the food option. \n\nSteak, sushi, Chinese, Italian, and then you have your breakfast classics like omelets, bacon, sausage, waffles, pancakes, biscuits......they had everything for everyone. I tried this lamb chop and sirloin , oh man it was so tender and fresh! I also had a shrimp and veggie egg white omelet. The cook who made my omelet was so funny and  very welcoming. We laughed a bit when I told him to make my omelet with love, and he did of course. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of buffets, and when my good friend recommended I'll admit I was hesitant. I'm glad that I went for it and took his advice. Come to the buffet at the Bellagio, you'll enjoy it, but go straight to the bar if you don't want to wait!
