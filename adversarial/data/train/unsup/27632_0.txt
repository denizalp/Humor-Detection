My doc was out of town so I got an appointment here. Staff were friendly. I didn't face any of the rudeness others mentioned. The waiting room was packed so the staff are probably not getting paid much and are overworked. They were nice and answered my questions. \nThese are a group of female nurses doing checkups and consultations. They even do check up on guys from what I heard. Yes I did wait 30 minutes for my consultation but you can have that and more at any medical facility. If you get an appointment there's less chance you have to wait.
