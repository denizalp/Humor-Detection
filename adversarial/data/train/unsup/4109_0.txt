When I'm craving hot soup & don't want ramen, this is my go-to place. Their menu is simple, the place is quaint but their food is DIVINE.\n\nShang Beef Noodle is sooooo good. Piping hot broth with braised beef brisket and veggies. It sounds simple but it really hits the spot on a cold day. I also loved their Spicy Wonton. For me, the sauce has some sweetness to it then the spice kicks your taste buds at the end. I can't quite explain it. The potsticker presentation is a must see, besides the taste. It's so pretty because it's shaped like a flower of some sort. The beef pancake is also tasty. Watch out though! Don't bite too fast or too hard, the soup inside will burn your tongue or hit your neighbor, both of which are not very pleasant.\n\nThe prices are awesome & the service is always friendly. I can't wait to go back!
