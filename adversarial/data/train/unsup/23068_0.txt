We really enjoy the breakfast food here and the atmosphere of the store is always fun.  The service was great (5\/5) and the food was very good (5\/5).  The coffee was a bit weak but doable.  I had the pecan pancakes with 2 eggs and bacon and da boss had biscuits and gravy and hash brown casserole. All were delish (5\/5).  Didn't have biscuits and cornbread as I did not want to fall into a food coma.  This is a very good instance of CB.
