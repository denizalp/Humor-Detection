Since we had a evening flight, we decided a decent meal and rest for a long next day was best. I had not been to Peppermill since 2009. So I checked the Yelp Las Vegas and Instagram reviews and it got a green light. We spied on the table close to the door and the \"Nachos, Nachos, Nachos\" with Ground Beef looked amazing! So of course we checked reviews and ordered the \"Nachos, Nachos, Nachos\" as well. Now let me tell you were it went wrong: Our server insisted that the Ground Beef was way too greasy and we should get it with Chicken. That my IG friends was a HUGE mistake! The chicken was flavorful, but it was a mountain of cheese, chicken, and some of the strongest white onions I have encountered in a couple months. We had to ask for the refried beans and got no Sour Cream or Guacamole. We regretted not ordering the Greasy Ground Beef!  The Burgers were very good: Pastrami Burger and PepperMill Burger...burgers were seasoned well, not overcooked, and bread was fresh. I will good back next year, but for breakfast. ____\n____\n#foodieontheroad #stlmetrofoodie
