Man, I wanted to love this place.  We SOOOO need a great family restaurant out here.  I came close to a 4 star, but.....  The wife's fish and chips (no chips - remember the new diet) was absolutely great.  Wish i had ordered that instead of the French Dip.  After all the wonderful things said about the French Dip....sorrry, my beef was without flavor and the au jus didn't help a bit and I used lots of salt to try and pep it up.  Sorry, folks, tonight was not our night.  I'll try it again, but LW's Hideaway is better.....at least to my tastebuds.  And at least tonight.
