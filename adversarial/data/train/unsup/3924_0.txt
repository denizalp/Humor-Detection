Tried this place twice. Terrible both times. Both orders were \"to go\" and both were messes when I got home. Food was luke-warm (I live nearby) and a greasy mess (even the grilled chicken sandwich!). I can't believe this place has so many locations and isn't bankrupt. There are lots of good burger joints (in-n-out, shake shack, etc.) - do yourself a favor and choose a different one.
