I honestly can't remember eating anything other than plates full of shrimp with endless tubs of cocktail sauce, but I do remember being happy.  The price is pretty steep so make sure you get your money's worth - hence the heaps of shrimp...\n\nBeing off the strip is a bit of an inconvenience, but I took the shuttle from Paris to Rio no problem.  Go at least once, but it's not worth going every visit.
