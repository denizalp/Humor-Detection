Great guy. \n- Salmon skin hand roll was was like Dohs. Not good. Not crispy. Poor. \n- Soft shell crab was small. Fair. \n- Short ribs a bit too much fat. \n- Pocky roll was amazing. Loved the avocado and presentation. \n- Superman burrito was flavorful. Didn't look like Superman or a burrito. \n- Their sashimi order was fantastic! thick slabs! Best for AYCE \n- Rose roll was fulfilling. Shove it all the mouth deal \n- Nabeyaki udon was great! Best AYCE soup. Ridiculously hot. \n- Hamachi kama was a bit oily, but still crispy. Maybe I'd stick with salmon. \n- Energy roll was okay. wouldn't get again. \n- Nice cuts on mochi. chocolate drizzle. \n- I felt that there was collective effort to try their best to ensure a good visit.\n- Definitely coming back for more!
