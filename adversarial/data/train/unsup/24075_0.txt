SO happy to see another sushi place in Old Town that isnt anything like RA.  I went on a weeknight and being with my date, I think I could have gone to Arby's and had the time of my life, so perhaps my review is a bit biased...but, I really enjoyed my time at Pure.  \n\nThe atmosphere and location are perfect for me, living 2 miles away, and the service was timely and friendly.  Creative, fun rolls and VERY fresh fish.  Trendy, yes...  But again, we went on a weeknight and it wasnt busy at all...do the same if youre looking for something a little less high maintenence, I tend to think it gets pretty Scottsdale on the weekends.
