This is a pretty good breakfast place. I gave the four stars because it was good, but it is just a standard breakfast place. What is good about it though was the wait was short and the service and food are good. I would definitely recommend if you want a good breakfast quickly. My kids enjoyed their food and so did we. Next time we need a quick breakfast we will return.
