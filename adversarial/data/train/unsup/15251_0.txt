So good!  I first had a sample of SkinnyFats was at a Yelp event.  Had a seminar on this side of town.  Needed a lunch option.  After spending 20 minutes in line to order, I decided to order two of the ahi srirachi tacos (skinny style). They were $3.95 a piece.  (not going to lie, this place is hopping.  Be prepared to wait and maybe no place to sit.  It's just too good.)\n\nI wanted to also try a full version of Liquid Defense pressed juice.  OMG, so good. ORANGE, CARROT, APPLE, LEMON, LIME, BASIL and 231 calories. Yes, the price of $7.95 is not for the faint of heart.  But, man, oh man, it is so good.  I should have gotten the large and not the medium.  I wanted to lick the bottom of the glass.
