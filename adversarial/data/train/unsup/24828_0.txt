I started using Krissy's Hair and Makeup services couple years ago just specifically for blowouts. Big plus to have my stylist nearby so I can drop by at the last minute whenever I wanted just my hair styled. She's great and knew how to tailor my hairstyle to specific events.  Eventually she became my go to stylist to cover up the gray hair that's been coming in fast and furiously. She does a fantastic job at making those grays go away. The color sticks and I just need touch ups every couple months. \n\nShe totally rocks at ombre \/ balayage techniques. I saw pix of her work on Instagram one day and relayed that I was thinking of going for a change. Her suggestions of what style and colors would look good on my skintone were spot on.  I love how the caramel colors blend in, fade at the ends l, and look natural not chunky or any harsh lines. Her prices she charges for hair services are super reasonable and listed on her Styleseat profile, which by the way I use to schedule an appointment with her. Either that or call Krissy to make an appointment here at Evo Salon.  I like how the stations are enclosed and more privacy too.  They rent out their space here,so you make your payments and tips directly to your stylist. \n\nI have 100% confidence in Krissy! I am always happy with her work. Thanks Krissy!
