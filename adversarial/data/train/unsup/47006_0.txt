I go here for Burmese food mostly. I've tried the Malaysian & Thai dishes too. Everything I've had has been great. My father is from Burma so we have ordered Burmese dishes off the menu days in advance for special occasions. It's been incredible being able to have some dishes we know. Try the Beef curry and roti if you drop in.
