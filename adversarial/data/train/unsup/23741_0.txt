After a play, I stopped in for dinner.  It's an interesting place with picnic table-like dining.  As with most Filipino restaurants, it's best to come with a group because portions are large and you want to try different things.  I was looking forward to the lechon but when I saw that the smallest portion was 8 ounces, I decided to hold off on that until I come with a family who adopts me or a group of friends.\n\nInstead of eating too much, I opted for a small starter of Ngo-yong, deep freind palm heart flavored with Chinese 5 spice powder.  There was a dipping sauce served with it that had the wonderful five spice flavors.  A very good start and a smaller starter.\n\nFor the main course, I got the kare-kare.  The beef in this traditional Filipino stew was tasty and came off the bone easily and the \"gravy\" of the stew was very good especially when mixed with some of the shrimp paste served with the stew.  \n\nFor dessert, I went with the turon with ice cream.  Two small banana filled, fried spring rolls with the yam ice cream.  It was a good ending to the meal.\n\nService was very good and the young woman answered all my questions.  With the tab;e set up being like family picnic tables, I wouldn't come back solo during busy times and I think I'd avoid evenings when there's music.  I'll have to plan my return carefully.
