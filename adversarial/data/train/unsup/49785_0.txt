I was excited to come here as all the photos that I have seen of the food looked amazing but unfortunately my boyfriend and I found it mediocre at best. I must say that the waitresses and waiters and very friendly and efficient and we got our food very quick. The pizza was very doughy and seemed undercooked, it was impossible to eat without all the toppings completely sliding off. The buttermilk calamari was what I was most excited for but I was also disappointed as it looked nothing like the photos and was way too chewy for my taste. The tables are extremely small and uncomfortable and they are all put together so close that it felt like I was having dinner with all the people around me. This place isn't terrible but I don't plan on visiting again.
