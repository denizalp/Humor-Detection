I'm in Vegas, and where does our group end up going?!  A freakin' Filipino \"disco\", \"just like the ones in the PI\" my friends told me...  ew.  Granted, it was fun for the first 2 hours, but the folks there don't get sick of dancing to the same rap songs being played over and over.  They serve food, although our group didn't have any.  \n\nThe good:  No cover.\nThe bad:  being in a filipino nightclub while in Vegas\nThe ugly:  being here for more than 4 hours, nasty people practically having sex on the dancefloor, doing it to Flo Rida's \"Low\".
