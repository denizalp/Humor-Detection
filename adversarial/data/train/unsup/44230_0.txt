Food was reasonable but a bit overpriced (You charge extra for mayo\/aioli for the frites? Really!) it took about 20minutes after being seated to place our order. Food arrived about 25 minutes after that. The order was not completely correct (I assume that one of the 4 or 5 people handling the table got confused) but at this point I didn't have time to wait for a replacement. I think I will stick with Gates and Brovi...better service...much better food.
