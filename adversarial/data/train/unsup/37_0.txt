Horrible experience ever. I don't believe in the comments above after my experience. Arrived at 1:40, first impression of this place: empty salon with only 2 dressers. The manager looking girl was talking to me while eating something. Unprofessional big time. \n\nAnyway,  started dying my hair around 1:50. Now, I've been dying my hair a lot from different famous salons in NYC, Seattle, I know how it works. My first impression was this girl here doesn't know what she's doing at all! My hair color was blone and black on the root, trying to dye it to silver lavender. She accepted the challenge.  HOWEVER, during the process,  I noticed couple mistakes she's been making: \n\n1. Didn't wait long enough for bleach to complete to a perfect color. \n2. Some part of my hair wasn't even bleached, very unprofesdional. Had to do it second time. \n3. Because of the failure to bleach it, the color later applyed was horrible, and for these years of experience, this was the first time someone applyed a light color on me and didn't let it stay on my hair for atleast 30 mins to let it absorb. \n\nI was there for 6 fucking hours, from 1:40 to 8:00, walked out with a yellow toned silver with pink highlights. Not happy at all. Charged me $211. I don't think she deserves this amount of money. How you charge your clients should depend on the results, not the time you spent and the products you used. Also, the other big girl with short pink hair there was just hilarious. All kinds of excuses, like, we all see the color, ok? There's no need to argue with that because we all see it. She's trying to persuade me that the actual color is not what I see lol. \n\n6 fucking hours with no food service whatsoever, and the color wasn't what I expected from a professional salon. I'm sure someone else in this salon are capable of doing intensive colors than Liz. I think that's her name. TRUST ME,  DON'T GO THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT A PROFESSIONAL DYE.
