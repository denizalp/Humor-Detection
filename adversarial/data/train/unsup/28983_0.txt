We stayed at la Quinta because we had a family member in hospital it was a very important visit I had to bring dogs but we were constantly getting phone calls About my one dog barking which was only when he heard maids I heard dogs howling and barking I never complained we were locked out of room. We paid a lot for room that week and we explained our situation I understand but we were all paying customers. Besides when we stayed last October I got all bit up by bed bugs so we will not be staying at that la Quinta and if you have the attitude feelings mutual that's  fine
