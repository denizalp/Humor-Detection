The person who recommended this place either has very low culinary expectations or a perverted sense of humor. Both the tacky, threadbare decor and low price should have tipped us off to what lay in store for us - a spread that was mediocre at best, with food that was overcooked, underseasoned (except for salt . . . lots and lots of salt!), and lukewarm. Fatty, gristly meats, greasy chicken, canned vegetables, and wilted salad were among the better offerings, and strawberry jello was the best dessert. We felt like we had wandered into a pot luck supper in a white-trash trailer park. Each night has a different theme, but it seems unlikely they could pull off anything as exotic as spaghetti and meatballs or enchiladas. At $9.99, they're charging about $6 too much.
