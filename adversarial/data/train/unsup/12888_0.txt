Stunning! The aroma in the lobby! Nice customer service. Very elegant.\n\nIf you want to stay in a non gaming hotel, this is worth your dollar. \n\nOff the strip but in a good location and easy access to everything \n\nRide-share drops off at entrance, but leaving with a ride-share you have to walk away from hotel with a specific area.
