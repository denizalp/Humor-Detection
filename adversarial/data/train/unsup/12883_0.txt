Dropped in here for Valentine's Brunch (ok, it was just me, alone) after my hike and the place was pretty full. A table for 7 was seated quickly before me, and I was seated fast as well. My order was taken quick, food delivered about 15 minutes later. Service was fair, a little slow but understandable with the crowd.\n\nTables are tight inside, so you can hear lots of conversation. Off to one side is the bakery, but I didn't look at what was available.\n\nLots of people ordering the chicken noodle soup with matzah ball so it must be a favorite. Looked pretty good. I went with a standard breakfast fare of eggs, bacon, fruit, and a garlic bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was ok, heavy on the garlic flavor to the point I couldn't finish it. Bacon was nice thick strips and 4 of them so good portion there. \n\nOverall, just an average meal for $11. I'd come back to try the pancakes as those looked delicious.
