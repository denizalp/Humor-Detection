I had my very first Red velvet cake when I was 16. It was a gift from a friend. It was my first experience with Barbs Bakery. I fell in love! \n\nEver since then If I do not make my own cake or cupcakes I would go to Barbs. Baby Showers, Birthdays or just because moments. It's great cake with pretty good design capabilities for fair pricing. \n\nThe last thing I got from them was for my husband 30 birthday. It was a cake shaped like a hot dog. It was amazing. I think I paid $75. Totally fair. \n\nFor my Mom's 50th birthday I was throwing a huge event. I called for a quote on cupcakes for it. I was floored at the price. I just ended up making my own and getting rave reviews. I made Pink Champagne and Vanilla Bean Coconut.\n\n Not my favorite thing to do when planning a party but I will do it to save a couple hundred dollars. \n\nThen came my daughters 16th birthday and I called for a quote on a cake. I can't remember what they said but it was just hands down ridiculous. So I again just made cupcakes. \n\nFast forward to my Daughters graduation. I find a picture of a cake that I feel is fairly simple. It's 2 tier. Ombre ruffle cake. I said I wanted butter cream not fondant. Which they even said was easier but the price would be the same. ??? Ok then.  \n\nI then said I was flexible on the design once they said how hard that was to do. I said I just care about the color and it being ombre. I said, rosettes whatever I just need to stay in my budget of $150. \n\nShe had quoted me $115 for just the bottom tier and said she would get back to me with the total price and would also try to work something out since I had been a customer for so long. \n\nWhen I went in to order the cake, the cases were pretty much empty. They had some order and wouldn't have the cases filled until Thursday. It was Tuesday. I continued to get red flags. So I couldn't try any cake I wanted. \n\nI want to say the girl working was AMAZING. She was so nice, understanding and even let me have 3 cupcakes to try since I waited so long for help. It's all they had left. \n\nSo they called me back with a final quote of $389. Yep, I said that. $389. Whaaaat?!?! \n\nHow did it go from $115 for the larger bottom tier to $389? I mean even if you doubled that price it wouldn't be that much and the top tier is much smaller. \n\nI was confused and disappointed to say the least. I was so mad that I had waisted time with them, traveling all the way there, waiting in line and going over everything and waisting ink to give them the photo.\n\nIn my opinion if that cake is too hard for your baker to do, you should get a better artist or improve upon your skill set. I don't want to hear cost of labor when ordering a cake. \n\nI didn't even bother working with them as I could tell they didn't want or couldn't do the cake. Why else would they change the price to such a crazy amount.\n\nIt's sad that my favorite cake place has fallen off my list of go to places. I live in the north valley and I have to pass a lot of places to get to 20th st and Thomas. \n\nI won't be doing that any longer and my friends who I have turned onto Barbs won't either. I will personally make their cakes for free before I ever tell another friend to go there.\n\nI think they have gotten a little too big for their britches. The more I thought about it I started to think of who helped Barbs build roots in Phoenix and grow into a well knows establishment. It wasn't people with large pockets. It was lower middle class to low income families who lived in the area. I can't see how those same people could possibly afford to continue to buy cakes to celebrate family events. It's sad. \n\nI gave them 3 stars because they do make some good pastries and the cake is pretty good. My pink champagne is better and they don't have coconut.\n\n As far as decorating goes, they are not even close to $389 good. \n\nI ended up getting my daughters cake, exactly perfect with a slight variation to the decor. Rosettes. It was beautiful and the centerpiece of the party. Everyone was in awe of it and I didn't get it from Barbs. I got it from a bakery a few miles away. \n\n I also paid $150. Right in my budget. The new bakery will get plenty of new business with the amount of people who were in love with the cake. I can't see how they won't. \n\nAnyway, Barbs is good to pop in for a cupcake or a doughnut but that's about it. \n\nIf you want cupcakes or a cake, message me, I will make you the best tasting cake you have ever had and it will not require you to pick your jaw up off the floor when I tell you the price. \n\n;)
