Indian was once my favorite type of food, and for years I'd eaten at many Indian restaurants in Tempe. After trying multiple Indian restaurants, Delhi Palace has my vote for the best Indian food in town. Like some other hidden gems in Tempe, it's located in a tattered looking strip mall near ASU, but the interior is beautiful. The huge murals that decorate every wall and the mellow Indian music make you forget that you're sitting 30 feet from a Kinko's.\n\n I love the Vegetable Pakoras and the Samosas for appetizers, and the Garlic Naan is the best naan bread I've ever had. Also, they serve both Flying Horse and Taj Mahal beer- you can't go wrong with either and they both compliment the food nicely. If you're not in the mood for beer, try their Mango Lassi... it comes in handy if the food's a bit too spicy for you. : )\n\n I've had every vegetarian dish they offer multiple times, and they're all delicious. The Palak Paneer (cheese cubes in spinach sauce) and the Yogurt Masala (veggie kofta balls in yogurt sauce) are two of my favorites. Any of the veggie dishes are great- this is the type of restaurant where a vegetarian has a lot to choose from, and won't be disappointed.\n\nRecently I've tried one of their meat dishes- the Lamb Korma- and it was just as tasty as the veggie dishes.\n  \nThe one drawback to Delhi Palace is the service has gone downhill slightly. I suspect the restaurant was sold sometime in the last 2 years... as the old staff was always bright and talkative and extra kind.  The new staff is polite and attentive enough, just a bit awkward. \n\nThe cost for dinner for two is just a bit higher than most other Indian food restaurants in Tempe, so if you want to try this place out first, go to their lunch buffet. I think it's weekdays before 3PM... It's half the price, and much of the food is the same as the dinner menu!
