Hate to break the news, but I was not happy with my ice cream at Creamistry.... I ordered a double scoop of the coconut base milk coffee flavored ice cream with chocolate curls and almonds. My bill was close to $12 - pretty expensive for ice cream but I was hoping every bite was worth it. I watched the employees work their butt off filling orders and finally my name was called. \n\nI took one bite and I couldn't taste the coffee and barely taste the chocolate. I took another bite and got more disappointed as I taste uh, maybe the almonds and coconut base. It just wasn't good... I take another two bites and I couldn't eat anymore. After a few minutes, I noticed this aftertaste that I did not like and all I wanted to do is go home and brush my teeth to get rid of the taste. Twelve dollars down the drain...\n\nI'm wondering if it was the coconut base and maybe I should've tried the signature premium base instead, but honestly I don't think I would go back just to spend another $10-12 to find out if it's any better.
