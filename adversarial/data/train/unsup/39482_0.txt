My girlfriend and I decided to go while in Vegas for two days.  This was a great mob experience attraction.  The live actors were fun, engaging and played along when I made up a fake name and decided to take some of the fake money.  There was a lot of information and my girlfriend thought it was exciting and a little suspenseful as you walk through.  Overall I would recommend it.
