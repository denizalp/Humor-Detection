McFucky's. Yup that is what I call it. If you have been here you understand. I have had a long affair with this place. It was once a pretty good restaurant. One thing that remains consistent, Cheap booze. Always some special so you can get hammered. \nLets create a list: \n1. Cheap booze \n2. College kids. \n3. Cleveland Hts alcoholics. \n4. Old weird dudes \n5. Cheap booze. \n6. Contingents of Ghetto Fab \n7. Frat Boyz \n8. Fake ID's \n9. Debauchery \n10. Cheap Booze \n11. Steel encased mens bathroom \n12. Multiple town drunks \n13. Degenerates \n14. Crunk \n\nI think your starting to get the picture. It is what it is. I have had many good times, bad times, and blasted times here. I went back there this past weekend. I did not get blasted but had a good time. Somethings never change and this place is not an exception. When my buddy and I walked in the guy made a point of not asking us for ID, but my friend showed it anyway, what the fuck is up with that Kevin. I ended up talking to a really good looking girl that was hanging with her gays. I almost gave her my business card but I could tell she was one of those girls who really likes cheap booze and hanging with her gays. I have a deep appreciation for gays! But most women who surround them selves with gay dudes tend to be a bit much into drama for me! My ex was kind of like that : ) Sorry I'm too old for drama. Enough about that. One thing that really impresses me is when a bar has a steel encased mens bathroom.  It looked like it could stand up to a IED. I have only seen one other bar like that.\n\nAs for the food. I had  burger here and it was pretty good.  I usually hold out and get a slice or two from guys pizza.\n\nSo if you want to get like totally CRUNKED in Coventry, this, my friend, is the establishment for you! When you wake up at 12pm the next day and you realize you only spent 15 bucks the night before there is only one thing left to do and that is to smile, smile smile and drink a really big glass of water!
