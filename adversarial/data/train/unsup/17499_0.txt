I informed the person who made my appointment that this was for a replacement denture, that's it. No X-rays needed, no exam, just an impression to be sent out for a lower denture. I imagine I should have saved my breath because I was left in the incorrect BUILDING until an hour past appointment time. Now I'm being quoted another HOUR of waiting. No fun for me or my antsy 3 year old. I can't imagine I'll be more impressed in an hour when I'm 2 hours past my appointment but I'm hoping the back office staff is more competent.\n\n\nJust left angrier then I've ever been. DA informed me I had to have a panorex X-ray to get my insurance to cover it. She set the chin guard so high there's no way I could get my chin on it w\/o hyperextending my (injured) neck. I said something and was told that my attitude was unnecessary. Great let me show you attitude....flipped the lead apron off, grabbed my son and left. I tried to speak with management and was told to call her cell phone. Still waiting for the number to be sent to me. It's been an hour, I'm not getting any less angry. Go anywhere but here...
