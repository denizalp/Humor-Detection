I have never been here for drinks, only for the food.  Specifically, I come on Friday's for the bbq they offer outside.  It's not the most incredible bbq brisket I've ever had, but it hits the spot and isn't bad for something different from the usual market square lunch scene.  They do you give you a LOT of brisket, which is always nice.  One recommendation I have is to provide some sort of sauce - a vinegar-based bbq sauce would take this to four stars for me.
