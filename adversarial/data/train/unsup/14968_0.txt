Thanks for the unripe kiwi, U-Swirl.  It's so nice to pile your tart yogurt with kiwi only to find on the way home that the fruit is completely unripe and hard and GROSS.  I won't ever go there again because of that.  Also, out of 16 different flavors I was disappointed that only two of them were tart.  Of course, there is always the plain tart yogurt (which at U-Swirl is completely disgusting) so that only leaves one flavor of tart.  \n\nI won't bother with this place again.
