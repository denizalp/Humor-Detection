I was looking for something casual & outdoors on the strip, this was perfect! It was about a 30 minute wait, they text when your table is ready which I love. \n\nI got the chili and a Caesar salad. The chili with cornbread on top was SO good! A few of the ground beef chunks were pretty large, but it had just the right amount of spice, and the sour cream on top to cool the meal down was perfect. \n\nI WISH I liked bloody Mary's, because they really look amazing here!!!
