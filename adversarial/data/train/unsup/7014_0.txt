Le Peep is Mario from Super Mario Bros. 2. Mario is not as fast as Toad, doesn't jump as high as Luigi, and doesn't float in the air like Peach. That is why I never go back to Le Peep. Merry Ann's, Sam's Cafe, Pancake House and Courier Cafe are all better than Le Peep in one way or another, be it speed, price, quality, or selection. \n\nLe Peep is fine, especially for a chain, and offers an interesting variety of items for higher than average prices, but it ain't gonna wow you.
