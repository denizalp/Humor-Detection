Borgo... finally we meet for a meal! You've been on my list forever and ever, okay, well forever since you opened anyway. A Friday lunch turned out to be the magical moment of our first meeting.\n\nI loved that my fave server from days gone by at District was our server yesterday. I doubt very highly he'd remember this girl, but you'll recognize him by his most amazingly white teeth and lovely smile with an equally lovely mannerism to match. He was super attentive, knowledgeably... Borgo, you're lucky to have him on your side :).\n\nWe popped in for a late lunch (the lunch menu isn't available after 2pm), and snuck in our order crostini (Vine-ripened tomatoes, whipped buffalo mozzarella, balsamic reduction) to start followed by an order of gnocchi (Ricotta dumplings, basil, tomato passata, fior di latte) and chicken (Roasted 6oz breast, sage, lemon, speck prosciutto, saut√©ed broccoli). Oh, and what's a Friday afternoon with cocktails and wine? \n\nThey also had this cool little lunch box special thing on that you could try three things on the menu for a fixed price (I want to say it was $18? But don't quote me on that... there's been much wine and beer since yesterday at lunch at today, my memory's a little fuzzy on that one).\n\nI love the interior at Borgo. It's nice and open and modern with super tall ceilings, great seating in the front and down the sides of the room, it felt clean and lovely, it wasn't too noisy, and I bet when the weather is warm enough sitting at the front with those windows wide open is going to be a choice spot.\n\nBorgo's also open at 830 Tuesday-Friday for morning coffee (served until 1130... right before they kick off their lunch menu). It makes me want to get all prettied up one morning, grab a book and go sip some delicious Italian coffee something and take a mini-vacation for an hour or two!
