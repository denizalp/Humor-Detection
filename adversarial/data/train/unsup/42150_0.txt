This hotel is so beautiful. I have stayed here the past few times I have been but I am not sure that will happen again. I took a nap of the couch in our suite and I woke up to a rash on my arm!! I am not sure if they are bug bites from bed bugs or what it is but I know they were not there when I went to sleep. Gross. Be careful if you come here!
