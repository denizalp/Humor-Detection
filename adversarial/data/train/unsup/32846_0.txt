I can't say enough good things about Ray and his guys.  Aztec Decks is the company that you hope to find and work with.  They are there when they say they will be and are very hard workers and talented craftsmen.  We used Aztec Decks to redo our pool cooldecking with travertine, fill in our out dated spa, replace the pool cap tile with travertine veneers and install a new water and fire feature.  Ray understood our vision and had some really good ideas to make it even better.   Glad he made an 'executive decision' on something he knew would look better.  He was right.  Highly recommend!
