Tasty Squirrel... I ate it while drove home.  I couldn't take it anymore.\nIt's singular eye stared into my soul. Mischievious. What is it thinking?!?\nI tore it apart, Head to Tail. Bite after delicous morsel of Gingerbread.\nMoist. Thick. Substantial. I'm referring to the Cookie. Think pure please.\nAfterall these are more PG-13 type of Decorative Edible Cookies. 3.5'd\nI wish my Gingerbread had tad more spice kick[personal preference].
