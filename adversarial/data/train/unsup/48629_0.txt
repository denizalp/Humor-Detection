I've eaten here a couple of times now and love it! \n\nThe restaurant: small but clean. Nothing to complain about. Eating in, they serve you the food on real plates with real forks. No disposable nonsense. I like that they have the tv on with a football game. \n\nThe food: I've tried several of the wraps and the cheesecake. I appreciate having a place to go to that has basically only healthy options. They try to allow you to make good choices with low carb tortillas and sides like veggies or salad. Even the cheesecake is NSA and therefore low carb. The food comes out fast and tastes fresh. \n\nThe service: the owner went out of her way to deliver to my work once, which was appreciated. The only complaint was that my salad was in the side container next to my hot wrap, so the salad was warm. I didn't eat it. Dining in was better for the saad. Anyway, the service was friendly and fast. No complaints. \n\nNo reason not to become a regular here, especially being located so close to home. And a groupon!
