Had these guys out for some misc electric work around the house.  Needed some plugs moved and added, light added in garage over utility sink, etc.  They did a fantastic job.  Were very professional, worked quickly, demonstrated completed work and cleaned up perfect.  When I got the bill it was fair and affordable.  My wife and I could not be more pleased. Highly recommend!
