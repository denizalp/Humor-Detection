We tried Bubba's after church for lunch. They are a restaurant but also have a full bar. I tried the Classic burger because if you can't do a basic burger well the toppings are there just to hide that fact. I ordered my burger Medium and it came out cooked perfectly. It's nice that you have options on your side. You can get all regular French fries, all sweet potato fries, a mixture of both, or fried pickles. I went for the pickles and it was a good choice. We will definitely be back.
