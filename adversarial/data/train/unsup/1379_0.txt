After a long day of shopping we were quite hungry and needed some tasty pizza! \n\nWe ordered the wagyu pizza, sausage pizza, alfredo pasta, and calamari for our appetizer. The wagyu pizza was great, but the sausage pizza was a bit on the soggy side. My hubby took out all the artichokes off  the pizza as they were huge chunks and they were very mushy and didn't really go well with the pizza. The pasta was good as well, but nothing special - probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nService and atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Will probably come back next time if were in the mall and order their bacon and egg pizza and maybe try some of their white sauce pizzas. But for what they are charging it's tempting to just drive down to 17th avenue and grab UNA Pizza's \"beltline\".
