Arrived at 830am this morning. Advised the Counter Tech, Tip. I need to have my front Pads replaced and rotors turned.. My car was just inspected. I have 5 % left on pads and enough metal for the rotors to be turned. Straight  forward right, quick fix. Well I left and walked around the area even got a haircut.. 4 1\/2 hrs of waiting. When I returned at 1:15pm. to my surprise. My car was not touched. When I asked Tip , how much longer. He stated I'm car number two. I ask for my car keys back because I have been waiting for 4 1\/2 hrs and was hungry and tired. I am very disaapointed of lack of customer service, no phone call and no apologies when I asked for my keys. It was clear.  I, as a customer was not important and if Im not important, my vehicle and safety is not important... I DID ADVISED TIP, FIRST TIME HERE, FIRST TIME CUSTOMER...
