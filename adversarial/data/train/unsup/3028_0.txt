Discusting lying place.  Was looking forward to their gluten free pizza, but guess what??? Their pizza is NOT gluten free.   They use same gloves and same oven AND the cheese is not gluten free and the tomato sauce is not gluten free. Customer service was horrible!!! They were not sorry or anything. The women who work here were laughing at my frustration!! I am calling corporation about this place.  I could of gotten very sick.  I decided to ask if specific things are gluten free and they we're all a no.  Take gluten free off the menu please, because it's a complete lie.  How inconsiderate of them to lie to the public.
