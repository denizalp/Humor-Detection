Cannot say enough about Monarch. Was a Google search for me to find out about.. I don't know how it is not listed in top 5 options in AZ. Maybe because the prices are reasonable. Either way, try this place for your next night out. Service to prefix menu was top notch. Possibly best Sea bass plate I have ever experienced.
