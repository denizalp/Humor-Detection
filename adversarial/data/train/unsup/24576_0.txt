I had to give this place a try after I read a review that this place was better than Defalco's. Funny how that Yelper didn't have a review for Defalco's. How silly of me to being swayed so easily by a cumulative 4 1\/2 Yelp review. Romanelli's is a decent place with friendly owners and employees but the parking is not fun during the traditional lunch hours. \n\nI had the hot Chicken Parmesan sandwich that was maybe 10-12 inches long. The bread and the chicken was delicious, albeit a little up there on the price scale at $8.99. I would say the food was 4 stars for me and the parking which is part of the experience for me was a 2. I would rate this place 3 1\/2 stars.
