My mother and her sister went to Sears and were rewarded with a $60 ticket. Aside from the fact that they were parked in a handicapped parking spot, legitimately, they have been going to Sears since the early 60s and never noticed any signage. Last time they, or we, will ever go to North Hill Mall again.
