Great experience!! We decided to sell our first home to upgrade, so I made the call to Team Randy and Janine. Part of their services included advice from a professional interior designer on how to stage your home. We had already cleaned and decluttered, but she gave us valuable advice on the best way to show a home and set it up for professional photography. The pictures and videos were amazing! Our house sold for full asking price after 4-5 showings over the course of one weekend!! I know that we would not have had this type of success in selling our first home if it had not been for the expertise and marketing of Team Randy and Janine. They also helped us find our new home during this process! We worked with Meghan to purchase our new home. She was great! Always accommadating with our work schedules and communicated frequently. Overall, this is a great realty team to work with because they care about doing the best for their customers!
