Flying this airline only once was enough for me. Their hidden baggage fees are ridiculous. The flight and having to listen to the attendant trying to sell credit cards over the P.A was ridiculous too. Sorry, I just spent 3 days in Vegas. The last thing I want to hear are their attendants talking, talking, talking and talking and more taliking. I want to sleep. Just shut up already!
