Cool local gym, good looking females and decent selection of machines and free weights. Low monthly fees. Take advantage of the classes there and the other amenities. People hardly use them. Sardine hours are from 6-9pm. Not the best time to lift anyways. Go here to get stronger and be healthy, not look good. There's already a bunch of people standing in front of the mirrors admiring themselves while using horrible form. :)\n\n\nHad to update my review recently went back to school now I don't have money to pay for my membership. I was told my membership would expire a year from when I first signed up. This was with golds gym, I still have the original contract paper. The membership did not cancel and this was last year (2015) and I said \"ehh \"I'll use it still\". This year I called to cancel my membership before my renewal and I was still charged the fee and they said I would have to be billed another month on top of that and my cancellation fee. I've been paying too much for this membership ($20). That was golds price for Unlimited guests. EOS price is \"$15\" and they charge me a Rate guarantee fee?!? What Kinda garbage is that!? I was here before it was EOS (2years) would have thought my rates would go down. Nope. Sadly I won't be returning or recommending this place. I was happy with this place now we are breaking up and it's not on good terms.
