I've wanted to Bacchanal for YEARS since my hubs went without me. I've held it against him for years and I was totally right to do so. Bacchanal is amazing. Definitely the best buffet I've been to in a while. \n\nThey have kiosks like disneyland that gives you a time frame of when you can come back and get in line to buy tickets. They've also have alcohol that is also unlimited for an extra fee. Why waste room in your stomach though when there's ALL that food?! I'll just go over quick highlights.\n\nI had a ton of king crab legs but so many were still frozen and after a few I gave up. They also had a ton of frozen stone crab claws (they've must've been because they're not in season right now) but it tasted pretty good. Melted butter constantly being stirred and lemon was a great accompaniment. \n\nTheir lamb is unbelievable, the best I've ever had. PERFECTLY cooked, moist, tender and seasoned. The sliders were also unbelievably good. I've paid $18 for a tiny mini 3 slider dish at a \"happening\" restaurant at Santa Monica 3rd St Promenade but this was incomparably better. Prime rib was also above average but that's expected at a place like this. \n\nFor desserts, definitely get the house-made gelato. I had cosmo's wicked spoon back to back to this place and this place's stracciatella and chocolate is phenomenal and much better. Their chocolate tastes much more authentic (if that makes any sense) than any other place. Would DEF come back.
