We like T.Pot for dinner and takeout, so 4 of us went for dim sum on a Sunday morning.\nIt was fantastic! We had been to the Silver Dragon recently, and this dim sum is better. It may be the best I've had. Everything we had was hot, fresh tasting and SO flavourful. \n\nWe made reservations for 10:30 and I would highly recommend this if you can because the resto was packed by the time we left. You definitely want to miss the after-church crowd.\n\nThe service is very good for dim sum because you pick from a menu instead of waiting for carts. The servers brought us fresh tea at regular intervals and anything else we asked for immediately, including hot sauce.\n\n Lots of families.It gets pretty loud, but that's all part of the fun.\n\nFood ******\nAtmosphere ****\nService ****
