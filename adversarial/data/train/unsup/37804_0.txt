First time eating at Island Style, it won't be our last.  Good food, Uncle Russell treated us like we were family. If your from Hawaii this as close to any kine Korean from home. Who else offers meat Jun in LV.? Haven't found any till here. Combo plate n bulgugi \/ spicy seafood soup dinner are good. Will be back...Ono...
