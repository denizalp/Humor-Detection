I love Tom Yum Noodle Soup. Before I discovered this little gem, I thought Lotus of Siam had the best. But now I find Thai Style Noodle House is even better and a lot cheaper. Plus they let you choose among 4 types of noodles, including flat, thin, vermicelli and egg. How awesome is that? This place was so good, I came 2 days in a row, the second alone. I wish I had known about this place when I was still living in Vegas.
