3.5 stars\n\nI stayed at the Palazzo for 3 nights for a conference. The conference people offered a special room price at $216 per night. Hm, that's a special deal? I wonder what the regular price for this place is.\n\nThe check-in was a breeze. Service was top notch. Everyone was polite, but I got a sense of surly but impersonal service. A bit like dealing with an automated machine, if that makes sense.\n\nOur room at the Palazzo was one of the best rooms I have stayed in my life. The room was very spacious (about 800 sq. ft.) -- as big as our apartment, and the bathroom is bigger than our bedroom!!! All marble, beautifully appointed. 3 flat screen TVs!!!!!! Opulent.\n\nI paid extra $65 for a view. Well, the view was ok, but I'm not sure if it's worth additional $65. I was excited to see the Treasure Island Siren\/Pirate show from our room, but the show was canceled during our stay. Boo~ \n\nThe wireless connection was strong. The roman shade and curtain are controlled by a remote. The curtains blocked out the bright Las Vegas strip light completely.\n\nHowever, the sheets were not as luxurious as everything else in the room. I felt like I was sleeping under a sheet of paper! Yes, it hurt my skin. The pillows aren't very comfortable either -- a little too soft for me.\n\nWe signed up for Club Grazie online and got a $15 gambling credit. Free money, sweet~ The slot machines paid out pretty well, although it could have been the beginner's luck. I earned $328 with the $15 credit. :D \n\nEverything in this hotel is expensive even for Las Vegas standard. At the same time, the casino floor felt much more calm and classier than other places, which I did like.\n\nI splurged my winning on a $90 pedicure at the Canyon Ranch spa. Holy crap, that was an expensive pedicure. It was nice, and I got to keep the nail polish, but I felt guilty for spending $90 on a pedicure. Back in Oakland, I can get a full body massage for $90.\n\nI would have bumped it up to 5 stars, but here are the reasons why I will not return to Palazzo:\n\n1) Smell: If you are sensitive to smell, you will notice a very strong perfume smell permeating outside and throughout the hotel premises. Certain areas -- entry and front desk, etc. exhibit exceptionally concentrated dose of perfume. The same smell exists at the sister establishment, Venetian. I am very sensitive to smell and can't use any scented lotions or deodorants. I felt nauseated during my stay, and I  I ended up leaving the Palazzo because of it. \n\n2) Lay out: It's very easy to get lost in this place. The signs aren't very noticeable and it's easy to find yourself inside the Venetian and difficult to find your way back to the Palazzo. I felt involuntarily trapped in the casino and shopping area. It's bad enough that you have to walk through the casino to get to the guest rooms!!!\n\n3) Casino waitresses never came around during the 2.5 hours I spent at the slot machines. When I was at the Mirage, I was offered drinks 3 times in 2 hours. \n\n4) Pool: The pool area itself is nice, but there is no wait service. \n\n5) Linen: As stated above, the sheets hurt my skin. They should provide higher quality linen, since they are charging a handsome amount and selling themselves as a luxury establishment. \n\nLas Vegas just isn't my kind of town, and staying at Palazzo was so so.
