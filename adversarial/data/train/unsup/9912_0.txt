Good customer service at this store. The associate was very patient and let us sniff quite a few teas before deciding on a few packets of loose leaf green and black tea. They have an extensive selection of tea pots, but I enjoy using their PerfectTea pots that allow you to steep and drain tea into your cup without needing a separate strainer. The tea in general I feel is overpriced though and be sure to read the ingredient list if you want more healthy tea since quite a few of the fruity and herbal teas have a lot of sugar already in them.\n\nMy favorite hot tea so far from them is the golden dragon yellow tea. It's delicate yet flavorful.
