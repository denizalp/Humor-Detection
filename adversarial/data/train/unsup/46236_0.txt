Always looking for local go-to eateries. This has definitely been added to the list. \n\nI ordered online on a Tuesday evening- it told me it would be ready in just under an hour, but when I called them to ask for the order to be rushed, they had it ready in just about half hour. \n\nI am picky with sushi but here, everything is very fresh, well-portioned, not an excessive amount of rice in their sushi like other not-so-great places. Affordable prices also! That counts.
