Simply Amazing! Hubby and I were in vegas for a few days and some friends told us to check this place out for a nice dinner. So we made reservations, arrived an were seated right away. Waiter was great, took our drink order right away and gave us some ideas of items to order. We got, truffle fries which were amazing, shredding pork wontons, AMAZING, brussels sprouts were okay, no the best just okay, baked potato was really good and 2 filet which were also amazing and cooked perfectly! Got the amores for dessert and I loved it! After dinner the chef came and introduced him self which I thought was a really nice gesture..... Great romantic dinner!
