I was always curious about Fuku Burger, but never found myself making the trek to their original food truck or their brick and mortar location on the strip. When they're Chinatown location opened up in the short-lived White Rabbit space, I had to see what the hype was about. Sometimes, I don't want a good ol' fashioned American burger. Sometimes, I'd rather have a burger that reminds me of the Amazing Aloha from Jollibee in its meat quality and sweetness factor haha. We will usually get the Kinoko (mushroom) burger or their Fuku burger (which is just a normal cheeseburger). We jazz it up with jazz fries on the side, which they pour a bunch of sauce into. Is it the most flavorful burger and fries you're ever going to have? Probably not, but there is something about it that is comforting to me. I think it's the Jollibee reminders though, since the gravy is a bit watered down too and growing up I've always dipped my Jollibee fries in the ChickenJoy gravy. \n\nI've read good and bad reviews from their different locations, but it's definitely a place you should try at least once. Have a nickname ready! They'll use that nickname to call our your order. One of the guys here does a particularly perfect and hilarious announcement of any name he's given. They also have two TVs, so good place to eat and catch any games. I would say the cashiers could be a bit more informative about the menu and engaging, but they're also cleaning up tables so I can see why they might not always have the time to interact. The tap water here also had a bad metallic taste, so I always bring a water bottle or order soda here.
