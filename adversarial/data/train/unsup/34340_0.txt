I used to eat here all the time when it first opened up but got spoiled with all the great dining in my area, central Phoenix and quit making the trip to Scottsdale.  So this past Sunday we decided to journey up to Scottsdale for Sunday brunch.  I notice that the dining area has become more formal than it used to be but the atmosphere and food are still fantastic.  Their peach bellini's are yummy and all the food super delicious!
