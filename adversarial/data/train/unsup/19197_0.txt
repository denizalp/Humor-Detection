I cannot believe I have never reviewed this place, yet I come here about twice a week. This place does it right. Simplicity with quality. Sourcing their beans from the top 1% in the world really shows here.\nVesta does everything there from roasting to brewing to serving up a friendly smile. This place has their stuff together.\nStaff seems to remember me which is really nice. I see most of the same employees there so I know they are happy and that speaks wonders. \nThe place is always clean, i don't think I've ever seen it a mess. Very urban\/hipster vibes when you walk in. They let dogs hang out there if on leashes of course. Just kind of all flows well.\nI love their hot blend. It's sooooo amazing. Usually I add milk to my coffee but this is too good to add anything to. A huge flavor boost in my mouth. For me to drink it black says a lot. They have some simple food options but nothing too crazy. Just light snacks and sandwiches.\nKeep it up vesta you all rock here: you know I'll be back! Clearly. \n#GenderNeutralBathroomsHere #Progression
