One star is too high a rating. Where can you find employment even if you have no soul? Apparently ABC Nissan.\n\nFlash back a year and a half. A self sufficient, yet inexperienced, 19 year old responds to an advertisement for an affordable low mileage used car. She exits with a new car and payments of nearly $600 a month which she couldn't afford. A classic bait and switch. Illegal? Probably not. Unethical and immoral? Clearly.\n\nOn this day, I offered to accompany the buyer to see if there was a solution that could result in a lesser car and lower monthly payments. Efforts to refinance elsewhere were not much help. Going back to the source of the problem was admittedly a long shot, but worth a try. How bad could they be? \n\nThe encounter was shocking. No admission that they had done this young person a huge injustice. Okay. Wasn't really expecting that. What they did instead was go into full sales mode, ready to screw the buyer a second time. There's substantial negative equity with the car, so options are limited. A switch to a new model of the same car, a new model of a lesser car, and conversion to a lease, were all suggested. Never mind that huge cash payments were required and that monthly payments remained high. They sensed blood in the water and they were going for another sale. Buyer be damned. The fast talking sales managers and their inability to give straight answers when pressed were amazing. It's difficult to comprehend how ABC Nissan is still in business. Or that they haven't gotten themselves into serious legal trouble.\n\nOh yes. We had difficulty getting our keys back, having to suffer through an encounter with yet another sales manager, when we tried to leave.\n\nIf you must buy a Nissan, I suggest you go elsewhere. ABC Nissan is managed under the premise that customers are prey. It's a big valley with numerous other dealerships from which to chose.
