My husband and I went to Uno's for dinner last night. We were promptly seated by the host in a section with 4 other occupied tables.  We sat and waited over 20 minutes and no one stopped at our table. There were other tables seated after us, which were promptly greeted by servers.   We decided to leave and on our way out,  I informed the host that no one had been to our table yet despite several employees (including a manager) walking past us.  Unfortunately,  the host was too busy chatting with a server to really care.  He asked if we wanted to speak to a manager, but we were so frustrated with the way we were treated,  we decided to leave instead of listening to a manager make excuses for his inattentive staff.
