Everything was good... UNTIL the morning we were packing up to check out. I spotted something crawling on the bed sheet of where we were sleeping on. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a bedbug! I quickly grabbed my phone to take pictures as proof. I was able to snapped a couple of pictures & tried to catch it in an empty water bottle but the blood sucker ran away, fell off the sheet & disappeared. We just wanted to get out of there as we were utterly mortified of not only sleeping in the room but bringing them home. \nWe did bring it up to hotel management & showed them the pictures. The manager said they would comp the resort fee, as well as 2 nights. Well... that didn't happen as I just spoke with my credit card company as well as the hotel. Eventhough, i have paper receipts stating what was being refunded, LINQ said they were only taking 2 nights of the resort fee and nothing else.
