First of all, it takes forever to try to get an appt with her and she's rude about it.  Secondly, after getting my eyelashes done by her, I realized I must be allergic to the type of glue she uses because my eyes would not stop burning.  I called her and asked her if she could get me in to remove them sometime because I was in a lot of pain.  She said she was booked out solid for 2 months and would charge me $75 to remove them!  I called around and went to a place right by my house that got me in that day and removed them for $10.  Definitely would NOT go to her again.
