Breakfast - $25\/person plus $8 for bottomless mimosas. I got my money worth there. Basic buffet stuff here fr both breakfast and lunch. oImelet station, taco station, normal breakfast foods (eggs, bacon, breads, potatoes) and a nice dessert station. \n\nLunch - $20\/person. Same stuff as the breakfast bar without the breakfast food obviously. Dessert station was a bit larger. \n\nService was very nice...which is always a plus. \n\nOverall...both were a bit pricey for what you go, but hey...it's Vegas. Enjoy!
