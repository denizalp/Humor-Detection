Have you guys seen the K-drama, \"Coffee Prince?\" I felt like I was on that show but the place was more cluttered, the furniture was eccentric, and the staff was Chinese instead of Korean. Okay, so maybe it wasn't like Coffee Prince afterall.\n\nI love the atmosphere and decoration at this place. Green and brown leather couches and arm chairs are spread throughout this large space. Squishy pillows and shelves upon shelves of games are ready for you to play. Chinese chess here, a cute side room there, and a large expansive menu is up for you to order off of.\n\nI got the frog milk tea without knowing what it was. I figured it had to be good. My frog milk tea tasted like either the center of a Cadbury Egg or a chocolate Twizzler.  We couldn't figure it out but it was sweet and delicious. It was a little too sweet though and I had to wait for the ice to dilute the sweetness a little. My drink also had popping boba in it which I told my friends were tadpoles.  Hey, we might as well go with it. Frog Milk Tea doesn't actually have any tea or flavoring in it. It's gets its name from the tadpole egg-like boba. It's a milk based drink I believe. \n\nThis place opens late and I appreciate it. There aren't many places in Arizona where you can sit down and enjoy a beverage until midnight. Also, please excuse the blurry pics. I think I had grease on my phone since we just came from Gen Korean BBQ House.
