Another great spot to head for lunch if you're looking a sandwich or salad. They have some awesome sandwich choices, it was really hard for me to decide on one. I ended up choosing the Bambino which has tuna salad, chopped jalapenos, bacon, avocado, provolone cheese, and spicy sriracha aioli on a hoagie roll. However, I ordered a their lunch deal of half house salad and half sandwich so it came on whole wheat bread.\n\nIt's weird that I ended up choosing tuna salad because that is usually the last thing I choose for a sandwich but for some reason when I read the ingredients to that sandwich I couldn't say no. I'm glad I didn't say no because I devoured it. The flavor combo was on point. The side salad was also yummy and simple as it should be. \n\nThe staff was friendly and they have a nice seating area in the back that has some comfy couches which was really relaxing on my lunch break. They have house made pickles which I'm eager to try because they did not have any available when I was there. I'll be heading back to try more sandwiches!!
