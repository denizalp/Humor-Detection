I was here Saturday morning at 8 am and as usual the wait is so long.  I actually don't mind waiting my turn but I just want to say the guy that makes the crepes is a jerk!  He stands there all day pouring the batter on the griddle with a stupid face and wore a stupid hat and he is extremely rude.  Maybe I would hate my job too if I had to do that all day but I would not be as rude as he is.  This is my third time back and even though I love these crepes, I am not sure I am going back.  Hey crepe maker . . . get a real job or put a smile on your face because you are hurting business.   I hope you are not the owner of this business.  If you are the owner then have you ever heard of customer service? If you are not the owner then someone needs to fire you.  And if I do come back then I will make sure  my husband comes and tells you in person that you are a jerk!
