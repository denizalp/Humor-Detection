I rented my home out to this family. When they moved out I had a mess! I could not believe the stains they left in this carpet. The animal urine was ridiculous! I called this company I got them from a referral., friend of mine had used them and raved about how great her carpet came out.\nMy carpet came out beautiful!\nHe got all the stains out in the urine smell too.\n5 Stars!!!!\nI'll be using them again and again!
