After a night of partying at Tao, my friends and I decided to continue our Asian theme and headed downstairs from our room at the Wynn to Red 8 for some dim sum and other assorted Asian delights.\n\nAfter opening the menu, my eyes almost started bleeding. Combination fried rice $25?!? One plate of normal dim sum $6?! I know it's the Wynn but come on! At these prices we could've just ate at The Buffet and gotten a lot of similar quality food for less.\n\nSince we already sat down and committed to the restaurant, we decided to stay and order. To minimize the damage, we ordered just 3 dim sum plates (cha shu bao, shanghai dumplings, and fried taro balls) and two dishes (broccoli beef and sesame chicken). Growing up in the bay area, I've had my fair share of good Chinese food, and let me tell you, this was not it. The cha shu bao (bbq pork buns) were soggy and the filling was an unidentifiable paste with a few bits of meat. The Shanghai dumplings had no soup in them. The broccoli beef was mediocre.\n\nIf you want good Chinese food in Las Vegas, DO NOT go here. There must be better options elsewhere on the strip. This restaurant definitely caters to rich people who don't know much about Asian food.
