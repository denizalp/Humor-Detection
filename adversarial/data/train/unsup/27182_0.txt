The atmosphere was very Frank Sinatra style fancy!  \nWe had the BEST service at Tender!!!  \nNot only was the meal phenomenal, but the service is what made it even more amazing!!!!\nWe had Manuel and John as our waiters.  They were so professional but yet so down to earth.  They offered great suggestions and checked on us regularly. Not to mention both had great personalities. \nThese 2 waiters really made it a pleasurable experience.  Thank you!!!
