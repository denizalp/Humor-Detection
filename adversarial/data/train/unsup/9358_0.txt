So it's the Saturday after Thanksgiving and all through the house  - BURGERS NOT TURKEY we all cried out! This place is close to my Mom's and allowed us an easy way to get some grub to go and allow the cook a day off. We hopped onto the website, made a list (checked it twice) for the 10 of us, and then three of us cruised over to make the order and pickup. OMG. I'm still dreaming of this place. Too bad it's a 5 hour drive....I could REALLY go for another burger from this place! My husband and I both indulged in the Culver's Bacon Deluxe, and everyone ordered a smattering of other burgers plus 8 orders of fries. We avoided the Cheese Curds because it seemed a lot of other reviewers weren't too pleased with them. Oh, there was also an order of onion rings but I didn't get to sample those. Our only \"issue\" if you will is that we requested all of the burgers be single patties and realized when we got home and unwrapped them all they were double patties - but don't worry - I still CAN'T BELIEVE I ATE THE WHOLE THING. It was SO good!!! I think there was only one in the group who felt his wasn't what we ordered ( hey, we went off of the list) but I was in seventh heaven. The place was more fast food-ish than I had pictured when we first walked in but I don't care, the food was delish and the service was pretty fast. My husband also split his chocolate malt with me which was very, VERY good. I guess I'll just keep dreaming of this burger until my next visit - but thank you Culver's for a delicious \"last meal\" with the family before we hit the road that day to head home.
