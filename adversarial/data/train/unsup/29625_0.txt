If I can rate 0-star I would. Worst eat out experience. The food is ok. We arrived at 10 pm for the dinner special $9.98.\n\nOn the menu it doesnt say what's on the dinner special. Dinner special was under 'regular'. So when the waiter asked us do you want the regular we said yes.\n\nwhen the bill came it showed $19.99 per person. I asked them why. the waiter said because you guys ordered ribs.. which is not included in the dinner special. BUT THERE IS NOTHING SAYS WHAT AR INCLUDED IN THE DINNER SPECIAL!!! The lady owner puts her hands togethe and said sorry next time. Next time? There won't be a next time. \n\nWe got ripped off. If we knew we would not order ribs at all.\n\nNow we understands why there ar not many people there on a Friday night. It wa only half full. Compare to the other Korean Bbq dinner special nights this place is quite.\n\nSo yes we got cheated! We will never go to this place.\n\nIf you want to go make sur you ask them what is on the actual menu otherwise there is always suprise charges.
