I recently had the opportunity to see a couple of shows here. One being a comedy night which was great. They had 5 comics that were all good in an intimate setting. I would say there were only about 20 of us. For the price of the tickets and beverages I would say it is much better then Yuk Yuks. \nThe second show was a tribute to the Beatles. They made me a fan. Again the drinks are pretty cheap, however; with this larger venue you can't bring your drinks back to you seat and you only have 20 minutes to enjoy your drink. If you are not a drinker you need to try a coke. It is only $1 and it is in a glass old school bottle. If you haven't had a coke from a glass bottle, believe me it is a whole new experience.
