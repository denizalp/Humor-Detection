We saw the good reviews and decided to give it a try.  Massamam Curry was my favorite.  I liked everything in it, potato, sweet potato, onion, carrot and so on.  There's even avacado in the dish.   What a wonderful surprise!  Crying Tiger (beef salad) is also great.  The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was their TomYum soup.
