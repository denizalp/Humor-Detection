My first and last foray into an Applebee's.  One star ONLY because the service was exemplary.  The hostess opened the door for us upon arrival for lunch.  Although I came here under protest, that small (corporate focus group inspired) gesture made me let my guard down and think \"Maybe it will be at least OK...\"  The waitress was quite pleasant and had the illusion of sincerity pegged.  (And in reality, it she did do a good job service-wise.)  My hopes for a adequate meal were not yet dashed.  \n\nThen the food came.  \n\nWell, it looked like what it was.  Industrial  food put together by machines.  The only seasoning was salt. \nI had ordered a chopped sirloin.  It had the shape, flavor and consistency as high school cafeteria food, but saltier.  It was covered with a special brown gelatinous slime that could be best described as \"salt sauce\".  Now,  I use quite a bit of salt. I usually salt everything, but this was like the shoreway in February.  The lukewarm baked potato had frozen butter balls in it to cool it further.  The ceaser salad was made in the same place they make airport food.   I'm surprised it did not come with a  plastic envelope of generic dressing and croutons.  Actually, it probably originally did.\n   \nGross, gross, gross.  I cant believe people eat this stuff.  And there they were, all around me, eating it all up. Now I'm starting to think that the staff must be Stepford-Waiterons to serve this crap. \n\nWretched.
