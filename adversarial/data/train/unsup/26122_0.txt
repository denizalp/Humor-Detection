I came here because I was due to get my eyes checked and was looking for something in my area. \n\nMaking an appointment is easy and I like that you can do everything online, including filling in the patient intake form. Dr M. saw me and she was really friendly and personable. The prescription on my contacts changed, and I was given 2 brands to sample before I made a decision for which one to buy. \n\nThey sell contacts and seem to price match with Clearly Contacts, but there's no pressure either way. \n\nShe also sees kids for check ups. I brought in my 6 month old (hoping she doesn't get my poor eyesight) I also learnt that check ups for kids under 20 is covered by OHIP. \n\nI'm really happy I found this place and dr. \n\nTheir glasses are $$$ but worthwhile checking out if you're into trendy new styles.
