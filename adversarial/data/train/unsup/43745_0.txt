Shocking experience. My wife's meal was incorrect not once but twice! We were made to feel like we were bad customers for asking for the meal we ordered. When the correct meal came out, the capicollo was intentionally poorly cut, as if to punish us. I advised that I was very surprised at the experience. The cowardly manager sent the poor server to deal with me instead of showing any leadership and coming out.
