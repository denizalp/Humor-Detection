Overpriced for the food, atmosphere and overall dining experience. \n\nLooks nice from outside, minus all the cats running around. Interior decor is nice but the tables and chairs were all mismatched and very old. Waitress was prompt and brought waters and offered additional drinks. She didn't go over menu at all or discuss their specials. She brought us their garlic bread, which was nothing but regular sandwich bread buttered with garlic powder and toasted on the grill, a little too toasted. The salad was pretty good with Blue Cheese and crumbles.\n\nWe ordered Top Sirloin, New York Strip, Filet Mignon and chicken Marsala. All the steaks were ordered medium well but came out undercooked and kind of bloody. The Chicken Marsala sauce was pretty thick and had the consistency of gravy but the chicken was very moist and tender. The sides were twice baked potatoes which were kind of on the small side and a little burnt on the skin, probably thrown on grill for a bit.\n\nI probably won't return unless they lower their prices considerably. It wasn't bad but not great and overpriced.
