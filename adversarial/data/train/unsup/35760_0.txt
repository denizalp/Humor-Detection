I have been to both locations and the service and the food is very unreliable. The food is so overpriced for the quality and the service they offer I am shocked at how people continue to go there. At times the food s decent but it still doesn't justify the prices which are comparable to upscale steakhouses such as Michael's on Simco and such without the actual quality of food, the ambiance, the wine list or the service. The place (both locations) are poorly designed and decorated and the music is just irrelevant. The kashk o bademjan o two occasions was bitter which is a sign they didn't taste the eggplants (which is a must for anyone who makes that dish) before making it or they knew it was bad and they made it anyways. The koobideh was stale and smelled, and the meat in the baghali polo tasted and looked like it was from days ago.
