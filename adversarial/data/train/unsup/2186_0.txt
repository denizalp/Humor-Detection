Namaste's lunch buffet is bomb with their decent selection of hot and cold food items, but how's the food and service like during non-buffet hours? I dropped in several days ago to have dinner there, so here's a review update.\n\nFOOD\nTo dine there during lunch buffet hours will cost you $10.99. It's AYCE and you receive a free basket of Naan bread.  During non-buffet hours, you'll of course have to order off of the menu. Entrees can be pricey for the portions and can range from $12-$16. Also, you'll receive a side of rice instead of Naan bread. \n\n+ Paneer Malai: I was wavering in my decision to choose which would be the best dish:  the Saag Paneer or Paneer Malai? The Saag is always good, and it's usually available during the lunch buffet but without the paneer, but the Paneer Malai isn't. I'm happy I went with something new, because now this is one of my favorite Indian dishes.  A  sauce made with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and chunks of paneer -- it's absolutely delicious. I could easily eat an entire bowl or five by myself. No shame. \n\n+ Butter Chicken: This is another item that's sometimes available during the lunch buffet, but decided to order this becauseI'd been craving Butter Chicken for the longest time. Ordered this with a medium spicy level, which was just perfect. Still loving the creamy sauce and the tender chicken. Just as good as when it's served during the lunch buffet.\n\n+ Kashmiri Naan:  A mix made of cashew nuts, cherries, and coconut is spread thinly on the inside the Naan. In my opinion, this is more of a dessert bread that I would eat on the side rather than with my meal; although, you could still dip this bread into curries and other savory dishes, because it doesn't conflict with any of the flavors. \n\nSERVICE\nGreat as usual. No complaints here. I've always experienced excellent service whenever I visit. \n\nOVERALL\nFood and service at Namaste remains exceptional no matter what time of day. This is why Namaste is my go-to Indian restaurant, and perhaps one of my favorites to dine at in Vegas.
