My sweets was overjoyed that they had a Steak & Shake inside the casino.  I've never heard of the chain.  The burger was good and overall it gets a thumbs up because of the prices...which I thought would be raised since they were within South Point.\n\nThere's also a Century \/ Cinemark Theatre which has discounts and matinee specials, they were voted by Best of Las Vegas \"Best bingo 3 yrs in a row\" and there is a 64 lane bowl alley as well.  WTH?!  My most favorite part of their casino?  The gift shop sells bottles of booze for the price of supermarkets and some lower.  My Costco size jug of Captain was the same price!  Or was it a few bucks less?  Regardless, if I ever forget or I need to stock up and don't want to get it beforehand, this DEFINITELY is a stop to be made.\n\nThis review is based on the casino and fixings...not the hotel, which I did not stay in.
