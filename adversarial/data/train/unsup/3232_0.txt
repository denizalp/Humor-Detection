Now in its third month of operation and still doing good volume, opening during the holidays a smart move that allowed early kinks to be resolved before convention season, Friday night found A.Y.C.E. Buffet at The Palms particularly busy with a broad mix of patrons including Body Builders, Locals and tourists in town to watch the Final Four.\n\nCurrently celebrating Passover with a variety of traditional Jewish dishes in addition to the 'usual' items described as a \"celebration of All-You-Can-Eat,\" seven stations spread over a sizable footprint divided by cooking method and concept, it was just prior to 6:00pm that three guests arrived before the rush and found quick seating at a banquet near \"World Pan,\" everyone taking a moment to peruse the choices and plate number one comprised of Walnut Prawns every bit as good as what one will find on Spring Mountain Road plus spicy Noodles and respectable General Tso's Chicken.\n\nAgain impressed by such a radical departure from Station Casinos' Feast brand of Buffet, everything from the d√©cor to individual servings rivaling the standard set by Caesars' Bacchanal or Cosmo's Wicked Spoon, it was working with small portions that plates two and three took a look at several of the  Passover options plus a Dinner Roll and surprisingly light French Macarons, the Chopped Liver rich and creamy while Matzo Brei, Soup and Stuffing were all pleasant, though limited personal experience prevents comment as to whether others would think they were great.\n\nExecuted under the direction of Chef Joseph Kudrak, his time with Station Casinos at Red Rock earning him a role overseeing Palms Casino Resort as a whole, it was with plate four that the first misfire of the evening arrived in the form of watery Lasagna with overly sweet Sauce, the Stromboli and smoked Ratatouille a far better example of A.Y.C.E.'s Italian offerings while the French Onion Soup topped in gooey Cheese is also worth a taste.\n\nTaking a look at the Roastery plus Smoke & Fire next, sliced-to-order Roast Beef faring better than chewy smoked Brisket while Ribs, Turkey and Morrocan Lamb Stew were all better than one might ever expect at a Buffet, those avoiding Meat will be happy to know that Herb Roasted Cauliflower, Mushroom Quesadillas and Cornbread are all very good while the layered pan of Jack Fruit Enchiladas may just be the best savory item on the whole Buffet. \n\nPriced at just $21.99 for Dinner, Station's Boarding Pass saving each guest $4, Dessert offers a whole island of items that shifts from morning to evening, the aforementioned Macarons as good as what is offered at the end of a meal at Le Cirque while miniature Carrot Cake, Cheesecake Parfaits, Lemon Meringue Tarts and Vegan Coconut Cookies all stand out amongst a collection that even goes so far as to account for dietary restrictions such as Sugar or Gluten Free.\n\nWrapping up with made-to-order Cookie Sandwiches plus three large-format Desserts, the Apple Cobbler and Fudge Brownie both nice landing pads for Soft Serve plus a variety of toppings, it warrants repeating that no visit to A.Y.C.E. should end without a heaping scoop of Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding plus or minus Ice Cream, Gelato or Caramel because save for *perhaps* what is offered at The Kitchen at Atomic there is none better in Sin City...and theirs is $8 a slice.\n\n****1\/2:  Sure some will point out the lack of (thin, frozen) Crab Legs or U20+ Shrimp, but at less than 1\/2 the price and 1\/4 the wait for Bacchanal or Wynn it speaks volumes of Chef Kudrak and his team that only two of fifty items tasted from A.Y.C.E.'s Dinner Buffet were disappointing while several were good enough that they could be menu items elsewhere - including Restaurants charging double on The Strip.
