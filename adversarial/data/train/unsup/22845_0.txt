We have been to this Urgent Care about ten times in the last two years.  We generally go on a weekend when our primary care office is closed.  \n\nWe have always liked the call-ahead feature, but in the last two months it has become more than an annoyance.  The process is supposed to work like this:\n\n1.) Call ahead and let them know your illness.  Tell them how far away you are from them so they can call you when they are that many minutes away from seeing you.  Wait in the comfort of your own home until you get the call back.\n2.) They call you and you drive directly to them and check in (including getting your insurance info and copay.coinsurance).\n3.) You see a nurse who takes your vitals and asks you to describe symptoms.\n4.) You see the doctor and he gives you any prescriptions.\n5.) You go pick up your prescription and go home.\n\nHow it has been working:\n1.) Call ahead.\n2.) They call you and you drive directly to them.\n3.) Wait hours to be checked in by an uncheerful employee and then see the nurse. \n4.) Wait an hour or so to be seen by the doctor.\n5.) Wait a half hour to get your prescription.\n6.) You get your prescription and drive to the pharmacy.  It is wrong.  You have to call them to get a new one reissued and drive back to pick it up.\n7.) You curse the Urgent Care and vow to only get sick or injured during the week.\n\nAll that, and the care you receive used to be a 4 or a 5 and is now a 3.  \n\nAnd, to top it all off... they are now considered part of the Chandler Regional Medical Center so they bill you AS A HOSPITAL even though NO ONE BOTHERED TO TELL YOU THIS AT THE CHECK IN.\n\nSo, instead of just paying your copay (mine has been between $20 and $35 in the past two years), you PAY A FACILITIES FEE on top of your visit and you are charged coinsurance.  \n\nThat meant a difference of several hundred dollars for our family when two people got sick in the same weekend.  One bill was nearly $500 and the other was nearly $300.  \n\nWhen your policies change and you start billing as a hospital instead of an urgent care, you should PUT A SIGN IN YOUR LOBBY and INSTRUCT YOUR EMPLOYEES TO NOTIFY PATIENTS (who I will refer to as customers from now on because we are clearly all just dollar signs to your organization).\n\nWe will never return to this location of our own free will.  If there's an emergency, we might as well just hit the hospital.  We are being charged for it anyhow... and at least they smile when they rake you over the coals.
