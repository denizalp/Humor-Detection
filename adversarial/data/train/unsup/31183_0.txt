This was the worst experience of my life. Top hate tuxedo. Ruined my wedding..This place shouldn't even get 1 star. First I was there personally myself 3 time to reassure things prior to my wedding. And when. It came time to getting suits they only give you the 2 days before event and I had groomsmen from out of town so the day before was there only options to pick up .. my fiance went out to pick up with them and sat for over 2 hours waiting for someone to even see him to give them our order. Which made him miss our dinner rehearsal..  they gave my father's suit to the wrong person luckily we found it given to another grooms men however did not give him my father's shoes. So the owner has to bring them to my dad at midnight the night before my wedding.. they also had 2 orders in for my nephew. Which his pants were complete capri's on him. and when The men finally got dresses the day of found stains all over the suits. My brother in law had a half dollor sized pink stain right in his crotch. I don't think the suits were ever washed and just pressed dirty..
