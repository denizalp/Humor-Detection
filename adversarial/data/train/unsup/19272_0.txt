I am always in search of good shabu shabu \/ fondue \/ hot pot places, and Shabu Shabu Paradise in Henderson delivers!\n\nTheir menu is only shabu shabu, which can be a good thing and bad.  If your dining companions aren't into cooking their meal themselves, then this place won't work for them.  However, they can always stuff themselves on the appetizers like cod fish, salads, and beef misoyaki\n\nAll entrees come with a green salad, rice, selected veggies, tofu, noodles, and three dipping sauces.\n\nThe Big F went for the King #18 ( 1\/2 Beef,  1\/2 Shrimp, and  1\/2 Scallop) for $25 and I went for the Jack #1 (Original Beef) for $18.\n\nAs the water, lightly seasoned with seaweed, heats up, a small green salad with yummy dressing starts you off.  Feel free to ask for more because they are more than happy to give it to you!\n\nThen your table gets set up with your rice, various raw veggies and food, and your three dipping sauce.  The first being a peanut sauce, then a ponzu one, and then a spicy ponzu-like one.\n\nThe pot is split so you don't have to worry about your dining companion stealing your food! When the water starts to boil, start adding the food.  I don't recommend adding all the food at once, but rather a little bit at a time.  I like to swish my beef around just to cook it a tad before dipping it into the various sauces.\n\nThe beef and shrimp were great choices, but the scallops got rubbery too quickly.  (Reading Steve X.'s review, I wish were given soy sauce and wasabi so we could have eaten the scallops raw as well.  Bummer!  At least we know for next time!)\n\nWhat makes Shabu Shabu Paradise a step up above Swish is that they also give you additional veggies without charging for it!  It seems a bit ridiculous to be charged for what is considered inexpensive veggies when you're cooking it yourself!  \n\nAnd to close it off, complimentary ice cream with fruit cocktail is offered!\n\nService is great - the waitresses are really sweet and friendly about bringing you additional things as requested or when they see you need it.  It can get a bit hectic when the restaurant fills up as it started to on the Saturday evening we went.\n\nThey have about three tables for four and one long table that seats about 10-12.  You'll definitely see us back here again when we're in the area! \n\n(Pics are posted!)
