I was extremely disappointed in this show. As a last minute plan, my friends and I raked out hundreds to see the world renowned magician that we grew up admiring. The result? A couple of typical, repeated tricks and forced jokes. The most entertaining part of the show was when an audience member came up and grabbed his ass and he laughed it off. I also went to see Frederic Da Silva (who I had never heard of) in Bally's, and he provided an intimate show with LOTS of cool tricks. It may just be me and my friends, but Criss Angel didn't live up to his hype in person. I'm sad to say that I was disappointed. If you're interested in spending a lot of money for a below average show, go for it!
