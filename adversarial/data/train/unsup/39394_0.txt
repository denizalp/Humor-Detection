DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CAR WITH THEM!! They had my Porsche overnight while they worked on my set of wheels. When I got into my car after the work was done, I put my hands on the steering wheel and immediately felt grimey. I looked at my hands and they were black with filth left by the worker. I took a rag to the steering wheel and gear shift lever. I wish I could attach pictures to this review and show you how gross it was. Absolutely disgusting! I believe these guys took my car out for a little joy ride. Oh, BTW, the work was poor as well. Again, I wish I could attach pictures. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!
