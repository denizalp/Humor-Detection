I inquired about a price on an American Standard Stratocaster at their store, and they got back to me right away.  The matched a price I was given elsewhere and even dug deeper to save me some coin.  They were really helpful on the phone and by email, and shipped my guitar to Montreal within the week (after doing a full setup).\n\nVery satisfied, and would buy another guitar from them in a flash.
