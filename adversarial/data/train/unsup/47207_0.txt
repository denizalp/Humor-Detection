This is absolutely one of my favorite places to be. I have tried many yoga studios, I was kind of groupon hopping and this place stuck! The staff is super friendly and they care about each person and their health and growth. \n\nThey offer a good variety of classes and teachers! The classes are small so you get individual attention. The studio is always clean and smells good. A few yoga studios is have been to the do hot yoga smell like dirty feet :-X. \n\nI love this studio and wish I could go everyday!
