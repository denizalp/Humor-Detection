I live across the street and only go there when need only a few things. I treat it as a convenience store. The produce shelves are usually either empty or rotten. Many times have picked up milk (organic) that had passed its expiry date!!! Not close to but actually already expired! If you want better groceries either go to Longos by Leslie or Loblaws by Yonge, south of Wilson.
