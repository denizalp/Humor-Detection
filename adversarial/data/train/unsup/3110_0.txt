I just got back from France and Italy..I had better food at the smaller cafe's and mom and pop restaurants.I couldn't believe how slow the service was on a Monday afternoon on the patio. \nOur server took the order of the 2 males FIRST at my table. (not impressed) \nIt's ladies first... Anyone knows that in the restaurant business. Right?\n\nOur table noticed that tables that got seated after us received their meals ahead of time while we were still waiting on our apps..(oysters and lobster tail)\n\nREALLY?????\n\nA gust of wind lifted up a menu that knocked over a glass of water which spilled all over the table on my side into my lap which left me soaking wet. My cell phone got wet as well ....(Look I understand Mother Nature it happens) It was the events after that disturbed me.\n\nWhen I got up to use the napkin to clean myself up, the server, clearly seeing this, she just proceeded to talk to my 2 males friends about the Louis Roederer Champagne that she wanted to open up and serve..\n\nI WAS SOAKING WET.IT WAS OBVIOUS!!... OMG!!..I needed another napkin, SOMETHING to dry myself off and to dry up the spillage on the table in front of me.\n\nI said to the server, \" Can you please get me a napkin to help me DRY OFF and to clean the table\"\n\nThe response was \"SURE AFTER I OPEN THE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE\"\n\nREALLY??? I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE RESPONSE..REALLY??\nI HAD TO WAIT FOR HER TO PRESENT THE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE FIRST AND STAND THERE SOAKING WET AND MY PHONE WAS WET AND MY SEATING WAS WET..REALLY??\n\nI RESPONDED \"NO I NEED THE NAPKINS NOW IT CAN'T WAIT\"\n\nWOW!!! \n\nAPPALLED......SHOCKED \nI would never expect this service in what is perceived as one of Toronto's top Patio's.\nUpscale? Not even close.\n\nThe poor service \nThe dress code of the hostesses needs an overhaul,my server needs etiquette classes.(micro mini tight skirts with worn out tops and tattered shoes?\n\nLong waits, lacking etiquette,no attention to details and the MERE CONCERN OF A PATRON is appalling in an establishment of this nature. On an overpriced bill of $700 for brunch.\n\nNot the first visit but DEFINITELY the last!!\n\nAn INSULTED patron.
