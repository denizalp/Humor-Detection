Blaze pizza has the best vegan pies in my opinion. Their tofu popcorn chicken is on point! Seriously, for under $8 I can get a personal pizza loaded with unlimited veggies of my choosing. I'm talking bell peppers, mushrooms, basil, and zucchini with a spicy marinara base. I always order my pizza with daiya cheese, although most vegans aren't a fan of this brand. I think it tastes awesome! \n\nWhen you're in a hurry, I'd recommend ordering online. When your order is ready for pick-up, you just mosey over to the cashier and they'll fire up your pizza in the oven. Otherwise, waiting in line may take a sec because Blaze always has a crowd.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #7
