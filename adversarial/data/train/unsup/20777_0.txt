Rude waitress. Copped an attitude the INSTANT she walked up to the table, not sure why.   She musta thought she was God's gift.  I clearly saw FRIJOLES BORRACHOS on the appetizer menu.  I ordered them.  She said \"We don't even serve frijoles barachos\" in a really snotty way,  I thought I was ordering from  the captain of the cheerleaders, so STUCK UP!!! I suggest that if you are server in a restaurant, to know your menu and don't be a %$#$^.  Her RUDENESS caused us to walk out right then and there.
