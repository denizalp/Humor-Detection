My man and I had our first Canadian date here, and although I had a wonderful time, I have to admit that it was mostly due to the present company, and not so much the venue and food. Don't get me wrong -- the food is fine, just nothing I'd rave about to a friend looking for a Calgarian recommendation.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly (but so is every other Canadian in the world, it seems), and made some recommendations for us. We opted for the Halibut and Chips with a side of curry, as per our waitress's advice, and the Blackened Ribeye Steak with a salad of greens on the side. The food arrived promptly, and we dug in.\n\nWe started with the greens, which were dressed with a berry-citrus vinaigrette of some sort. Not great. The Halibut and Chips were tasty, although I much preferred my malt vinegar over the side of curry. The Halibut was light and flaky, with the filet inside delightfully maintaining its moisture without being inundated with frying oil. Not bad, if I do say so myself! Although at $18 for 3 filets, I would expect at least this much. Note: the fries\/chips weren't very good. :(\n\nI tried a bite of my hunny's steak, and though I give it ten points for being wonderfully tender, I have to take back points for being overseasoned. It was drenched in steak sauce of some sort, and any natural taste the steak might have had was completely overwhelmed. I've never had a $25+ restaurant steak this poorly done.\n\nIt's worth mentioning, however, that I did like the setting of the place -- definitely very Irish pub-ish, laid back and fun. :)\n\nThe verdict:\nfood: 2 stars\nservice: 4 stars\nprice: a bit pricey.
