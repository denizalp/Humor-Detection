We went here last week to close out a grueling week of conference training and networking.  The place is kinda hard to find but we finally found it.  It's rather dark inside but the restaurant area is on the second floor and is somewhat narrow but nice.  They boast that it's the only 2nd floor seating in the entire Grand Canal.  Woo.\n\nWe had a fixed menu since there were nearly 50 of us.  We only chose the drinks and one of three entrees.  The appetizer (radicchio, mozzarella and speck) and salad were uninspired, as was the bread and butter.  Seriously this is VEGAS, there should be like lava in the butter, or the bread should be red, or there should be a nude lady dancing on the table.  COME ON!\n\nI ordered the beef medallions.  Again, uninspired.  They were a bit salty and had a sauce on top.  And we all know truly good beef needs no sauce.  It seemed that the sea bass was the best of the three dishes.  The wine for the most part was good, but we hit a really nasty one and switched over from red to white.  The service was average, but why would you expect anything better if they've already been paid up front with a fixed menu service?\n\nThe saving grace was the dessert tray.  Large 20\" trays of bite-sized desserts were presented to us.  There were so many to choose from and every one that I tried was fantastic.  We all joked that it must have been brought in externally since we saw no indication of a pastry chef and the quality of dessert to the rest of the meal was complete incongruous.\n\nAll in all, not impressed.  There are a bunch of other places to go in Vegas, and I'm eyeing that new Cut place in Palazzo.
