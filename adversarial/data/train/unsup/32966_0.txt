Maybe the food here is just a little too authentic for your average round eye.  My palate is maybe a little more advanced than that of my dinner guests. By the reviews we thought this was maybe more like your average Anglo Chinese restaurant. Only 3 stars because it didn't turn out to be what we thought.
