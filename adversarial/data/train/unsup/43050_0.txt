It's located in the LINQ hotel, but connected to the outside.\nWe ordered brisket trashcan nachos and a bacon mac and cheese burger. The nachos were bomb! Worth the $20 bucks. The brisket nachos had the meat and a barbecue sauce type of flavor, it was so good and the portion was huuuge. \n\nThe burger however, was definitely not worth the $20 bucks. I was well warned by many reviews on here but I just had to try it.. and they were right! It's not worth it. Hahah.. So save your money!
