Very dissapointing. For the price, I thought I would get a real sandwich! $12 for a catfish sandwich was more like a slider than a sandwich. My friend got the meatloaf and is was pretty pitiful for $13. No sides, not even fries or chips. This place is charging a lot to be trendy. Definitely not a good value for what you get. Oh, if you like watered down vinegar tasting barbecue sauce, you might like this place.
