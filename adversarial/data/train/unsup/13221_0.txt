Largest Chocolate Fountain... IN THE WORLD! \n\nThis is their claim to fame. It is a pretty cool sight to see! You can't miss it. Right around the corner from the Bellagio Conservatory. \n\nTheir crepes here are delicious! My bf and I also recently tried their tiramisu gelato which I thought was just okay. Nothing too special about it. They also have lots of different desserts and chocolatey treats and goodies you can take home as souvenirs... they don't last since you'll eat them but I guess you can still call it a souvenir since your taste buds will remember it. :)
