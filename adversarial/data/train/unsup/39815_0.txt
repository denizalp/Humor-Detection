I love Soulpepper. I've been there a few times now. Its my favourite theatre venue in Toronto.\n\nWhy? The distillery district is beautiful- I love walking through its daintily lit cobblestone alleys on my way to the theatre. Its easily accessible by TTC or car.\n\nThe theatre itself is a mix of modern and casual elements. I love the feel, smell and touch of it! I like that its not too big and touristy. I love their intermission drink selections (from wine to hot chocolate) and their cookies are scrumptious.\n\nI'm saving the best for last. I have never been disappointed by any production I've seen there. The acting is solid. I have seen some amazing productions (most recently the Crucible...go see it!). There is no bad seat in the theatre. The prices are affordable and they have deals for students like me. \n\nSoulpepper is one of those places that reminds me how lucky I am to live in Toronto. Awww...I'm getting mushy writing a review!
