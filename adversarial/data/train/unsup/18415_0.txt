***This review is strictly on the drinks***\n\nAfter a long day shopping on the strip we ended up at H&M and when I saw the Max Brenner sign I knew I had to try it. We opted to sit outside so and just get chocolate wasted. \n\nMe and a friend got the chocolate martini with a shot of Baileys with a toothpick of chocolate dipped strawberry's. My other friend got the chocolate cake martini which came with marshmallows. The price was about $12-14 which is kind of pricey for a martini but it was deliciously pricey. The martini really does taste like chocolate and with one shot of baileys...you could practically drink it as if it was chocolate milk, which could be a good or bad thing ;)
