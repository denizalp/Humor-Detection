Don't let the outside of this bar fool you, it's super nice and new on the inside.  I check out most bars when they first open.  Fantastic reverse happy hour, Sunday through Thursday.  The apps were delicious and cheap, as were the drinks!  There's mini TVs at every table so it would be a great place to watch a game.  Servers were nice and attentive, no complaints at all!
