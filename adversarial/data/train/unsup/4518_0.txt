Came here for my friends bday dinner the other day and wasn't overly impressed with the food and service.\n\nI ordered the scotch egg which was actually pretty good! I love my eggs, and this was a totally new way with some breaded-like texture pork sausage around the egg.\n\nI also got the Wilcox poutine. Oh man, something about it was off. It the gravy tasted sweet but at the same time it tasted like it was plastered in salt. I didn't end up finishing it. Only good thing about it was the presentation of it in a hot stone pot.\n\nNot sure yet if I'll go back, but if I do I will definitely try something else.
