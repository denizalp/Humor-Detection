Basically one main on the menu: fresh noodle soup with beef. There are a few sides as well. Place is small but the tables turnover pretty quickly. The food was good and I will return. \n\nRegarding service, I believe you just wave down any server when you need anything. This is quite common a lot of Chinese restaurants.
