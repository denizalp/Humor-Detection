Hertz doesn't understand what a reservation is. We booked a Ford Fusion or similar, and was placed in a Ford Mustang. Which doesn't help when you have a family of 4. I showed them my receipt and they explained that a mustang is what we booked and we could pay $20 more a day for a Camry. If you ask me a Camry is more comparable to Fusion than a Mustang. \nEveryone was rude there. There was only one person who was checking out cars. Upon return Miriam was rude didn't give us any directions and could not answer any questions. \n     We were also charged for 18 gallons of fuel when the car has a 16 gallon tank. \nWe aren't renting here again!
