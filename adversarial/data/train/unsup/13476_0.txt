Of all people, I did not think I would be one to like this place. Big open entrance, annoyingly you climb up, to climb back down, to climb back up. Bathrooms open on both ends of a water fountain, rather mesmerizing depending how far into your night you are. Security were nice, back was a little understocked and as per the floor they could have used more garbages. Back terrace was beautiful, they should get a restaurant or something going out there in the meantime.
