The company is a scam. Here are my reasons. I was contacted by a sales rep. I made an appointment to hear their presentation for 90min. In return we would get 4 tickets to Disneyland and $100 dining gift card. We got neither!!! I heard everything they said didn't believe one word. If it sounds to good to be true it usually is. I didn't purchase their membership. So the sales rep went to go get me my gifts that were promised after their presentation. He gave me a stupid pamphlet that I have to mail in with $100 cashiers check and we have to pay addition money for addition fees and taxes. Then he gave me a $100 dining card. I went online went to restaurants.com to redeem and purchase my dining gift cards and guess what!!!!???? The stupid code they gave me is invalid!!! What a scam they are liars. We didn't get anything. So don't waste your time going and listening to their lies. They will say anything to get you to come in!
