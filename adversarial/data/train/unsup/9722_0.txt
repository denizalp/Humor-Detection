I feel like Doc and Marty dropped me off in the Delorean, right smack in the middle of Boulder City. Grandma Daisy's had just about all of my childhood(and adult) favorites. They have a wonderful display of chocolates, brittle, candy apples and of course fudge. It being as hot as it was I opted for some ice-cream. Nothing that is out of the ordinary just some good ole ice cream on a hot day. As I walked around the store more I noticed the rock candy section. This was one of my favorite treat growing up. I selected a few for the road and it defiantly brought me back to my childhood.
