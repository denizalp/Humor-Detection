Despite some of the negative reviews, my husband and I and another couple tried this place out for breakfast. Yes, we are married, and according to another reviewer, that means our standards MUST be lower than single people who live in phoenix, but you have been warned that my review might be swayed because I'm a sub-par married woman.\n\nI had the pancake breakfast, my husband had the wolfpack, my friend had a breakfast sandwich with ice coffee, and her husband had the loco moo (a fav from Kauai). All plates had more than enough, delicious breakfast food. The service was great, food was speedy and came out hot. We will definitely be coming back! Keep up the good work Gilbert Over Easy! All of married folks thank you!
