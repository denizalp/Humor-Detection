This was my destination for a quick lunch. After venturing up to the 2nd level of the sail and mast type structure of DT Summerlin. I was pleasantly surprised to enter a bustling mid afternoon lunch crowd with music blarring.  \n\nAfter browsing the menu and being informed of the $4 brunch beer specials. I decided I will take TWO! Start off with a Duvel Belgium brew which was good. More of a lager than my preference of IPA but still a tasty brew. Round two was a Live Free or Die! Brew from SF which satisfied my hoppy taste buds.  \n\nFor eats I went with the CCB.  A chicken burger with avocado, thick bacon, red onion, blue cheese aioli, bib lettuce, tomato jam and a fried egg over med.  Eggs on sandwiches means egg all over everything especially your hands. I did my best impression of Guy Fieri wirh my elbows up to not end up wearing this mountain of a burger.  The unique combination of ingredients definitely made this a tasty \"sammy\". You have been warned though it is messy. I felt bad destroying the fine white linen napkins with my messy hands and face.  The fires on the side were a perfect crispy golden brown and seasoned appropriately.  I like the natural cut with the skins still in play.  The sirracha ketchup on the side was perfectly balanced and not too spicy to kill the flavor. Nicely done indeed. \n\nOverall great visit. I cannot wait to come back in the fall to enjoy the 2nd level outdoor patio seating.
