Well I hate to give bad reviews but thorough ones are needed. My arrival time was 15 minutes before my check- in time which is 15 minutes or so minutes before the actual appointment time(30 minutes before my appointment) but was still not seen until and hour after my appointment time and an hour. Mind you this was a Monday morning 8am appointment and there were a lot of people there but at 8am and already an hour behind... I'm a little disappointed.\n\nThe waiting area was comfortable however crowded. Lots of magazines and things to read, I saw someone bring in a laptop to work on while I was there... smart people in the world make me jealous in these situations.\n\nThey took me back approximately 30  hour in to see an assistant who went over my issue\/eye sight check and then headed me back to the waiting area.\n\nDr. Ford was very knowledgeable which is why I gave the 3 star rating. He took his time (all of about 15 minutes) explaining my ailment and that it wasn't serious and would go away eventually. The office was clean, parking was ample and the office was easy to find. I don't know if I would come back unless I got the first appointment of the day.  I didn't think it would become an almost two hour endeavor which was the downside.
