I went in a few months ago looking for a sofa, and ended up finding much more for well under my budget. The 90 day interest-free financing option I received allowed me to pay off my furniture quickly and easily online. I worked with Sunshine and we had spoken several times over the phone, before and after my purchase, and she was always friendly and courteous. My delivery arrived on time and the movers were kind enough to even help assemble the new tv I purchased along with my living room furniture. I recommend stopping in if you are in the market for new furniture.
