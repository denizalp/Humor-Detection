Well... where do I start? is it with the fact that NO ONE speaks English... apparently not even well enough to understand OUCH... and painful groans! While you lay there in agony wondering if you can just get up and leave!! They ask if you want deep or med and trust me when I tell you you get what they want to give you.\nBoth my friend and i went yesterday 01\/26\/2018 and while the girl looked at me and said \"off... off\" my friends guys was busy snapping at her shirt and bra... (she chose to leave her shirt on as later I will explain why)\nThe 2 people who \"treated us\" are NOT certified reflexologists~! \nThere were so many things that I can not even list them... burping, smacking of something in his mouth... I am pretty sure she picked my blanket up off of the floor and 100% know she dropped it back there neatly folded (assuming for next client) it just goes on and on... Another great thing about not speaking English is when she looks at you and says \"oy..oy.\". she means oils! She had to go get the Head Dragon from the front desk and she came in and asked me if I wanted oil... I was like... sure. EXTRA FEE! lol\nBut before it was over and we were literally picked up and dropped and  on the table... not kidding, seriously had my pants pulled down just above the crack!! and a knee in between my legs.. ( my Girlfriend was lucky enough to miss this little part!) But by this time I was laughing so I didnt cry... and all the while my best friend is feeling quite violated wondering how many lines have been crossed.\nAfter the 90 mins (which I don't know how ANYONE could survive) as we go to pay, knowing it is 50.00 for 90 mins she informs me the \"oy\" is 5.00 more. We both had 10.00 tips in our hands which is 20%. As both the violators are standing behind us she  (head Dragon) tells us our tip is not good enough!!  In my best Japanese accent... \"you pay more... they work so hard for you! you pay at least 15\/20.00 dollar... this not good... you have more I see it!\" ( she saw a 50.00 in my wallet!) I kid you not we gave her more money!\nSoooo I know this was long but sure wish we would have read the reviews on Google and yelp....  hope this helps!\nBEWARE
