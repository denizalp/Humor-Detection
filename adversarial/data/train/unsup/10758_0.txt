I was here for a birthday party and as soon as I walked in, this place struck me as dirty and the front desk registration area-unorganized. There was a group off to the side of the line I guess waiting for their family to get their payment and hand stamps sorted. There were super loud and obnoxious and I'm surprised that the staff didn't ask them to be a little more polite. Some games here felt greasy (handles, buttons, etc.) and clean tables were scarce. Food was on par with fast food and the salad was wilted. Soft serve machine splattered on my shirt. I will never come here again.
