This little train museum is a super fun and free activity in Downtown TO. We happened on it by accident after leaving the Skydome, but my son thoroughly enjoyed himself. \n\nWe spent quite a bit of time here, the trains were sort of open to be explored. He climbed on everything and got my uncle to follow him around, it was pretty funny. I was impressed with the size of it for a free display amidst so many expensive attractions. It was definitely refreshing to see something like this among so many commercialized ventures. And it was cute to see so many happy children. I don't post pics of my son's face, so I had a hard time finding photos on my camera roll where he wasn't bombing in every shot :-)
