Used them two times and must say there are much better landscapers out there that I will be hiring one of in the future.  One thing that they did that was frustrating was they just showed up without confirming a day with me (2 times), thank goodness someone was home to let them in the backyard.  Their prices are on the higher side considering the quality of the service is average at best.  But mainly, the owner was super rude to me when on the second visit, (an annual service, none the less -) the work that we had verbally agreed upon was not completed and I had to call them back out to complete the job.  The owner then proceeded to be argumentative with me and inform me that he \"had written down everything on the invoice\", which he had not and how \"he'd had trouble with me all 3 times he'd serviced my house\". - Interesting, because he'd only been there twice and the previous year there WAS an issue but it was with a neighbor's tree and not with me at all.  So, in conclusion, they finished the work and my yard looks fine now - but I must advise that I would look further before doing business with a vendor that would talk to a female client so disrespectfully without having of their facts straight, very unprofessional.
