I would say the lunch buffet is 3 stars simply because I like my food spicy and boldly flavored, and lunch buffets are much milder and lack that oomph. \n\nThat said, ordering dinner portions or ordering to-go is a 4 star experience, so that's what I'm basing my review on. \n\nWhen I asked them to make it super spicy, they did not disappoint. On a price-to-quality ratio, this place nails the mark. I spend about $40 on a Door Dash order (the only way you can have food delivered from here) and I had enough food for about 4 meals. \n\nOverall, I recommend this place and will be treating it as my go-to for spicy Indian food. I think the other Indian restaurants around here are not as good on the price-to-quality ratio. Example - The Dhaba has really good food, but their portion sizes are really skimpy and they charge too much for those tiny portions.\n\nPro Tip: If you want delivery and you are a 1st time Door Dash user, you can often get a promo code to save some money. I got $7 off when I made my first order.
