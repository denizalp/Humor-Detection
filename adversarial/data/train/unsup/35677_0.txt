I have been going to Rockefeller Barbers for more than 13 years.  It started as a convenience, right across from my office, but turned into a \"long term relationship.\"Craig was such a great guy and I looked forward to chatting with him to talk about his former shows and his trips to South Dakota to see his family and hunt.  I have found that Nick is equally as enjoyable to chat with...I do find the stories are nothing like Craig's though...LOL!\n\nI will be retiring from my job soon, God willing, and will continue to make the trip downtown to get my haircut...\n\nI recommend YELP add a sixth star!
