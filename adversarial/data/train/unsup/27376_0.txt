I purchased a massage chair very happy with it.. Then a month later I purchased a couch with a chaise, but it was delivered with a hole in it. So fine there going to remake it. Great! but I Still have a whole day wasted because I have to wait for the delivery. Time is money! I asked for a 20% coupon to use in store for the inconvinece . Brad Miller the store manager offered me a 50.00 gift card.. I said I needed to tip the drivers again and he said that wasn't necessary they make a good living. THAT was insulting due the fact I'm a tipped employee.. He missed the whole issue another wasted  day waiting for a delivery! Anthony Lenz the Sales guy was great! But Brad  Millers lack of  judgement on how to handle this was extremely poor!!!!we all have busy lives no time to wait for a second delivery.. I work nights left my phone on so they could call me for the time . No call had to call Terry in deliveries which took 10 minutes... Won't be back
