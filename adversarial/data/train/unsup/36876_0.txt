Nice place, big but comfortable. Great bartenders! The best part.. the food is hands down amazing!! Great happy hour with awesome little food bites, I have been here many time and have tried most everything on the menu, I have yet to find anything that wasn't totally amazing!! Give this place a try, you will believe me then.
