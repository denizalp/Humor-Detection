After my lower review I was promptly contacted by the staff at salt cellar, given an apology and told the best means of resolving issues should something like this happen again. Tell your server promptly, go to the manager quickly. It seems sometimes lobster can have issues beyond the ability of the staff to be aware of until it is actually cracked open. I will give the Salt Cellar another try in the future.
