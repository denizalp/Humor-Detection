We've gone for three weeks here. It is important for me for there to be a fair amount of worship, a diverse population, cohesive solid biblical teaching, a pastor that encourages people to love Jesus with abandon, which is why were created (and others as ourselves which can b  challenging), and different ministries available ie women's, men's, outreach, marriage and healing seminars. It is also important for there to b \"prophesizing\" which is just christianese for declaring outloud Gods promises in order to encourage, edify and remind us.\nThe worship has variety- old hymns, contemporary and somewhat soulful gospel. I must admit I would like it if the worship wasn't as constrained but I understand people are at different spiritual places and we all worship differently. The teaching by the pastor is easy to follow is relevant , is a fair amount and refers to scriptures often. So far we r pleased with this pastor and church and will continue to attend.
