Just leaving as I write this. Wrapping up a 14 day business trip in 6 different cities and this was our last stop. What a delightful hotel. The rooms are spacious, very well appointed, CLEAN, and have great bedding. They offer an included hot breakfast and have a very high end and delicious steak house attached to the hotel. Service at hotel all around was really good. Compared to the other hotels we stayed at throughout our trip this was the stand out winner.
