First visit today.  Absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe wife said she would be leaning towards 4 star--she felt the toppings for the dogs were a bit skimpy.\nI disagree with this.  I thought it was the proper amount.\n\nWe did not get toppings on the tots.  We went with several dipping sauces.  Some really tasty ones!  My favorite was the Korean BBQ and the truffle honey mustard. \n\nThe prices were great, and quality was solid.\nOh, and the drinks list was solid as well!\n\nWent went for Saturday Lunch and there was no wait.  Can't vouch for other times, but we will be back!
