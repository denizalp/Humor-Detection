This is my wonderful experience to share with you!\nFirst I ask friend to suggest for reliable and expert skill dentist I need. She provide \"Happy Dental\" which are away from my house 30 min driving range(I am live in Henderson)! But,\nSaturday morning, after my wife and I walk into the front office, the first impression to me is: I am a walk-in and new patient buy they already have clear info and verify my insurance ready! This is the fast speed For my dental experience ever have. As they're so busy for existing patients, within 10 min they are ready for let my wife and I get into room and start X-ray & checking and cleaning.\nDr. Andy and all assistance are showing happy, passion and professional attitude that makes me feel comfortable and pleasure time doing all process.\nThis is the right place for my family to visit next time with our teeth health . Best suggestion and share!
