They have what ya need. It's a well-kept store. \n\nConvenience notwithstanding, did the old South Hills Theater really need to be demolished to make way for this CVS when another just like it already stands 5 minutes away on Brookline Boulevard? \n\nThe thoughtlessness of it all boggles the mind and breaks the heart.\n\nP.S. If you care, these are the hours for the pharmacy itself, not the store.\n\nMonday-Friday: 8:00 AM - 10:00 PM\nSaturday: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM \nSunday: 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM
