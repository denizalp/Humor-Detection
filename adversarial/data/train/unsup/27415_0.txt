It's Hard Rock, it is neither a stellar dining experience nor a bad one.  It was early but I was tired and wanted to keep it light, therefore dinner was salad based.  Note the the cook (or the chain): a handful of deli sliced chicken packed tight and thrown on the grill is not \"grilled chicken\". \n\nHard Rock...the decor is usually fun and so is the staff. It is what it is. And in this location, better than some of the other nearby options for lunch and dinner.\n\nProps to the Business Manager for taking the time to read reviews and comment on each of them; clearly she is working to make Hard Rock the best experience she can for each guest within the rules she must follow (all business have rules that are not apparent to the customer).
