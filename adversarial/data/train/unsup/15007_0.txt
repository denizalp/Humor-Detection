In general, airports are airports.  But what I love most about McCarran is the ease of getting in and out of the place.  Every other airport commute in major US cities are a total hassle.  This airport is by far easiest, most convenient.  It's only 15 minutes away from my place.   \n\nSure they could have more bars and better places to eat but it's not that big a deal.  I wonder how long it takes for airport workers to tune out the video ads at luggage pick up.  Do they wake up screaming at night hearing \"Phantom\" in their heads?
