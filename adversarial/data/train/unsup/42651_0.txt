Thank you Dr. Barruga and your staff for changing my smile.  I used to hold my mouth when I smiled due to a dead root in the front.  Now I can't stop smiling.  I have a lot of confidence and owe it to you and your staff.  Have a great Fourth of July weekend with your family. You deserve it! I will recommend you to all of my friends and family.
