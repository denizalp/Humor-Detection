I went for a 6 mile run before running to this location and getting the El Luchador smoothie. What a great way to end the run! They were out of hemp milk, so I asked for it to be made with coconut milk, and it was still great! I would be interested to try the food here, but I can already tell it's a one of a kind place in Charlotte.
