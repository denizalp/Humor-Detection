I had recently been frequenting this Sally's for a few specific items and found the prices for those particular things to be fair and the selection is nice. After looking around the store I noticed that most of the other merchandise is overpriced even with the Sally discount, so I can't ever see buying anything except those few specific items that I have been stopping in for. The customer service has been hit and miss with mostly misses. My last visit had me looking for the next closest Sally's on yelp upon exiting the store since I can't see returning to this location after the service I experienced. The female working had a name badge that said \"store manager\" yet she was hardly what I would consider management material. Not only was this store manager rude, but she was wearing a shirt that had vulgar language across the top of it. I wanted to make an exchange and she said since I used a coupon it wasn't going to be easy for her to do and that she would have to refuse me a receipt since she needed it to fix her records that would be messed up later all because I wanted to exchange an item that states is exchangeable and returnable on the receipt. This manager also had no knowledge about the items I was looking for and the store was cluttered. Definitely not a great Sally's location.
