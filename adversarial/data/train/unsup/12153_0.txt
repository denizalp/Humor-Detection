We come here for the Babcock ice cream! The prices are really reasonable, $2.50 for a single scoop. \n\nWe took our friend from out of town to try the locally, not to mention famous ice cream that's made here on campus by the food & science department. \n\nI'd say my favorite is the chocolate peanut butter. Another winner is the pecan. The Pumpkin was also very good.  Ask for lots of samples before deciding on your favorite!
