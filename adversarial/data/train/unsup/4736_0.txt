EEEEEeeeek!  With Allied Schools in CA, I studied and ACED the Broker exam!  \n\nWith ABC in Nevada... I studied... and I'm lucky if I knew 40% of the questions.  The books are horrible, the on-line stuff barely works, and nothing they have is intuitive.\n\nNote:  I've already taken, passed, and ACED the CA exams with Allied schools, so I am not new to the process.  \n\nDon't use ABC for preparing for your NV State Exam!!!
