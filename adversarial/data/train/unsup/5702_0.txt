What a fabulous little find courtesy of Yelp. Searching for a close by brunch spot, Block Bistro popped up first on my Yelp search. Tucked away behind a residential neighborhood - Vermillion- is Block Bistro. The downside is that service has room for improvement. We waited about 10 minutest to be seated. The couple in front of us were waiting even longer without any type of acknowledgement. There were tables available and there was no line. While eating, we saw another couple come to the entrance and wait at the host stand for about 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging them and they left. It's as if staff just didn't pay attention to the door. Additionally, while our waitress was kind and attentive, she came out of the back scraping stuck on food particles off our extra plates with her bare hands. I'm going to guess she didn't just finish washing her hands right before. There was a long wait for our food considering the restaurant wasn't very busy.\n\nThat being said, Block Bistro redeemed itself with food. They may have the BEST shrimp and grits in the area. Yes, move over Tupelo. My guy ordered chicken and waffles. BB makes it own special pepper syrup (they put red pepper flakes in the syrup overnight. We asked) that is downright DELICIOUS. My guy ate all of the chicken and waffles and had to know the secret ingredient for the syrup. The chicken they used was cooked in a way that it was comparable to a Burger King. They could use a breading from scratch. That being said, the food was GREAT. I will definitely be going back soon. I may become a brunch regular. It was that good.\n\nI forgot. The \"small\" orange juice is the same size as a small cocktail. It's $2.25, but not worth it. Too tiny.
