Thank you to my Awesome boyfriend for bringing me here one day before going to dine at Du-pars restaurant and bakery.\n\nI knew about this toy store from the show Pawn Stars as I have seen them bring the Manager\/Owner of Toy Shack on the show for appraisals and advice.\n\nThat very man was in the store when we visited on a Friday so I had a chance to chat with him for a bit.\n\nThis store is Amazing fun with all of the old toys from my day and beyond. I definitely was taken on a stroll down memory lane.\n\nTransformers, betty boop, CPK dolls, garfield, He Man, She Ra, My little pony, Gremlins, monchichi are just a few of my favorite things!\n\nWhile I was there a lady caught me sniffing the skin and hair of an old school Cabbage Patch doll. I have no clue what made me do that however I do remember the distinct smell of that yarn hair and plastic rubber skin lol. If only I still had the CPK dolls my Mom had gotten for me back in the day I would be very thankful.\n\nMy boyfriend saw the set of crash test dummies car set in which he used to have as well back in the day. I am glad he said something because had I picked up the car and played with it like I was about to then it would have fallen out into lots of pieces. \n\nThis store is cool, they have lots of new and old toys. The prices are not cheap, you are going to pay to replace your favorite old school toy! \n\nThey have a tour, not sure of the details but we noticed on the way out a group of people all come in with badges and an announcement that before the tour they could take a photo with The Owner.\n\nI will be back :)
