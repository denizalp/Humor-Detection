This place is truly a gimmick. It might even have been created on a dare.  But, a gimmick that makes a darn tasty burger.\n\nThe menu warns you, up front, what you are walking into.  Specifically, it warns you about the specific kind of surgery that you are likely going to require if you continue eating these burgers.\n\nThe fries are fried in lard and the milk shakes have the highest milkfat percentage of any shake traditionally produced.  In fact, they tried to run it a couple percentage points higher, I am told, but the shake machine kept seizing up.  So, just to flaunt reality, they will drop pats of butter into some of your shakes.\n\nThis is truly a place where you go to say \"to the wind\" with all dietary restrictions.\nAnd vegetables.\nAnd sobriety.\nAnd sanity.\n\nSeating is more than ample here and you don't leave hungry.  Prices are reasonable and the mural on the back wall, alone, is worth the price of any menu item.
