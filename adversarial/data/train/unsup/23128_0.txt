I hate that I'm writing this but this was such  bad experience I feel it needs to be shared.\n\nI had gotten off work and decided I wanted a salad. I love The Habits food, especially their salads. So I went in, ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad. Simple enough. She asked me if I wanted everything on it, I said yes. It took a little long in my opinion but nothing outrageous. The guy buzzed my buzzer, grabbed my bag and left. \n\nGot home, opened my salad. No dressing...zero. Its usually mixed in the salad by them. I figured, maybe they put it on the side, fine. Nope, no dressing at all in the entire bag. Checked my fridge, we don't even have dressing to put on it!! So I have dry lettuce, chicken, and croutons. So disappointed.\n\nI decide to call the store to ask for a refund. But no, you can't call a specific Habit, they have a call center. The call center said that they couldn't issue refunds. They said I needed to fill out an online request form if I wanted anything. So I did. I filled out this entire form. Went to submit it....the website is filled with errors. It wouldn't let me submit the form because I hadn't filled out the stores street address, which would have been away to fix, except for the fact that I did write it in the box, retried several times with no luck. \n\nCalled the call center back, the guy took my number down and said management would call me tomorrow before noon.\n\nNo salad dressing...no money...no dinner\n\nThanks Habit!!
