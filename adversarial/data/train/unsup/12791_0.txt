Alot of people think this place is a dog park. There is dog crap everywhere as you walk around the mile long concrete  path as most people seem to ignore the bags that are provided. I had a run-in with a large poodle owner also who thought she was special letting her dog roam around without a leash. I know giant poodles aren't dangerous, but I have seen pit bulls and bigger dogs off leash too. These snobs who live in North Scottsdale are pathetic and immature and think they are above the law. This is a soccer complex, so put your ugly dog on a lease and pick up your crap or maybe I will come over to your yard and drop a load right there too.
