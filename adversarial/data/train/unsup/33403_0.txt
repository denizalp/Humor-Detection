My family has been going to this vet for about the past 12 years and we've never had a single reason to complain.  They are very friendly and seem to really care.  I usually see Dr. Ulitchny, but have seen 3 other of the doctors that worked there and liked every single one of them.  As long as I live in Vegas, I will definitely take my pets to this vet.
