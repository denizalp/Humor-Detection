All the rave reviewers need to calm down!  This place is okay, not great, just okay.  Let's start with a Thai staple, Tom Kha Gai (Chicken coconut milk soup).  First off their soup has vegetables in it that I've NEVER had in any Thai soup before - very weird to have bell peppers and bok choy in this soup.  Also the absence of Kaffir Lime leaf is astounding for a Thai joint.  This is such a distinct flavor that MUST be in this soup, otherwise it's a failure - I'm sorry, lime zest doesn't cut it.\n\nThe curries are quite good.  I've had Massaman, Panang and Green.  All very good.  \n\nIt's okay for a west valley Thai if you live in the area and don't want to drive far.  Otherwise, Royal Jasmine on Indian School (east of Pebble Creek), Siam Thai (51st ave and Northern) and Bangkok BBQ (T-Bird & 51st) are all superior to Thai Gourmet.
