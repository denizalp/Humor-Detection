Nice out on the patio for brunch. Dog friendly as well.  Super cuteee!!! Great atmosphere, great staff \n\n\nThe peanut butter cookie was phenomenal! \nI loved my portobello sammich with the salad on the side. I should have asked for the dressing on the side. They put so much dressing on it that I couldn't taste the salad.   great presentation by the way,  of course I took a picture of it. Haha :)\n\nI am so coming back!!! Weeeee
