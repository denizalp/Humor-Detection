Arrived at 9:30 am on a Sunday morning .  We were surprised at the location but it works as a local non - chain restaurant.   Our wait was about 15 min and our drink orders were taken promptly.  Wit in 5 min our orders were taken and delivered in another 20 min.  The food was hot and tasty.  All three in our party were satisfied and stated they would come back.  A nice local restaurant.
