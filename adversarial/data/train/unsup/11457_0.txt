Looking for a place to eat, we stumbled across this joint.  What a great surprise!\n\nThe restaurant is located on the sublevel floor of the hotel, below the lobby.  It's kind of hidden and difficult to find if you're unfamiliar with the place....but worth looking for.  The stairwell is lit with candles...I wonder how long it takes to light all of those every day?  Ha!\n\nThey serve you this Bread that must come from Heaven because it's so awesome!  The only bad part is that the Butter comes out cold and hard....why do restaurants do that?!  It's such a pain to spread it on the Bread.....it was awesome nevertheless.http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/deseo-scottsdale?select=2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w#2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/deseo-scottsdale?select=nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQ#nhgW17m3ur1K6_t2ewSXRQ\n\nFor appetizers, we had the Kobe Beef Tenderloin Flatbread, $12.  It was very good and raw.....the server didn't tell us it was raw and neither did the menu (see pics below).  Good thing we didn't mind, but consider yourself warned.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/deseo-scottsdale?select=0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1w#0hM9bfms7OIUO2zP98tL1w\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/deseo-scottsdale?select=4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQ#4bqUF6UcLnJTWSHAIVRFpQ\n\nThe Better Half had the Lump Crab, $14 and I had the Annatto Pollo Asado (Jidori Chicken), $27.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/deseo-scottsdale?select=Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQ#Zp0dRqvTPsRo-B1FmjLXvQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/deseo-scottsdale?select=0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8Ew#0tOnd6OKDEW3P7U6Osq8Ew\n\nFor a side dish, we both split a Calabzitas Con Queso (Squash & Oaxaca Cheese), $6.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/deseo-scottsdale?select=0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA#0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA\n\nThe Jidori Chicken is full of flavor and comes with some Pasta, so it's very filling.  The Squash & Cheese was good, but I thought was a little runny.  Very different flavors for your palette here.\n\nThe service was outstanding and the room is very elegant and romantic.  We washed it down with a bottle of Cabernet of course....yum!\n\nI'm glad we found this place, can't wait to return.\n\nReturn Factor - 99%
