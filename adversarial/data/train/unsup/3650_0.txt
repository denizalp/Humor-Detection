Jennifer Lopez aka JLo is an energetic and mesmerizing performer!\n\nThe showtime was set for 9pm at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood on \"The Strip\" in Las Vegas. There was such a long line to get into the theater - mainly because of the security personnel checking everyone's bags.  They found my selfie stick, utensils, and snacks, so I checked my bag into the holding room and picked it up after the show.  The production started at 9:30pm.  There was no warm up act.\n\nThe stage was amazing. They made good use of the lighting with different colors, shapes, and special effects. At one time, it seemed like the stage was a subway and a train was coming towards us.  At another time, it looked like things were falling down onto the stage.  Clever!  The strobe lights, lasers, pyrotechnics, confetti,  and streamers were great additions to the set.\n\nThe backup dancers were excellent. They sure enhanced each song and made JLo stand out more!  Everyone's costumes were fancy and the props were all appropriate!\n\nThe only suggestion would be to make the seating more tiered. There were tall people in front of us and they blocked our view most of the time, especially when they stood up which was more than half of the time. \n\nOverall, it was a fantastic experience!  It was better than I expected and I'm really glad that I went!  We knew that there weren't going to be many shows left, so we got tickets for June.  \n\nNow, we hear that JLo's stay will be extended until September 29, 2018.  Haha!  Better to be safe than sorry, right?
