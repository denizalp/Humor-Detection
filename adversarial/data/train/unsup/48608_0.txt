The Farm is a whimsical little natural paradise with great fresh food coming from THE farm itself. I've actually only been to one of the restaurants nestled in the gardens, The Morning Glory Cafe--and am never disappointed. I love going there mid morning on the weekends when they have a couple vendors out front. I'll always take family there when they come visit PHX and we'll spend time walking around through the veggies growing next to the restaurant and then to the little shops selling plants, jellies, books, etc. My favorite would have to be the tree that wears a knitted \"sweater\". Very practical because, #1 trees need sweaters, and # 2 it gets damn chilly here in AZ. \nI happened upon an outdoor yoga class once as well while waiting for a table...all kinds of good ,clean, hippie, fun:) \nSo, all in all, The Farm has absolutely delectable, fresh, invigorating food that isn't all that pricey and even though you may have to wait a lil while for a table at peak brunch times, it usually turns into a lovely stroll through the gardens and fun shops (fairly painless in my point of view).
