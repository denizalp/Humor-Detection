I am so disappointed that this place isn't what I was told it was.   We are new to the area and were so looking forward to a good restaurant with views.  We made reservations for Saturday night and good thing, because it was packed.   No seating available outside or with a view, so the dining room it was.\n\nThis restaurant is not staffed correctly.  The servers must have too many tables, as we waited for over 10 minutes before she stopped by just to say she would be by shortly to take our drink order.   \"Shortly\" was another 10 minutes.  We placed our food order at the same time since we had a bad feeling we would wait forever.\n\nThe Moscow Mules were terrible.   They weren't made correctly, and I have never had one served in a glass, they are always in copper mugs.\n\nTwo of the four of us had the lobster bisque soup.  Although full of flavor, it was only barely warm, which was too bad.   The bread is nice and warm and good.   Two had the salmon with baked potato and two had the prime rib.   Again, there is a warming issue as the baked potatoes were barely warm.  The salmon was very hot and the sauce was great, but when I got home, my body decided it didn't like it at all.   Those that had the prime rib said it was decent.\n\nSad to say, but we won't return.   The place feels dirty and the food isn't that great.  Super disappointed as with the views, this could be a gold mine.
