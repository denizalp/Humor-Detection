Someone told me about this place. I tried it once--I had the chicken and chipotle mayo--and in matter of days I was there three to four times. I have tried the Club House which is great and the vegetarian as well as salad and the breakfast sandwich. A great shop, with quality food in a super clean environment. Give it a try once, and you be hooked without a doubt.
