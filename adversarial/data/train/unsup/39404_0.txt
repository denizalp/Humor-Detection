After no service at Sonoma, I wandered across the street to Sienna Mercato. I was immediately greeted and seated. My sever came quickly as did my food. I had never dined here and found the concept interesting. I had the spicy pork meatballs in a panini with arribita sauce. Excellent. I also tried the mac and cheese with government cheese. Very good as well. I would eat here again. I would like to try the upper floors as well.
