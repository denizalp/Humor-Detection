I LOVE THIS PLACE! The food is high quality and delicious on a consistent basis. I have frequently visited this place and tried almost every single item on the menu. I also brought many people to this restaurant and every single person who visited this place with me agreed: this is some DAMN GOOD Japanese food! \n\nThe menu is small and it is categorized into a few sections: the skewers, small plates, and regular entrees. I highly recommend the vegetable small plates and ALL the skewers! It's not cheap but with such high quality food, you should expect to pay a bit more. \n\nI highly recommend this place if you're in Chinatown area. In fact, I recommend this place even if you aren't in the Chinatown area!
