Summary: I really liked the flavor. \n\nWe walked in around 7pm on a Tuesday and all the tables were packed except 1. Shortly after we sat, the line out the door started. I noticed the men working the restaurant didn't really have assigned areas, thus seemed a bit disorganized.  BUT the flavor was amazing!!! I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and my husband ordered the pork and shrimp fried rice. \n\nThe dishes came out very separately so my husband  finished eating before my soup arrived. \n\nOther than the disorganizedness of the restaurant, I'd definitely come back for the Bun Bo Hue!
