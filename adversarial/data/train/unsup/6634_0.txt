What can I say that hasn't already been said? Fresh food, hot food is hot cold is cold. Delicous, worth the price. A few friends and I got together here to have a good dinner and do some gambling. Usually we stay away from the Strip but two people were from out of town, so we did the touristy thing. I'm glad we came, and will hopefully come back again one day.
