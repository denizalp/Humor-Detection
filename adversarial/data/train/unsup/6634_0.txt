The most comfortable place in Charlotte to grab a beer or cocktail.  If you were like me you may have driven past this place a hundred times and wondered hmm looks interesting, a little sketchy perhaps, wonder who hangs out in there.  Well the mystery is over I stopped by the Thirsty Beaver on a Sat. night and fell in love the instant I walked in cheap beer, country music, and nice folks.  If you want something chill go and check this place out you're bound to have some fun and meet a few unexpected people.
