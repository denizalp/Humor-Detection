If you're a plant lover - GET HERE NOW! This adorable little plant shop is located right in Downtown Phoenix and attached to Be coffee, food, and stuff {another amazing spot -why not kill two birds with one stone, eh?). They have so many varieties; from succulents, to cacti, to air plants, to fern, it is truly a plant lover's delight. Unfortunately I wasn't going straight home after I was in the store and didn't want the plants to overheat in my car while in appointments all day but I will DEFINITELY be back to make some purchases! I already have my eye on a few. They had adorable vases too! Their plants also make great gifts for that special someone that is so hard to buy for! See ya soon, Bosque!\n\nP.S. I totally can't forget to mention how amazing and knowledgable the sweet lady working was! She literally knew everything about every plant and you're sure to leave knowing exactly how to care for your new plant baby!
