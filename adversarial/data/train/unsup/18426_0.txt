I consider it a huge accomplishment that I left Sokolowski's and was not completely stuffed. It wasn't easy. But, reading other reviews and knowing the reputation, I was afraid of getting in over my head. So I planned to issue restraint. \n\nThe line was very long, but it wasn't too bad because it gave me a chance to figure out what I wanted. There was also stuff (memorabilia lining the walls; interesting conversations to eavesdrop on) to distract me. In this way, the waiting experience was not unlike that of a wait for a Disneyland ride: people keep standing on tiptoes, craning their necks and peeking at what's around the bend. \n\nI immediately grabbed some chocolate cake. Well, duh! Since all \"dinners\" come with two sides, a roll, and the salad bar, we de decided that we'd only get one full meal, and the other would just order a dozen pierogies. Ha! \"Just\" a dozen. Anyway, it worked out great. My husband got the chicken paprikash, with mashed potatoes and corn. We decided not to get the roll - why bother? We shared a salad with great picked beets and greens. Everything was delicious!! We pulled the plug when we had four pierogies and half of the chicken left (we finished the sides). We also took the cake home. \n\nWe were so proud of ourselves! We had a great meal and didn't feel like death afterwards. Oh, and the dining room is really cozy, with a pianist playing standards. We left with a great feeling. There's a sign in the place that says something like, \"Enter as strangers, leave as friends.\" i definitely like the sentiment.
