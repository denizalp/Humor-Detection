Damn. \n\nThere is a Bay Street premium on the food here but you better well believe that it's worth it. The seafood here is as fresh as it gets. \n\nHere is what we ordered: \n\n1) Yonge Platter: raw platter of oysters, clams, shrimp and tuna. This was a decent enough portion for $50, especially considering how delicious it all was. The tuna was marinated in some kind of Asian vinegary dressing, and my boyfriend remarked how it brought him straight back to the freshest fish he's had in Japan. \n\n2) Tuna \"nachos\": this was a dish of taro chips with chunks of raw ahi tuna on top. There was way more tuna than taro chips, which is definitely good value for money. I wished it was a little more \"nacho\" like but the flavours were amazing and it was eaten much too quickly. \n\n3) Okonomiyaki: we were a bit hesitant to order so traditionally-Japanese a dish at this kind of restaurant, but I trusted that they could pull it off. And did they ever deliver. It was a good-sized pancake, chock full of salmon, scallop and shrimp and bonito flakes on top. It was very authentic, and each bite gave a mouthful of seafood. By then, we were pretty full from all of the fresh seafood protein but it was SO good. Best dish of the night and easily top 3 dishes for both of us, ever. \n\nThe fresh bread + butter was also amazing. It was warm and had a buttery crust, as if it had been pan-baked. The butter was pre-salted, which is not done enough! We also had a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc to go with our meal. Total came out to roughly $230 with tax and tip. Pricy night out but god, it reminded us of how much we love seafood and how delicious it can be when fresh.
