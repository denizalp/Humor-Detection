i imagine that there must be a wine rack out in the city which is larger than the one near me, and so just for size, which should probably mean greater selection, theres one less star on this review.  laadeedaa who cares.\n\nwhat is to care about is the fact that here is a store that is filled with only canadian wine.  its important to celebrate just that.  this is part of our collective identity whether we identify with it or not.  i am not that schooled in prices of wine, but i imagine that because it doesnt have to travel too far, that it wont be that as expensive as others.  an example of a canadian port topped out at 15 bucks or so which is usually about half as much for a bottle of port youd get at the lcbo and ive never seen this brand in the lcbos either.  i will definitely pick that up and at that store as the women who worked there were very friendly and informative.  she was either completely bullshitting me (which it didnt seem like it at all...therein lies the rub!) or telling me that she was quite delighted herself after having tried it and couldnt wait to get home to crack it open for a little nightcap.\n\nwell heres a tip of the cap to the wine rack in thanks for showing off and educating us about the good stuff we carry at home.
