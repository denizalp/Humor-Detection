Last year, this company resurfaced our pool beautifully & even ahead of schedule. Now, if that's all you need to do, this is the company to do it. \n\nNow, if you want to arrange anything else, requiring the most basic of skills & Communication skills, such as requesting that they send over someone to look at our greenish water & quickly tell us what to do in order to to fix it, this is NOT the company for you. \n\nWe honestly don't understand why they list themselves as a contractor AND pool cleaner when they obviously have no desire to do anything with pools after they finish installing, resurfacing, etc. \n\nRegardless, it took weeks of the company promising their best guy would be coming over that day & him never showing up & Never even being considerate enough to even let us know he was blowing us off time after time. Finally, when he did grace us with his presence, the problem was resolved & we enjoyed our pool all summer long. \n\nNeedless to say, we tried having someone sent over to simply direct us on how to fix our green water again in time for memorial day holiday. Despite having all week wide open for his quick visit, we were told he was finishing a job on Friday & would be swinging by our home afterwards. She said that he had no idea when he would be coming to us. Despite finding that extremely unprofessional & inconsiderate, we sat around waiting for him to come & guess what, he never came, never called, nothing. So, we were unable to enjoy our pool over the holiday & have finally learned our lesson, we'll be working with a professional company from now, since this is not obviously one of those.
