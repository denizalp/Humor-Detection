We had artificial grass masters come out a few months ago for a quote. Upon meeting the owner and talking over the types of grass they have, my husband and I decided to go ahead with the install. \n\nThey came out a week later and had the job finished in about 4 hours. So far, we've been very pleased. It looks so nice, really quite real looking. Our neighbors came over to pet it to see if it was. We've had the turf for 3 months now and are loving low maintenance and saving water. Highly recommend these guys!
