GREAT customer service.  Maria at the counter really sets the bar. Very friendly and accommodating. \n\nMint lemonade- So refreshing, a must (5 stars)\n\nlentil soup- Delish, perfectly seasoned (5 stars)\n\nFalafel- BEST IN TOWN ( 5 stars ) \n\nkunaffe with cheese- a little too sweet for me at first, but the butter and cheese cut through it the more you chew. (4 stars)  \n\nKibbeh- My husband says Some of the best he's had (5 stars)\n\nI wasn't too impressed with the combo platter\/hummos but with everything else being so delicious, we'll definitely be back!
