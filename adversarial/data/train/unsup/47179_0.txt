Francesca bakery is right around the corner of Sheppard and McCowan, perfect for busing! The interior is clean with a friendly service. You can find more than just baked goods! If you're hungry, you can definitely find yourself a great Italian style meal. I would definitely recommend the rice ball and the tortellini which isn't too salty or bland! The bakery is divided into four main sections, deli, hot meals and a sitting area with a TV to sit, relax and enjoy a great meal. Walls are decorated with nice photos and washroom is located downstairs. I'm definitely coming back! :)
