I've been wanting to try bubble tea at The Alley ever since I heard about this chain and finally got around to it.  Overall, I really liked it.\n\nIt got a large The Alley Milk Tea Trio ($6).  It's milk tea with tapioca pearls, pineapple jelly and rainbow jelly.  I got it \"little sugar\" which I think means 25%-30% of the regular amount of sugar that they usually put in, and \"regular ice\" (self-explanatory).  I still actually found it a bit too sweet, but the next level down is \"no sugar\" and I'm scared that would be too unsweet, haha.  Nonetheless, I still really enjoyed my drink.  I think they make it with homogenized milk or they put cream in it because it was sooooo rich and creamy, maybe a tad too rich and creamy for my tastes, lol.  It had a good tea flavour to it, which I liked.  They were generous with the tapioca and jellies which I appreciated.  \n\nService was nice and efficient.  The place is spacious, but there's not too much seating.  There's this huge fake tree in there with some fake birds which I thought was cool.  There's like a bench that surrounds the tree, so you can sit there, but I just sat there to wait for my drink.  I don't think it's a nice place to actually sit and hang out because it's right by where you order and also the washrooms.    \n\nThis place is super popular.  All the seats were occupied when I went, and while I didn't have to wait too long, after I arrived there was a huge lineup forming.\n\nThe location is on Joseph, just off of Yonge St.  It's actually not too noticeable from the outside, you kind of have to be searching for it. \n\nI want to try the Royal No. 9 bubble tea next time :)
