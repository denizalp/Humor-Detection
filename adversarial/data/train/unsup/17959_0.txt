i have been practicing on and off at inner vision since jan 2008. i had to stop running due to knee pain and decided that yoga would be the way forward. i did a 6 month unlimited package and was not dissapointed. two of the owners Jeff and Michelle are some of the best teachers i have ever had. the other teachers there are great as well especially Josh who likes to get really philosophical and pulls it off without sounding pompous.\n\nmichelle's sunday afternoon yin\/relax class is like dessert at the end of a weekend. you will never be as relaxed and ready for the week as when you take this class.
