Quality Inn in Surprise gives you the unique chance to time travel back to the 80's. The d√©cor doesn't look like it changed at all. The rooms actually have the bathroom sink outside of the bathrooms! Once you get through the memories of childhood road trips and early 80's summer vacations, this Quality Inn really isn't bad after all.\n\nI'll start with the staff....top notch! Everyone from the front desk, to room service, to the people keeping the breakfast buffet fully stocked were awesome! We were always greeted with smiles, and everyone was so helpful!\n\nThe rooms were decent. My bed was comfortable, the A\/C was a little noisy..but I got used to it, and the rooms were kept clean. Nothing too much more that I could ask for. The location of the hotel was a little isolated though. We happened to be out there on business dealing with Rangers Spring Training Baseball. Like most suburbs, you'll need a car to get to where you're going...even though it is located close to a couple of eating spots in case you get hungry.\n\nSurprise is a rapidly growing town, and the newer hotels have probably surpassed this one in popularity...but I'm here to tell you that if most of the town is booked up, and you see this Quality Inn as one of your options, go for it!
