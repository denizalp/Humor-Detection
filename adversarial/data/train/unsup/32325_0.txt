Ordered twice and been once\n\nThe meat is pretty good, the tzaziki is extremely salty but nice. \n\nThe salad has massive chunks- like tomatoes cut in four- but is generous quality.\n\nAvoid spanikopita, feels like you could do better at costco.\n\nThe first time I ordered they took forever, the second time they forgot something and got it to me 20 minutes after everything, ice cold.\n\nIts not bad and I might go again buts its not the best.
