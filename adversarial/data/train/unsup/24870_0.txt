I agree with the first reviewer, what's not to love?! Postino has some of the yummiest food around and I'm excited to have an additional location nearby. :) Service is great - I had a wonderful experience with Tessa and the hostess that day even ran after me when I left my sunglasses behind on the table. Truly appreciate the good people and good food! Will be back often!
