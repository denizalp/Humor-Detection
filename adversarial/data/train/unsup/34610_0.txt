I love Brixx but after seeing a cockroach and nicely pulling the lady to the side, they make me wait 50 minutes for two small pizzas that were only supposed take \"10 minutes\". Gotta love cold pizza when it's been sitting there for 40 min and no one bothered to even question it. Thanks Brixx I enjoyed the visit, my pizza is cold and I still tipped you.
