When people ask me where to stay in Vegas, I always need to know details like how many people, what's the occasion, and what's your budget -- but the Venetian is almost always one of the top choices.  In order to make my review a little more helpful though, I'll add my \"Best of Drew\" winners at the end of this review.\n\nThe Venetian is massive and a good blend of everything you might want in Vegas.  There are plenty of restaurants, a nice mall, a large casino, and one of the best locations in Vegas.\n\nIf you are looking for a home base for a crazy party, then the Venetian is a great choice.  The rooms are large enough to accommodate a large number of people (if you want to cram), and the location is within walking distance of the hottest clubs in town: PURE, JET, Tryst, Tao (at the Venetian).\n\nIf you want a nice, quiet weekend, then the Venetian is also a good choice.  There are plenty of restaurant choices, the best spa in town, lots stores to visit, and even museums.\n\nThe Venetian is really the best overall resort in Vegas, and with the new Palazzo Resort being built next door, it will have even more to offer.\n\nPROS:\n- One of the most interesting and useful malls in Vegas.  While others might have higher-end brands, this is one where you can actually shop for that last-minute outfit.  I'd say that the Forum Shops at Caesar is the only other casino\/mall that is better.\n- One of the largest (soon to be the largest) resorts - you have everything you could want in a resort.\n- The Canyon Ranch Spa is still the best spa in Vegas.  Not as exclusive as other resort spas, but much more professional.\n- All rooms are \"suites\" which really means that they are mostly large studios with a \"living room\".  But for a group on a budget, it's the best room in town where you can reasonably fit 6 people into a single room (2 queen beds and a pullout couch).\n- Great location in the heart of the Strip.  Across the street from the Mirage, connected to Treasure Island by a pedestrian bridge, walking distance to Caesars and the Wynn.  There is also a convenient rear entrance from Koval, which makes it especially easy to get to the airport.\n\nCONS:\n- Can be a little pricey for a couple - better suited for a group.\n- Not the most exciting resort for the younger crowd - geared more for families and older visitors.\n- Some of the rooms haven't kept pace with the newer resorts with the furnishings (e.g. flat-screen TVs).\n\nBEST OF DREW - Vegas-Style!\n- Best place to stay if price is no object: Four Seasons\n- Best place to stay for a bachelor party: Palms\n- Best place to stay for a bachelorette party: Venetian\n- Best pool area: Mandalay Bay\n- Best place for a couples getaway: THEhotel at Mandalay Bay
