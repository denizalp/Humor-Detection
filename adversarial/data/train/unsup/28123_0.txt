White Dove Thrift is one of those places that you finally visit and wonder, \"why have I never been here before?\" Compared to other thrift stores around the east valley, WDTS is priced fairly well (most womens shirts cost about $3-5, shoes & handbags starting around $7) and the quality is arguably better than most places around town. My only qualm is they have a limited selection of Plus Size clothes--found difficulty locating anything beyond a regular XL. The store is clean and well-organized, and they had a large selection of vintage bakeware and kitchen accessories.
