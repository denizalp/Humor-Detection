Yum.\n\nHave been here a few times, and have never left disappointed. It's an easy choice on my \"vegan\" days when I still want something that feels sort of bad for you and diner-y (versus Green Owl, which is fantastic but sometimes feels TOO healthy). All the sandwhiches I've tried have been great, and the pie is SOOO good - especially any one with peanut butter in it. Service can be a little slow and invisible, at times, but the food makes it totally worth it. Looking forward to hitting it up again in the fall.
