Terrible service. Seriously, this is the worst Buffalo Wild Wings I've been to. Our server was very over the top and it often came off as rude. She was very sassy and often would ignore us for her passing co worker. It wasn't busy when we were there but our service was so slow.\n\nI should have known better than coming to this location. I wrote a review before regarding the service, but I can't seem to find it. \n\nWhen we came here last month to pick up a To-go order, it took about 5 minutes before the servers and host finished their conversation to pay attention to us. I figured it was an off night, so we decided to give this location another chance. After both of the experiences here, we definitely will not be back to this location.
