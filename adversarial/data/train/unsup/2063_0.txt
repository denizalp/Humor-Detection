I can understand why the low ratings. but i needed a car and running out of time and they were here. \n\nJunie is the name of the person that assisted me.... \n\nFirst, he was RUDE. He didn't acknowledge me at all when i walked up. He was on the phone with a friend since about 5 minutes in, he told them i have a customer i need to go. REALLY?????\n\nThen when i told him that i had been calling and left 2 voice mails asking for a call back and he looked at me like \"ok and what did u want me to do about it?\" No apology... Nothing. So it looked like even tho Junie had time to call his friend, he didn't have time to call paying customers back?? Bad bad service (0\/5)\n\nThen i fill out the paperwork... And i was in a tad bit of a hurry and didn't think about it until my friends and i got to the rental car...omg... It was covered in scratches. My friends asked if i had gotten a paper to fill out which covered the scratches...i never got one. When my friend went back upstairs to ask... He just said \"all the cars have scratches\"? Really? All the cars have scratches and yet they are trying to sell their cars???\n\nStupid service.... Bad quality of cars.... Just overall a bad experience. I would expect better from a rental car placed in the palazzo.\n\nNext time i will definitely be calling enterprise. If you have time skip this rental place and go somewhere else... You'll be much happier and receive better service.
