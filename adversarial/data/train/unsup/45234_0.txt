I enjoy coming here. The prices are great, the parking is great, and the portions are awesome and the staff is friendly. But recently the last 2 times I've come I've had the same male waiter, and both times he did not write down our order and both times our order has come out wrong. It's not going to stop me from coming here but I'm sure I'll be asking for a different waiter from now on just to be sure my order is taken correctly.\n\nUpdate: So within 10 min of my original review, Jenni, the owner came out with the waiter and personally apologized for both times. Very sincere, very nice, very awesome. Jenni is awesome, but she did ask for ways to fix what went wrong and also informed us about the anniversary coming up which sounds exciting and most likely will be attending. Jenni thank you again!
