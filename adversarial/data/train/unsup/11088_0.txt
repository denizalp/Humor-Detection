We have attempted to try Babystacks a few times, but it is very small so the wait times are very long and there is little space to wait leaving you feeling awkward.  We decided to stick it out this time and were rewarded by spotting empty space at the counter in the back which is not part of the wait list.  Keep an eye out for this!\n\nWe ordered iced tea and found it to be pretty disgusting.  The service was extremely slow.  We waited about 10 minutes to place our food order.  When we did, I asked to swap out the tea for Diet.  When our food came over 20 minutes later, I had to ask again.  \n\nMy order was incorrect and I was told that the \"chefs were not in today\"??  OKAY.  Who's cooking the ratatouille?  Once I did get the correct order (carrot cake pancakes and an omlette), I was happy.  My food was yummy.  But the cramped space and poor service keep me from giving Babystacks a higher rating.
