Meh.....Grandma is still still yelling at me from The Grave \"Are you still hungry, eat bubbe eat\"\n\nCall me Crazy but $480.00 (tip not included) for 3 people having a Sampler dinner with only one glass of wine (just me) makes me feel foolish. \nPros:\n*The view is wonderful of the fountain show across the strip\n*The food is very good to say the least.\n*The decor and style is AWESOME\n*The Lemon Cream Spaghetti is to die for But why so friggin small-2 Tablespoons of Pasta  on my plate with a beautiful Shrimp. I want more dammit.\n*Lamb Chops and Salmon-Superb!! but... (see below)\n*The Dessert tray and Gelato is A+\n\nCons: \n*Service: Nice people but inattentive occasionally. Should have brought road flares to get some service.\nNote: One waiter tried to take my dish while I was obviously still eating. Maybe he has a date waiting outside.\nOn Occassion we waited a long time for attention or for the food to arrive.\n*Noise Level: Sucks. Why do restaurants need to blast loud music? I hate yelling at the table during normal conversation. Geez, Why not add a Costco Hearing to the menu selection.\n*Portions: are fu fu small so make sure you bring your high school microscope; sorry I am a hungry American who works hard and likes reasonable portions. \nIf I order lamb chops give me more than 3 oz. total meat in 4 minuscule chop slivers.\n\nHonest Conclusion: It's probably me. Even though I was a guest I can't understand leaving a restaurant still hungry and having my host pay more for the meal than my first 2 cars \n(A Chevy Corvair and a explode on rear impact Ford Pinto) No comments Please:-) \n\nGreat location and obvious excellent food but this is not a great value for a Hoi Poi guys like me. I just don't get fancy restaurants with low value and high prices.\n\nLike I said it's just me.........
