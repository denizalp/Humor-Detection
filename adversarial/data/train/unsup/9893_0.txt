Love springs preserve! It has a way of tying the community together with events for all ages. Lots of educational and fun events. my favorite event they host every year is dia de los muertos. they did a phenomenal job creating a beautiful outdoor recreation park that creates a relaxing vibe. I recommend coming here for an organized event versus just an everyday outing to just scope it out. otherwise I think the expectation bar is set too high
