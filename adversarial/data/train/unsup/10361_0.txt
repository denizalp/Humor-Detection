Pleasantly surprised by this gem of a dog park. a good crowd of dogs in the evening, many of the dog owners know each other and have a sense of camaraderie. Most importantly it isn't filthy and does NOT reek of urine unlike other places I have frequented, I am also a fan of bark park but this place wins due to location for me. \n\nPlease note:\n\n1. No big dog\/small dog sections. All size fits one. I am ok with this as my small guy plays with huskies and labs at daycare. \n\n2. Water fountain available\/poop bags available\n\n3. Ample parking\n\nThis is my new go to dog park due to it's location and the fact it is clean and has dogs consistently every evening.  \n\nBonus: basketball courts, tennis courts, baseball fields and school next to dog park.
