Finally made it to the Beef and Bottle after all these years! \nNot sure what took so long. My wife and I wanted to go old school this year for our anniversary and the place was superb. We tend to eat out at the newer trendy places but skipped that idea, and so glad we did. Loved the old traditional atmosphere and coziness. Loved sitting with portraits of Clark Gable and Tom Jones over our shoulders and Clint Eastwood across the room! Also, was really nice to hear Billy Holliday singing softly overhead. Our waiter Edwin was perfectly attentive without being overbearing, and even served us a pre-meal bottle of champagne since it was an anniversary reservation we called in.The wife's filet mignon medallions were cooked to perfection, and my filet mignon and salmon in bourbon sauce was supreme! Nice cold beer from the tap and the wife's merlot was outstanding. Get back to the classics, my young friends, and fellow yelpers! You won't regret it!
