I have been working with Chris for about a month now trying to get a property up to speed before selling it.  In that time he has replaced anti-siphon valves, a creeper and a pool pump in addition to getting the pool from green back to blue.  Throughout this ordeal Chris has been punctual and beyond helpful.  I can say without reservation that he is fantastic at what he does.  You can't go wrong if you go with New Living Pools.
