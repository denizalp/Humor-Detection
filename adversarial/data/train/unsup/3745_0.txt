The used-car salesmen of the Appliance World.  Promises, take your money, then no product.  I was sold an item, (\"In Stock\") that turned out to be in stock in their warehouse in CA, only it wasn't, and the daily lie of \"should be on the truck tomorrow\" was never supplemented with any type of further care, information,  or customer service.  Ended up taking 6 days.  In stock.  Also, all sales final and no return, refund.  They mention Attorney's Fees on the standard sales receipt, so I am guessing that comes up a lot.  Be careful, is my advice.  I won't go back.
