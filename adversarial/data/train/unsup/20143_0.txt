had to come out of retirement to talk about the meal i had today.\n\ni ordered the dry rub wings and pulled pork poutine. DONT judge me on eating two animals! hmmph!\n\nI've ordered so many times, and I gotta say, the Wings fluctuate; sometimes crispy sometimes jiggly but the fries never fail me!!! OMG THOSE FRIES. So crucial.\n\nIf everything weren't so expensive I'd order way more often! Oh, the ribs are surprisingly meh the one time I had em.  I LOVE the pulled pork poutine.
