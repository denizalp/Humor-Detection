Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nThat pretty much sums up my experience tonight at this Grimaldi's location on Rainbow Blvd. It's a shame too, since I am a big fan of their pies. I have been to several of their locations and used to especially enjoy the location on Eastern\/ 215.\n\nPros-\n\n- The reason they are getting the 2 stars is simple. The pizza is still scrumptious! We grabbed a large 16\" pie($16) with grilled chicken(an additional $5).\n- I still the dig the ambiance of the place, especially the wine bottle chandeliers! That coupled with all the vintage pics of New York really creates a fun and unique atmosphere.\n\nCons-\n\n- I tried not to hold this against them, but the entire time we were there, they were hosting a large and LOUD group. These people were yelling over one another and, to add to the fun, they had a gaggle of infants pitching ear piercing screams. As much as we tried to brush it off, it VERY much took away from the experience....to the point where I've never felt such a relief in leaving a restaurant! \n\nAs it relates to this, I was confused because this large group was placed right in the front of the restaurant, while a large room with about a dozen tables and sliding doors sat there unused. Would it not have made sense to place this group in this area where they could enjoy themselves and been a lot less disruptive?? This is something I CAN hold against them!\n- Our server wasn't terrible, but he seemed pretty annoyed....and it showed. We felt like he just kind of \"mailed it in\". He didn't even offer to refill our beverages and I had to wave him down to get my drink replenished. It could have been and should have been much better.\n- When we asked about pineapple for a topping, our waiter responded,\" No pineapple. No wi-fi. No ranch.\" Wow. lol Ok.\n\nBy the end of the meal, we could not WAIT to get the eff out of there. We both made the remark that we should have just stuck to Rosati's since it is much closer to home.\n\nIn summary, I still love Grimaldi's and I still love their pies, but I will drive the extra miles to go back to the Eastern restaurant and avoid ever coming back to this location.\n\nDisappointing. Underwhelming. A complete letdown.\n\n2 stars.
