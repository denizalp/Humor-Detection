They are crap.  Possibly racist against asians.\n\nSupposed to be open 24 hours.  Walked up to the door.  Some guy sees me.  Both doors dont open.  Doors are locked.\n\nSo i begin walking to my car.\n\nThen some old white dude walks up to the door.  Bam.  They rush to the door to let him in.  Wtf?!?!?!?\n\nBeen in n out of here at night because i began working around the area.  Never have they ever said hi or greeted me at the checkout.  Only once i was helped my a young kid at checkout.  That is all!\n\nSo besides the young college guy.  Everyone rlse there have crap customer service skills.
