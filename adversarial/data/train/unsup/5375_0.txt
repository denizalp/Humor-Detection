Came for opening night. In general, the bar has a really fun concept and friendly staff. We enjoyed ourselves despite the long wait for drinks and food, and our pizza order coming out incorrect. But it was opening night so we understood why it would be backed up.\n\nAm I the only one who thinks the food was way over priced? We order a 4 cheese pizza for $10 and received a small personal sized pizza that looked like something I make in my kitchen at home. Not trying to be a downer here, but it was maybe a $5 pizza. I'm glad we weren't hungry because the bill would have been way too high. For $10 I'm expecting a little better.\n\nHope to come back once the opening rush dies down. Like I said, cool concept and fun atmosphere. Really enjoyed playing the games while we waited.
