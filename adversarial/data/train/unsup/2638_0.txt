A lovely Starbucks indeed. The staff at this location really makes the place great. They are so nice and have the best awkward small talk conversations that I have ever had at a Starbucks. They almost always manage to successfully convince me to buy a cute adorable cookie as well. Nicely done! \n\nInside is mostly filled with chairs rather than tables and the few tables they do have are pretty small. Don't expect to be able to have a large monthly book club or writer's group meet up here for a discussion. Not really gonna happen unless it's cooler and you do it at the outside tables. \n\nThe bathrooms are clean except for the floors. The floors always seem to look like someone with dirty shoes walks all over them right after they were mopped. I'm not sure if that's just how they look or if that is what is really happening, but that is the only little bump at this store.
