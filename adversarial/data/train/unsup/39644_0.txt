I need to say right away that I am not a seafood guy. Unfortunately, I come from a seafood-obsessed family, so I often end up getting dragged off to restaurants that serve nothing but that--thus, one afternoon I came to eat at the Fish Market @ the Waterfront. \n\nFrom the outside, the Market doesn't seem like anything special, but the interior of the place was quite nice. We had reserved the private back room, and it was very spacious and tastefully decorated. \n\nAnti-fish as I am, I wasn't really expecting to be wowed at this place. But I was wrong. For an appetizer, we ordered a plate of hushpuppies....I would like to graphically describe to you our reaction to them, but this is a G rated site I think, so I won't. Anyway, they were delicious! and we ordered about 2394293 more plates of them after the initial one was devoured. \n\nLuckily, there was a solitary non-seafood item on the menu--filet mignon. I am not crazy about steaks either, but it's better than fish, so that's what I ordered. It was the best filet that I've ever had, and I've been to Morton's, Ruth Chris', Ditka's, etc. It was just absolutely bursting with flavor. Omg. \n\nLastly, we got some dessert...which I can't even remember, because the steak and the hushpuppies were so great. I think I got some sort of apple tart thing....but who can say. I bet it was good though.\n\nThe sole drawback to my experience was our server....apparently, we drew the lotto and struck out by getting an absolutely crazy server that day. I felt sorry for her, actually, because she seemed like she was just super stressed out and on the verge of a meltdown....but still. She took a loooooooong time to bring us our food, and I vividly recall her returning after we had already eaten, and asking us what appetizers we would like 0.0; clearly, she wasn't on planet earth that day.\n\nAnyways, the place was good and normally the service probably is too, so I highly recommend it.
