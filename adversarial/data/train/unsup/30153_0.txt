A few minutes after returning our car I realized I left my cell in the back seat. I started calling immediately - during regular business hours - but no one would pick up. I left multiple messages with the Lost and Found department but after four days there has been no response. I filed a lost item report online but that also has been ignored. Tweets @Avis have only resulted in multiple suggestions to email them WHICH HAVE ALSO BEEN IGNORED. Their total lack of acknowledgment is infuriating, especially given that my corporation spends millions with Avis annually. If I get my way we'll be cutting ties with Avis and doing business with a more professional car rental company.
