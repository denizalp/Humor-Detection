I first tried Mandy at their original restaurant in Windsor and would go out of my way to stop by for take out every time i was in town. I tried the new toronto location through skip the dishes ( FREE DELIVERY!btw), and it was just as amazing!! This is the second night in a row I've ordered take out and I am literally waiting for my food to be delivered as I review this place:P\nI always get the schwarma plate half chicken half beef and a falafel pita for later. They have the juiciest, most flavorful meat with a spiced yellow rice that is to die for, it comes with salad and garlic sauce for about 9-12$(i can barely finish the small). \n\nI'm so happy they opened up here!! Give them a shot and you can thank me later!!!
