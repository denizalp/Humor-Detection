When we started looking for an apartment we needed something months in advance with a narrow move in range. Pam, the office manager, was the only person we found in Phoenix who would accommodate this request. She was always available to answer all of our many questions. She made this long distance move a breeze, and I am grateful, because I could't handle any more stress than a cross country move demands (NY-AZ). After moving in Pam and the office staff continued to be friendly and helpful. When our garbage disposal gave an issue, she sent Carl, the go to fix-it guy over promptly. Carl got to work on the problem and tackled it right away. He even said he's ordering a new unit for good measure. \n\nI am so utterly happy with this apartment. It is so spacious with more than ample closest space. All my stuff seemed to fall right into place like it was predestined to be there. I cook allot and consider myself a foodie. Yet, the amount of pantries and cabinets allowed room for my varied gadgets, and ingredients. The layout of the kitchen and the amount of counter-space makes cooking very efficient and fun! :)
