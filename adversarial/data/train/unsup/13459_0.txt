Hate it!  Taxis stop in every lane to drop off, tying up traffic unnecessarily.  No other airport I've been to allows this to happen. Then as I try to go around this a-hole taxi driver, some jackass in a green vest tells me to stop for no reason, no cars in the other lane, no pedestrians, then yells at me and says I can't stop here, are you kidding me you f-in jerkoff!!!  I wasn't the one who gave you your crappy job or told you to wear that stupid vest!  Don't take your frustrations out on me!  I guess some people just need to make themselves feel important...
