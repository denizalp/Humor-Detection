Just ate at Portofino's at the Mirage. One of the best dinners EVER. Chuck was great as our server, very knowledgable and personable. Chris Zadie, the General Manager, was absolutely WONDERFUL. His advise was spot on. The fact that they had Cakebread wine was a bonus. This will be a sure stop every visit.  Get the crab cake!!!
