STEPH JUDGEMENT: Creative, delicious vegetarian\/vegan food and cocktails with great service and ambiance.\n\nFor our last night in Calgary we wanted a pretty nice dinner. Yelp gave us several suggestions but this place went right to the top of the list because it was vegetarian\/vegan and had such good reviews. We made reservations, which was a good thing because the place isn't very large and was packed. It had that retro-mod but slightly rustic look with lots of wood and plants, which was stylish yet still friendly and cozy. They also had a live DJ spinning some loungey electronic music, which was a nice touch. We got seated at one of the tall communal tables by the windows, which turned out to be a good place to see what's going on in the resto as well as the outside. \n\nWe started out with a couple of cocktails, which turned out to be really well-made and delicious. Then we chose a variety of items from the menu to share--everything was really great, with just a minor quibble with a sushi roll's rice being a little too al dente. It was really exciting for the bf to know that he could order anything on the menu. For the record, everything is vegetarian, but not necessarily vegan, but they can make a lot of the items vegan so there is that. The meal and service were wonderful. I think this place is a must-visit in Calgary for any vegetarian or vegan (or even an omnivore who just likes tasty food).
