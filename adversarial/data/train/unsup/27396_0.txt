Went to Centurion as a result of Groupon - the title said European fare, so I couldn't pass it up.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went there on a Tuesday night, which seemed to be a low night - better for us! The part owner\/executive chef Eric was very attentive and he spent quite some time talking about the restaurant, the food, the type of customers he targets. You could sense his passion!\n\nWe shared a brick oven margarita pizza and the pork loin entree, along with a glass of red wine and their signature dessert - a pastry filled with berries and mascarpone cheese, served with hot chilly chocolate soup!!!\n\nI was impressed with the food, the ambiance and the service - I look forward to going back again for one of their prix-fix menu events and for brunch! I already know how we're celebrating Valentine's Day :-)\n\nI thought the place was a bit small, but cozy and a little romantic. They had table cloths - growing up in Europe, I often think those are usually a sign of a respectable, gourmet food restaurant, and in the case of Centurion, I was right!\n\nMoreover - they had a print of \"Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach\" on display, painting by Salvador Dali, one of my favorite surrealist artists; you don't see that often!
