I attended a fundraiser for relay for life where a portion of an entr√©e purchase was donated to the cause.....great concept and idea and shout out to Brixx for being a part of an awesome event.  This was my first time at this location and I haven't had their pizza in years.   Parking is available in 7th street station and they will validate.  I would say that the service here was lacking, which shouldn't happen at such an event or any other time.  I waited quite a bit for a server to come over and take my order, we received no silverware or napkins, just basic things that were a bad look.  I ended up ordering a kid's pizza for my son and I ordered the Rustica pizza(prosciutto, mushrooms, artichoke, olives, and roasted garlic) which was excellent and I would order that again if I decide to go back.  As a plus, there is a free app with check in and the purchase of 2 entrees, plus cash back on your purchase.
