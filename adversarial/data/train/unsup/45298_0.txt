I was looking for a new salon to call home - I found it with Katie. The staff is beyond kind, clean facilities and great ambiance. \nI hardly trust anyone to touch my hair because I fear they'll do what they like vs. what I ask for. This was not the case with Katie. She listened to exactly what I wanted, she is very passionate about what she does and a great conversationalist. \nAlso, one of the best priced places I have ever been to!
