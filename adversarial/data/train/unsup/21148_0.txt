A big banquet at this restaurant was a good opportunity to be able to try several dishes at once, and I immediately accepted an invitation for the occasion. It is definitely a good venue for a large gathering and the restaurant was appropriately festively decorated for the occasion. The dishes themselves seemed to be hit or miss. The crab claw appetizers were crunchy and delicious. For such an exceptional-sounding dish, the chicken and ginseng soup was unexceptional. The roast chicken was flavorful, as were the black mushroom\/bokchoy, mixed seafood, and lobster dishes. The deep fried fish with sweet-sour sauce was overcooked and dry, and the pork chop dish was unremarkable. A refreshing coconut gelatin desert capped the meal. Service was good and the servers were very efficient at bringing the various dishes and clearing out the plates from the lazy susan to make way for the next dishes.
