I came here after eating nearby for lunch and was hit with a smell of fresh bread. \n\nMy coworker and I got some the egg custard pastries. The crust was flaky and yummy and the custard was good too.\n\nThey had a very large selection of fresh bread and I mean LARGE. And different types of loaves as well. This is a good bakery to get bread and things like that, but not the best for a wide variety of actual desserts
