Wahoo!  They have a location in Vegas!!  I used to be a regular in various locations around SoCal... so when a friend mentioned this place recently opening up... I had to pay this place a visit.  Unfortunately it's location is a bit obscure... you wouldn't really run into it randomly unless you live in the area.  Google it and try it out.\n\nI like the fish tacos and the maui bowl... but mix it up and find your favorites, there's plenty to choose from.  If you can't decide, let the bartender or server order for you :)  \n\nThey've got video poker machines at the bar as well as Thirsty Thursdays! (1\/2 off draft beers...Sam Adams please.  Always a good choice...)
