So I've had enough fake and bad banh mi sandwiches here in Arizona that Lee's is a beacon of banh mi heaven if I have a craving for a Vietnamese style sandwich. I love the additional sweets and treats they offer now, including various packaged dried squid jerky (Yep, I used to snack on these all the time as a kid!), jelly rolls, mochi, and macarons ($1.25 each). The bubble tea is decent here, and the taro with boba I had today was light and refreshing. One of these days I'll try their manjoo- it looks pretty tasty! Upgrade one star!\n\nP.S. Cash only but they do have an ATM in the store.
