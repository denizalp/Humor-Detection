On a recent Saturday afternoon, my 18 old Lexus, with 69,000 miles on it, was jerking, the \"check engine\" light was on, and the 'trak off' light was also on.  Lexus couldn't look at it until Monday afternoon.  In speaking with someone at an Advanced Auto, they recommended I take to Mike at PSK Performance.  On Sunday, I left a message on the PSK answering machine that I was in a real bind and needed my car for several extremely important medical appointments on Tuesday and Wednesday.  At 9:00 am Monday, Michael (owner of PSK) returned my call.  By 11:30 am, the faulty ignition coil was replaced, and I was back on the road.   AMAZING!  The service was fast, efficient, and reasonable, and Mike was as nice as they come.  \n\nMIKE, IT WAS A PLEASURE!   THANK YOU.  SEE YOU AGAIN.\n\nRose Stack
