This place smells like absolute heaven when you walk in, and the lady running the counter and kitchen is as sweet as can be! Unfortunately, the taste did not quite live up to my expectations.\n\nOrdered a Greek salad, add gyro meat, and a traditional lamb gyro, both to go. The salad was overdressed and I had to add a ton of spinach at home to get the proportions right- it was drenched, even with some dressing leaking out the side of the takeout box. Accompanying pita was seasoned with herbs, crisp as a cracker, and almost painfully salty to eat. \nTook a bite of my guy's gyro and didn't care for the tzatziki sauce used- can't put my finger on it, but it was too much like straight sour cream and too light on the flavor for my liking. BF said it was fine, but he wasn't blown away by it. Gyro meat was a little lower in quality than I expected and seemed less than fresh.\n\nThis place is out of the way for me, so I likely won't be returning, but their pricing is good and they'll do when a craving strikes.
