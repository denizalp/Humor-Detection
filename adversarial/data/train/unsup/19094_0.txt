Never go here! It was bland & flavorless. Not only was the entree bad the salad was even worse! A couple pieces of sad lettuce & a slice of tomato. I've never in my life returned an entree cause I did not like it, but in this case I ordered Linguine and clams in a white sauce. It was bad, so bad. It had no flavor, the sauce was just pasta water and the clams totally came out of a can. My husband's lasagna might has well been tomato soup with some noodles. Don't waste your time and money. That's an hour of my life I wish I could get back.
