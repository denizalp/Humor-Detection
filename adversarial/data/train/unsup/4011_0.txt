4 stars for overall dining experience and food \n5 stars if comparing to just  buffet style food\n\nFresh food, lots of selections from typical Chinese food staples to Hibachi to Sushi to even PHO...awesome \n\nStaff are very friendly \n\nNote: price is well worth it....$11.99 for dinner...but with the cheap price ...you will have to deal with some Ignorant , crass,  rude  people (fellow customers)...complaining loudly that the ice cream was \"too cold for my gums\"??? !?\n\nPlenty of room...no wait on a busy Sunday
