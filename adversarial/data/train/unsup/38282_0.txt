I called in my order for a medium sausage and mushroom pizza with a Greek salad. I was told it would take about 15 minutes. When I arrived in 10 minutes, the salad was ready and the pizza was emerging from the oven. I returned to my hotel and enjoyed a great in-room dinner with my hubby. We'll choose Palermo's when were in Las Vegas again.
