Our cool Veterinarian Dr Maya Bellapianta is taking care our doggie Matti. On top of her great skills, she even comes to the house with her cool mobile clinic, so that she is close to us the whole time and sends us texts and pictures of her progress. She is the best Doc ever had, and I highly recommended her to take care your fur babies!
