Apparently my last review was removed because some one was all Liberal Butthurt over me expressing my views on the food. Well once again I will tell you the Volcano Roll is top notch. The sashimi is fresh and favorable and the service is top notch. Yes I compared it to the horrible service I received at PAN. The food at PAN is just OK. The server at PAN was intrusive and rude and I bet she complained about my last Jimmy Wan's review. Too bad. The only thing I've tried at Jimmy Wan's that I didn't care for was the wonton soup. To me it had zero flavor.
