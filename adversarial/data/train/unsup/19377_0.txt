So here we go again trying to add another worthy review after over 1000 plus. The biggest thing I would add is LOVE personality in any business more so restaurants. Kung Fu Tea has it own personality comes to the ever growing boba tea\/more names that people call it in this day and age. I enjoy boba drinks. I am far from addict might get boba on rare occasion. On this night it was the perfect spot to chill with Ohana visiting while waiting to get seated at Hwaro couple doors down. The menu is pretty diverse comes to options. First time was torn in lot of ways but kind of went with comfort high oolong tea with boba and the sweetness level keep mild or not over the top sweet. It was really good!!! The boba was on point! \n\nThe personality talking about, It small boba spot not the smallest one been in Vegas. Once you walk inside looking at the walls with all the different artwork. All of them one of kind artwork from different artists and all of them can purchase if you like them. Each one had bold colors and each one truly different style. It stands out and pretty much impossible not to check out while waiting on your order or just chilling there over book or conversations. The menu is pretty straight forward nothing confusing and lot of pictures help you with choices. \n\nThe staff is super friendly, high energy, and awesome.  \n\nThe only downside but mention that for any restaurant in that tiny shopping mall. Is when the place gets packed parking flat out sucks. You might end up parking on the street but no matter the hassle it worth your troubles. Kung Fu Tea is one of many spots in that shopping mall that by the time leave forgot about the parking.
