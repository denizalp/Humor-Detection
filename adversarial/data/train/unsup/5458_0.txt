I ate here last week with my adult son- we both love Indian cuisine. While it was perfectly fine, I do not agree that it's the best Indian food in town. The samosa chat was delicious, but both our meals and the naan were exceptionally greasy. As in leave a pool of grease in the bottom of the basket greasy. Service was less attentive than hoped, although water was refilled regularly. At this price point, I didn't expect to have to box up my own food- maybe that's why they give you the great-smelling towels??
