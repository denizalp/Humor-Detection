There's a lot of whining here about what is a perfectly serviceable clinic. Oh the decor isn't what you want? It's a CLINIC. The computer monitor is hard to use? It's a push-button monitor like the one that exists in every Appletree everywhere. Oh there are too many posters on the wall? Again: it's a clinic, not a day spa. What are you here for? Are you here for quality shelving? You're probably in the wrong place. And you may want to reexamine your priorities.\n\nCityplace residents judge this place based on their own ridiculous desires, which includes the staff - who are perfectly fine at their jobs. Yeah the nurse isn't super chatty, but he's your nurse, not your barber! He does a perfectly good job.\n\nAnd Dr. Vale is definitely no-nonsense. He's young, but cheerful and efficient. He asks pertinent questions and yeah he might cut you off if you start babbling but guess what - it's not his job to listen to your stories. It's his job to see you and treat you. And he certainly did that for me. I came in with a cyst in my wrist and he went \"sure, let's confirm that by drawing out some fluid\". This after a previous doctor made me wait six months for a four in the morning MRI. \n\nAnd to the commenter who complained that the Dr. referred you to an ER - if you have immediate pain, that's EXACTLY WHERE YOU SHOULD BE. The clinic is for checkups and general family health, they can't deal with immediate surgeries or give significant care. If you are actually in pain, you don't go to your family doctor. \n\nIn short, these reviews say more about the expectations of the kind of people who live around here than it does about the staff and the doctor.
