I've been eating at salt cellar for the past 15 plus years. Shrimp San Remo is my favorite dish. I was sad when they took it off the happy hour menu. Now they've switched bread. They use to have amazing bread. But now they have these dense tasteless rolls. It was a great night when I could go for happy hour and enjoy a beer and dip my bread in my San Remo and savor the goodness. Oh and they use to have the best bartenders. They would greet you with a smile and looked genuinely happy. I realize the service industry is stressful and hard on the feet. I believe my breaking point was reached when I went there on a slow Monday night and the bartender looked perturbed by our presence. I found myself apologizing to him that I had to order another drink and more appetizers. I believe it's the end of an era. Gone are the days of great service and food fit for kings for the older restaurants. They're are several places in Scottsdale that have popped up and are giving the Salt Cellar a run for its money. It makes me sad to see the place go down hill. Many good memories fill the place.
