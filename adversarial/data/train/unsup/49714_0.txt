Subway is the healthy alternative when you're in a hurry. I eat here every now and then when I'm on the road. The owner amazingly remembers me, or at least pretends to remember me which makes me like the place even more. The only bummer is sometimes I want breakfast for lunch and they stop serving it after 11am even though the sign says they serve it all day. Nonetheless, the place is clean and the food is as healthy as fast food can be.
