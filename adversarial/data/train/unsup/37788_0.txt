I love the layout  but the course  was in horrible shape. Pace of play was slow . There were a lot of bald spots . The greens are tough and the sand traps are like mud. Price is great .some of the rough is long where it is difficult  to find your ball. Number 9 and 18  are shaved so that your drive can easily  end up in the water .
