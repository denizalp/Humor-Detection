Dr.Thomas Davis was personable and knowledgeable. I took my mother in for aches and breathing issues. She has some pre existing health problems and the doctor was sure to give her antibiotics that wouldn't cause further issues. He seemed genuinely invested in his patient. Additionally, the entire staff was enjoyable. It was obvious that they enjoy what they do.  I recommend making an appointment online before going in to avoid excessive wait times.
