Had to redo the dust cover on the box spring of my queen size mattress set. This was the only place out of three that I called that had that unique black fabric in the size that I needed. As others have suggested, they're really organized with a huge selection and the employees that I've dealt with all were knowledgable and helpful. I'll be continuing to patronize this local small business for my fabric\/upholstery needs, as few and far between as they may be, from now on.
