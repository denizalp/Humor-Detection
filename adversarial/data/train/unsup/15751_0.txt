No longer a media darling, the simple fact that nearly three years have passed since opening enough to account for such in a city where \"journalist's\" paltry budgets and PR-Firm recruitment of Instagrammers guarantee a constant focus on only what is trendy or new, it was as part of a group of eight that dinner was enjoyed at Other Mama on South Durango, Dan Krohmer's little-Restaurant-that-could once again proving excellent and punching well above its modestly-priced weight class.\n\nLast visited in November 2015, a difference of opinions subsequently souring opinions of Chef Krohmer before both parties apologized and moved on, it was just prior to seven o'clock on a Monday evening that guests began to fill the newly opened private dining room, Dan himself not in-house that night but that fact completely unrecognized thanks to the quality of his staff.\n\nOrdering a prix-fixe family-style tasting with Cocktails charged extra, the brighter lighting and softened soundtrack of the attractive PDR more conducive to conversation that the handcrafted main seating area or Sushi Bar less than twenty feet away, it was after greetings from Chefs and servers that the meal began with  Cocktails including the fiery yet herbal Geraldine, two trays of fresh Oysters plus a quartet of housemade Sauces a challenge to first timers but fresh and pristine as ever with the combination of plump Plymouths and Rosemary Mignonette particularly compelling alongside the Drink.\n\nFinishing the $12 Cocktail far too quickly but abstaining from another on a work night, others around praising both Wine and the Billie Joe, it was with trays of Ice collected that a duo of jars were next served along with housemade Waffle Fries and crispy Potato slices, the Tuna Tartare silky smooth with a hint of spice mellowed by Avocado while the marinated Octopus, Shrimp and Fish was tender, snappy and accessible even for those who'd never tasted the Cephalopod before.\n\nDining with an atypical crowd, the meal's business focus bringing together representatives from a variety of backgrounds and experience levels, it was next that two large trays of Sashimi were presented creating an interesting dynamic, those familiar quickly divvying up Uni and Giant Clam while the uninitiated took small bites with mixed emotions before returning to more frequently seen Fish such as Tuna, Salmon and particularly good Ocean Trout.\n\nMoving next to four Fried items, the Deviled Eggs impregnated with a crispy Oyster and Foie Gras infused Rockefeller both looked at with a leery eye before receiving high praise from those who'd first experienced raw Oysters just moments prior, suffice it to say that Other Mama's virtually oilless Hush Puppies remain a crowd pleaser while the blistered Shishito Peppers were seeded and sweated to make them mild and beautiful atop chopped Cauliflower and Pistachios.\n\nEasily one of Sin City's best dollar-for-dollar deals on any  given day, and all the moreso in the setting of group dining, it was with some already suggesting that they were full that four additional pairs of plates arrived, the butterflied Shrimp simple and pure amidst Potatoes and Garlic Butter while breaded Rings of Squid and Buttermilk-fried Lobster competed for the spotlight with a seasonal plate of colorful Carrots given added texture from Cous Cous plus sweet heat by way of Cashew Chili Sauce.\n\nNot about to leave guests anything less than sated and stunned, one diner at this point calling it a night, it was with seven remaining that grilled Sea Bass was joined by two servings of Krohmer's outstanding 'Steak Frites' plus housemade Kim Chi Fried Rice, though the most impressive entr√©e was unexpectedly the organic Jidori Chicken that looked south instead of towards Japan by way of a bold Pumpkin Seed Sauce that compared favorably to those seen in Mexico City this past March. \n\nUnable to leave without Dessert, a request for Other Mama's signature Miso Honey Ice Cream seeing two sizable balls presented with seven spoons and a story from the server about patrons trying to order the creamy concoction by the half gallon, it was with smiles on all faces that the night ended with a little more talk and broad acknowledgement of a very successful meal served at a Restaurant that continues to earn every ounce of praise it gets.
