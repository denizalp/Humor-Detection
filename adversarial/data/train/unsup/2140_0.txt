Fuk U!  Exactly!  Because that's my reaction after my first bite of this delectable greasy morsel of deliciousness.  The burger had a teriyaki sweetness to it.  I would classify it as a \"tweener\" burger not even a normal-size burger.  With that said, I'm getting half a bang for my buck but that's why you pay for hamburger meat that's grinded fresh everyday.  \n\nWith my last bite about to be devoured....the echo of me yelling NOOOOOOOO in slow motion because I unfortunately made the HUGE mistake of eating my Tamago Burger standing up as the runny egg yolk was dripping down on my new pairs of kicks!  Grrrrrr!!!  \n\nAnyhoo....creative menu with an occasional special and it just works.  So keep it going Mr. Colin Fuku and the crew.  Pick up your FukUBurger up in Chinatown next to BofA for now.  Otherwise if you don't than your Fuk'd!
