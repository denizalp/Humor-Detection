Wow! This place is fabulous. I was in Pittsburgh for a week and an old school friend recommended this spot. This was by far the best meal we experienced. Everything we had was so tasty, so many great flavors. Bland is definitely not in the vocabulary of this place. I had the Paella, my daughter had a Cuban sandwich, her friend had the Jerk pulled pork Quesadilla. Everything was so tasty. The pork was pretty spicy though, but so good we kept eating it. The Paella is highly recommended and could be shared for two. If I were to go to Pittsburgh again, this would be my first stop.
