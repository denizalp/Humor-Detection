For me, brunch is one of those meals that you will always be ravenously hungry for, which usually makes it all the more delicious. I mean, if you wanted to just wake up and fill your belly, that's why breakfast exists. By nature, brunch is something you stand in line for, something you anticipate throughout the week, something...poetic.\n\nI came to Aunties and Uncles with high hopes and great expectations given the numerous positive reviews. Being the sneaky dickens that I am, I came later in the afternoon on a weekday in an effort to avoid the notorious line. After being seated immediately and perusing the menu, I decided to order the Pan Bagnat -- described as a sandwich of arugula, cucumber, sundried tomatoes, red onion, olives and tomatoes on warm focaccia -- with a side of hash browns. \n\nDespite the fact that the restaurant wasn't very busy, the food took forever to come out. After the lengthy wait, I eagerly bit into my sandwich only to find that the bread was cold, hard and dry, and the contents seemed to be devoid of all flavour. Where was the tang from the olives and the mild spiciness of the arugula? Where was the mellow sweetness of the tomato and the bite from the red onion? I pondered these questions thoughtfully as I continued to basically stab myself in the mouth while consuming my lethal weapon of a sandwich. My face was literally wounded and sore from the fact that the bread was so dry, but my hunger urged me to continue. To top it all off, \"service\" consisted of a guy in a Canadian tuxedo shuffling around and throwing stuff down on the table.  \n\nI left Aunties and Uncles with emptiness in my belly and in my soul. I will continue to reserve my weekend mornings to stand in line elsewhere.
