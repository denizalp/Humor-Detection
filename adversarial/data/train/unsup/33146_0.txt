I can't believe there's a Viet restaurant this good in Charlotte. Love love love their lemongrass tofu, crispy noodles and yellow crepe pancake, they're just so flavorful and tasty. Also their avocado smoothies and orange juice are good too. Came to check out this place during my visit from LA and IMO the food here is wayyyyy better than many places in California. Attentive service, friendly staffs and good atmosphere. If anyone happens to be around the area I do recommend this place every time.
