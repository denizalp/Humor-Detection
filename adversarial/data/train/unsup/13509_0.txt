Served with a bit of a Southern cuisine touch plus lots of Southern hospitality, this very small cafe did a brisk business on this weekend morning! It was the bacon and cheddar omelet that caught my eye on the menu.\n\nA few minutes later, my omelet arrived. It was only okay. Lots of bacon and cheddar, but it was rather dry. It was served with fresh seasonal fruit, but it really needed a biscuit or some toast. Next time, I'll have something else.\n\n$3 for coffee. I did get my money's worth drinking about four cups. It was decent coffee and the gals did a good job at keeping my cup filled.\n\nOverall, it was good and I'm a fan. But when I return, I'll have something else.
