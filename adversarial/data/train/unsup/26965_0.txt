I stopped in here while visiting Arizona because I had time to kill. I had seen a rug online that had went on sale and sold out before I could get it. I figured it was worth checking since I was in the area. I asked Tracy if she knew if they had any left and she was able to see that the store had one left! I was so excited and we looked for it on the floor and couldn't find it. She double checked the back and was able to find it for me! I really appreciated her help. She went above and beyond by telling me how I can join their member program to get a discount code to use on top of the sale price as well.
