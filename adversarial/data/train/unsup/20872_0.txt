If you like checking into rooms that have the previous guests urine on he toilet seat and dirty towels over the floor - please give Monte Carlo a shot!\n\nWe checked in at 2am after a delayed flight, however I called to confirm that we would be showing up.\n\n1.  They gave away one of our rooms that was a double (we explicitly reserved a double)\n\n2.  They assigned us rooms that were filthy.  Urine on the toilet seats and used towels everywhere.\n\n3.  We complained.  They \"upgraded us\" to strip view rooms on a higher floor.  These rooms also had the previous guests urine on the toilet seat and one of them reeked of some kind of curry or body odor.\n\n4.  We complained again.  I insisted on speaking to the manager who then talked down to me because \"I was being too aggressive and threw my phone at him\" to show the pictures of the dirty bathroom.\n\nMind you it was about 4am by this time.  I didn't throw the phone but it did fall from the counter into his computer area because I wanted him to see the filth.\n\n5.  We moved again.  One room was a suite the other a double that faced floodlights on the outside.  \n\nThis place is a disgrace.  Avoid at all costs.  See my picture and judge for yourself.\n\n-- The generic cut-and-paste comments from customer service at the resort really don't make up for the vacation day that was ruined by zero sleep or the rude experience with the night manager. \n\nNote to MGM: Yelp lets you reply to negative comments to express your honest and heartfelt reply to issues that impact your customers, some of who only get to go on one or two trips each year.  Ruining one of them can be devastating.  Your reply doesn't provide any kind of indication that you understand this at all.  It is corporate and hollow.
