Just purchased a bed from Parnian Furniture and I couldn't be more excited or pleased by the quality and craftsmanship of it.  \nTheir attention to fine details and the service they provide is over the top.\nLeila Parnian did a GREAT JOB putting the whole order together with prompt delivery.\nIf you're looking for high quality, detail oriented furniture that will last you a lifetime or more, then purchase a Parnian piece of furniture or accessory. \n\nCheck out their second showroom at Biltmore Fashion Park next to Apple. A beautiful boutique to give you a taste of their actual showroom in Scottsdale.
