An excellent knock-off of the ___berto's taquerias. Or is it the other way around? In any case, this location is the best of the bunch, including any Filiberto's (though for the best Filiberto's-proper, go to the location at 19th Ave & Thunderbird).\n\nThe adobada and carne asada are particularly good here. And I once witnessed an altercation in the parking lot that concluded after one of the participants fired his pistol into the air.  The carne asada burrito was particular great that night.
