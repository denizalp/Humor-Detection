MOzen is an absolutely beautiful place that yields some pretty awesome brunch with a ton of eclectic options. The brunch here is unlike most spots on the Vegas strip as it has a menu that is essentially a mixed bag of Asian, Italian and American options. The service at this establishment is absolutely 5 stars as one would expect when embedded within the Mandarin Oriental. The food was delicious, the dessert options were plentiful and very well presented. Overall, if you want a different type of brunch, appreciate great quality and don't mind spending a bit of $, this is a great option. \n\nPros-\nLocation (within Mandarin Oriental)\nService \nMenu \nAmbiance \nFunctional layout \nDining options \nSeating \nChampagne selection \n\nCons-\nPricey \nLimited reservations
