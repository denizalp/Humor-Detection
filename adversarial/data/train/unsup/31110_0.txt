I honestly don't know how this place got 4.5 stars? Clearly people have never had good thai food. The egg roles were mediocre (can't mess those up) and the chicken skewers were dry as hell and the peanut sauce was literally peanut butter and I don't know what was wrong with this chicken pad Thai... But it was so saucy and had a tomato paste flavor and chicken was way overdone. Gross. We took 2 bites each of the pad thai and didn't even get asked how the food was.... Really? Clearly it was crap because we didn't eat it. Went here for my birthday last night instead of our usual place Nunthaporns in downtown mesa since it was closer. Essentially my birthday dinner was crap and went home hungry. I'm sorry, but if you don't care about the quality of your food then this is your place! The only reason they got 1 star is because I am required to rate them. *thumbs down*
