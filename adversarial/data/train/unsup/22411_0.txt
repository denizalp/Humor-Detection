Applied for my gun permit online. Received a text to report to the sheriff Ofc within 5 days for verifications. I'm a nervous wreck. What kind of verifications. I'm a citizen, no criminal background. Will they depart me back to WI for a parking ticket?! \nWalked in. You get scanned for weapons. This sheriff office provide gun permit, Conceal carry permit, fingerprints for your conceal carry and if you're sex offender, you also report here. It look chaotic but it's a well oiled machine in a chaotic way. Everybody sits and stand everywhere. You don't know what the hell is going on. Just check in and they'll tell you what to do. \nAfter I was call back up. I was required to show my ID and proof of citizenship. Done. Easy. Nervous for nothing!
