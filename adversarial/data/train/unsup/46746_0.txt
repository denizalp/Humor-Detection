I am in love with this place! It is small but has so much character. The menu is small but the items on it are done very well. The staff is very friendly and I noticed that they knew several customers by name. It is very comfortable with seating at the bar, table or on the patio. It is a great place to swing by after work for a quick drink and convo or dinner. I could see riding my beach cruiser here on the weekends with my dog in tow for an app and drink in the patio. This is a great place and much needed in this area. Well done!!!
