The SAQ Depot concept--a bulk warehouse full of booze--could probably only fly in free-drinking Quebec. For years, I had wanted to visit the SAQ Depot in Montreal, but, living downtown and not owning a car, I never got around to it. But when I drove to Montreal with a couple of buddies for New Year's, we made a point of going first thing. It did not disappoint.\n\nImagine the last scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark, only with crates full of bottles instead of mystical relics. There is a so-so selection of beers, as with most SAQs. The back wall has spigots of wine, so you can bring your own jugs and fill 'er up if you're a wino throwing a party. When we went, we got enough beer and liquor to last five hard-drinking guys four days for around $150; that's about as economical as you can get. Just don't tell that to your liver.
