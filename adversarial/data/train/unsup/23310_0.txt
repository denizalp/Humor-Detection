First, I want to apologize for not coming here first. We went to Shinbay and we were denied service as the entire restaurant was empty. We were told every seta and table was reserved. When my guests and I arrived at Roka Akor, your hostess made sure she got us seated promptly. We sat in front of the chefs and enjoyed the scenery of cooking right before our eyes. \n\nThe atmosphere, the service, and most importantly, the food, was all outstanding. The friends I was with enjoyed everything and raved even after we had left. Keep doing what you're doing, we will definitely be back. :)\n\nThanks.
