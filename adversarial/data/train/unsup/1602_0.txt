Dennis, my partner and I, call this \"The Pig Restaurant\" as they have so many little ceramic pigs that decorate the dining room. \n\nI love this tiny restaurant in the heart of the gay village!\nOpen 24 hrs, this French Quebec cafe has everything from soups, sandwiches, poutine, great coffee, braised beef and carrots, hamburger steak, homemade desserts, yummy breakfasts, and so much more. \n\nI love it that I can have all choices at any time. Prices are cheap, cheap, cheap!
