After I read about this restaurant on yelp we went there. We tried the Pho soup with chicks and beef. Both are very good, but the chicken one was better. The waiter was helpful and kind, we got our dishes fast, the prices are good. The only problem is the place is really tiny, lot of table in a small area, it wasn't so comfortable.
