This was such a fun experience!!  At first, we were all a little uncomfortable, because we didn't know what to expect going into a pitch black environment. But, on the other hand, that was the point! To try something new!  Our server, Anthony, made us feel at ease, and was very gracious and enjoyable! The food was all fabulous (I won't tell you what it was, in case yours is something similar).  Six courses of delicious food that we all enjoyed!!  And something we found interesting --- if you know what is in your food ahead of time, you often pass on it because you \"don't like a particular ingredient.\" Or, if you can see the food ahead of time, you pass judgment on it because the \"serving is too small\" or \"that's way too much. I won't be able to finish it!\"  We were afforded none of those prejudices. Consequently we ate what was served to us, and tried it without knowing the ingredients, and without being able to see the serving sizes. We enjoyed the entire meal, and later saw the menu and realized there were ingredients we would not ordinarily have chosen, but we actually liked when we just tried them!!  We eat at a lot of restaurants, but this is one of the most amazing experiences we've ever had!! My husband, my mother-in-law, and I all highly recommend this place!!
