I took my bridesmaid dress here on a recommendation from a friend who has used her many times. My friend told me \"you have to look past the mess because she does a good job and is affordable.\" Not only did she charge me $20 more than she has ever charged my friend for just a hem. I was promised my dress on 10\/10 and went to pick it up and she said, \"can you come back tomorrow or maybe the weekend?\" This was a Tuesday. She was surprised by the promise date on my receipt. I told her I would be back on Friday morning. I showed up and she went to get my dress and tried to give me someone else's dress. I told her this is not my dress my dress is a completely different color and style. \"Oh after you left the other day I did this dress because I thought it was yours.\" She asked me to come back later that day. The place is an absolute mess!! She makes up prices and also made me pay before the work was done. Otherwise, I would have gone elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend anyone use her although my dress looked fine.
