This was a drive-by donut-ing.  Really needed to use the restroom.  REALLY needed a donut. Out of nowhere, what should pop-up but a Dunkin Donuts.  I was so happy.  I pulled in front of the door and parked where I wasn't supposed to park (I REALLY had to pee) and ran inside.  The store was fairly clean and it didn't make me want to turn around.  \n\nOn my run out, I picked up a half-dozen donuts to shove in my mouth as I was driving around.  They weren't the freshest things around -- tasted like they had been sitting for a couple of hours -- but they didn't taste stale either.  They gave me that much needed energy boost.  I will stop by next time I am in the area.
