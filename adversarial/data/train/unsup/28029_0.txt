Great find in Scottsdale. There's a lot of upscale restaurants in the area and Cien Agaves is more reasonably priced and they serve good quality Mexican. I'm pretty picky about Mexican food and really enjoyed the whole experience here. We stopped in on Monday night when the house margarita was half off and tacos were 2.50. I got a margarita and two tacos for 9.00!  It's also located in old town Scottsdale which is a fun area to check out. If you are looking for a more casual, comfortable spot in Scottsdale, stop here.
