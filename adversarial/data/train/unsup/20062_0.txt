Located on the second level in Bally's, you'll see the entrance as soon as you reach the top of the escalator.  \n\nBefore entering, they have you in a line just outside of the venue.  The waiting area is small and really makes you feel squished in.  There is one waitress taking drink orders as you wait.   There is a small bar you pass before taking a seat.  \n\nThis is a small show venue. The ushers are very friendly and helpful.  You'll be pretty close to the stage no matter what seat you choose.  Speaking of seats, they aren't very comfortable.  Hopefully the show you're seeing keeps your mind off of it.  \n\nIt's a quaint and cozy theater.  Enjoy the show!
