Came here for HH on a Friday night with my sis and her family.  Everyone was happy and satisfied when we left.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door.   and found my family.  It is a small place, but the service and the food was good.\n\n1.  Chicken Teriyaki - Grilled chicken with sauce\n2.  Chicken Tatsuta - Deep fried chicken marinated in garlic and ginger\n\nThe HH menus are a great value!!!  Get here early,  because the tables fill up fast!!!
