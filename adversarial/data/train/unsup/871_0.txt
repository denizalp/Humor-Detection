I'm sharing a super secret with you. Bridwell's offers full service... an art that's been long lost since the popularity of chain gasoline shops started.  This is one of the last lone standing full service stations where they actually fill your tank for you, check your car's tires, oils and essentials -- all while getting you in and out. \n\nThere are times when I am going out of town and would like my car to get a quick check-up without it taking hours. I just need to make sure my car is drivable for the road trip. This is where BridWell comes in. I can't count how many times they've helped me out when my tires were low or I needed to check my oil. I feel safer after a visit and I am happy that the art of full service still exists somewhere in Scottsdale. \n\nWhen getting an oil change and tire rotation, I quickly learned that Bridwell is surprisingly competitive to other automotive places. For some reason I expected them to be pricier but they weren't. So now I know I can visit for my basic car needs and have a place to wait at a nice grocery store next door! \n\nSo my suggestion to any yelper in need of a full service experience when getting gas should think about visiting Bridwell's!
