What can I say that hasn't already been said about In-n-Out? \n\nBurgers are delish. Fries are hot and fresh. And shakes are thick and tasty. Their menu is pretty simple; it's just burgers, fries and drinks. And they also have the not-so-secret \"secret\" menu. My go to order is a 3x1 (3 patties, one cheese) animal style (patty cooked in mustard) with raw onions instead of grilled and no tomato. No matter where I go, I know quality will be the same. \n\nWhat stands out at this location is the customer service. They are always fast, friendly and efficient. During one of my visits, I was standing near the counter waiting for my to-go order and this angry customer stormed up to the counter. He claimed that his burger was raw and showed the female employee the half eaten burger. I saw the burger and I assure you it was not raw. The female employee was very friendly and patient with the irate customer and gave him a new burger even though he proceeded to eat the old one he was complaining about. Some people are just a**holes, but the female employee took it in stride and kept smiling. Props to her. Also, their drive thru goes by pretty quickly even with the long line of cars. \n\nI always pass this location on the way to my parents' house, so I will definitely be back.
