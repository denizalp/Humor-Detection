Initially I had a very good experience working with Kristin. Loved the makeup, and she was very knowledgable. \nAlthough my first experience with her was good I've tried to reorder makeup and can never get a hold of her. Doesn't answer the phone, voicemail box is full... One time she did pick up but then got another call, she said she would call me right back and then never did. Disappointed with the customer service I've received.
