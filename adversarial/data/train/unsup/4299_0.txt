The place is too crowded and cramped inside and the Happy Hour only runs until 6pm while Chandler's other three bars go until 7pm. They charge more ($4.75) at their own brewery for a draft than other bars who carry their beer. When your at the source you should be charging less - how bout $3 a pint? Too bad, nobody cars and there must not be anywhere else to go out to eat in Chandler. All menu items are about $11 or higher and the Nitrogen beer thing they are doing now does not work well. It doesn't taste like beer, it tastes like beer water. Nothing creative either in this brewery's selections, but a couple of the bartenders were nice and attractive. When your in St. Louis, you can get a Bud for $2 - take a lesson San tan.
