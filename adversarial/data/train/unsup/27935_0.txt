Well I must have to say that I do like this gym at the Surprise location and some of the staff there. Dolly, is the sweetest lady you meet when you walk in the door. She greets you with a smile and a warm welcome and will help you will anything you need. Kim, Stefani... Awesome instructors in turbo, functional fitness, and CSC. Kristi, and Jenny.... Are the best with cycle classes. They encourage you to do your best without criticism. :).  However, I do have a problem with Aaron, the personal trainer who tries to sell personal training sessions and if you don't sign up... He tells you that you will not succeed and will only last coming to the gym for a month. He's very negative. He is not customer service oriented unless you sign up and he's bringing in money. He turned me off. Let's just say... I've lost way over what I wanted too and I did it on my own.
