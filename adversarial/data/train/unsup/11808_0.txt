So, they accepted my return, but really no acknowledgment of wrongdoing.  Emma apologized for ME not being satisfied and said that it would darken when finished.  I responded that I was doubtful it would darken more than a light pink color and no one wants a pink countertop and she'd be more believable if I hadn't received the first countertops that had the nice shades of red.  I received a stale countertop that was closer to a white....  This place disgusts me. NEVER AGAIN.  There are plenty of better companies out there than this trash.
