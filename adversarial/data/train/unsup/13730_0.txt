I currently have a bonus dog in my care and I wanted to get her a bath and nail trim.  I can admit her records may be a little confusing as they are from another country, but I don't think that excuses the nasty tone of Juliana, the clerk that unfortunately I was next in line for.  She's definitely not a people person in my opinion.   I was finally put in a room so I could discuss the situation with a doctor because her and her condescending attitude was no help.  After about 20 minutes waiting I stepped out of the room because I didn't plan on spending my day there.  As I'm waiting in the lobby the doctor finally comes out and I go back in the room to talk to her.   This was my first experience with Dr. Bailey, and even if no resolution was met just her demeanor and tone was completely opposite than Juliana, you know, basically friendly.  Not only that but she told me they had two euthanasia's currently happening and only two doctors working.  Had I been told that I would have been more understanding of being stuck in a room.  As I left I ran into Robin, the office manager.  She's been there at least since I first became a client, 2010.  She's also always friendly and actually figured out the problem and corrected the record.\n\nUnfortunately, it's probably my last visit there.  It's not worth the drive anymore and my favorite doctor who I would recommend, Dr. Lewis has a very limited schedule.  And honestly if the check-in staff is nasty what's the point?
