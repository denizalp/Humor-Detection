Great Southern style comfort food. One of my favorite places to visit in Las Vegas. \nHave the Shrimp and Grits and the Fried Green Tomato appetizer. Really good bourbon drinks to compliment the food.\nSon had the ribs this time, and not really a fan of the cumin in the BBQ rub. First time I can say we had a dish that was not outstanding, but a matter for taste.\nI always recommend this spot to anyone visiting Las Vegas.\nLooking forward to trying the Miami location in May.
