well gabi you said it they are SLOW and i don't think the sandwiches are that great plus all the employs seam to have this attitude that your taking up there time like they have something else to do there product selection of Italian goodies seems pretty good but way over priced the one thing they have that i really like is there feta cheese which i use in my spanokopita the other day when i stopped in for feta i decided to get a sandwich... meatball,I said to the guy can i get an xtra meatball on the sandwich .......guy.....snotty....you can get whatever u want ,oh OK f u then i went to the front counter i told the guy there i would like a pound of feta he kinda shook his head in disgust i guess because there were 5 people behind me waiting to order food to go and i had the gull to order feta so he yelled behind the window CAN SOMEBODY GET ME A LB OF FETA FOR THIS GUY OUT HERE .......f u.......I will think twice before i give this establishment any money again
