Call ahead and make sure Vince - the owner - is there.  When he's not, the place totally falls apart.  It's like having a substitute teacher in a fourth grade class when Vince isn't there.  The servers don't care and get snooty and food comes out at various times.  I think this is a result of Vince being an active owner\/manager.  The problem is that he doesn't have a solid manager to back him up when he's gone.  Someone else needs to be able to crack the whip.  \n\nI'm a regular and will continue to be so, but my trips to Moto are few and far between when Vince isn't there driving his tatted-up sushi and saki slinging serving staff.
