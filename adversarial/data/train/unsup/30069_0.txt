Casa Rasta is slowing becoming one of my favorite places in the Pittsburgh area. Between the taco choices and entree options there's enough of a spread on the menu to accomodate a large group of customers with certain preferences. Being from the south, I had to partake in their version of Jambalaya and it sent me back to the stuff that we grow up down south on. Heat, but flavorful and had it's own Caribbean spin on it. \n\nThe Al Pastor Taco is one of the best tacos in the city.\n\nBYOB which is never a bad thing.\n\nEnjoy!
