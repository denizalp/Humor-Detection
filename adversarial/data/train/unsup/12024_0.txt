The pineapple teriyaki wings are great, the honey hot flavor is awesome, but the bar is not always clean as it could be. I hate traveling to the one in Ahwatukee because I'm ALWAYS the only minority there and I tend to get a bit scared all by minority lonesome. I've visited this location a few times and it's never as clean as the one in Ahwatukee. Serious SAD FACE!
