With my vast experience (this place plus the Mirage), I can definitively say this buffet is the best value on the Strip.  Weekend brunch is $26, $35 with unlimited boozies (mimosa or bloody mary).\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Wicked Spoon was that it had Class.  Placemats, nice silverware, glass carafes of water on the table...and that was just the beginning.  I became fairly obsessed over their dishware over the two hours I was there - the small square bowls for salads, the mini fryer baskets for the wings, the ying-yang condiment bowls, the espresso cups for the gelato, the metal creamer \"milk carton\", the mini lidded sautee pans for baked items...oh my god I could go on and on.\n\nBut onto the food...oh the food.  I did not expect such quality and variety from a $26 buffet - my favorite highlights:\n-salami and cheese selection\n-watercress and burrata salad\n-made to order omelets\n-gnocchi\n-a dozen (!!) flavors of gelato\n-dessert dessert dessert!
