Beautiful fountains keeping time to wonderful music for free? How would you not give this 5 stars? \n\nIt's a very entertaining show as the water blasts out of cannon like fountains and make for some especially beautiful showings at night. Very family friendly and with the water all around, a nice place to cool off on a hot Vegas night. \n\nIf you've never seen the show, it's a must see, and if you have, it could become a staple to your visits to Vegas.
