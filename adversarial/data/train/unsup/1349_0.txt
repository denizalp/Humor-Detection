Worse place in the world! My boyfriend weighed in outside the restaurant and was told he would get his meal for free. He met the weight requirement and they told us at the door to tell our server he would get a free burger. The server was not clear at all! She didn't explain the only burger you get is the single and that you had to weigh in before you eat it. They refused to give us a free burger even though we met the requirement. The server did not communicate well and we paid the bill and left very upset! Horrible place! Terrible food
