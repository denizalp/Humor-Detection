Amazing service, amazing food!\n\nWe were having a late night second dinner craving so we decided to hit up Sushi Samba that was conveniently at our hotel in the Palazzo.\n\nEnjoyed the dumplings, chicken teriyaki, and we tried almost every roll here. Each one was excellent.\n\nI don't eat pork, so the chef actually created a chicken based Ramen for our group which we all LOVED. It was so flavorful and comforting and really hit the spot. This was my favorite dish here. I'd come back for this!
