Oh boy, oh boy. If you feel like spending A LOT of money (60$ for two for \"Californian-Mexican\" food WITHOUT DRINKS is a lot in my book), endure really bad service and eat ok food, this place is exactly what you are looking for.\n\nI wasn't looking for that at all last time I went. The vibe is funky, with their bath filled with sand and toys as a table, their jungle plants and the toilet paper on your table instead of napkins. We see the effort here to be creative. \n\nWhere is gets bad is when you wait 20 minutes without water, on a Tuesday night, even though the restaurant is empty, for someone to take your order. It gets worst when you see the guy going out for a smoke, and give him The Look by sticking your head out of the window. You feels kinda better when he swallows his cig, and runs at you apologizing because he forgot about you. But then when they don't have fish anymore, and it takes another 30 minutes to get what you ordered, you are not feeling good at all. The 60$ bill was the finishing move.\n\nDon't be fooled by the jungle and the red lights. Worst case scenario, just get a Margarita, and get the f**k out.
