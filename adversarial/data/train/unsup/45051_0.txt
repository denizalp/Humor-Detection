I'm soooo glad it's getting nicer out. My daughter loves coming here to play. She makes new friends every time we come! We've been going at night during the summer but we'll be going during the day now that it's getting nicer out. There are two seperate  play areas one for kids 5 and older and the other for 2-5. My daughter is 3 and plays perfectly on both. The big slide is pretty high! There's a rock wall to climb up to it. There are 5 different dizzy machines lol, it's what my daughter calls them. I think the only down side is the swings! Every playground NEEDS swings!! This playground has two toddler swings so kids can only swing if they fit, so no swinging for momma :( \nThere are a bunch of picnic tables, my family and I celebrated Easter here this last year! \nThe playground is gated so kids can't run away, as easily!
