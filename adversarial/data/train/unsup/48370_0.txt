Came here for dinner with 3 others and it was a great place to people watch, eat amazing Mexican fare and delicious drinks. I enjoyed my time here muchly! :P\n\nSERVICE: Always with a smile. Personable and had great recommends. \nFOOD: DELICIOUS. Had the shrimp, veggie and fish tacos. Yum Yum. Not oily, or too salty. Just right. Margaritas were strong but you tasted all flavors, which is important to me. So yay!\n\nYou should go!
