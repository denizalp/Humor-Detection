Beso is a beautiful restaurant located inside of the City Center.  The restaurant looks great with giant chandeliers and a wall of large windows overlooking the Aria.  \n\nThe service was average and the wait time for food is long. My wife and I ordered the 8oz. Petit Steak with lobster tail added on.  The steak was cooked to order and was very tender and juicy.  The lobster tail was very small and overcooked.  Everyone else in our party said they enjoyed their food, but for what you spend there are many better options. \n\nBeso was great to try, but I do not expect a return.
