Forget flowers and chocolate, show her how much you care by ordering her a giant slice of coconut cream pie the size of her head.\n\nI wish my boyfriend read my Yelp reviews.\nDo you see this review?\nHint?  Pie? Me?\n\nAnyways, I bought myself pie and I'll buy it again.\nNow that I've already talked about dessert, I should start from the beginning.\n\nI had a hard time finding the entrance of this restaurant.  I saw a sign on Avenue Road but you have to access the restaurant from the small residential street.\nIt's bizarre that the restaurant is basically attached to an apartment building.\nThey have valet parking? Really? Because I parked on the street.\n\nThe decor is pleasant, simple, but conservative.  I also found the vibe a bit stuffy and older.  There were a few groups having business dinners here...or older people that like to wear suits and have dinner.  Surprisingly, not as many people on dates as expected -- except one older gent with a hired lady friend.\n\nThere is a great view of the city (request a seat by the window), but it's not the most romantic place I've been.  But give me more pie and martinis and I might change my mind.\n\nTo start I had the foie gras terraine ($28).  The chilled foie was served with toasty bread.  I'll be honest, I've had better.  I found the sourdough toast over-crunchy and the foie was stiff and slightly too cold and wasn't overly flavorful.  It was garnished nicely with sweet maple cider jelly and fig confit..\n\nI ordered the scallops and shortribs Bourguignonne ($41).  It was a creative entree deconstructed, the scallops were perfectly seared and juicy, the de-boned short ribs were fall apart soft.  The smoked bacon gnocci was good, but the sauce overpowered any bacon flavours.  \n\nI'm going to talk about dessert a second time.. just because it's THAT good.\nI ordered the coconut cream pie ($13) that everyone talks about.\nLayers and layers of light, fluffy cream, with a bit of coconut, crispy buttery bottom.\n\nEveryone at the table was full.\nMost people left some pie on the plate.\n...I sure didn't!  \nOne of the top 10 things I've put in my mouth.\n...And, you can actually buy full pies to take home.\n\nThe food was excellent.\nThe service was super excellent.\nOverall, I had a wonderful dinner here and I'll be back. =D
