Papa Chang Express is located in Pacific Mall on the second floor where all the food places are. Don't be intimated by the hustle and bustle of the area as it's meant to replicate the traditional Asian markets. We ordered a popcorn chicken bento and a braised pork with preserved veggie bento. Both of these boxes came with rice and a generous portion of meat as you can see from my photos below. The chicken was tender, boneless, flavourful and the batter was cooked to a nice crisp. The braised pork was soft, juicy and had the right amount of flavour! Especially the fatty parts. Our only complaint about the food was that the rice was a bit too hard. \n\nSeating can be problematic as the area can be very busy due to proximity to other eateries. We had to walk around the upper level to find seating to eat. We eventually walked back to Papa Changs where they have about four seats hidden on the side. Overall a good place to try authentic Taiwanese cuisine at a good price. Will definitely return to try the other dishes!
