I stumbled into Red Square after a filling meal at the House of Blues Foundation Room's restaurant upstairs.\n\nTaking a seat at their ice bar, the bartender asked me what I wanted to drink.  I had no idea where to even start with their HUGE selection of vodkas surrounding me.  He asked me what my favorite fruit was and so I thought of the first thing that came to mind...strawberry!  He started mixing a couple of vodkas together and poured his concoction into a martini glass.  He added a fresh raspberry and blueberry to my drink and I took a sip. Yum!  My bf had a classic martini himself.  \n\nWe perused over the menu and although I was tempted by the caviar, I had to say no.  I was still full from my huge meal upstairs. \n\nWe were then invited to the vault.  Putting on the crazy hats and the crazy coats, we proceeded into this ice chamber for a shot of vodka.  I went for the Mango flavored vodka.  It went down smooth... \n\nI should mention...I'm not usually such a lightweight.  But as I started drinking my martini, I could feel it...damn, I'm getting buzzed already!  Wtf! So, you can imagine I was feeling pretty damn good by the time we left, and that was only after one martini and one shot.  Sheesh. \n\nAnyhow, when you're there...ask for JD to take care of you.  He's the cute Asian bartender with the funky glasses and the tats all over his arms.  Ask him to make something special for you! \n\nOverall, for the brief time I was at Red Square, I had such an interesting night.  We met the most interesting of people and witnessed the most interesting of things.  I'll definitely go back for some caviar and a seat at their ice bar.\n\nUpdate! 03\/03\/08 - Has it been so long since I've experienced the vodka vault?  We're lucky to swing by during their \"Cavi Hour\", which runs everyday from 4 pm to 6 pm.  With the purchase of two Imperia Vodka Cocktails per person, you receive 1 oz of caviar to enjoy while you sip your drinks.  What a decadent treat!  \n\nI enjoyed a mixed concoction of vodka and a bunch of fruity stuff.  The BF and another friend had their vodka straight up.  The real winner was their Russian Mary!  My oh my and what yum!  This mix has been sitting around for a little while and has some serious hotness to it.  They mix it with their Bloody Mary mix and top it off with a couple of blue cheese stuffed olives!  So delicious!  (And yes, I was getting a nice little buzz from here!)\n\nTheir caviar comes with triangle toasts, blinis, creme fraiche, red onions, hard-boiled egg whites and egg yolks, and chives.  And yes, I'm one of those people who would rather eat such loveliness without all the condiments 'cuz caviar just tastes so good!\n\nI do have to make it a better point to come here more often, and especially to take advantage of their Cavi Hour!  What a fabulous idea!\n\nUpdate! 07\/20\/09 - Reverse Happy Hour is from 11 pm to close, Sunday through Wednesday.  Half price cocktails and bar menu items.  Discounted bottles in their subzero vodka vault.
