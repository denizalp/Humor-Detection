*** WARNING **** DO NOT SEE KAT *******  If you go to this salon have the Master Stylist cut your precious locks. \n\nAfter seeing a coworker arrive at work with her new STUNNING haircut I demanded the stylist's information. I loved the cut, it was so flattering and gave my coworker a boost of self confidence. \n\nBefore the haircut I had hair past my shoulders in long layers. I found a picture of a long layered bob that went two inches above my shoulders.\n\nI showed her the picture and with my fingers showed her 3 times the length I wanted my hair. She DID NOT call over the Master Stylist to conference with before she took her first cut. She had me move my chin to my chest, measured with her finger then...... chopped! Yes! She chopped my hair to at the base of where my head and neck meet. Once she made that fateful cut I went with it because how on Earth can you uncut 3 inches of hair. \n\nI thought \"ok, it will be a little shorter but I will still have the long layers like the picture\". Oh was I wrong. I ended up with an asymmetrical bob! That is the anti-haircut. I would NEVER EVER EVER ask for an asymmetrical bob EVER! That is not a flattering style for me. I was horrified but heck.... you get what you pay for. \n\nThe master stylist should have looked at the picture before she cut it. He did not even ask if I had a picture when he inspected the completed cut. \n\nEvery time I wash or style my hair I am crushed. \n\nI now have a short flared at the sides Lisa Rinna hair cut and have to find a stylist to fix my hair on a regular basis to get the look I wanted in the first place.
