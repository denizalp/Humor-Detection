This place has gotten dilapidated since it's opening.  My bathroom was moldy, a used condom was on my bed when I walked into the 2nd room they gave me.  I couldn't sleep well in the place and the staff was a little rude.  They lost my clothing at the bell desk, never found it and I left Vegas with a bad taste in my mouth.
