:-) Hi Brad\n\nThanks for \"reaching out.\" First and foremost, it was not my intention of \"body shaming\" anyone, I was simply describing her without using race....maybe if she had a nametag?\n\nWhat I find interesting, though is that you knew your employee was having a hard time, yet decided to stay and count the money. Where's the leadership in that? Secondly, you knew I was there, so why didn't you offer an apology at that time, come to see how I was doing, or simply check on your staff??? No wonder my experience was negative. GOOD day
