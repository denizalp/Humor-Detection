I try to not make a habit of eating large platters of fried food and calling it a meal, but....ever since eating a walleye and shrimp combo at The Fish Shack, that's pretty much all I wanna do.\n\nThe service at lunch was super friendly and fast, and trashy daytime court tv shows were playing. I wish I could have stayed all day!
