So, tryst got a makeover.  The beloved waterfall stays and there are crazy \"dancers\" who are mostly just posing being sultry lol\n\nDrinks are more expensive (mostly because the glasses are smaller) and as usual the place didn't get crowded until after 11.  \n\nWe were so relieved that the DJ changed at midnight.... Too bad that DJ wasn't very good either.  Older crowd... Old music!
