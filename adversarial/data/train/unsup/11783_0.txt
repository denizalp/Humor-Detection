Let's just start out with saying, I'm cheap. \nI generally refuse to go anywhere like: Starbucks, Jamba Juice, One-Stop, etc. Not because I hate Smoothies, Protein Shakes & Coffee, I actually LOVE all of those. I just know I can make them SO much cheaper at home. & I do!\n\nUntil I was introduced to Dutch Bros.\nTheir Iced Skinny Carmelizer (sp?) is ridiculously delicious. I don't think I could ever recreate it myself. So, I don't even try. The employees treat each customer like they've been waiting all day to meet you! Everyone is dancing, singing, smiling, & making me want to throw away my career to become a barista. Plus, their prices are fair. Fair enough that I never leave without adding to the tip jar.\n\n& now for a feel-good story about this place. The first time I came through the drive thru I was greeted by their regional manager. He made small talk as I counted out the money for my coffee. When I went to hand it to him I dropped a dollar on the ground. I opened the door to my truck to get it, forgetting that my salad for lunch was wedged between my leg & the door. Well, it fell. Embarrassed, I handed over the stray dollar & asked if I could have a bag to clean it up. He just laughed & asked the other employee to come around & help me. Well, the employee was so nice about the situation! She swept everything up as I apologized & told me if they sold food she'd give me some to replace what I dropped. The manager then handed my money back to me, along with my drink, and one of their punch cards completely filled out. He said that he hoped my day would go a little smoother, & that the free drinks should help. \nEver since then, I've been a customer to this location. Their generosity that day has kept me coming back for the legal-liquid crack that they sell. Plus, the vibes the give off make my day better!
