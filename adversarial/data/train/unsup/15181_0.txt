I was fully ensconced in my morning grogginess a couple of days back when some purple person on the corner of Guy & De Maisonneuve pushed a \"Buck for a Coffee\" card into my hand. I tucked the card into my wallet deciding to keep the treat for next Friday morning when it would be most appreciated after a week of kitten herding.\n\nFriday morning finally rolled around, as it has done for countless millennium. This particular one was cold, overcast, and had a touch of dampness that sent a shiver up my back. This morning was the perfect time to grab a cup of piping hot spendy joe to go!\n\nThe friendly counter staff welcomed me, and upon seeing that I had his promo card proceeded to explain that I could have any of the coffees on the menu for a dollar.\nYay, and all that, but I like my coffee black; unadulterated; a symphony of dark bitterness. Kind of like a Guinness, yet appropriate for breakfast.  So that's what I ordered and, once my request was passed on to the barrista, a printed slip of paper was pushed across the counter, accompanied by the words \"You'll have to register in order to get your coffee\"\n\nWhat?\n\nNo.\n\nSorry. \n\nI don't give out my name, email address, and phone number to save pennies off the cost of a cup of coffee.\n\nWhat could have been the discovery of a cozy caf√© instead turned into something much less pleasant; a sneaky, underhanded marketing ploy.\n\nSo now I have a bitter taste in my mouth from the experience; I guess that's almost as good as a morning coffee, right?
