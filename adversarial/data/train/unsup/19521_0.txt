I don't write a lot of reviews, but after seeing reviews like the one from \"Virginia S.\" I was like... wow... some of these peeps be cray.  I'd like to apologize to Morton's for them having to serve people like this person.  Here's what she had to say in her 5 star review about an unrelated bar: \"They bring in food trucks in case you get hungry.\"  (no joke.)  \nSo, hotdogs off the back of a truck, 5 stars.  One of the best steakhouses in the country, 1 star.  And not just 1 star... no.  1 star and a dissertation about the worst experience of her life.  I was surprised when i didn't read the part about how Morton's kicked her dog.   lol.  Oh my dear, sweet Virginia... I hope you'll consider, some day, to stop being so miserable.\n\nOhh ohh, ummm, sorry I got distracted there.  Morton's?  Excellent food and service, duh.
