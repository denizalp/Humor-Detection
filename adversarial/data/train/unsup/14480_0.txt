Apparently Bruce does good work for reasonable rates, but please do not attempt to patronize this business unless you are fond of being verbally abused and talked down to in the worst possible way. I had heard that he was rude, but I let it slide, thinking maybe people were too sensitive. I should have heeded the warnings, as I have never before wanted to punch a grown man in the face as I the one time I visited his shop. Plus, we didn't even get any help with the bike... Bruce just made insinuations about the shop where we had purchased the bike and wanted us to try to get information from the shop and then bring it back to him. It was all kinds of creepy and unhelpful.
