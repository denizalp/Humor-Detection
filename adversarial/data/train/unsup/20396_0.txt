I miss these apartments soooo bad :(  I lived here from March 2008 until August 2009, I had a 2BD\/2BA on the 2nd floor, and they are really beautiful newer apartments!! I like how there are only 4 units to each building, its more like fancy condos than apartments! The complex is more like a resort too, with a clubhouse and big screen TV, 3 swimming pools, a heated hot tub, gated community with garages (but I chose not to buy one), spacious and modern layouts, up to 3 bedrooms, fireplaces, new and modern design inside including washer and dryer!  I also really like the location in SouthWest Las Vegas, about 15 minutes away from the Strip but far enough away from all the madness lol :) I made the big move to Los Angeles summer 09' and it really made me appreciate Las Vegas living..A place like Coronado would run at least 4k a month in L.A, and I was only paying $1050.. If you are considering moving to Vegas, I definitely recommend you take a look at these :)
