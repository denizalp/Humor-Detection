I just need Starbucks staff to be clear on one thing, you are not skilled coffee makers!! Starbucks \"school\" is a false allure to get low achieving people to sell their souls to this horrible coffee establishment. Not only are starbucks produce some of the lowest quality on the market, but the staff do not actually make the espresso! Everything is automatic and pre-ground for quality matching Tim Hortons! It is factory coffee with no \"coffee artisan\" skill or taste. This location has horrible service from arrogant staff \"proudly\" bearing starbucks pins for their \"achievements\" in Starbucks coffee school....i.e. American Propaganda for the stupid. As a corporation staff are paid extremely low wages and give even lower quality coffee. Modern slavery at it's finest.
