Stopped by tonight for dinner (yes, they are open on Sunday's). I had the Cabernet Burger and it was wonderful. From the bun to the Brie, it couldn't have been better. \n\nHubby had the Hamburger Wrap and said it was \"very good\", which is honestly the highest praise he gives just about anything. \n\nWe were visiting from about an hour away but are figuring in a meal here on our next trip.
