Ship & Anchor Pub is a Calgary institution. It's the perfect bar: perfect location, perfect pub food, perfect crowd. This spot appeals to everyone, which is why men in business suits will be seated right next to tattoo'd bikers. Ship's big patio right on 17th makes it the perfect stop before, after, or during a night out in Calgary. Despite its popularity, it's not too hard to find a seat. Inside is dive-bar-esque, with lots of seats and a tiny dance floor -- just the way I like it. Staff is attentive and menu is good pub fare at super affordable prices. Visit once and you'll be a regular like the rest of us in no time.
