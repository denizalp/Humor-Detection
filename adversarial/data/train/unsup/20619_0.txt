I was here a few years ago with my buddy Bob, also a Calif guy and we both loved it. By a wild chance in hell we found seats at the bar, the place was packed, it was loud, and there was some music on in the background - heard faintly from the noise. \n\nLook if you don't like crowds and noise - this place isn't for you. \n\nThe beers and cocktails were very cheap - I could say inexpensive but that's just not right here. I was having an odd conversation with the bartender - we were not agreeing with each other but both laughing about it. You gotta dig it when you can laugh - and I got the feeling he doesn't agree with many people. \n\nEnded up being the last ones out - great bunch of guys working here - Working man's bar (shed your attitude before you walk in).
