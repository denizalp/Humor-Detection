Buffet of Buffets: Stop #3 & Final Stop. \n\nLots of choices. I mean that's what they are known for right? I was still surprised though. I mean there was so much to eat. Food overload. How was I supposed to get to it all?\n\nRibs were the best here. The meat just falls off the bone and the sauce is just slightly sweet and not too overpowering and saucy. I love their ribs! \n\nMore thoughts: The teppanyaki was also fun to watch. The alcoholic drinks are very inexpensive. Happy hour $2\/4\/6 drinks. They've got gelato too. The carrot cake was tasty. The Carival World Buffet was the best of all of the one I tried this weekend. I liked everything that I put on my plate. The variety is a plus too. \n\nBuffet of Buffets: We only made it to 3 but that's not too bad. Definitely got our money's worth. Now, I don't want to hear the word buffet for a really long time. =P Can I just order out the ribs from the Rio and the macaroons from Paris? Pretty please?
