As others have already pointed out, the shaved ice is awesome and can easily be shared between 2-3 ppl (which my best friend, my gf, and I did). I've never tried food here but while the food going to other tables looked appetizing, the portions appeared small. My girlfriend likes this place as a whole, although I personally prefer chatime when it comes to drinks. In fact, I would literally just return here for the shaved ice. Service leaves much to be desired.
