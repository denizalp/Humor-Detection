The food here was delicious! \n\nThe Zucchini Fritter appetizers definitely hit the spot! You can really taste the zucchini and it's not too heavy even when it's fried.\n\nThe Chicken Jambalaya had a nice kick and was delicious.\n\nThe Friday's special, King Crab Cioppino was fantastic! Great amount of seafood. Well seasoned!\n\nI would order everything I ordered again! I hope to return on another trip to Phoenix to try out more stuff on their menu!
