Clean and great nail technicians. When we were there some crazy lady started crying because she said they burned her foot. Funny thing is the nail tech was getting ready to paint her nails, the pedi was done and this lady flipped out and said she wasn't paying for the service. This place is in a really nice neighborhood so I'm confused how this lady couldn't afford her pedi. Her feet were fine I just think she wanted a free pedi. I'm posting this just in case that basket case tries to write a review. It's not them she was clearly off her meds.
