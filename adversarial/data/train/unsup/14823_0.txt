(Lyrics - Foghat - Slow Ride)\n\nSeoul bites, right in Phoenix\nSeoul bites, right in Phoenix\nSeoul bites, right in Phoenix\nSeoul bites, right in Phoenix\n\nI'm in the mood\nThe Japchae is right\nMove to the Galbi\nWe can eat it all night\n\n\nI was pretty skeptical of this place when I first saw it.  It was in an area close to a lot of chain restaurants so that was a downer for me.  As I arrived to the place I was somewhat put at ease.  The place was fresh and chilly as in most Korean BBQ places.  It had a beautiful bar plus the place was clean and a modern Asian theme to it.\n\nMoreover, I rather appreciate SeoulPHX since they had a combo selection based on the size of your group.  We ordered the 5 people combo which came with onion pancakes, salad, and tofu soup.  The onion pancakes was bland and lacked textured, but the sauce that came along helped give it some pop; pungent, sweet and spicy all at once.  The tofu soup was okay at best based on the morsel of quantity I received.  I can't speak about it much since the star of the meal came right after; Galbi, Bulgogi and Spicy Pork.  The meats were all well seasoned and I barely used the oil and salt for dipping.  Our waitress would always ask us how we liked our meat temperature which is always a plus; rare indeed please!  The staff was on point that night since after every choice of meat they changed out our grill tops.  This process really helped by keeping the flavors of the type seasoning and meats separated allowing you to taste each to it's full potential.  \n\nIn the end, SeoulPHX really had something going!  Service was on point, except they need to figure out how to deal with check separation for larger groups; 3 cards per party isn't going to cut it.  The marination of the cuts of meat was solid and overall ambiance was well done! - Enjoy!
