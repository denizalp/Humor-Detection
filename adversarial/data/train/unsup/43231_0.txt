Found this place by accident and boy am i glad. Excellent service, a really good selection of japanese items. The cocnut shrimp was easily the best ive ever had. Sushi and miso etc were all top notch as well. Try the wine ball! Flame grilled chicken was also amazing. The chef even came out to greet us!
