A mediocre spot by Yonge and Dundas to meet up with friends or go out after work.\n\nYou would think being a \"brewery\" and brewing their own beer that the beer would be something above average, but it was really nothing to rave about. The food is also average as well. I split the nachos with some friends and we all agreed it would've been more worth our time and money to make better nachos ourselves. Some other friends ordered different items and for the quality, the menu seemed over-priced.\n\nA good thing about this place is the atmosphere - it's pretty lively and the place is fairly large (multiple levels) so there is lots of space and seating.  Service was decent given the size and busy-ness of the place, but the food did take a while to come out. \n\nIf you are looking for something easy and centrally located, this will probably do the job, but other than that it's very average.
