What a highly rated restaurant! The number of awards peppering Japango is quite insane. On a rainy afternoon, the restaurant was fully packed with customers, but after the lunch hour rush the location was deserted.\n\nThe menu is laid out in a clean and simple format, and service is extremely efficient. They give you TEA, not water, which is very rare in Toronto. Price was a bit expensive but the lunch specials are fair. I'm fond of Japango and I would definitely come back! \n\nFavorites: Sashimi don- SO delicious! You get a bowl of spicy sauce to drizzle over your don, and the beautiful mix of sliced raw fish and steaming white rice is pefection.\n\nDislikes: Salmon teriyaki lunch. It's a bunch of pre-bought side dishes with a quickly grilled salmon that is drenched in teriyaki sauce. I could make this at home!
