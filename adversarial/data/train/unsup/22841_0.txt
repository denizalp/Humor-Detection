Unfortunately, if you want to feel excluded, under-served and like you've over-spent, go to Osteria De Medici.\n\nMy disappointing experience was thus - The Osteria over-booked the restaurant on the night we had made reservations, forcing us to wait - although we had arrived on time - more than 30 minutes for our table to be ready.\n\nWhen the snotty Maitre'd arrived to tell us that we were to be seated, she lead us to an 8-person table in the middle of the lounge and said that they \"we're very sorry, but they over-booked and we had to sit here\". Instead of leaving... we stayed to see how things would go.\n\nAfter a good 15 minutes, the waiter came by and looked hard down his nose at us while we ordered drinks. We watched our drinks be made at the bar and subsequently sit on said bar for 20 minutes while the ice melted. \n\nOver the course of the dinner, our server was curt, pretentious and noticeably absent. To be fair, I don't mind an absent-esk server, many restaurants in Europe operate a \"waiters are ghosts\" serving strategy where servers zip around almost unseen serving food and refilling drinks without breathing so much as a word to the guests, save to take an order. But this server was more a poltergeist then a ghost. I felt like if we'd ordered the wrong wine, he'd sweep is starched arm across the table to knock the dishes off.\n\nThroughout the night, many of the other servers, restaurant staff and patrons - I suspect because we were so oddly placed in the middle of the lounge or because at one point, I laughed - cast side-long glances crested with little 'harrumphs' our way. So when a more suitable table opened up near the window, we asked to move. Curtly, we were told, \"that table is not for you.\"\n\nThis restaurant would get half a star save for the food was pretty good. It was almost prohibitively expensive and grossly pretentious, but the flavor was alright.\n\nRegrettably, I don't recommend you go here for any reason. Osteria De Medici is a \"famous\" restaurant in Calgary. The lobby is dotted with pictures of 1980s and 90s celebrities who have visited and, apparently, happily eaten. But after being treated like my money, my age or my status wasn't good enough; I simply can't imagine why it's stayed famous for so long.\n\nT.
