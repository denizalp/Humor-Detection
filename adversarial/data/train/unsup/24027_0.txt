If you're in the area and are in quick need of some over the counter heartburn medicine or other OTC relief, this is one of the few spots within a five block radius at least where you can get them.  But if it's all the same to you, you'd might as well hit up the Shoppers' a few blocks east - the prices here are reflective of it being such a tiny shop.\n\nOne whole half of the store is dedicated to the pharmacy itself as well as over the counter remedies and a lot of items that seem to be related to elder care, like canes and reading glasses.  The store also has a few U-of-T student pandering items, for example, instant bowls of mac and cheese and other quick carb eats.  There is also a surprisingly large array of candies and grooming products.  Overall though, it feels like there are as many candies on clearance that are about to go stale as regular priced, which to me says that they aren't moving product as fast as they could be or think they will.  Be careful about checking the expiry date on food items as you don't want to get something that missed the clearance bin.
