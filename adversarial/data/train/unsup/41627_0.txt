Thank you Yelpers for getting us here...\n\nMy husband is not fond of Take-out joints and presuming this place to be one of that kind we always drove past this...One fine afternoon, my daughter insisted to eat Fried rice and so we landed up here. \n\nI must say, a very small yet decent place. Calming ambiance, great food, great price and good portion size. I would definitely recommend this place for dine-in and take-out.
