4 of us went for dinner...not sure who does the food ordering, the restaurant literally had run out of more than half the food on the menu (our reservation was for 8pm on a Saturday). Service was so slow, the food came out before our wine...had to ask for cutlery....lol serving 101 guys.....this place ranks low in comparision to other places to eat on Ossington- dont waste your money on this place #sorrynotsorry
