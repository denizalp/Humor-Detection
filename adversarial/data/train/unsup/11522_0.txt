As I sat and made small talk with a blonde waitress, the bartender took her order. He proceeded to make what I believe was a martini, a dirty martini. I only say a dirty  martini as I nerver had one but since he was adding olive juice by holding his bare hand over the olive  and fruit tray (BARE) just nasty.\nJuice pouring through his fingers like an added boost of flavor.\n\nThen I ordered a shot, and it was double the price of one in a  downtown Chicago night club. Makers Mark. A double in one  shot glass wtf. \n\nWaitress was rude, and I mean nasty. So  nasty I wrote as a tip, learn to be less rude.\nThis place is a dive. Or in better terms a dark Dungeness shit hole with bitter servers and bands that can't even play the wedding circuit. \n\nI swear the stench of drunk nasty is still on me from sitting on the stools. \n\nIf you plan on going here, slam your  in a discount cab door first. Its as much fun and three times cheaper.\nBy the way this was my second time here. I always go twice
