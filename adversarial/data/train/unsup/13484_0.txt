Every now and then I'll hit up a spot and neither review them, nor pretend it really happened.  Xtreme Sushi was \"ehhhHhhh\" at most..  \n\nI came in on a week night and sat myself at the bar next to two other couple.  It's a small little restaurant with one chef behind the bar on this particular night.\n\nI order 1 AYCE even though I'm sure I can do 2 AYCE for just myself, but I'm more reasonable than that and rather save money. \"Just 1 AYCE will do, thanks.\" \n\nI started off with a few piece of Nigiri.  Some scraps were left in the fish which was no biggie.  I just asked for another clean napkin as i separate and spat out the chunks into it, and discreetly dump it in the restroom as I do not want to disrespect the chef\n\nI go ahead and proceed to try other fish. So far not so bad, but then this Gaijin next to me wanted to chime in.  \"Hey, you should try their Spicy Yellowtail Nigiri, bro.  It's Amazing.\"  He goes ahead and order me it and I accept, but get this, the chef had the Spicy Yellowtail mixture premixed!  Sooo I take a piece and toss it in my mouth.  I was expected to be blown away since it came from the chef's hidden secret stashed, but meehHh..\n\nI proceed to go about my route and order other stuff including Garlic Tuna Nigiri.  Now THAT was amazing.  So I thought to myself they must have really good Maguro (Tuna) today.  I order one and a salmon too.  My new sushi buddy overheard me and told me that their salmon is \"Phenomenon.\"  Ok, buddy..\nI get my sushi and the tuna clearly did not look anywhere as near as fresh as the garlic one I just moments ago.  Even my salmon looks slimy!  At this point I'm befuckled.  Was I not getting any love from the chef?\n\nI stuck with a few basic and safer choice from my earlier selection, and finished off with the chef's special Spicy Yellowtail but this time hand roll and I think a complimentary mochi for dessert.\nI go home right after dinner and puked my brains out because i felt sick from what i ate.  Must have been the chef's special because that's all i could taste in the back of my throat ;(\n\nVerdict:  Find your own sushi chef and stick with him.  I'm pretty sure all these Sushi place gets their fish from the same vendor, so keep a look out for the slower restaurant since they don't rotate as much fresh fish as the busier establishment does.  Also don't trust Gaijin (non-Japanese) that winks at you.
