Been coming here for years.  After testing out a few others from recommendations (Mr Presto, Novelty etc) I still come back to Kaner's.  Their service is reliable, detailed and reasonably priced.  For larger jobs, I don't rush them and let them dictate the time they think it will need to complete the repair well.  I used to take about 5 pairs, each visit I went.  \n\nUntil I find a better cobbler in the city, I will continue coming here for their excellent work.  There is a reason why most of the luxury retailers use Kaner's as their top choice for local repairs.
