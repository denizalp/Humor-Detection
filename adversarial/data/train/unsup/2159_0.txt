Either new ownership isn't doing so hot, or they weren't that great to start with. Actually, they're doing hot in a way.\n\nNikki's Akropolis Pizza is the new name of this business that still seems to be serving gyros and pizzas in a nondescript plaza at the bottom of that hill on Sunset Road. Yelp evidence suggests that the new owners took over a few months ago. Although some of the old signage is still up, the new name is quite obvious from the outside.\n\nThe inside isn't that welcoming. There wasn't a TV menu or other sort of posted menu, and they only had 1 paper\/to-go menu available. That made it awkward when the customer right behind me asked to see the menu immediately. The dining room was clean enough, but the temperature was at least 3-5 degrees too warm. Summer isn't shaping up to be a good time to visit this restaurant.\n\nI went to the lunch specials menu (available 11-4) and picked out the pork gyro combo ($8.99). It took about 10-15 minutes for my order to come out, which I'm usually fine with when the temperature is more comfortable. The food was hot though, and the gyro had good flavors and textures among the marinated pork, tzatziki, feta, and veggies. The pork meat ended up a little dry though, and there wasn't enough tzatziki to cover that up.\n\nWhether ordered dine-in or to-go, the fries are served on the side in the same plate. They're the thick-cut, crispy and soft variety which I tend to enjoy, and they're properly seasoned. They did complement the gyro but still couldn't cover for the main deficiency.\n\nOddly, the drink with the combo has to be one of the cans or bottles from the fridge. I realized a little later that I probably could've grabbed bottled water, which would've been good, but I went for soda instead, and that warmed up a little too quickly throughout the meal. Don't fountain drinks tend to cost businesses way less? They'd also help with the drink temperature issue by virtue of having ice.\n\nI wasn't impressed enough to come back to Nikki's, even to try the lamb gyro which they apparently now offer. The reason is that there are more interesting Greek places in the area, not that these guys are a bad option. I would recommend them if you need a quick lunch in the area (looking at you, Roseman).\n\n[REPLY TIME: I told the employee that things were \"good,\" not \"great.\" That's not inconsistent with an experience that reaches 3 but not a full 4 stars. I was mostly done with the gyro at that point, so am I supposed to get sauce for the last small portion? Also, let's be serious, when was the last time anyone has walked into a restaurant and had to ask them to turn on the A\/C? Out of my hundreds of experiences in Las Vegas \/ Henderson, this is the only one of my trips which comes to mind. Stop being either miserly\/inattentive and fix your issues including that and the menu.]
