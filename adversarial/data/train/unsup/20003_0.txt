My husband and I call this shop \"the good convenience store\". Every downtown hood has a few convenience stores, but only one that's tolerable for anything above gum. For us, that's Ready Go Store. \n\nI feel a little conflicted tossing this place some love after reading Zahra H's review. However, I've never had a bad experience here, and they always have exactly what I need. Gotta show them some love for that. Further to this, I've only ever been helped by really kind ladies, never angry men, so maybe they've turned it around. Here's hoping. \n\nI live around the corner and I have a baby. Yes, there is a FreshCo but sometimes you don't want to enter the chaos of a full grocer, you just need one-three things and a bank machine. This place has all of that. Frozen foods in a fix? You bet. Diapers and advil? Check check. Every kind of soda and a banana? You betcha, babe. \n\nReady Go is always read for me. Go there. (See what I just did there?)
