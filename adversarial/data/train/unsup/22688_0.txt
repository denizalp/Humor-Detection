Their machines, dumbbells, and TVs are often broken and it takes forever to get anything fixed.  The kids that work there don't seem to care about much of anything except signing up new members.  There is never anyone available to answer questions in the workout area.   People often drop weights and kids are often running loose on the floor and there is no one that ever does anything about it.  At night, there is usually only one person on duty for the whole club!  The lockers and steam room often smell and the pool and hot tub have green, disgusting water that looks like it hasn't been changed in years!  And the music that they play is horrible and loud!!  The songs never change and you can barely hear your iPod over the music.  This is not a good club for anyone who is serious about working out and
