I went here for a quick Dinner on Monday night. \n\nI had a seaweed salad and the grilled squid. My husband had a spicy salmon roll and chicken teriyaki. \n\nEverything was good, particularly the spicy salmon roll. The grilled squid was a bit too chewy. \n\nThey had a pretty large cocktail and sake selection, but we didn't have any.
