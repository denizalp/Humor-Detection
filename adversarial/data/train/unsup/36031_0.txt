Italian sandwich was OK.  The Filet salad was listed  on the menu as medium.  Served well done.  The apps came moments before the entrees which is not much fun.  Too many guests for one server.\n\nFood quality is near the price but not quite the price. \n\nWork on the timing and add staff and you'll be a better restaurant.
