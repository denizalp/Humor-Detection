My wife and I enjoyed every dish and kept wondering how they accomplished both flavor and texture for our dishes. I really was amazed at the duck like texture, crispy chewy with a little effort needed for gamey meat.   If I lived in Montreal this would become one of our favorite go to places.  This not a specialty restaurant but it should be valued as an upscale foodie spot that is worth the uber money to get her. If your coming from old town.. take another uber up to the nearby outdoor market on your first days visit to the city and you'll set the bar high for the rest of your visit!
