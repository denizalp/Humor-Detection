I've always been a fan of Dr. Andrew Weil and his use of both conventional and natural, alternative healing methods in treating people. That's exactly what I've been searching for in a veterinary practice as well.  I'm happy to say that I've finally found it. Dr. Casey was wonderful. I sent my Pippa's medical records in advance and she clearly looked them over carefully before our appointment; remembering even the smallest details. Everything about the appointment was what I had hoped for and I feel confident that Pippa and all the new pets who come into my life will be receiving the best care possible!
