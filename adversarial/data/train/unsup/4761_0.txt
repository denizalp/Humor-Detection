This place made me feel like I was at a high school dance. Fatman Scoop mashups horribly mixed; I think I may be able to beat match better. Uhm, no. The DJ did play some Too Short though, and he got all us Bay kids pumped up for a bit, but then it was back to garbage.\n\nI see Rocky B. below has commented on the mojitos, but I'm guessing she was at Rum Jungle for dinner, however we came after eating next door at Red Square to go to Rumjungle, the club. We ordered mojitos at the bar, and the bartender said they don't make them.\n\n....W T F ?!!!?!?!\n\nWHAT KIND OF RUM BAR ARE YOU IF YOU DON'T MAKE THE QUINTESSENTIAL RUM COCKTAIL?!!?!?!?!\n\nWhether it was a case of a n00b or lazy bartender, I don't care, that's just unacceptable. What about suggestively selling us a Mai Tai or Zombie or Hurricane? Nope.\n\nThis place does earn three stars though because of the scantily clad gogo dancers in UV reactive lingerie in the hanging cage and the super tan platinum blonde babe with the bob walking along the bar pouring jager in everyone's mouths. She had the biggest badonkadonk I've ever seen. Clear, six-inch lucite heels, a sparkly push up bra and itty bitty panties. Can't miss her. We were here on a Friday night, so my guess is that she's a weekend feature. Excellent eye candy. The actual crowd? Not so much.\n\nRumjungle would be a decent place to start the night out (hit up the said jager goddess walking along the bar) then go somewhere better. No line at 12am. Free cover for girls staying in the hotel, or that's what the bouncer told us, though he never asked us to show our room keys to prove we were actual guests. Our guy friend had to pay $30, LOL.
