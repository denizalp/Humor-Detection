I don't know HiLiter... I want to like you, but it just is never quite right. The staff has been friendlier here lately than in the past for sure. The waitresses are hot and awesome. There are quite a few very pretty dancers, too. Kudos to them for keeping it diverse. There are all races, body types, fake and real tits, tatted and non-tatted. We do always have fun and usually come with a group for a birthday or something. \nI think it's the decor that throws me. Remember hypercolor color shirts and those neon days back in the late 80's, early nineties? Well, that's what their decor looks like! The chairs and carpet match and not in a good way- the exact same pattern!. The chairs are cushiony and kind of scare me thinking what might be on them or embedded in the fabric. They also take up a ton of room, so you generally feel as though you are intruding on someones lap dance or might get kicked in the head. \nI haven't had a dance here in years, but whoa! I don't know if the recession is having the girls working harder for dances or what, but they have been MUCH more lax. Touchy, touch , almost to a point of discomfort. Bare touching to the client, under shirts, bras, underwear... I'm sure most people dig it, but if you don't want to get that \"personal\" I would advise skipping the dances. \nOverall, not bad for a strip club! How about a little decor upgrade? A \npatio cleanup? And maybe someone to Windex the mirrors because they are covered all throughout the club with streaky hand prints. I'm sure this place can afford it based on those hefty drink prices. \nEnjoy and try not to get kicked in the head with a giant plastic heel. \n*TIP- go on-line to print free admission passes, then you can save that 10 bucks for a groping and pretty X rated lap dance!
