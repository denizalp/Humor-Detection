Azul will take away your blues!  Prepare yourself for awesome home made salt and pepper tortilla chips and queso dip that tastes like joy in a bowl.  \n\nAttentive staff served us a constant flow of home made Mojitos and Margaritas, as well as Mexican Beers on tap.\n\nEverything tasted that much better served up on giant feasting hall style tables, surrounded by cool Mexican art, beautiful wood, and a blue tin ceiling.  \n\nAs good as the drinks, decor, and apps were, the entrees fell a bit short.  Definitely good, just not TREMENDOUSLY GREAT like the rest.  \n\nSo next time you're feeling blue, come to azul, get a little sauced, load up on starters, and leave with a smile!
