Not only was the food delicious but the service was superior. Our waiter Tracy aka \"Hatch\" was extremely knowledgeable of not only the food but the beer menu as well.  He is a shining star and I would definitely come back for his hospitality alone.\n\nIf you want to put a little South In Your Mouth...this is the place to go.
