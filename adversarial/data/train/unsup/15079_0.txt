Do not go to this location!  I can back the other review about NASTY BATHROOMS!  Having said that, I don't think that it was blood....looked like much worse to me.  \n\nThere are some very nice staff here and some I could do without.  At this location, if you don't have a personal trainer you don't matter. \n\nOne of the staff members had his dog here and it made a mess which was disgusting. When I said something, they just laughed.  If you want to go to a gym and use equipment a dog slobbered all over then this is your location.   Can someone say, health department?
