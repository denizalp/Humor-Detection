I came the week before Thanksgiving, which generally feels like a off-season time, so many things were much quieter and less crowded overall in Vegas.\n\nPros:\nMy room was dead quiet. I never heard a peep from any other people my entire stay, let alone really saw any other people.\n\nThe location was perfect - I prefer off the strip.\n\nGreat decor. I picked this hotel for that reason - something different. Cozy, no gambling, or shows, or late night bars, just quiet. Ahhh... :)\n\nFree parking, free wifi....I think (noticed a funny charge for $100 this morning...)\n\nCons:\nThe CHILDREN in charge of checking people in need a lesson in manners and customer service. Extremely unhelpful.  I booked through Priceline and paid the room in full MONTHS ahead. Even called days before to confirm my reservation.  I get there after a 5hr drive and they say I need to pay $75\/per night for \"incidentals\".  I've NEVER been charged a fee that huge at a hotel. I didn't have an extra $150 as my paycheck didn't go through until midnight. They said they couldn't help me. I was able to convince them to charge me just $75 for the first night and that I would settle the second $75 in the morning - no f&*ing way was I going to sleep in my car till midnight when I had already paid for my room.  That's just BAD BUSINESS.\n\nStay somewhere else. The business ethics of this place are shady and the staff are bored apathetic teens.
