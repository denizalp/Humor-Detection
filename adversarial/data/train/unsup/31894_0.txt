The Kmart on 43rd and Indian School has been closed for a long while now. That was our go-to store. They had decent stuff. I miss that snack bar so much. The nachos were amazing and I have yet to find any better nachos but I digress.\n\nThis location is now the closest to us. It seems mostly like a ghost town. Very quiet and strange. No snack bar. Boo. They do have ICEE's but that means nothing when the machine is ALWAYS out of order. But I can see why since there seems to be minimal traffic here. As another Yelper said, the prices here are in shambles. Their loss, our gain. My mom got $1 pool filters and $1 kids pool due to false advertising and false labeling. Go here and it's not surprising to see why Kmarts will be a thing of the past. The service is lackluster and you can tell none of the employees want to be here. All they do is stand around and gossip loudly.\n\nKmart is one of the places that has ELF cosmetics but they are always out of stock of lots of them. Good thing Target also sells them too.\n\nFor the most part a lof of items seem to be $1-4 more than others stores. Makes it not worth it to shop here except for cheap, depressing nostalgia. It will be a bummer when Kmart is thing of the past.
