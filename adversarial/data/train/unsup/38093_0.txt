We've had my husband's car repaired here twice in the last few months (different issues).  They have done both repair work and tires for the vehicle now. The customer service is wonderful.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  I loved the customer service philosophy they have hanging in the bathroom.  The facility is new, clean and like another reviewer said the lobby is great.  I especially liked it since I had to wait a few minutes with a toddler. Price was great, they were honest, clearly explained the work that needed to be done ASAP versus work that could wait and the best part they are incredibly quick!  Both visits we had the car back within hours, which is huge for our family of six. Highly recommend.
