Clean pho, great meat options..\n\nTo be fair I came in when it was 116 outside and my fever probably matched, so the magical elixir that is fresh lemonade and pho was a must have.\n\nIt seems like a family run establishment which I love (support local businesses!) And the layout was clean and interesting.  Service was great and attentive,  which usually can be hit or miss in a pho spot.\n\nSeems they even have a karaoke set up for special nights or occasions, my fever was not high enough on that day to get me to find out.\n\nSide note: saw they offer crawfish now so if you want to grab some rather than hitting say, an angry crab you can get it here as well.
