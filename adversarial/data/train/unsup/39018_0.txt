Came in to buy a handgun and rifle with\/for my wife. Was at the counter for about 5 minutes and had to stare at the group of 3 employees before they even acknowledged me. They treated me like I was bothering him and after showing me one gun, I decided they don't want my business, so they obviously don't need it, and I don't need to give it to them.
