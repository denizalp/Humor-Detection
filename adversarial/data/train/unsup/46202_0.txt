An annual favorite that just went from 4 to 5 stars thanks to Monika. A favorite Spring Training stop while visiting Scottsdale. \nHappy Hour is the best. Monika's suggestions were right on! Started with the Queso Verde and then on to the Cheese Crisp (it's actually a pizza on a flour tortilla.) It was great. Topped off with half price Margaritas. How can you go wrong? We'll be back. \nTry the patio if it's not too hot.  Kinda noisy inside.
