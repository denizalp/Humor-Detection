Being a fan of the Pawn Stars tv show, my sister and I decided to visit the shop when we were in Vegas.  It was very hot and the outside line to get in was long, but they have misters mounted above the crowd and it kept us cool.  The shop is small, there was a long line of people moving through and we really didn't have time to stop and look at anything.  We did buy some shirts and Chumlee made an appearance but didn't talk to anyone.\nThe problem started here:  My husband and I were at the Trump inauguration and were in the same hotel with Rick, and on the same floor.  The guy was a total jerk when we met him, acted like he couldn't be bothered with fans, even the wealthy ones that were staying in the same very expensive hotel that he was in.  Is that a good way to drum up business to your shop?  Is dissing your fans, the very people who made you rich, a smart thing to do?  Even though it was my favorite show for years, I'm so disappointed in the way we were treated that I will never watch it again.
