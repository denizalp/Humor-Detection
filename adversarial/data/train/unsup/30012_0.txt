I always heard good things about this place, never been so we wanted to try it. Kinda looka like a dirty ghetto place from the outside and when entering the spot, very musky and looks weird because they have the sitting area on the right and ordering on the left. The lady in the front was sweet and asked us if it was our first time, showed us the menu, let us try the different chickens and told me whats good and whats not. We got the jared red chciken (I think thats what its called) with chicken fried rice.... it was delicious  Overall really good food and delicious!!!
