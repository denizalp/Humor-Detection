xs shits on other clubs in vegas...\n\nthis tiime i actually remembered more than 10 mins so i can write a more accurate review. \n\nthis place is huge!!!!! i didnt realize before. there were people all over the place. the music was kinda ehhh geared more towards house...so every once in a while they played some hip hop but only for 3 or 4 songs. the bathroom lines were not to bad until all the chicks started getting drunk. ive actually yacked in both bathrooms and i think i prefer the one inside better. there are soooo many tables for service i was super surprised. we were able to find a bed that wasnt being used so we chilled out there for a little bit. well being the wild and crazy chicks that we are of course we ended up being the first ones in the pool...i dont get why more people did join us. i mean come on its effin vegas!!!! do something crazy! take of your shoes and take a dip..you aint that damn cute....\n\nso me and my friend had a small lil argument before i went. he said that there were poker\/ black jack tables at the bar near the pool i said there werent...he won.... it was nice to see the hot tub in the corner but it was way to  hot even at 4 am to get in it. cant wait to go again...
