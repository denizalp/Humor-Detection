Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!! You never let me down XS!!! ::hearts::\n\nI think I have a different mentality going here. Forget trying to be cute, dancing, and flirting- I find myself sneaking over to the gambling tables every chance I get!!! \n\nEveryone was super nice and the drinks were very GENEROUS. We were all cheering each other on and we even got the dealers to 'fist pump' by the end of the night!!\n\nWeeeeeee!!! Drink alll dayyyyy... CRAPS alllll night!!! Well.. until 4am, when they declared LAST ROLLL and kicked us out =)
