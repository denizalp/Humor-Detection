The Wagon Wheel is under new ownership\/management as of March 2015. Same great food, along with great service. We always have a fun time everytime we come here. Tons of TVs, along with Keno, Wifi and friendly service, all in one place.  Definitely one of the hot spots in Parma\/Parma Heights. Great outdoor patio as well!  And don't forget the basement bar if you're hosting a private party.
