Ordered two large pizzas to go from Grimaldi's with high hopes that I would be tasting a bit of New York before I make my first visit out there and boy was I disappointed. One of the boys in my group highly recommended it and according to Yelp, it was a highly recommended place to dine, so we decided to make the call. We ordered a large chicken jalepeno (my go-to pizza wherever I go) and a large pepperoni, onion, and mushroom for 6 people. The pizza were thin crust slices, which can be a hit or miss for me. The pepperoni, mushroom, onion pizza was the most flavorful of the two. The chicken on the chicken jalepeno pizza tasted odd and I felt like it didn't belong. The jalepeno added a nice kick to the pizza, but wasn't enough to make me go for a second slice. The cheese on the pizza was different from the normal mozzarella cheese, and looked almost like goat cheese. Everything about my first try at Grimaldi's pizza was a miss for me. Luckily, I had some good company to share in on this painful experience with me. Sadly, I probably won't give this place a second try and neither will I put it on my to-go list when I visit New York.
