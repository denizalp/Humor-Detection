Long wait for the table. Very slow service. We waited approximately 10 minutes to be greeted. I expected more from a restaurant that is open for 30 years. They featured a 4 course meal for $30.30 in celebration of their 30th anniversary but the menu was a big disappointment. Appetizers were good. The mini baguette was very good. The intermediate course, a house salad was the most rustic and an item that should not be in a fine dining restaurant, mixed greens tossed in an over acidic balsamic vinaigrette. The Lasagna was mediocre, you can even see the comparison with other pictures on Yelp, they hold the garnish to save some pennies. The dessert was nothing special, a small piece of tiramisu and a hard to eat cannoli. \nThe wine list is super over priced. I was looking for a good value Barbera or Langhe Nebbiolo for about $50 dollars but it was a mission impossible. They have the most expensive Italian wine list I've ever seen. If you can afford Gaja and Masseto this might be your place.\nI am sure there are a lot of great Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas Strip to try. \nThe owner is famous for his hospitality, however we sat in the waiting area for 50 minutes waiting for our table with our baby and he never came by even to say hi. \nI guess he only shows his hospitality to the rich regular guest who patronize his establishment.
