Pizza by the Slice, sign me up.  Sal's has a very nice space, with an open kitchen that includes a pizza bar with over 10 pizzas that you can order by the slice. In addition, they do offer a full menu, of specialty pizzas, cheesesteaks, hot sandwiches and some Italian dishes.\n\nAfter checking out the menu, I decided to order a Garden Salad and a small Sal's Special.  \nNote: They offer Small and Large Pizzas, the small having six slices.  \n\nSal's Special included Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushrooms, Onions and Peppers.  The pizza was cooked to perfection, perfectly crisp crust with a chew to the slice.  The toppings were overwhelming, and unfortunately the mushrooms are straight out of a can.  I love fresh mushrooms on a pie so that was a little disappointing. But, overall, great choice!\nThe salad was fine, but not sure it was worth $5.95, was more like a side salad, which costs $3.00. Would love to see the difference because they do offer both. And the ranch was good, but not homemade...at least it sure tasted like one I'm familiar with.\n\nOverall the pizza was great, will definitely be back to try some slices, service was on point, and prices were okay.  I think a little pricey if you ask me... $17.95 for a small pizza, which is 6 slices.
