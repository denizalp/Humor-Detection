Dan E basically has it perfect here, so make sure to read his.  I have trouble adding much to it.\n\nIt's a unique venue that effectively merges Caribbean, Mexican, and Chinese flavors into something all it's own.\n\nWhen just stopping for a quick meal and not a big production, it is a great, though not lite choice.\n\nRemember that you get a cookie with each order, so save room.  On weekends you get a choice between the usual snickerdoodle and a volcano cookie (chocolate).\n\nRemember to ask for tastes of anything you're not familiar with before ordering, and trying mixing things up by trying them in quesadilla and burrito formats instead of just dumped in with the rice and beans.
