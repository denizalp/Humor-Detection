I finally came back so I could try the vanilla french toast I had previously dissed for their marvellous eggs benny. I walked through the door and lo and behold a new brunch menu was waiting for me. (yay) But the vanilla french toast was no longer on there! (boo) But it had been replaced by an even more decadent version, stuffed with ricotta and apricot (yay)! Man, what a rollercoaster that day was.\n\nAfter regaining my emotional footing I ordered the aforementioned dessert-passing-for-breakfast. I don't normally cuss before noon (not quite true) but FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULL HOUSE that was a mean french toast. Slathered with real maple syrup, the thick pieces of perfectly carmelized bread had my heart pounding -- and it wasn't just from the fat intake.\n\nThe french toast was served with a salad (why?) and fresh fruit. Service as always was impeccable and motherly. Sage is as good as it gets.
