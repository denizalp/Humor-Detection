Prime rib was really good, but otherwise disappointed in the overall selection of foods considering the advertisements for this place. Staff didn't know full protocol as the sign stating to go containers were $16 also stated to go beverages were $3.50. When I inquired about a to go beverage I was told it couldn't be done. Too tired to argue.  Management should change sign or re-educate staff.
