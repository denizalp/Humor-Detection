This is a good spot that I nearby for a quick bite to eat. \n\nThere is an ok amount of room and even some patio seating for the nice weather. The decor is kinda of all.ober the place but you can see it's a collections of favorites from picture to teams etc. Everyone was really nice and the service was pretty quick. They offer diner fare and all you would expect for that, so breakfast dishes in thier classic forms and lots of choices for sandwiches at lunch. Everything was good that came out. The fries were frozen fries but ok....nothing was really outside expectations so they are a reliable place to go grab some grub Solo or to catch up with a friend.
