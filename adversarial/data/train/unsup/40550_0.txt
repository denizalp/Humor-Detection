I went to Landry's for the first time last night. I was apprehensive about the service in this restaurant because I had heard from many people that service was incredibly slow. However, it had been a few years since I had heard that so I decided to give this place a chance since the food was supposed to be good. \n\nAs I walked in I notice a big blue marlin in the restaurant. It was dimly lit and had a very nice vibe. It took about 5 minutes to be seated because unfortunately no one had answered the phone when we called. We were seated and had a wonderful waitress, Amanda Prosciutto (like the ham). She was very friendly, bubbly, fun, and very attentive to our table throughout our whole dining experience. The food was a little slow coming out but she kept coming over to our table to keep us informed about what was going on with our food. \n\nWe ordered the paired appetizer of spinach, crab, and artichoke dip and the crab and shrimp fondue. Both were good but the artichoke dip was especially delicious. For dinner I ordered the tilapia bianca. It was delicious - lightly fried, with artichoke hearts, tomatoes, shrimp, and scallops in a nice white buttery sauce. It was served on top of a cheesy risotto like rice, which was also pretty tasty although not very multidimensional. \n\nI also ordered two drinks. One was a caipiranha made with strawberry and basil. I thought it was delicious but my fianc√©e thought it tasted too alcoholic. I think that is probably just because he does not like caipiranhas. also tried a pomegranate mojito that was also pretty good. I would recommend this restaurant since our server was very attentive, the food was delicious and reasonably priced, and it had a pleasant atmosphere.\n\nAddendum: On a recent trip I had a lightly fried avocado stuffed with crab that was amazing!
