This place is good for a quick and simple meal whether it be lunch or dinner.  The place is frequented by \"health conscious\" people who eat lots of salads and live on hummus.  So finding me in this place when I'm a meat eater, is rare.  However, when I do get in, I enjoy their beef gyro and jalapeno hummus with pita.  \n\nTheir gyro is of course not the authentic Greek kind, where it's vertically roasted on a spit and then shaved thinly just before serving.  It's the \"processed\" or the pressed kind where it's thicker cut and dryer.  They do serve it with the tzatziki sauce, but they put their own American twist to it and put pickles in it!  I know, it's atrocious, but actually tastes ok once you accept that you're sitting in Pita Jungle, not in some amazing hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Rhodes or Athens.\n\nThe servers here always crack me up.  Some are friendly, but most look like they don't want to be there.  They're dressed hippyish and that's their style I guess to fit the restaurant's vibe.  The place always reminds me of Berkeley, California except the food there's much better.  \n\nOverall an ok place if you're hungry and don't have the time to go out to a real dinner.
