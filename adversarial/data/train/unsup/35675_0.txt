Creative name, but I don't think that it really lived up to it.  I was overcome with the strong smells of meat when I stepped inside this small deli\/marketplace.  \n\nThe brothers behind the counter were very pleasant and I loved the bright colors that decorated the place.  Of course Dali paintings were everywhere: the dining area, the deli, and even the bathroom.  \n\nI thought that they overpriced for everything, and my friend that doesn't drink alcohol didn't have many options to expend at all.  I might just pass on by the next time I am in this district.
