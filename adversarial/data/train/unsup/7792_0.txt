Ok, seriously why did no one think of this spectacular idea before? Healthy, reasonably priced salad drive thru. Oh and not to be forgotten, AMAZING breakfast. \n\nMy obsession with Salad and Go started in a cool morning with a warm berry quinoa bowl. So feeling good! It'll make you forget you ever had any desire for oatmeal in your past life. \n\nThen I tried a caprese salad and the obsession grew. It's a HUGE salad (seriously three meals worth for me) bursting with pesto and balsamic. And for a little over $5?? Sold. \n\nThen, addiction set in with a breakfast bowl. Anytime someone wants to give me red potatoes, pico de gallo and avocado for breakfast, I am totally in...at first I thought it was odd that's it's really more of a salad breakfast bowl (ie: the tons of fresh spinach leaves they serve up for you for breakfast) but holy breakfast...mix that in with some egg whites and I am SOLD for life on this. \n\nOh...and the iced coffee? Yum. I am such a coffee snob and I love theirs. \n\nEveryone is super friendly and they even have organic dog bones for the furry kids if you bring them along for the ride. \n\nGrab a salad and go at your next available opportunity, you will thank me (and them).
