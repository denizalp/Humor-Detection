Definitely a well-maintained park, which shouldn't be a surprise considering the surrounding subdivision. There's ample parking, covered picnic tables and barbecue grills, bathrooms and water fountains, and a play structure. For older kids, there's both a basket ball court and baseball diamond. Note that this park is adjacent to an elementary school, and it's pretty busy in the afternoon immediately following dismissal. In the early morning and evening hours, there are lots of dog walkers who utilize the perimeter trail. \n\nTIP: Stairs are to the far left, going up to the school property.
