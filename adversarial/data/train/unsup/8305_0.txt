First time here ! I have never been to places like The Boiling Crab or Hot n Juicy so it was a fun experience :) and incredibly messy. There's plenty of seating so this place is great for large parties. \n\nCame in with a party of 11 and we ordered plenty of items including: shrimp , crawfish & crab (you order by the lb. @ market price) , oysters (9$ for 6 pc. or 15$ for 12 pc.) , fried calamari (10$) , Cajun and sweet potato fries (4$) , etc. I wasn't really a big fan of the crawfish or crab, but I definitely liked the shrimp and oysters. We got our seafood w\/ the \"whole sha-bang\" sauce (which is a combo. of their Cajun , lemon pepper & garlic sauce) and w\/ medium spice. Medium was still spicy and flavorful :) Everything was super fresh. I also have to mention I had the best fried calamari here. You can actually taste the calamari and not just fried dough. Most people say that the Cajun fries are the best but I preferred their sweet potato fries over the Cajun. Also have to note , one serving of fries was more than enough for a few people. We didn't even finish our fries even though they were delicious.\n\nOur service from our hostess & waiter was great from start to finish :) They split our orders and bills among groups no problem.
