People say I have a flare for the dramatic... Especially when it comes to describing restaurant experiences and the food. So, with no intention to be dramatic (this time or truthfully in my previous reviews - I guess it just happens) my first experience here was very pleasant.  \n\nOne very nice discovery... (Wish I could say it with the accent like I heard it in)... \"You pay cash you get 10 PAcen off\".  So I did.  Bam!  I was even explained how much I saved.  Cute!\n\nPlace is small, a bit of a dank odor (smelled as though it was formerly flooded) but nice, seemingly clean, not a dive at all.  \n\nSince they don't yet have a menu on-line I had to go (for takeout) and order there.  She (the owner it was apparent) said, \"we no yeh do it.  Heya is yaw taye ow menu foe nex time.\"   I swear I love accents and Asian people!!!  Kind, hard working, passionate.  Anyway, might I digress.  \n\nOk so the food... We ordered the Yellow Curry with chicken which was surprisingly delicious and the Pad Spicy Eggplant with beef which also was very good (Yellow Curry slight better).  The spicy eggplant had a nice basil flavor.  \n\nBig Tip!  Wait for it... Wait for it... So I asked the owner, \"If you were going to take home food for yourself tonight, what would you order?  What are your personal favorites?\"   Answer: Red Curry and Thai (or Spicy) fried rice.  \n\nSo there you have it.  The tip from the owner herself.  You can thank me now.  Oh, but wait!  Hold your praise... I didn't order it so I can't say how good it actually was.  Next time... I promise I will order it and then (if really the bomb) you can thank me.  For now, if you want your taste buds blown and you're a fried rice lover get the Jalape√±o Fried Rice (comes with their cured sausage) at Malee's On Main in Old Town Scottsdale.  Crazy !  Indescribably delicious.  (Not as spicy as the name implies!)
