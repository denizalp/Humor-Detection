My wife and I went for their happy hour and wi-fi yesterday.  We didn't know that Happy Hour started at 4:00, but we still ordered drinks at 3:40.  At 3:58, our waitress came over and asked if we wanted another round... sure!  We got charged full price!  \n\nApparently I didn't fit in there because I wasn't wearing huge block sunglasses, wore a tight black t-shirt, had my hair spiked high or had Fashion Square Jeans on.  At least now you guys know what to wear.
