I've been addicted to this place lately, and I can't stop coming back! They sure know how to work their magic. The hand-pulled noodles are sooooo good, and the texture is just perfect, not too chewy nor too soft. If you prefer chewier, you can opt for the knife-shaved or the flat, wide noodles. You can also watch them make your magical noodles fresh behind the glass in their open kitchen.\n\nMy favorite items include: \n-Szechuan beef noodle \n-spicy pork ribs noodle\n-Dan Dan noodle\n-Mongolian beef chow mein \n-House special fried rice\n-spicy wonton\n-homemade style cucumber\n-sweet and sour black fungus salad (yes that says fungus)\n-Chinese beef burrito  \n-steamed chicken with chili sauce  \n\nThe food and service are amazing, and the prices are very reasonable. Heck, you even get a show out of it. What more can you ask for?
