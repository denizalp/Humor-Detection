I come to Ncounter a lot, I'm such a fan of this cute urban place on mill ace. After yet another amazing meal, I decided to tell and share with others this fantastic Tempe Find. My personal favorite thing is the chipotle egg burrito. It is delicious and nutritious. But don't think you have to try the burrito, they have a range of others including waffles, pancakes & french toast all loaded with fresh fruit and other fun toppings, they also have non breakfast as well like tasty salads, sandwiches, soups and a huge selection of hand crafted beverages. Not is even the best part, they have dog friendly patio :) so if you haven't been here you need to make it your next stop!
