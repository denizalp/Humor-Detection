I'm surprised to see someone else noted in their review that they worked around people's allergies. I told them I was allergic to wheat (or gluten free) and they said they didn't have anything for me to eat. I'm not knocking them or anything, Just wanted to put that out there for others with a similar situation. Smelled good and looked clean, though. Love that neighborhood, too.
