I'm re-writing my review. I had a completely different experience this time around using another cleaner. \n\nIf you can, request Chastity!\nSuper, super nice! Thorough, efficient and exceeded my list of expectations. She was incredibly pleasant. I can't imagine having anyone else come clean. (I'm requesting her next time!)\n\nMy apartment looks and smells wonderful. Ya'll can come visit now.\n\nGiven my less than stellar experience last time (see previous review) I wrote out an incredibly granular checklist. When Chastity arrived, we had a high level walk thru (ha! I'm still using the walking sticks:) and she then toured my apartment to assess the damage. (Hey! Blame the sticks, not my grubby hands.)\n\nWe periodically would stop to review the list to see how much was left. When I say granular, I mean *every* single low level item was on there. (\"Clean light switches.\" \"Clean windowsill - optional if time allows\" \"Clean inside of toilet.\" Clean outside of toilet.\" \"Clean sink\" and so on.)\n\nAs I had asked for some items to run in parallel, I would prompt those. (Basically, that means my laundry. YES! I had some help doing laundry.) \n\nThis is different than other cleaning services I've used in the past. You may find it helpful to more micro manage the process. Doing so I was incredibly satisfied.\n\nYipee!\n\nUPDATE:\nI forgot to note...You can provide a review via Homejoy.com about your cleaner. This helps for internal management. e.g. You can specify if you'd want the same cleaner again. Also (!) muy importante: Tips can be added online! I tipped for excellent service!
