I have been a patient with Dr. McVey for over 25 years.  She is more than a doctor, a true longtime family friend.  The entire staff here is amazing and I would not think of trusting my eyes to anyone else.  She always has a current selection of frames and I look forward to seeing her annually for my exam.  You will not be disappointed, an amazing doctor..
