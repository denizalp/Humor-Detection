Best Mexican food I've had in a VERY LONG TIME. I've tired several Mexican places in Henderson and they come no where close to the yumminess of food from this place. We all had a variety of their fajitas so can only comment on that for now. Their rice was delicious and their bean dip with chips was out of control! Definitely going back.
