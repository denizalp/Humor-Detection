There's a lot to like about Style Encore.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, the entire store is organized and it's easy to find what you're looking for (instead of digging and searching at other resale shops).  They offer a great selection of all types of clothes, shoes and accessories.  I agree with the first reviewer - the prices do seem a touch high; $50+ for used designer jeans is steep in my opinion, but they do offer clearance sales throughout the year.
