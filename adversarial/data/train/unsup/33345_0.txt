Great little motel.  A bit dated, but very clean.  Staff was very accommodating and helpful.  The breakfast was well maintained (the eggs were a bit weird).  But all in all, a great experience.  Easy access from the 10 with more than ample parking for large vehicles.  We will be back if ever in Phx.
