I stayed here on an overnight staycation in Phoenix. I was glad I did.\n\nThe entry way was gorgeous. A good place to lounge with a book or laptop and just relax. The Networks sports bar is attached the the lobby near the registration desk and is a convenient place for a drink. \n\nThe staff was very courteous but I wish they had reminded me of the rotating restaurant they had on the top floor. I did not know about it till later. I will revisit just to be there. The two bed room I got was very clean. It had a mini fridge, which was very convenient as I had some dinner to store. \n\nThe shower was a pleasant experience as the shower head had some nice settings and it had two curtains which made it look very classy.\n\nThe little shampoo was also of more than acceptable quality, good since I forgot mine. It was probably among the best I have sampled from hotels. \n\nLastly in order to give you an idea how well of a service I got, I accidentally ordered a movie I had not intention of watching. I called immediately although somewhat embarrassed, it was after all a porno, but they took if off. I literally did not even watch a second of the movie, but good luck trying to convince the downstairs of that, or the reading audience of this post for that matter :? \n\nHave a great stay
