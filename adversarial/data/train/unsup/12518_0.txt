Today, was my first time trying waxing in the city. The customer service was amazing. I was welcomed and greeted right away. My waxer was amazing and patient. I loved how she warned me since it was my first time there she advices that the strips were shorter than any other waxing place I've been too. Also that it would take a little longer as well. I did the Brazilian wax and they sure take you to trip to Brazil! Lol
