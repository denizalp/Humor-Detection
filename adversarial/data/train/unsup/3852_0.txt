This place has been around for a long time. Ever since I lived in Phoenix it was here and I know it was here at least 20 years before that. So I think it is safe to say it has been here 50 years plus.\nIt used to be called Christown Mall, which I actually like better. \nThe parking is a bit on the crazy side here. As if it is the only mall in town. Which of course it is not.\nThey do have a lot of stores inside. Penney's being one of the main ones. There is a few name brand chains in here,but mostly one hit wonders.\n It is on the less expensive side as well. The clientele can be a bit shady at times.\nAs they say in New York, ladies watch your purses. \n They used to have Santa Claus there which I liked when my kids were small , plus the giving tree, but in the last few years,no.\nI still go here, they have a Pets Mart, Costco, Target, and Walmart.   Walgreens, radio Shack and so on.\nit is not all bad, But, I am always on guard when I am there. Which does not make my shopping day pleasant.
