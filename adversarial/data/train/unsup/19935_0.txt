I really wanted to enjoy this place.  First off, the place is adorable, very original n fun.. Great for kids and adults.. They have some good beer selections n the patio is fun. The food on the other hand was a major disappointment. We ordered the herb and goat cheese tots and beer cheese to start with.  Both were served cold and u can tell they were never heated properly to begin with. The tots must have been old because the cheese on top never even melted on them, and the herb stuff looked and tasted like bird doodie. The beer cheese soup must be sitting back in the kitchen at room temp because it was cold by the time i got it and so was the limp bacon hanging off of it.. The worst and scariest part was being served a cold prime rib dip and jus, after it came back reheated, it was just a soggy greasy mess. Im really sad about the whole ordeal because Michael the server was a sweetheart n totally deserves a great place to serve good craft food at. I left totally sick feeling and mad i give outlying places like this a chance. Why cant suburbia have decent food.. Back to the city i go, after i throw up...
