I am a thirty eight years old. I just moved here from Nevada and am using my passport as temporary ID. I did not assume I would need it to buy sex toys. I was refused for having an obviously legitimate but expired ID. At 38 years old. Fuck this place with a hammer. It is genuinely creepy, requiring an intercom entrance, has threatening signs posted in the parking lot and generally feels like it is the first stop for newly released ex cons. No thanks.\n\nAnd why are all sex shops now sorry excuses for aspiring potheads? Can I now load up on bath salts and have a psychotic break while simultaneously working out the kinks in my new 50 Shades of Grey faux S&M discovery set? I could.\n\nOr...\n\nI can just go to A Woman's Touch and not feel like I need a Silkwood shower upon exiting.
