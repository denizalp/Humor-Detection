Always enjoy the Venetian. Very spacious room and good amenities. Was just there for a conference and enjoyed the stay. Plus, they have the new Palazzo tower and shops which seemed very nice. Bonus - the new Wizard of Oz machine... Seems to pay out very well - particularly the machine just on the edge next to the elevators. Good luck!
