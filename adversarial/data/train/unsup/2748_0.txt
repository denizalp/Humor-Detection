Went there today to compare a Lexus 200t 4 door to a MB my wife and I are thinking about purchasing, however today when I arrived there was nobody to greet me or to help me. The first person the receptionist called was too busy, so she made a general announcement that someone needed help over the loud speaker. The salesperson who approached me shook my hand and listened I thought to me as I told him what I would like to do. He then proceeded over to a showcar  that was not like the car outside that I wanted to see and drive. He wanted me to set in it and told me it was just like the car outside - sure it is. I told him that I did not want to set in the showcar as it was not the car I was going to buy. I had to get persistent with him that I was not going to sit in that car. I had enough at that point and told him this was unpleasant, I then whet to shake his hand to say have good day and he would not shake my hand. I then thanked him for his ability to be pleasant and help the customer. I was having a tough day, I had just left my doctor with a skin cancer diagnosis and the thought of getting behind the wheel of a Lexus might cheer me up, plus I could compare it to the MB we will  purchase now. Ya know the Sales manager at Gilbert MB came out and shook our hands when it was over 105 outside and the salesman went out of his way in the heat to help us find a car we loved at MB. This was a very unpleasant experience today. I thought I could expect more from a Lexus dealership.
