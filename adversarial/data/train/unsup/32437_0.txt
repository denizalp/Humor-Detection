The friendliest, most capable staff I've encountered. While I was there three cool things happened. \n1. They were giving away free bagged gingerbread lunches. I don't know what that meant, but they were definitely lunches and totally free. \n2. I found Alex & Ani Bracelets there with a super qualified salesperson who knew ALL about what each signified. \n3. This one lady -- apparently a regular -- walked in and said \"I need six gifts for my hairdressers\" and without missing a beat the staff member had curated holiday gifts for the woman. \n\nThe shop is neat, organized and has a wide variety of collections. Definitely check it out!
