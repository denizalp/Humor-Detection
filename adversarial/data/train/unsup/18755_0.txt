I had an appointment this morning to correct the colour. \n\nThe colour on my hair turned out to be the colour I wanted.\nHowever, Nicola let me know what I wanted was a lower balayage so she did a reverse balayage with a darker colour.\nI'm a happy camper and will return to Evoke in the future to get other services done.\n\nWhat I really appreciated about this salon is they do care about your experience. \n____________\n(   \\\/  \\\/  \\\/  )\n\/                \/\n\/                \/\n\/                \/ \n\/                \/\n\nWas what I had\n\n\n______________\n(   \\   \/  \\  \/  \\  \/  )\n\/   \\ \/   \\  \/   \\ \/  \/\n\/    \\\/    \\\/     \\\/  \/\n\/                      \/\n\nWas what I wanted and got.
