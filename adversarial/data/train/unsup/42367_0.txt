Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting \"TexMex\" glop;\n\nMumbly, unengaged waiter;\n\nClueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees\non plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked us\nperfunctorily for our patronage;\n\nWe're from the Texas Hill Country;\ndown there, we jail critters \nwho serve up grub this bad,\nfor their own protection.\n\nNever, never, NEVER again\n(Back to Yard House for real food)
