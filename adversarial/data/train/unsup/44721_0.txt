Once again the disappointment and lack of respect and consideration of customers time becomes a major issue.\nI have not been to this establishment in 3 years.  The first time we went food and service outstanding.  The owner Bubba was there.  The next two times it was awful.  Like the last time, only 3 years later, service an attitude of server was awful.  She was too busy to greet me.  I sat at bar unwanted on for 5 minutes.  She looked up at me and said I will be with you in a minute as she was adding up some old checks.  Finally came over and took my order and got me a beer.  A half hour later I asked where my food was and she said it's coming soon.  I told her to forget it and I will pay for my beer.   She overcharged me for my beer and I complained about wasting over a half hour of my life as I retrieved my change.  I told her she should be ashamed of herself for letting a customer sit so long unattended and that I will never be back.  Her answer?  Told me to go F myself!  I never  cussed at her just told her how I felt in clean words.   Funny, the other waitress told me as I was leaving she didn't blame me.  Never again!   Never ever!
