The 2 star rating goes out to the \"customer service.\"\n\nWanted to take my daughter out for breakfast and not just a typical IHOP joint. I've been to Hash House in San Diego and had such a great experience that I wanted to finally check it out here in Vegas. \n\nWhat a disappointment :( I don't want to be the mean reviewer but my experience needs to be addressed. As we arrived, I was told its going to be a 30 min wait. OK fine. I understand given the fact that its Saturday morning and its a busy time for them. Got our table and order taken 15 mins later. Then, it seriously was over 30 mins and our food hasn't arrived yet?! Keep in mind, my daughter and I only ordered a a tractor combo (2 eggs, bacon, and a butterscotch almond pancake) & french toast for us to share! Given the patient and understanding person I am...I held my tongue. So what got me was when the people who sat around me started getting there food already! BUT we got there waaaaay before they did!!! what the?! I finally asked the server if our food was coming too?! He said yes, its coming out soon. *slaps forehead* If only he would of kept me updated if it was going to be awhile or not, instead of ignoring me. \n\nThe sad part was... after 15 mins into eating... the server handed us the bill!  WOW. REALLY!!? It took forever to wait to get seated, for the food to come out, and SO QUICKLY to rush us out!? No words to say. Customer service is terrible. I suggest not going to Hash House in the mornings on weekends, unless you have the time and patience to go through all of that especially in this summer heat.
