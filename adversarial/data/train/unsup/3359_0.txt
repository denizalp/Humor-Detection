I gave Ninki another try. I met CUTE! Chinese Girl in the Financial District. \"Where do you want to eat?\" \"All you can eat sushi?\" The way her face lights up when you say \"all you can eat sushi\" never gets old.\n\nIt's on the pricey side for AYCE sushi although it does have sashimi. $23 isn't, I guess, out of line when sashimi is an option. 15% gratuity is added automatically, even for a party of 2. I might have tipped more based on nice service (you seem to have 3 people working your table). You do need to inspect the bill closely to even see the 15% was added. \n\nThe food itself. Meh.
