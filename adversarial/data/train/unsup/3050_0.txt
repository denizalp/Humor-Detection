At first glance, this place, a random, quirky and charming vintage shop on lovely Clifton Boulevard, strikes you as kinda small. A cool assortment of everything you would want in a vintage store, sure, but a little small. That was before I noticed the staircase going down to the basement. Like a lot of stores with basements around town, this is going to be tiny, right? WRONG. The basement is crammed to the gills with furniture, books, clothing, old Star Wars toys, records, hats, scarves, Playboys from the 1980s, and about a zillion other sweet things. And it curves around like a maze revealing other cool tchochkes. Seriously, I wouldn't bring a small child here, because if you let him or her run around, you may never find them again.
