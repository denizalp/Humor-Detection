\"Dingy\", \"ugliest\", and \"filthy\". Yes, fellow Yelpers, your comrades-in-arms have not led you astray here. This place is a dump, but something about its shabby-chic thing kind of authenticates its food as the real deal. None of this \"restaurant makeover\" nouveau-moderne faux-mexicano or exotic Indian crap! This is New York Subway and the name is totally misleading but it don't matter cause they are keeping it so REAL.\n\nThere are a ton of things on the menu - lamb, beef, chicken, even some random butter chicken rolls - I always just go in for the lamb or chicken, Medium spicy. Given, there are variations of both meats, but they've never asked us to specify, so it's just plain old, \"uhh... one lamb, and one chicken, please). Even with the size, they kinda just give us the up-down and somehow just correctly determine what we'd be happy with. And they always come out correct - as if we'd know any better - but it's part of the Realness. \n\nTo come in here expecting a fat ball of a burrito a la Bandidos is barking up the wrong tree. These burritos are more torpedo-shaped and are spiced with just the right amount of Indian\/Asian flavourings. Also - way cheaper than aforementioned Bandidos.\n\nGenuine, mostly friendly folks (they even let me duck into the back to wash my hands once), and a definite staple for a satisifying grab and go in that weird block of Queen West.
