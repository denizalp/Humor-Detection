The best part about Chase Field is that nobody goes to the games. They average about 17K midweek and this opens up alot of options for smart people. There are scalpers (can we call them that if they are selling below face value?) galore outside hawking $5 and $10 tickets. Once you get that done, you can pretty much sit wherever you want. The ushers are old and usually have their backs turned and down we go into those \"expensive\" seats. They have $4 beer, so open your eyes and stop complaining about high beer prices. The food here is a a joke, nothing exciting, just standard crap, unless you find your way into the lower club levels where a great high priced buffet resides. The AC was cranking tonite and if you pay for parking at this stadium, check your head. Chase has boatloads of free spots in the neighborhoods and you just need to find them or ask me.
