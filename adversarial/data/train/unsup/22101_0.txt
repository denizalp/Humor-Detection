The Blake is like an old pair of shoes inside a new shoe box.\n\nThe paint is new. The carpet is new. The elevators are old. The phone in my room didn't work. The ice is on 3 floors of 16. The furniture is new and cool looking, if rather cheap. There is a flat screen TV. But it doesn't get any channels. There is a wifi signal but I can't seem to connect to it. There is an iPod dock, thank gawd. \n\nI will say this: it is a hotel. Not awful. But avoid it if you can.
