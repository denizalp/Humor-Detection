Worst service imaginable. \n\n-Had my beer glass (empty) taken away, and not asked if I would like another (which I would have) - simply because the bar had run out of the glasses in which they were serving their $3 special - domestic drafts. \n-Fries are shoestring potatoes, unless you pay $9 for 'hand cut' (doubt it)\n-Nachos were a mockery of any nacho, if I've ever seen one. A hungry homeless person would have most likely rejected these even if they were free. There was nothing homemade about the salsa except that they put it in a plastic cup for you. \n-We were legitimately ignored for at least 15-20 minutes while 4 bartenders struggled hard to serve probably 100 or so people, give or take. I was a bartender. 100 people is not that many. \n\nI blame this on several things, not necessarily terrible service staff (although they really didn't handle the situations well) - there is one computer at the bar. You cannot expect 4 bartenders, plus a barback and a \"manager\" to be ringing drinks and food orders into one computer. \n\nThe service bar was a cluster as people were ordering from the service bar and she was getting behind on pouring for tables - I would never order a beer at a table, as 3\/4 of them that went out were also 3\/4 full. \n\nTop it off ... the soap in the bathroom was in the industrial packaging (you know, the box with the bag in it, with a tube sticking out) and not in a dispenser, so a girl I didn't know and I had to take turns squeezing it into each other's hands. And it was dirty as sin. Worse than a porta, honestly. \n\nDefinitely doesn't deserve a second shot.
