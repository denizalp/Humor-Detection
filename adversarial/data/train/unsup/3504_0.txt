The chicken pieces are tiny.  The special half-half chicken, (which is supposed to be one chicken split into two with two sauces of choice) suspiciously comes with only one chicken wing and one drumstick.\n\nWe had ordered two half-half specials and both only came with one wing and drumstick each, so I doubt it was a one-off.\n\nThe batter isn't fluffy.  The chicken is kind of dry.\nIt overall lacks any taste besides chicken and salt.\n\nThe salad is just shaved cabbage with a bit of thousand island or ranchy dressing drizzled over it. \n\nDid I mention that all this was at a rather steep $28?\n\nThe only thing sadder than this is the mental image of a one-winged, one-legged chicken running around before being made into this disappointing fried chicken. *tear*
