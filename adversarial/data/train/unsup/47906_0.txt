The food was way overpriced and didn't taste that great. $17 for a burger plus $5 for a side. Crab cake was salty and $16. Wine was $14... wife had a chopped salad with chicken and they forgot the dressing. why? You need to revise your menu with better items (pizza and ribs are good for 900 degrees) and reduce pricing on drinks and food soon or you will be going the way of the dinosaur quicker than you think. It's early enough to make these changes and win back a big portion of customers but I have a feeling your rent was so high due to the TI you did and your margins are barely clearing.
