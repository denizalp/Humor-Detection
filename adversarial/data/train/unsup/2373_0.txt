I've been he here on numerous occasions now, and have not yet been disappointed. Usually when I come in, the owner himself is working, so I can't say anything about the staff. The owner has always been super friendly with me, and chats with me while preparing my order. \n\nThe portions are monstrous to the point I almost can't finish one, tonight I was super hungry though and was able to wolf down a large steak, I'll be digesting this for the rest of the night, burning calories ;). \n\nEverything is prepared fresh in store and I find it to be greatly superior to the competition, this is definitely our go to place for burritos. \n\nJust opened a new location in Liberty Village, so if you're in either area it's worth a stop in, you will be full after this great fresh tasting burrito.
