Even before I moved to Ohio, my friends in California have told me about the \"best ice cream ever\" that is Jeni's ice cream. So I had to try it, right? Words cannot describe how ridiculously delicious Jeni's ice cream is!  Not only are the flavors extremely unique, but they will entice your taste buds like never before! Like seriously, your taste buds will transcend to a level of blissfulness. \n\nThe first time I came here, I probably sampled every single flavor (ain't no shame here). With $5 for 2 scoops and $6 for 3 scoops, you gotta make sure you're getting the best of the best! My all time favorite flavors are: brambleberry crisp, goat cheese with red cherries, and brown butter almond brittle. Holy cow, I can't even begin to describe how amazing each flavor is. You just gotta try it for yourself! \n\nI'm just glad Jeni's ice cream is so far away from me, or else I'd be eating ice cream three meals a day and gaining a bazillion pounds.
