the new bartender is horrible watery drinks, bad listening skills giving me the wrong drink rushing to nothing he didn't back the bar properly leaving beer bottles and shot glasses galore until the other bar tender came and cleaned it looking dismayed. He is kinda cute but no thanks the ladies here make good drinks stay away fron this guy I've been coming here as I'm here now for 3 years this is the first time I'll be leaving after my 1st cocktail.
