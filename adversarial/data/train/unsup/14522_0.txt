Well now that I am eating Vegan visiting familiar cities and states have become new adventures because I have to find Vegan options. Well this is the first establishment the wife and I tried in Las Vegas and we were not disappointed. The owner of the establishment is Cindy Violette who is a former World Series of Poker champion back in 2004.....so I found that interesting. So when we walked in we seated ourselves and waited about 10 minutes before our waitress came to our table. The establishment was very clean and the customer service was good.\n\nNow to the food.....I had the Rise n Shine Platter which came with Seitan Sausage.....which was surprisingly delicious......Yukon Gold Potatoes.....sauteed veggies......Tofu Scramble with Daiya Cheese.....and Toast. My wife had the Sunrise Superman which consisted of a BLT Sandwich......home fries and Sauteed Veggies. We had to wait 10 more minutes after we finished our meal to get the check but that was fine.....LOL!!!!!! The food was awesome and for 25 bucks for the both of us it was definitely worth it.
