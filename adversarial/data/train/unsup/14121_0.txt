Tried to attend this establishment on a Saturday night. Upon walking in the door the man behind the bar asked if we needed to use the washroom. \"Let me guess.....where are the washrooms?\" What type of question is that? When we said we would like to order a few drinks we were told that they were no longer serving alcohol (as he pours a beer for one of the numerous customers still sitting a the bar). The man behind the bar was extremely rude and because of that I will never go back. Also, if the guy behind the bar starts to brag and say he looks like George Clooney....tell him the truth.
