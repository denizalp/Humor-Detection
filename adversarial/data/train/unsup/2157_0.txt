A tad pricey for a dim sum place but plenty of great food options! I ordered around 10 dishes and my total came out to be around $50ish. Compared to NYC dimsum, this place isn't ... that great. What makes up for it though is the great service and quickness in which the food arrives! I highly recommend ordering the fried sticky rice. I never had sticky rice that was \"fried\" but now I'm on a search for that in NYC. I DO NOT recommend the xiao long bao because it was a measly portion of 3 mini bao's that had the flavor of cardboard. My boyfriend liked the egg plant stuffed with fish paste dish so I recommend that. Lastly, they charge $1.00 per person for tea (which surprised me because in NYC tea comes for free!) Nevertheless, they have many tea options (black, red, chrysanthemum etc.) They're open until about 10:30pm, so if you're craving late night dimsum this is the place to go.
