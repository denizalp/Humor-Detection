Tea tastes very fresh! Not overly creamy.\n\nWas asked what they recommended for a first timer at Coco, and they recommended the \"2 Ladies\", which is their black milk tea with tapioca and pudding. Got regular ice and 70% sugar. I would definitely reorder this!\n\nOrdered the mango slush with sago. Didn't adjust the sugar content and it was sweet. Next time I would do 50% sugar. The sago as a topping option was nice as not a lot of places offer sago.\n\nThey also accept Vicinity points. Buy 10 drinks, get 1 free. \n\nWill come back and try their other flavours.
