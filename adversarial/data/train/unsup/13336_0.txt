Edwins is an outstanding restaurant. Everything is five star from the service, and decor to the cuisine. Edwins features a french inspired menu.  They also have vegan options. Our server, Jason did a fantastic job. He was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. Jason made great recommendations too. At no time were our glasses less than full or our table without bread.  Edwins is located in picturesque Shaker Square so there are shops and things to do after your meal. Valet parking available.
