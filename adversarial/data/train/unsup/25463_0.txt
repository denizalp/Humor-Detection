Best Middle Eastern sit-down restaurant around.  Friendly, family-run BYOB restaurant.  I was concerned when they moved away from ASU, but they place always seems full of loyal customers.  \n\nUPDATE: Really sad they closed!  I would love to have said goodbye and thank you to the owners.  They made us always feel like we were guests in their home.
