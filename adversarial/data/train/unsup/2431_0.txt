So I want to start that my man and I didn't have crepes so I'm a little biased. I had an omelette with potatoes. First, the cafe is super cute. Definitely a French vibe and it's location not right on the main drag in the Old Port area makes this a neighborhood gem and looking at others devour their crepes definitely a solid spot. The omelette was good. Nothing crazy, or anything you'd see on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives but just a small omelette with some fresh ingredients. As someone on a diet, I was stoked to have some roasted potatoes to accompany the omelette as advertised on the menu, but instead they were deep fried (womp womp). I sampled a few for the sake of this review (the things I do for Yelp) and they were of course awesome but again, these home fries were deep fried. I didn't eat the bread but it was thick cuts of fresh bread. Carbs, hmmmmmmmm.\n\nOverall a definite solid spot for a moderate priced lunch. I'd come again when I can eat some crepes and those fried potatoes!
