Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this bar a try one night in Scottsdale.  It was one of a few that were open late on a mid-week night and looked appealing.  The restaurant\/bar looks like it can be hopping on busy nights, but on this particular night (Wed), it was slow.\n\nI saddled up to the bar and asked for a menu.  I asked the bartender if they had any IPA's and he suggested the Odell brewing company IPA.  I went for it and asked him what he would recommend I try.  Since  it was considered 'late night', there was a special menu and he suggested the Pork Loin Sliders (3 Sliders with Pepper Jack, Poblano Serrano Mayonnaise, and Tortilla Encrusted Onion Rings).  It sounded awesome, so I went with it.\n\nThe IPA was really tasty and hit the spot.  After a few minutes, the Pork Loin Sliders came out.  I spread the Poblano Serrano Mayo on them and then for fun added some Fries on the Sliders.  I took a small bite out of the first Slider and it was awesome!  The Pork Loin was moist & juicy and the Poblano Serrano Mayo was the perfect compliment....adding a nice bite to the flavor.  I devoured the Sliders within a few minutes and then sat back and enjoyed the rest of my IPA.\n\nI really enjoyed this place and would like to return on my next trip to Scottsdale.
