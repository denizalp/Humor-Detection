I adore JoBot mainly for the building. The converted house and neighborhood feeling is so cute. Whenever we visit Arizona we often find ourselves back at JoBot to meet with friends. \n\nUpon walking up to the house, there were at least six people scattered across the front lawn with bright blue hair. It's that kind of crowd.\n\nThe savory crêpes are fairly good. The chorizo and egg is my preferred order.\n\nThe service was kind of weird on our last visit, but thankfully the food and drinks are consistent. \n\nThe guy at the counter was initially nice and let our large group take plenty of time to look over the menu and order. We all ordered and then asked him where we should wait for the food since we were in the way of the staff and bathroom entrance. There was no space for us indoors. He told us we could wait outside and get a table so we did.\n\nHe shortly arrived with our crêpes. However, he didn't bring us any silverware. We don't eat crêpes with our hands unless they are served in paper to go cones. We aren't animals! lol \n\nHe also didn't bring any of the coffee drinks out. He just quickly shoved the crêpes onto the splintery picnic table and started to walk away. We stopped him and asked if the iced coffees were also ready and he indifferently told us to go get them ourselves from the indoor counter. Being half served was really strange. Either bring out everything we need or politely ask us to come inside and pick up all our food and drinks from the counter. Weird, just like the crowd.
