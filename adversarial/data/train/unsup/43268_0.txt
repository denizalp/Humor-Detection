First time visiting, and I always visit a self-proclaimed italian restaurant, order the same item . Oh, so first off the menu is VERY limited, and is displayed. You get soup or salad, bread, and cappucino with each order. The sauce was ok, but didnt think that penne pasta was a proper type of pasta to go with the eggplant but ok.The eggplant was very thin, and well breaded, smothered in mozzarella. My husband ordered the salmon dish. **Lights are super dimmed, but your eyes adjust.**\nPro: place was clean, cozy, and you get a full course. The salmon with garlic and butter was delicious (but still salty).\nCons: food is extremely SALTY...we both felt like it was packaged and heated rather than cooked fresh. Eggplant is a 2 out of 10. Dry, too much bread, and very salty. Just cheese, bread, and salt :\/ Their soup was ok. Nothing extraordinary. The salad was bland. \nNot the best spot to dine at in Vegas, in my humble opinion.
