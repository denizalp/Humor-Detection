Today was my first time eating at American deli. I ordered the cheese steak, wings, and fries. The wife ordered the same thing without the wings.\n\n As we ordered this, the cashier was awesome. She was very personable and appeared to love her job. I didn't get to talk to any other staff members but they seemed upbeat and worked well with each other. \n\nThe restaurant was very clean and well kept. The seating was adequate but i could see it being uncomfortable if there was a good number of people in there. \n\nNow here comes the negative aspects. My wife did not care too much for her cheese steak. She was not a big fan of the type of cheese used and thought it tasted a bit off. As for myself, i thought it was just \"ok\". I would have preferred a bit more cheese. \n\nI liked the fries but i made the mistake of telling the cashier to add the seasoning salt to both plates of fries. It was decent in my opinion, but my wife absolutely hated it. \n\nMy wings were decent although i wouldn't order the lemon pepper type again. I'm more of a naked wing type of guy. \n\nIn summation, America Deli did not wow me. It wasn't terrible by any means, but definitely not the best. But this is just my humble opinion.
