The No. 1 reason I eat at Panda Express is the availability of fresh-cooked vegetables. I especially LOVE the fresh broccoli, my favorite vegetable. However, I do have a few criticisms of the vegetables at Panda Express. FIRST, the carrots are obviously frozen crinkle-cut and are completely unappetizing. I separate them out and do not eat them. SECOND, the sliced onions are almost always overcooked and slimy, so I separate them and do not eat them, either. On occasion, the String Bean Chicken has the same problem - brown, overcooked string beans. The cabbage is always great - it stands up to high heat stir frying! The sliced zucchini, however, is hit and miss. Sometimes they are bright, firm, and appetizing. Other times, they are mushy and broken down, so you guessed it -- I discard them, as well, when that happens. On balance, Panda Express is a great value and one of the few places one can find fresh cooked vegetables. I juust wish the other vegetables were as good as the broccoli & cabbage!
