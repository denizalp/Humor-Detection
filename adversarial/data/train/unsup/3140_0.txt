The atmosphere is aesthetically pleasing with their murals and wooden designs. This has been my top location to come by ever since they opened last week. With their convenient location it's easy to stop by on the way to work or on my way home. \nThey have a lot of items besides just poke bowl and burrito on their menu, which helps them stand out from numerous poke locations around town. \nThis place is the best when you want a full meal but don't want to feel heavy or bloated. The ingredients they have taste a lot more fresh than other poke locations in Vegas. They only have three sauces but all of them help accompany the dish instead of drenching the sashimi with them. For me poke bowl tastes the best when it's flavorful and FRESH instead of biting into 70%sauce each bite.
