My co-worker and I came here for lunch since it is closed to work. I was highly disappointed at their food and its services. When I first arrived, I told the server multiple times that I am new and have never been there. She didn't seem to care a bit or bother introducing their menus to me. The only thing she asked was if we were ready to order or not. Finally, I've decided to order from their lunch menu \"Side by side Pasta\" ($8). I picked a meat ball with Penne with a small side of drinks. Total came to $13....which is pricy even in downtown area. If the dish is $8...does it mean the small drink is $3???? \n\nThe meatball is tasteless and the Penne is cold. I'm not joking you....my entire dish isn't even warm. I couldn't even finish half of it and ended up throwing the whole thing away. Needless to say, my stomach started hurting few hours later (and I didn't eat anything else all morning). The only reason I give it 2 star is because I do like their ice tea and the restaurant is pretty clean. \n\nI will certainly definitely never going to come back here again.
