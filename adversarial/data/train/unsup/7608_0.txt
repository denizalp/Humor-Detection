Carowinds is a theme park located on the SC\/NC border, inside the Charlotte Metropolitan Area.  \n\nIf you have been to a Disney theme park, you'll notice differences here, some good, some bad.  For one thing, admission price is $40 at the park entrance, $35 for advance online tickets, and only $19.95 for kids.  Inside the park,  you'll notice that you're not being ripped off as much as Disney.  Want to lock up your belongings while you ride?  It's free.   The park is clean, and employees friendly.  There are several great rides; wooden coasters, inverted coasters, water rides, and even a water park inside.  But, you'll notice that the atmosphere is not as spectacular as Disney, there are no special effects along the rides, just coasters riding along a track.\n\nWhen arriving , you'll be tempted to jump into the large line for the Borg Assimilator roller coaster at the park entrance. However, this line seems to be 45 minutes to an hour wait, while many other coasters are 15 minutes or less.  On my first trip, I rode all of the other coasters until I was nauseous.  \n\nDuring late October, Carowinds hosts \"Scarowinds.\"  In addition to riding the coasters at night, \"Scarowinds\"  adds haunted houses, smoke effects, and hundreds of scary characters walking around the park at night, trying to scare you.  This is pretty entertaining, but only lasts 5 hours in its entirety.  I rode only 2 rides during my Scarowinds trip here because the lines were extremely long.  \n\nIn all, it's a great park, and well worth the admission price.
