Very nice and quiet steakhouse off the strip. I loved how they had a special elevator that led to the actual restaurant. (I got lost, but it's literally to the right of the casino when you enter.) It really felt like we were entering some kind of secret place. Made reservations and were seated promptly. Our server, Rhonda? was great! She was very attentive and gave really good suggestions. Kept it simple since I was in a rush, got the house salad which was delicious, and the filet mignon which was also pretty good! I didn't really like the veggies that it came with but oh well. Oh and the cheesecake was excellent!!! Very big o slice too. I could only eat so much since it was so creamy and yummy. All in all a great experience! \n\nBtw, I didn't ask to be seated by the windows but I could see from where I was sitting that it had a pretty nice view of the city! So if you do come ask to be seated by the window for a more romantic feel.
