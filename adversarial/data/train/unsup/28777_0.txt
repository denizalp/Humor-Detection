I remember the first time I ate at a Pita Jungle was probably 4 years ago.  I never heard of it.  I was with a coworker and a vendor.  We just wrapped up a meeting and it was close.  I tried their Tuna and Hummus and had a Shwarma.  I was hooked after that.  \nWe ate here after a long week.  Since we have to travel back and forth and this place was on the way.   I ordered the Tuna and Hummus for a appetizer and it was good.  I ordered the Pesto Turkey Lovash with out cheese or tomatoes.  It was good as always.  I like this place a lot and the service and food has been consistently good.  I tend to stick with my favourite menu items too.  I have tried a couple of different things.  I will do the pizza on a pita with chicken, PLTW, Shwarma and the Mediterranean salad with chicken too.  The good is always good.
