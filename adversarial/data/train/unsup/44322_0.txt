Over 30 dollars per person! You would think now that the servers don't get your beverages they would drop the price.  I seen this old couple struggling with their drink and spilled about half of it, before they got to their table. Pretty soon they are going to give you an apron and have you pick up your own plates. Even Station Casinos gets your drinks. Plus the quality of the food is going down. Plenty of better buffets out there.
