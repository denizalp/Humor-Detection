Sim! Sim! (Yes! Yes!)\n\nEu amo grelhado frango! (I love grilled chicken!)\n\nEu amo quente molho! (I love hot sauce)\n\nPollo Loco Churasqueria really serves up nice tender chicken. My extra spicy request was fullfilled when my chicken was drowned in this orange, hot sauce.. remind me of Todasco sauce but not as sour tasting! Yes, I ask for spicy!\n\nThis is really a takeout spots so we ended up eating in the car. The 1\/4 combo that nice man gave me is more like a 1\/2 combo?? Maybe he feels sorry for me for my poor attempt of speaking in Portuguese!
