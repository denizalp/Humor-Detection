Today was my first time in this wonderful eyeglass\/ optometrist boutique.\nThe owner is very personable, and helpful.  He was more interested in a satisfied customer, than anything else. Most stores only care about making money, but J Crimi cares about making customers happy.  There is a lovely assortment of unique and high end glasses, and they can accomodate all price ranges. They are great on repairs, which was the purpose for my visit. I will be going back for all my eyewear needs from now on. I am very happy to give him five stars and urge you to try the shop out , just to see if you feel the same as I do.
