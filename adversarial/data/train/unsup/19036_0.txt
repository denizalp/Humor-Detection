It's beautiful and there's a decent variety of music. I could give this place more stars if I solely judged it by the whole easily walking in, no line, free drinks, and everything else that happened nonsense....but I won't. I remember walking in immediately being annoyed at how ridiculously packed it was. And that's all I remember :\/
