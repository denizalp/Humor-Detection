The 17th Ave outlet of Fuji Yama, based in the basement of the Devonshire building, is a bit of a mess in so many ways.  The decor, minimalist at best, had tables that reminded me so much of hospital cafeterias.  The rolls, while adequate, seem to be a bit uninspired.  Service was average as well, with little attention except when we either received food or had to chase down people for something or another (like chopsticks).  I would write more, but how can I go through everything without sounds like I'm dragging the place through the mud.  Basically, the whole experience was just middling at best.  \nOh, their application of coupons and reservations are pretty much absolute as a warning people.  No reservation, no coupons allowed.  While I wasn't affected, the table behind me were.  Considering that the resto was actually 1\/2 empty at the time, their absolutely insistance with no flexibility on using a coupon without reservation probably lost them a few customers for life.  The things I was hearing from that table were definately not very complimentary, and again, the place was 1\/2 EMPTY.  Honestly, this treatment was just embarassing and portrayed this place in a truly negative light.
