Was disappointed had a party there for 100 ppls they served your choose of Green Chili or Chicken ,rice & beans. Not even 1 hour later they ran out of the chicken! And it turned out to be about 60 to about 70 ppls that came. The beans and rice were very bland. And they served very small portions.   The lady kept coming over and telling us it was to loud. First it was the music was to loud then it was that we were to loud! What a disappointment! They did have Mariachis that were really good and they even came to our side and sang Happy Birthday to the birthday girl and sang a few more songs. The overall I wouldn't do another party here..
