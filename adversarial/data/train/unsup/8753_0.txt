I've visited the Beverly Hills location and wasn't really that impressed, so I didn't have high hopes for this location, especially because I think almost every restaurant on the strip is overrated. Not this one....\nWe came here for my General Manager's birthday and I was blown away. Of course the food was exemplary and worthy of the Wolfgang Puck brand. My GM knows the GM here so we were treated to some extra personal service. We just let the staff pick whatever and bring it to us. I think the three course dinner ended up being a 7 courser. I didn't really decline anything this night. For example, I'm not a big fan of oysters but you damn right I ate my share. \nI also have to say, their wine and champagne selection lived up to their food standards. Perfect matching. The staff was very knowledgeable and explained every detail to us about both the food and alcohol. \nThis is one of the few places on the strip that I would actually make an effort to go eat at when the opportunity presents itself.
