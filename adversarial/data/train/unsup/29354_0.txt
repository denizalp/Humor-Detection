First time at this location. At first it's hard to find it due to its location in the Plaza (it's at the end behind). I came with my family and my experience was better than expected. The service was great compared to the other franchise. Very quick, friendly and came oftentimes to check up to see if we needed anything else. The food is somewhat more flavourful compared to the other locations and seemed more fresh. Atmosphere is calm and decently quiet with a nice and clean interior. It is quite easy to move around from entrance to table and to the washroom. If I am back in the area, I'll definitely go back. \nDespite its hidden location, it's a plus that it's part of a Plaza where you can grab dessert which is located just around the corner.
