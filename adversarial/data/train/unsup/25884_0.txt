We visited The Crowned Egg for the first time in mid June.  First impression was very good!  The service was very good and the staff friendly.  I had the meat lovers platter, which included 3 eggs, ham steak, sausage links, bacon, breakfast potatoes, and toast for $10.99.  While all of the food was very good and served hot, the bacon was fantastic!  The eggs were properly cooked over medium.  The potatoes were delicious (I opted for the oven roasted potatoes rather than hash browns, but you do get to choose.)  My wife had the corned beef hash that she described as very good and large with tons of real corned beef.  We both brought home take home boxes.  Also, I thought the coffee was excellent as well.  The decor is fairly basic, that of a local diner that just opened, but was clean and perfectly acceptable.  We will definitely be back and highly recommend to others.
