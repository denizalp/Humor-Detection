Thomas Keller does not disappoint! I love their macarons here! It's $3.50 a pop but it's the bigger one so you can really enjoy and savor each and every bite without having to worry that it'll all be gone after just two meager bites. I had the chocolate and pistachio. Both were fantastic! Not too sweet, texture is just perfect, filling is not overwhelming but still rich in flavor. You can tell there's so much love put into that pastry. I will come back to try more flavors and their other pastries the next time I'm in Vegas. \n\nPrepare to look for this place. We got lost a couple of times before finally getting here. It is located near the casino under\/behind the escalators.
