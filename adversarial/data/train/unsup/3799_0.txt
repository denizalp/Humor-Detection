4.9 stars!\n\nDecided to come here for dinner before seeing Sade and John Legend at the MGM Grand.  My cousin was also in town, so we met here a couple hours before the show.\n\nAmbiance was tones of gold and lavender lighting with dark accents.  The entrance was through glass wine displays that opened up into their bar lounge then main dinning area.  Ambiance:  5 stars!\n\nI arrived first and sat at the bar and ordered a fancy cocktail, whose name escapes me, but contained a smoked peach whiskey.  It was fabulous!  The bartender shares that they smoke their peaches, infusing that flavor into the whiskey.  Pretty amazing.  Knowing we had an 8 pm concert, the staff asked twice throughout dinner how they were doing on time.  Nice to know they know, you know?  Service:  5 stars!\n\nMy cousin arrives and we delve into the menu and opt for the $79 Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings (that went perfectly, btw).  Although it wasn't the prix fixe Restaurant Week menu we were intending, we couldn't resist the urge to splurge.\n\nWe started with an amuse-bouche of some fish inspired concoction that was a nice start.  The prix fixe allowed us some room to decide among 2-3 choices in each of the four courses.  \n\nFirst course:  \n1)  Wagyu Beef Tartare of crushed caper aïoli, slow-poached egg and crispy chocolate.  I don't like raw meat, but this was fresh and extremely flavorful.  An intriguing pleaser despite our aversion for raw meat:  4 stars.\n2)  Foie Gras 'Brûlée' that was more like a tartlet rich with creamy goose liver:  5 stars!\n\nSecond course:\n1)  Glazed Pork Belly with sweet corn tortellini, Porcini mushrooms & crispy pancetta:  5 star brilliance!  Probably the best dish of the night.\n2)  Maine Dayboat Scallops with braised Oxtail, Wild Mushrooms in a salted caramel reduction:  5 stars!  Succulent medallions of scallops adorned in a beautiful sauce that turned out to be my cousin's favorite dish.\n\nThird course:\n1)  Iberico Pork Loin with milk-braised cannelloni with baby eggplant and Creminelli Mortadella.  The fact that my cousin offered me none is testament of its superiority:  5 stars!\n2)  48 Hour Beef Belly with golden chanterelles, Padrón peppers and California plums:  5 stars!  I'm a big sucker for belly meat, so this outrageous dish won big time in my book.\n\nDessert course:\n1)  Peach Praline Profiteroles or roasted peaches with praline gelato and peach jus:  4.5 stars.\n2)  Crunchy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Tart with cassis sphere & in a toasted marshmallow sauce:  5 stars!  Give me chocolate or give me death!  A high brow example of a low brow standby.\n\nA great experience, exactly what I wanted to mark my ten year return to Vegas (no joke!)\n\nTally:\nAmbiance:  5 stars!\nService:  5 stars!\nFirst Course:  4+5= 9\/2= 4.5\nSecond Course:  5 stars!\nThird Course:  5 stars!\nDessert Course:  4.5+5= 9.5\/2= 4.8\nWine Pairings:  5 stars!\n5+5+4.5+5+5+4.8=5= 34.3\/7= 4.9 stars\n\n#Yelp 365:  050\/365
