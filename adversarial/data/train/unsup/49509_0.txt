Went to Tott's for the first time this week. Following other Yelp suggestions I ordered the Orange Chicken. Flavorful dish, but needed a bit more 'heat' (I guess I can always add that to my dish). Appetizer was the Lettuce Wraps. Nice cool lettuce with flavorful chicken filling. \n\nOne appetizer and one main course fed two easily and the bill was $18.  \n\nI'll go back to check out other dishes.
