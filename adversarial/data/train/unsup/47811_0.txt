Tonight was my first time going to Longhitano's. I drive past there every on my way to school and decided to stop in to take part of their Tuesday $.40 wing special.\n\nRight off the bat, this is very much a bar and grill kind of place. Don't expect any kind of fine dining here, just good pub (and of course Italian) food and lots of alcohol. \n\nThe prices were really good with burgers and sandwiches around $6 and pasta at $10. The service was acceptable. We did wait a while to get our menus but the waitress was very nice and kept up with drink refills and extra condiment request.  The food was also quick to arrive. It took less than 5 minutes for our appetizer,amazing fried mac-n-cheese bites, to arrive. \n\nAs far as the quality of the food, it was pretty tasty. I assume they order in a large portion of their items, so keeping that in mind, I was quite pleased with my meal. I had (as I already mentioned) the wings, which were delicious, spicy, and very large! along with a basket of fries that were not as crispy as I would like, but still pretty good. My boyfriend had the meatball sub which he quickly devoured, and some fantastic thick-cut homemade chips. All for under $20.\n\nI'll probably be visiting Longhitano's again, especially since it is the closest Italian restaurant. I look forward to seeing their new larger menu which will be coming out soon, but I think I will forgo to fries and stay with chips next time.
