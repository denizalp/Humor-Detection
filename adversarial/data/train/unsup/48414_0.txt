Currently going through a horrific experience with these guys 12\/9\/2015. I am awaiting answers as to why my truck is taking so long to arrive in San Diego... \n\nI signed up with DAS because Craig Crawford told me \"they own their own trucks\" and that \"they are not a broker\" only to find out that was a lie. He told me that it would only take between 5-7 business days to ship my truck. It is day 15 and they still can not provide me as to when my truck will arrive here in SD...\n\nI am shipping my 1965 Ford F-100 from Charleston SC to San Diego. They said my truck would take between 5-7 business days and then my contract stated ETA 12-14days after I paid over $900 dollars. LIES, LIES, LIES \n\nIt is day 15 and no truck nor answers as to when I will receive my truck. Good luck trying to arrange work and family plans around your ETA arrival date of your vehicle.\n\nI called trying to speak with a manger this morning which was like pulling teeth and they provided me with manager Craig Disalvo 1-800-826-1083 (EXT 1147)\nI could not reach him and have requested he call me back ASAP\n\nVery poor business! Awful experience! Horrible customer service! LIES, LIES, LIES
