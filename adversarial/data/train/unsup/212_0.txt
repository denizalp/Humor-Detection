Traumatizing experience - BEWARE:\n\nWe went here for dinner and ordered the dinner Wok-fired specialty entree: Crispy Honey Shrimp and Mongolian Beef.  Appetizer: warm and spicy artichoke dips.\n\nFood is overly expensive, too salty, too fried, and felt very unhealthy, making us ill afterwards with intense stomach pain.   I feet like I swallowed a large lump of coal.  I'm thankful for Advil.  \n\nOn a happier note, our server is very nice and accommodating; food came rather quickly.  Regardless, there are definitely better restaurants on Bell Blvd.
