Such a cute and hip date location. The drinks were really good and strong. I ordered a dirty martini... with extra olives. They kinda forgot the extra olive part and could work on getting some blue cheese olives. Our waitress was stunning and quickly poured my drink into a to go cup when ready to go. It is a small intimate place and wouldn't recommend a very large group. Better for 2 people IMO. Would come back for sure to make out in the back area.. and maybe try to close the curtain.
