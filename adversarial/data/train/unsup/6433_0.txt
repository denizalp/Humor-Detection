No words...just wow!  OK a few words...I am 32 years old and I have had curly hair my whole life, and although many love it...I hated it!  I tried other treatments (like Rusk), but then I found Alicia at Bravo and she turned me onto the Japanese Hair straightening!  For the first time in my life, I have STRAIGHT hair...I mean really straight hair. Alicia was able to explain everything to me and really understand my issues...for the first time I got to have a professional work on my hair...and boy did it pay off!  I highly, highly, highly recommend going to Bravo - i mean that is if  you want the best and you want to look the best!
