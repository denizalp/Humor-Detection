I have to admit, I really enjoyed my time at XS. What I dislike the most is how crowded the dance floor can get towards midnight and beyond.\n\nWe got here pretty early, around 10:30am and avoided a line that was already building up. I bought tickets online prior so it def helped. If you don't have a table, it will be hard to enjoy yourself (I think). Just because there are not a lot of areas where you can sit as a regular patron! We had friends who got a table outside, which helped a lot. I really did enjoy being outside, even though it was cold. The tables had heat lamps and the wait staff were all attentive. We grabbed our drinks at the bar outside, which got pretty packed. However, bartenders were able to get through everyone fast and efficient. \n\nI'd come back. Especially after hearing that my bf ran into Deadmau5 in the men's restroom, while he was taking selfies with patrons.
