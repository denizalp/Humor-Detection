As per usual, a great restaurant ruined by ignorant staff. No napkin or cutlery...am I suppose to eat with my hands?? Tired of feeling like a burden to employees when I enter an establishment to order food. It is your JOB--if you don't like it, QUIT. Is there ANY Caribbean restaurant in Scarborough where I can go and receive EQUAL service? You clearly see the demeanor and attitude  change when a customer comes in who is, how can I say...NOT WHITE. On my list of never agains, along with Sunrise and a few others. I liked it much better when the Asian ladies worked there.
