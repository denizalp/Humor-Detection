The Finance guy is a moron. They somehow talked me in to getting \"pre-qualified\", even though I told them I was only browsing. I was informed that I had \"horrible credit\", my credit score was 780. The only thing they would sell me was a shitty green hybrid 2006 Ford Escape, which was shittier than the car I had. The Finance guy stated that I needed a \"starter car\" to \"build up my credit\" and then I could \"have anything I want\". There were discriminating comments about my age. I'm 22. Apparently I wasn't worthy of a car that was made within the last 17 years. I left and bought a new Mazda, where I was told that I had great credit and the staff worked with me well. Also, just want to throw in that More Mazda is the best place ever, I've never had a bad experience to date. Mazda's are where it's at. Also, thanks for sucking, Earnhardts. I'm really glad I don't drive a pieceoshit Ford.
