I've been going to T&G Old Town for over 2 years and couldn't be happier. Prior to then, I spent the better part of a year searching the Valley for a salon that could do African American hair. Adam, Dominique and the team there are great, usually on time and reasonably priced. The salons ambiance is awesome as well. My husband (Caucasian) and bi-racial son are also clients.
