Maybe the owner was having a bad day. When we arrived he was not busy. We were the only ones. He was very rude to us. I drove a friend that is handicap to get some real state papers notarized. He was upset the whole time with a frown on his face. His attitude was like the one of somebody making a favor to a person he does not want to make a favor to and is upset about doing it.  I do not know if he was having a bad day but I will never go back to this place. What it takes my attention is that I believe was  the owner the one that was being rude. Usually owners are super nice because they want you to come back. Not sure what happen that day. Maybe he does not know how to deal with handicap people? Anyway, I will never go back and will never recommend this place.  There was not excuse to be rude. He behaved like if  he was doing a favor to my friend by notarizing the document. I felt super bad for my friend. She was with a cane, super tired from walking from the car to the store and she was treated not right.
