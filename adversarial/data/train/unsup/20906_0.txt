Alright folks, I AM NOT A COMIC BOOK READER. I love all the X-MEN movies, Batman is my favourite hero, and I finished the two short seasons of Young Justice. What? Her name is Gwen (and not Mary Jane) in The Amazing Spider-Man? \n\nSO NO, I am not your girl to ask about comic books!!! Apologies for the ditsy comments above ^^^^\n\nAnyways, perhaps **someone out there** is interested in my opinion of Silver Snail Comic. \n\n.....\n\nDear interested readers,\n\nI'm so glad you have decided to read my review! I give this a 5 star because:\n\n1) This shop is very clean, modern decor, and ORGANIZED. Yes, you will find what you are looking for without asking! Of course, you can also ask!\n\n2) The staff DOES NOT look at me with a snobby thought, \"Girl, you don't belong here.\" I absolutely cannot stand shop owners that look at their customers that way. (I CHOSE to come in, so they shouldn't judge me by looks!) A+ because I felt very welcomed at Silver Snail Comic.\n\n3) The staff left me alone as I was browsing but were happy to jump in when I needed help. They didn't make small talks, yet they were very approachable.\n\n4) OK. THE GOODS THEY SELL: \nAs expected, I wouldn't buy the expensive action figures (oh my gosh, they were A++ quality though!) even though they are beautifully displayed on the shelves. The large Hulk figure looked amazing with so much attention to detail. I found lots of hardcover, elegantly-crafted comic books. \n\nDon't laugh when I say this. I LOVE blind boxes! They have tons!!! At the time of my visit, their Toki Doki collection actually was better than Magic Pony 680 Queen St. W. They also have Hello Kitty with moustache mint tins. \n\nKidrobot and Paul Frank can also be found here. I bought the Ghostbusters ice cube tray for my boyfriend for $18.07 (PRICEY for 12 cubes!! The cubes don't turn out well FYI...)\n\n\nI'm taking my boyfriend here next. We aren't comic book readers but we do enjoy browsing for geeky items and toys. \n\nMaybe even order a Captain Americano or Yoda Soda from their very own coffee shop!
