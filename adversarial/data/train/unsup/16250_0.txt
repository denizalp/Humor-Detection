This review is for when I went in November 2009, I know-- I'm THREE months late.... but I had so much fun, so I remember it was CRAAACKIN. \n\nI came with 4 other *BEAUTIFUL* females, we waited in line for only about 5 minutes and got in. I loved dancing on the dance floor that was partially outside because you got FRESH AIR, although it was very packed. So there kinda wasn't any room to dance nor walk around from one spot to another quickly. \n\nMusic was cool but towards the end they started playing like those rave\/trance music, and I don't like that. \n\nOne incident though, we almost got kicked out... so, note to self: Don't push or shove an employee because they will find you like with their HAWK'S EYE and try to get you kicked out!
