This is a wonderful little place if you're serious about getting into competitive dance or if you're like me, and just want to be comfortable on the dance floor.\n\nEveryone, from the teachers to your fellow students, are incredibly supportive.  This is important because confidence helps you show up the next time and more practice helps you get better quicker.\n\nThe studio is very comfortable and family friendly.  They have weekly \"parties\" where you can practice what you learned --  At the parties, people of all levels are dancing... and dancing with others of various levels.  \n\nThey offer group classes and private lessons.  Definitely, Give it a try.   It may be the best thing you ever do for yourself!
