I hadn't gotten a facial for almost 1.5 years when I happened to get one from BEBA. It's IMPOSSIBLE to find a place that does extractions at most American places. I had no issue in Los Angeles, but, BEBA seemed to be the only person that I could find who was wiling to do it. \n\nShe squeezed probably about 70 times off my face (stuff and gunk wherever they were hiding) and got rid of whiteheads as well (the main reason why I even go get a facial). It' s a small shop, and she's just a very sweet, comforting person to be around. \n\nI'm used to 1.5 hour facials from back in LA, and my session lasted me about 50 minutes? I was a bit surprised. I personally woulda wanted a couple more face packs or something done with the extra time I had, but she said that everyone's session time varies based on their skin condition and mine was not needing anything more. I must take it as a compliment, I suppose. \n\nI'll for sure be back to squeeze the crap out of my face again.
