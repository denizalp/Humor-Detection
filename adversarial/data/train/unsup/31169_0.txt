What can say, other than Wow!  I took a couple of friends here for their birthday dinners and we had nothing but an amazing experience.  We were greeted right when we walked in, and sat immediately.  The food was delicious!  Our waitress was tremendous and very pleasant!!!I highly recommend Thailicious!!! :)
