I would call myself an Italian food snob. I come from a large Italian family on the east coast. I love cooking Italian food and im very very good at it. so when i eat Italian food out i have high standers. SAUCE has met those standars. You can tell everything is freshly made on site. i had the Italian chimichanga OMG you have to try it. what a great fusion of Mexican and Italian. i also took a large cheese pizza to go for a late night snack for after the club. The pizza was awsome also.A chill casual place to have some good Italian food. I will be back,
