Me and a group of friends came here expecting a high end holiday dinner. It was so disappointing. The waiting staff were wonderful, however the food was atrocious. Two of us ordered a green salad which was smeared in garlic. It tasted like the vegetables were soaked in garlic, drenched in garlic sauce with garlic sprinkled on top. We sent the salads back and I got a tomato and broccolini salad which came in huuuuge slices of tomato and entire broccolinis, so big I had no way of actually swallowing the food. Someone else got a soup where alcohol was supposed to be a compliment but the bisque tasted like wind with a hint of soup. Other people got meat dishes which was presented like a five dollar meal and tasted mediocre.
