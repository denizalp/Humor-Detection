*2.5 stars* Extra 0.5 star for the tasting menu- great deal, I must say.\n\nMy dinner date and I came here on a Saturday night after hearing and reading all the buzz online and seeing all the pictures.  We made reservations for about 8:30, and was empty except for a rather large party in the back (which actually knows the staff, I think).  Definitely not what you expect on a weekend night at a new and  supposedly trendy place. \n\nMy date is Filipino himself and knows all the traditional flavours, and I have been out to some more traditional Filipino restaurants around the city.  So we're both quite familiar with the cuisine, but the dishes here are served with a modern twist, and we were excited! The menu is nice and concise consisting of a snacks\/apps section, an entrée section, and desserts.  There is also a tasting menu of $40 per person which includes an appetizer, an entrée, a dessert, as well as an amuse-bouche and a pre-dessert from the chef.  There is also a chef's tasting menu of $80, but reservation in advance is required. \n\nMerienda Platter: $10-12?? (4\/5 stars)\nWe couldn't decide which app to get, so we got the platter.  Great portion for the price.  It includes several pieces of chicarron (deep fried chicken skin), one slider burger, one lumpia, and an empanada.  All was quite good.  Great start to a meal!\n\nIf you know me (or at are familiar with my reviews), you'd know I definitely went for the tasting menu as well... both of us.  Only way to go:\n\nAmuse-Bouche: Complimentary\nSmall portion of Filipino congee served in a little jar.  It was cute and quite good.  But it was congee... I'm Chinese, so I'm allowed to be picky.\n\nAPPS-\n\nHalo-Halo Sisig and Rice: (3.5\/5 stars)\nI'm going to admit, if it's one cuisine I don't really love, it's Filipino cuisine.  However, I LOVE sisig! I also know the BEST place in Toronto to get it!  The sisig is here very hearty and non-traditional.  It taste was good but I would have loved if they used traditional pork rinds, all crisped up! \n\nSeafood Paella: (2.5\/stars)\nI would have given this a 3\/5 IF this was in fact paella.  It was much more of a risotto with the type of rice that was used and the consistency.  So basically, imagine a risotto-like dish with seafood.\n\nMAINS-\n\nCrispy Pork Belly Adobo: (1.5\/5 stars)\nThey claim it's pork belly, which quite possibly could be. But, what a waste! The fatty bacon goodness is not there!  Instead, expect a few small slices of dried (though tender) flavourless pork with an overly sour gastrique.\n\nCarre-Carre Briased Short Rib: (3\/5 stars)\nThis was okay.  A generous portion of beef rib, braised and topped with a peanut butter sauce.  Not bad, but have had better.\n\nAdmittedly, I can't quite remember what I had for dessert...\nOverall, I was disappointed, but good pricing for everything if you were to try it for the first time.  I definitely recommend getting the prix-fixe like I did!  I have to admit that their website looks amazing right now and the food looks great!  Too bad an appealing website does not KEEP customers.  Maybe, i'll give them another try sometime... not in a rush.
