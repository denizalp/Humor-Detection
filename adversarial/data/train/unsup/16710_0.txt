The ancient grain pancakes are crazy delicious. CRAZY. DELICIOUS. CRAZY.. I'm not sure if it is fair for me to say that though, since they were the first pancakes I have had in a very very very long time, and I had them with real maple syrup, which is good on just about anything. Oh well, I guess I will have to try them again just to be sure... The rest of the food was ok. The bacon looks very soggy and limp, wouldn't order that if you're into bacon. The vegetables were previously frozen I'm pretty sure. Everything else was pretty much what you'd expect, good enough but nothing fancy.\n\nAs for the service, it was prompt and relatively professional, and I was given everything I asked for, but I can't say I felt 100% welcome. Never before have I been asked to close out a check while I was still in the middle of eating. I might have understood if the guy's shift was ending, or the restaurant was about to close, or if they wanted me to hurry up and leave because they needed the table. However, none of these things were true. Did they think I was going to hop into my Lexus and split without paying that tiny check? I don't get it? Additionally, the server addressed me as ma'am every single time he came over to my table. I don't know anyone who appreciates being called ma'am. It's quite rude. Even grandmas prefer to be called miss. Also, When I first walked in, the host asked, \"can I help you?\" which I thought was odd. Yeah, obviously I want to eat..wtf.. this is a restaurant isn't it? Don't hosts usually ask \"how many?\" or something like this? Did I look like I didn't belong there? I don't understand. Very strange experience, service wise.\n\nPrices are extremely reasonable. For all the things I got, my bill was super cheap.\n\nThe restroom is good.
