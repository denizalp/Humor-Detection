Was excited to finally try this place and was extremely disappointed with both the quality and quantity of meats. We were there at a busy time and it seemed like no coincidence that the good meats only came around a few times while the cheap ones were readily available. I understand the cost differences but when you are paying this much for a meal it shouldn't matter.
