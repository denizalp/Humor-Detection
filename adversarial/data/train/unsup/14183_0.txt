I arrived early morning to Madison, Wisconsin and was hungry. My husband and I decided to visit the area around the University of Wisconsin. Imaging my surprise when I found a Taco Bell Cantina open.\n\nWe went in for coffee and breakfast and I had to ask what was a Taco Bell Cantina? I was told it was one of 8 in the United States and they are able to cell beer and wine. They had the usual menu with the added bonus of spirits and televisions.\n\nI felt like I was in a restaurant when the server brought breakfast to the table. I was thrown for a loop when I was asked how do I like my coffee. It arrived with flavored cream and sugar. I sat there in amazement eating while watching several TVs.\n\nWhen can we get one of these in San Diego!
