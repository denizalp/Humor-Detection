This is my favorite restaurant in the city!  My boyfriend and I just visited for the third time.  We always sit at the bar bc honestly the drink making is amazing to watch abs then taste.  The bartender is always friendly and remembered us from a previous visit.  \n\nOf course the bread is amazing but I would just like to say that for the few people that gave 2 stars you do not have a palate or open mind. \n\nThe food is always Excellent and I will continue to return!
