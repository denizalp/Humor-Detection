Very nice ambience, especially in the fall. \nLarge, mature trees line long fields with a pretty view of the south mountains. A quaint \"farm\" setting with small gardens and little shops in shabby chic buildings. \n\nYou park across the street in a dirt\/rock lot. Once you wander across the street, there is a cute little shack type set up, you walk in, grab your fresh made, plastic packed items. They have fresh and hearty salads with your choice of gourmet dressings, choices of sandwiches on artisan breads, delicious muffins and cake slices, all made right there. There are really cute miniature pies that look great, as well as fresh made lemonades that are really good. \n\nYou get your sandwiches (fresh made) in a little picnic basket, after you pay. Grab a seat in the fenced in garden and enjoy the views and the weather (if it's not too hot out). Many people bring their pups and enjoy a walk around the farm.\n\nI love this place, I love that everything is fresh and it always tastes great!\n\nPrices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting.
