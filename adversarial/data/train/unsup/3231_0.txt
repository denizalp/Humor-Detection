Good Pho! I had the Pho Dac Bit (large) and ingredients were fresh and soup was delicious! The staff were friendly and courteous, they kept checking on me to make sure everything was ok. I also had the Thai Tea, which was delicious! \nThis place is tucked away in the shopping mall and a corner unit! Small, but good place for fresh and we'll cooked Pho!
