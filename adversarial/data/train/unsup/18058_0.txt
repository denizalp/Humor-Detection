Located at 484 Dundas the House of Gourmet is in the very heart of Toronto's China Town. The place has seemingly been here forever and I've dined here many times and have always found it to be one of the better the many Chinese restaurants of the area. It's nothing fancy and the Chinese food it serves isn't really the tops of what China ever produce, Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution pretty much wiped that out, but for what it is it's pretty darn good. And one thing for sure is that you can generally tell you're in the right place as most everyone in the place is speaking in Chinese. \n\nWhen I lived in Toronto I usually got the BBQ Duck, a hanging display of which they always have in their window, but now that I live in Florida where Chinese restaurants only served warm water spiny backs, I went for the lobster knowing I'd get the more tasty cold water lobster, which in fact I did. The lobster I order came chopped mixed in with varying noodles and vegetables done over with an oriental garlic like sauce. Whoever chopped the lobster did it perfectly. Every chop was clean and precise leaving no little flakes of shell or shrapnel, allowing one to easily pick the meat from the shell, all of which I found to be flavorful and good. \n\nThe service here is extremely fast, almost to the point that you might believe they had to have your order prepared before you ordered though it is only prepared upon order. \n\nThere isn't anything classy or upscale about the place, it's just a good Chinese restaurant serving good though not exemplary or unique Chinese food.
