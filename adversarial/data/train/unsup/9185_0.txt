Cosmopolitan Food: This used to be my old stomping grounds and I'd nickname Cosmo and Aria as my \"backyard\" as at the time I lived in City Center.  This became my go to buffet as I loved the environment and Cosmo is my favorite hotel on the strip.  Concept of the food is like all you can eat Tapas.  Food is limited so the turn over is more frequent than when it is large trays.  They have a jazzed up salad bar and bread basket as well as charcuterie board.  This time, a very large selection of fresh fruit.  They also have a seafood area where it can be pretty hard to get enough of the crab legs, so I have noticed.  Further down you have hot side dishes like honey carrots and baby broccoli.  Cutting board offers sausage in a swirl (luganighetta) as well as roasted chicken (bone in), prime rib and lamb.  They have a small section of sushi and make your own pho soup.  Kimchi fried rice inside the take out box is almost always there.  I do love the desserts here: usually a rice krispy treat, macarons, gelato bar, hot cobblers and bread pudding, fancy cakes...\n\nService: I always ask for Katie\/Kathy here as she has become more a friend here than a server.  It really makes the whole dining experience all the more sweet.  She is attentive and the dining experience goes smoothly.  Only thing is I wish the food service buffet attendants were more friendly as they are definitely lacking.  \nOur most recent visit, we celebrated a birthday and they put together a beautiful platter of desserts with a candle and edible happy birthday chocolate coated in gold, it was very impressive.
