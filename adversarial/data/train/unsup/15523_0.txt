Here's the thing with this line...it's convenient and connects the two biggest subway lines in Toronto. I know we only have 3 or 4.  \n\nBut I really hate this line too for the following reasons:\n\na) Too congested\nb) If you get off at the wrong time during rush hour - PROTECT YOURSELF!!! I can't count the amount of times I've been shoved by people running into me and even once I was getting off the train and a person almost shoved me back into the train off the Yonge line.  I was like \"WTH?\"\n\nYes, I know that's not this station's fault, but here's what I like about this station though:\n\na) If you are coming from the Bloor line during rush hour and going up the stairs, they actually have pedestrian traffic controllers and segregate people going up and down the stairs so no one gets injured (I really think people would if they weren't here).\n\nb) The buskers here are decent. \n\nAll and all, this is the station that gets you everywhere but beware of insane corporate drones and students trying not to be late.
