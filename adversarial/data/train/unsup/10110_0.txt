Been busy lately and time with the GF had been at a minimum.  Over the years she has spoken very highly of Maggianos.  Having never been before... a window of opportunity would present it's self to give it a shot.  The GF had a gift card, we had the time and reservations were made.\n\nWe arrived at the Fashion Show Mall and parked half way from the north forty.  We made our way around the outside of the mall and entered.  \n\nVery nice atmo and servers in white shirts.  We had a window table.  Sounds fancy....but it was not.  We gazed out on the promenade outside and watched people loiter and or pass by.\n\nService was initially slow, and pretty much stayed that way through the entire meal.  I had a drink run empty and was not addressed until 15-20 minutes after.\n\nI ordered up the Chicken Piccata.  It looked delicious on the menu.  The GF ordered up Chef KB's Lobster Carbonara.\n\nWe chowed down on bread prior to plate touchdown.  If they don't bring the balsamic, be sure to ask for it.\n\nWhen the plates arrived, I surveyed the contents.  It all looked good enough.  Dipping into the two plates with my fork.....something seemed off.  It seemed almost sort of commonplace.  \n\nMy eyes and my knowledge of the location told me I was at someplace that was supposed to be special.   My tastebuds were telling me I have been here many times before.  I could not really put my finger on it.  That was until I noticed the gift card the GF was partially paying with.  On the back of the card, were familiar corporate foodie locations I was well aware of.  \n\nPutting it all together, Maggiano's taste reminded my of other chains.  Putting it all together, I can check this off the list.
