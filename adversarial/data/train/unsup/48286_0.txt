I thought my savory pesto roasted chicken crepe was delicious! Lots of chicken, asparagus, and sun dried tomatoes (maybe even a little too many sun dried tomatoes..). It was surprisingly filling despite it just being a single crepe. Some friends got the sweet one with nutella and the one covered with fruit, and consensus was that everyone was happy. Prices ran about $10-$11. \n\nI've never had a \"real\" crepe in France before, so I guess I don't know if these are legit or not, but overall it was satisfying and a quick and easy way to grab something to eat!
