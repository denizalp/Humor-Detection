One can have great food, but nothing can kill a great experience more than to pair it with such horrendous service. Several good friends highly recommended Carbone including some of the discriminating friends that we went with that evening. We chose this restaurant to celebrate two birthdays and had a well-placed table of 11 (mostly foodies). Ordered amazing wines, Quintarelli and Biondi Santi, lots of starters and sides and of course, their tableside-filleted Dover sole, among their highly recommended homemade pastas.\n\nFood, great. Wine, what little we had, amazing. Let me explain how to ruin an evening with great food and wine.\n\nNO SERVICE...had to beg.\n\nAfter opening and pouring the first pours, they left the wine bottles on the table and never came back to refill glasses or offer additional selections. Never came back to refill water, ask for cocktails, we had to get up twice to ask if someone could bring more water to the table.\n\nThree of our guests, left the table discreetly to ask what was going on and why no one was coming to service our table while the 4-top table next to us was being well-attended to.\n\nThey forgot to bring out three different side dishes we had ordered (total of 6 dishes). Completely forgot. They offered to put the orders in after bringing out the main courses.\n\nOf course, our table was a mess. Empty cocktail, wine and water glasses, empty wine bottles left on table, no one came by to take empty dishes away or sweep debris before dessert.\n\nI have to admit the dishes were great, however, there are a lot of extraordinary restaurants in Vegas. Carbone lost our faith and our referrals. Each of us traveled in from all over to attend this birthday gathering which made it all the more disappointing. Even if they were shorthanded that evening, they could have explained it to us and at least make sure we weren't parched by the end of the evening. Bummed.
