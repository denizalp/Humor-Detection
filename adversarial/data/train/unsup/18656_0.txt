Fantastic.  Awesome.  Wonderful.\n\nAfter a visit to a dealership (*cough* Town & Crook Toyota *cough*) about the leaky sunroof on my 4runner, I vowed that if I couldn't find a fix for it that cost less than the  $850 I was quoted, I was just going to put duct tape over the damn thing.  And after being jerked around at the dealership, I would have just put plywood over the hole in the roof rather than give Toyota a dime.  Enter Auto Toyz. \n\nI made a call and brought it up for them to check out.  Dan (the MAN), looked it over (and fixed the additional damage that the dealership had done) and gave me a quote that was $500 less than what Toyota wanted (exact same part).  Previously, Dan owned Charlotte Sunroofs, so he knows what's what.  He gave me a quote for a Charlotte sunroof and a lower quote for the sunroof to be ordered, and I had no problem waiting since he had patched it up pretty good for me during the estimate process.  Sunroof arrived, Dan called and said he was ready to install.  An appointment was made for 2 days later.  I had a free afternoon pop up the day before the appointment (less than 18 hours after the sunroof arrived) and called to see if they could squeeze me in and he said to bring it up and he would get it done.  45 minutes later, I had a brand new, functioning, leak-free sunroof.  And did I mention that it was FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS LESS than the dealership?!\n\nAuto Toyz also does leather interior, electronics, tinting and truck accessories.  Everyone I dealt with was polite and efficient, and the quotes that I heard while standing around on my two trips all seemed beyond reasonable.  All I can vouch for is the sunroof service, but I recommend that 100%, I would give Dan more stars if I could.
