This has to be the friendliest dive bar I've ever entered.\n\nThe husband HATES Karaoke, and we still had fun here.  We saw no drama, no show-offs, no meanness, just a bunch of people on a Saturday night having a good time.\n\nThe people here were absolutely gracious and friendly.  I felt completely welcomed and encouraged to have the best time possible during my visit.  I almost never sing Karaoke, because I'm bad, but I sang two songs and received a ton of applause after both songs.  If you're a singing god\/goddess, come and have fun, but this isn't a talent showcase.  The patrons were dancing to the songs and having a good time regardless of the ability of the singer.\n\nAnd, I was patiently waiting to use the ladies room when a gentleman asked if I would feel comfortable using the men's room because it was open.  I told him I wouldn't mind if I could lock the door or have someone stand outside to prevent someone from walking in.  He stayed outside and waited for me to finish.  SO NICE!\n\nI will be back to this bar.
