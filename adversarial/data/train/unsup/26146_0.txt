Just came here again. Got 1 skewer jooje, 1 skewer Barg and asked for it to be a combo with rice, And a soltani combo. They charged us $57 dollars initially, and messed up by not making the separate skewers as a combo, and they had the nerve to argue that we did not order that. They then told us to pay for rice. So the total came to $61 after we were forced to buy the rice.\n\nThe food is good, but the staff is horrendous, it's on the pricier side. Change your attitudes or no one will come to your restaurant again.
