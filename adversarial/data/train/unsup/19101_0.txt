Decent coffees but having to pay $8 for a well balanced, well-ratioed coffee is outrageous\n\nLocated right off the elevator banks to the Mandalay Bay tower rooms, this was a welcome sight in the morning\n\nTheir small lattes ( 12 oz ) only had 1 shot & this girl needs 3 to get me going in the mornings\n\nThe good news was that it required no additional sugar.  The bad news was that it cost $8\n\nStarbucks was much more reasonable & it pained me to admit that since I usually avoid that place
