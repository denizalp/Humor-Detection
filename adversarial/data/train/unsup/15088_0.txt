When booking here, I wasn't expecting a 5 star hotel. But....really....we found a vibrator under the AC unit....\n\nLet's start with the Pro's:\n-Hooters  wings\/food\n-Cheap alcohol\n-Pool looks like a frat boys dream pad w\/giant connect 4, ping pong tables and so on\n-Short walk to lobby\/pool from your room\n-Smells like a Hooters (aqua net) \n- Bath&Bodyworks soap\/shampoo\/lotion\n\nCONS: \n-AC didn't work and they did nothing.... (its 111 degrees. It's hot af) WHEN TRYING TO FIX THE AC MY BF FOUND A F-ING VIBRATOR UNDER THE AC UNIT.....\n-Room was dirty (Unvacuumed floor\/grungy tub\/makeup on the vanity)\n-Everything in the room is grungy... the plaster is falling off of the walls...the molding is missing\/the bed is falling off of the frame. \n\nProbs won't ever book here again for the price. Book early and you can stay somewhere nicer for the same cost.
