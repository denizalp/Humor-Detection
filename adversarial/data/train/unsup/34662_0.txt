The service was great but the food was disgusting. We ordered about 7 different plates. Lamb ribs, onion rings, tomato bisque, french onion soup, salad, crab cake etc. Almost all of the food we ordered was wasted because non of it was good enough to eat more than a few bites. The mac and cheese is the only one I liked. If you are looking for good food, this is not a place for you. You are better off going to the buffet.
