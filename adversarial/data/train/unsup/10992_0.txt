My first experience with hot yoga...I expected it to be...hot.\n\nAnd hot it was. \nHot.\nDamn hot.\nHot like an oven. I was tempted to stand on the spot and rotate like a chicken in a rotisserie oven.\n\nThere are a lot of poses.\nPoses repeated.\nAnd when you think that you might be done...\nNope! More poses.\n\nIt's an intense 90 minute class.\nI'm pretty sure I've never sweat that much in my life.\nI didn't even know my kneecaps could sweat!\n\nI can see the benefits of hot yoga. \nThe staff was very friendly and even call you the next day to make sure you are okay and offer you special intro pricing.\n\nI'll probably go again, but not an activity I would do regularly.\nBut your skin looks great after!
