Do you enjoy listening to music with lyrics that bring emotion and mean something?\nDo you enjoy listening to music while making love?\nDo you enjoy listening to music with perfect pitch?\nDo you enjoy listening to acapella singing with flawless pitches?\nDo you enjoy listening to the classics in the 90s?\n\nThen this is a MUST GO concert. \n\nTheatre: The inside isn't huge. Although the furthest seat back isn't actually that far, it'd recommend getting a seat on the aisle and in the center orch. The guys do a great job getting the audience involved and even make their way to the aisles to pick up some ladies to dance to. \n\nMusic: Yes, they sing their top hits\/classics. Yes, they have some humor in their concert. Yes, there is some dancing, Yes, there is some romance. Yes, there is perfection in their voices blending together. \n\nEven if you only know a song or two by them or like the gentleman in front of me asking if this was the \"Men to Boys\" concert, you will be thoroughly serenaded and pleased with the beauty in their voices. There really is not a group as great and successful as these guys in their genre.\n\nGO GO GO!
