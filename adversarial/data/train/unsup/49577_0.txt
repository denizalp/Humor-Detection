My first time at new location.\nFood as usual is out of this world. 5+\/5\nDecor and atmospher is similar as before. 3.5\/5\nService is similar as before. 4\/5\nLocation even easier to get to now. 5\/5\n  - Lots of free parking on side streets.  \n  - TTC pretty much right to the door.\nCurrently no alcohol but sign in front showed an application for it.\nAll in all, if their service was bad i would still come back just because their food is that good.
