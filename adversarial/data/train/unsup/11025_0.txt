This place has horrible customer service the SECOND you have a request or question about ANYTHING you'd like to adjust or fix. They charge way too much for the usual wait, and sometimes add things on without explaining the cost difference! So over it, have been coming here for a few months and always try going back but something always goes wrong, someone always has some sort of attitude. \n\nTO MAKE MATTERS WORSE. Went back a last time to see what would happen, and sure enough, as soon as I sat down, they sent one of their workers to tell me they will attend me but if I don't like something to tell them \"don't go posting about it online.\" He proceeded to ARGUE with me when I said I posted a review because EVERY TIME I come someone has an attitude when I ask a question or they start speaking in another language. INSTEAD of APOLOGIZING, he said \"no we don't\". Wow. Instead of replying to this review, or saying \"Hey sorry you felt that way, hopefully we can redeem ourselves.\" THIS SHOWS THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  So rude. Never again. Went down the street to Luxy Nail Salon (also open late) and felt so much better!
