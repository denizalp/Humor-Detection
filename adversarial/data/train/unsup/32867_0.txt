Dim Sum review: Morning special ($2.8 per dish before 11am)\n\nThis place apparently has been recently renovated. They no longer do the push cart service. \n\nI didn't have high expectations because the prices are low, but it was actually all really good. We tried several items and were very happy with everything. \n\nThe morning special (order before 11am, including weekends) is excellent value. All dishes sized S, M & L are only $2.8. The only problem is that it is extremely packed on the weekends. We actually made a reservation for 10am, but still took us about 20min to be seated. I'm guessing the wait without a reservation would have been pretty terrible. \n\nWill definitely return. \n\nPs. they really should change the English name
