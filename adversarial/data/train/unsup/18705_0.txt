Ok, so booking a hotel last minute for Vegas for Memorial day weekend was probably not my best idea. So trying to find a hotel on Thursday for Saturday was a little difficult, because as we found the reasonably priced deals through several of the hotel search sites (travelocity, expedia, orbitz, hotels.com, and kayak) they would get swooped up and become unavailable. So I ended up staying at the Candlewood (although from the pictures that I saw and reviews I read, I thought it would be much seedier). \n\nThe were nicer and larger than I expected. \n\nOne of the washcloths had a bloodstain on it. Yuck.\n\nThe power went out for an hour and a half from 3:30 am to 5 am. I wanted to smoke a cigarette in there, but I didn't want my boyfriend waking up freaking out because I was smoking a cigarette and couldn't turn the air on. This also meant I couldn't leave the room with my sleeping boyfriend in it because he sleeps like a rock and no amount of knocking would get him to answer the door for me; power being out means the keycard wouldn't work). \n\nOtherwise it was a pleasant stay. Its not too far off strip and there's a strip mall next to it.
