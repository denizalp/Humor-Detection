This is perhaps the most awful run down store I have ever seen before in my life.  Look at all of the photos I took.  It's a lawsuit waiting to happen with the lack of appearance and potential accidents.  The feel of the store is what I used to see in the 1980's, when you thought this type of atmosphere was cool.  They obviously are in need of a huge renovation.\n\nTook literally 10 minutes for someone to help us in appliances, while we saw about half a dozen other employees.  \n\nBottom line, until I see major renovations, I will never come back.  Make sure you come packing too...lots of unsavory characters.
