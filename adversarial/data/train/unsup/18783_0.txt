I've come a long way from asking Michael Symon to take a picture of Guy Fieri and myself at a Cavs game years ago. Don't worry. I got looks of confusion and was asked why I didn't want him in the photo also... I have grown up and am much more in touch with my foodie side and will never make this mistake again.\n\nLolita. I love you. Never do you disappoint. Stand me up. Or give me the cold shoulder. Warm. Inviting. Dreamy. Delectable. I could go on...\n\nI will. \n\nThe Roasted Dates...Oh My!!! \nFried Brussel Sprouts...Have you read any of the other reviews??? Amazeballz!!!!!\nCauliflower Gratin. I don't care if it's even semi healthy since cauliflower is in the name. Try it. Thank me later.\nCrispy Local Potatoes+chili flake+orange zest...really...\nSoft Polenta+mascarpone and parmesan=melt in your mouth yum!\nPork Chop was perfection.\nMac & Cheese is also a fan fav. def in the winter.\nHH Lolita Burger. I feel like this is his signature burger. As it should be.\n\nI'll be back. (Arnold style) For drinks. For late night snacks. And for everything in between. xoxo
