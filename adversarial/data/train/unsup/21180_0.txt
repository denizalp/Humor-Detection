Its so incredibly bad that it is hilarious to watch! I thought wow the first act was bad maybe it'll get better later, nope just stayed bad the whole time. The only reason we left with smiles was because of laughing so hard at how bad it was. The first act was just jumping on a trampoline expecting an applause, we were all thinking 'oh that was it'. Then it goes into the next act of a guy juggling and he dropped the pins about 5 times, and yet seemed pretty proud of himself. Then the so called magic act, that was the funniest bit, that man really loves his coat he continually swung his coat around claiming that his tricks were amazing, they were $1 shop tricks. Then the only animal in the circus came out, a mini horse. This lady who brought him out had no sense of embarrassment since she was rather large and in a leotard, she walked this horse in circles on a leash continually feeding him to coerce him to move forward, at this point i was about to die of laughter. The whole show was so bad it was comical, we defiantly will not forget this one. Spend your money else where!
