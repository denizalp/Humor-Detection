WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nThe baked goods in this bakery. I think they specialize in the croissants since there's different ways they make this pastry. They call it the roulée and comes in different flavors of drizzles. I chose the chocolate because I saw it on display outside being freshly made. \n\nThe people helping me were nice and the roulée tasted great. It wasn't dry and the it was moist. It had just enough crunch and chewiness to the pastry. \n\nI didn't try anything else because I came on nuit blanche night and they only served this pastry or teas. Guess they anticipated to be really busy to make anything else. \n\nLAST TIP!?\n\nCome try out the pastries that are fresh out of the oven if you have a chance. The freshness and crispness to the pastries will satisfy you!
