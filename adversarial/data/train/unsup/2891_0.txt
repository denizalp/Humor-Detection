Nespresso Boutique is hard to compare to any other Nespresso Boutiques because it is the only one in Ontario. They sell Nespresso machines ALL over the country and there are only two stores, one in Toronto and one in Montreal. Everyone else is forced to buy their expensive pod coffee online, for a shipping charge, of course. \n\nThis store is very much a boutique, a bit too much formality when picking up some coffee. The staff are dressed in suits, each customer has a nespresso club card, you are called by name - it is all very la-di-dah. Do I feel like I am part of a club? Not usually. I generally feel that if there is this much pomp and ceremony around picking up some coffee, I am probably being colossally ripped off. But, I continue to enjoy my nespresso maker. \n\nIf you are in the Bay at the Eaton Centre, it is a good idea to drop into the Nespresso store for a free sample espresso. Who doesn't love a free coffee?
