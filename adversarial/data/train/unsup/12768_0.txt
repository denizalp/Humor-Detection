They have the basics, the classics and build your own creation stations such as tacos, omelets, and pasta. \n\nFresh sliced meat options, turkey, roast beef, prime rib and ham. \n\nThey also have shrimp cocktail, simple sushi, salad bar, soups, breads, pizza, enchiladas, fish & chips just to name a few. \n\nDesserts are incredible, cakes, pies, gelato, soft serve, cookies, macaroons, etc. \n\nDrinks anything you could imagine from chocolate milk, lemonade, coffee, iced tea, and sodas. \n\nThe lay out is comfortable, spacious with both booths and table seating. \n\nThe service is always fantastic, the servers always keeping our drinks filled. \n\nGreat food, wonderful service and fantastic deals with a players card for comped or two for one deals. \n\nI have done this buffet many times and will continue to do it every time I am in the mood to be satisfied.
