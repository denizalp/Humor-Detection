Chocolate! Pastries! REAL VEGGIE BURGERS! This place has it all, and a pitcher full of water flavored with strawberries and oranges you can drink from.\nMy friend got us each a sampling box with yummy candies. Some really didn't taste like their labels said, but the most flavorful were the pumpkin maple, acai berry truffle, and the mixed berry. So pretty too! Their parfaits are a work of art, and very yummy. I can't wait to come back and devour one of their cakes!
