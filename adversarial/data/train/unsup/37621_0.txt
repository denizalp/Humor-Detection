Food ranged from minimally adequate to inedible. Service was not bad, but could not exactly be described as attentive, either. The leaking a\/c vent with the towel tented below it and the bucket on the floor to catch the rest of the dripping, added so much to the atmosphere. None in our party understood the 4+ star ratings others have given this restaurant.
