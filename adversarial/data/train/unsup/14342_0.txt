Location...wow...simply breath-taking. For a moment there, I forgot I was in Sin City.\n\nOver 300+ reviews so we all know how great this place is. Nothing else to add except....\n\nThey added a handful of pasta dishes. DELICIOUS DELICIOUS! Something that they're doing different than other restaurants is the option of making your pasta as an \"appetizer\" or \"entree\" portions. This is such a great idea....especially for small eaters. The appetizer portion was perfect for my date and myself. I had the Shrimp and Lobster pasta with a spicy garlic tomato sauce. My date had the Papperdelle meat pasta.  We also ordered Parmesan garlic fries and a Cobb salad.\n\nI feel like this is a perfect place to go during the spring\/summer time....when it starts to get dark later. The sunset glistening and you see the reflection on the lakes....oh mai gawd! LOL. Gorgeous...just gorgeous. Don't know how well it'll be during the colder months though. I'm sure if you're not a fan of the cold...it would be a struggle.\n\nDefinitely a great hidden gem here in our city!
