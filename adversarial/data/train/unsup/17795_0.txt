When I first moved to Toronto, I was told that you have, HAVE, to go to a Lick's burger.  I had kept this in the back of my mind and when I found myself in the Beaches area of Toronto, I happened across the Licks location there.  Time for lunch.\n\nThe bright open area for dining consists of a collection of tables surrounded by murals of ice cream, burgers, all vividly painted like a newborn's bedroom wall.  It's definitely a fun place and it's aimed at kids.  From the ice cream bar to the fact that the servers sing your orders to the cooks, it's a place that's alive with electrical fun.\n\nDon't let the interior fool you.  Yes, there is a childlike element to it, but the burgers are the thing.  Large, fresh, and tasty, once you select your condiments, you can find a seat, unwrap your meal, and enjoy a tasty burger to the tune of people behind the counter singing about cheeseburgers.
