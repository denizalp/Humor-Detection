So... I am a student turned client of this place. I absolutely love this place. The people are amazing and passionate about what they do! The clinic is run on a first come, first served basis. Since they are a school, the clinic is run like an internship, requiring a certain amount of hours in the clinic from each student, so there is never any knowing who will decide to show up for their scheduled shift. If you are willing to wait, you can not beat $25 for a massage!
