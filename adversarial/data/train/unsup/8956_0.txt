We had a great experience here at Valley Verde...Ron, the manager was very helpful he answered all the questions we had and also brought a lot of things to our attention  living in Arizona what not to get.\nWe were very impressed with his knowledge about plants, trees, and Cactus.\nWe are definitely going back to pick out plants and trees, it is great to work with a small company that gives you more attention then the larger ones.
