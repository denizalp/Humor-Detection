DON'T CONSIGN: I've been sending clothing to MSC for years, it's gone downhill to the point where I will not be consigning anything. I called today for my account balance as I am an out of state customer and Marysol told me they are changing software and HOPES they will have item level account reporting by end of July when it's mid-June leaving me with almost no visibility into my account and lack of confidence they are tracking my items and the sale of them correctly. \n\nAs far as I know, HOPE is never a strategy to build a business on and maintain customer relations with. \n\nI am waiting for the Director of Store Operations, Shannon Gabrilson to call me back with better news, in the meantime I advise other customers to not consign with. This is a case of poor business continuity planning.\n\nAdditionally, on a recent visit to the stores while I was visiting the area it looks like they have gone downhill in terms of quality designer items, it's quite messy and it makes sense why I've started to get less and less for my items.\n\nI wish I could give a better review, but they've given me no reason to justify it.\n\nUnhappy Customer
