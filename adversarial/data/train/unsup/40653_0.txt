We held an 18 person party in the 2nd floor private room- Fiermosca outdid themselves, everything about dinner was perfect- location, service, food.  Food is simple but with really fresh ingredients.  Not fancy but tasty.  I have never had a server as outstanding as Giovani.  He even gave us a chef coat for my son when jack soaked his shirt (and oops we had no back up). I said I would return it and he said \"no keep it- maybe one day jack will be a chef and this is his first coat\"!  The whole night was like that.  Hats off to Fiermosca for a stellar night!
