I was waiting for my Happy Meal in the drive thru and observed a huge amount of what I thought were crickets crawling in the rocks and on the walls of this McDonalds after a few minutes I realized they were not crickets but cockroaches!  I asked the boy at the window if he knew about them and he assured me that in Arizona everyone had cockroaches and that there were none inside.  I asked him if I could just have my 3.00 back and he would not give it to me. I ended up taking the food and trying to eat it but I couldn't and just threw it away.  I would definitely stay far, far away from this place!
