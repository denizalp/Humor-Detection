I've been with him about three weeks now, he's absolutely amazing and extremely professional. He's the only male trainer I have felt comfortable with. His knowledge is astounding, and his demeanor is calm. He pushes you to your limits and when you leave after a session with him.... You feel like a super hero. He is my ROCK, I'm glad I found him. Love you coach
