I usually bring the party to wherever I go, but boy, I didn't need to for Paladar. It was after hours and we walk in to find that the bar was hopping with energy. Filled with corporate types, the crowd was a bit more mature and didn't seem all that worried about this quarter's sales projections. All the ladies seemed to be sporting 4-inch heels that day... company memo? Anyhow...\n\nWe were seated in the non-bar area which was partitioned and well insulated from the bar noise. The meal was great, loved the guac, chips, ropa viejo, feijoada except for one. pet. peeve: damp rice. Damp rice pretty much tastes like wet towel, it was not spoiled but with a texture like this I could imagine it getting there, kinda gross, so I washed away my sorrows with the Mimosa which was delicious. The bottomless Mimosas are only available during brunch FYI.\n\nI've been here more than once and I always get good service. Counting all visits, it has been A-Ok.
