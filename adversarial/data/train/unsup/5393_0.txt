Don't go here! Because once you do...the bar will be raised, and you will forever need\/crave\/save up for this place.\n\nYes, it's a bit pricey - But you're eating RAW FISH. It's worth it. \n\nThe Salmon Sashimi was lovely : )\nBig Fan of the YellowTail.\n\nI also, had the Beef Carpaccio (I know, I know), which was to die for...and I am a sushi snob.\n\nThe fish is super fresh, the owners were attentive. Any comments about the owner being a snob might be true...but I honestly liked the guy. It's his place, and he knows what he's talking about. Basically, he's allowed to be a snob.\n\nJust go - You'll love it and you'll agree with all the other 5 star reviews.\n\nNow, if you need someone to hold your hand, and artificially smile at you while you slam your sake bombers and eat your deep friend Las Vegas rolls - This might not be the place for you. Go back to Mill.
