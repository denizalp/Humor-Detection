I came in to check out an unlocked iPhone, because I need to buy an unlocked phone for traveling overseas. The place was jam packed and there looked to be about 20 people working today. Regardless of the chaotic appearance, I was helped almost immediately and given excellent customer service. Juan was my sales assistant and is much of the reason I will return to buy their products (as soon as I'm ready to turn to the dark side). \nIf you are looking for products, or need assistance, this store is your go-to place. Get rid of the angst of walking through a mall full of millenniums. The service you receive will be worth it!
