Food was good, definitely better than most AYCEs. service satisfactory. \n\nI have 2 issues with this place though.\n\n1) Its AYCE and yet when you order something, its big enough to be one whole meal even when I specifically requested for it to be served in small portions. Server said items would be served in small individual sizes so do not worry. It was individual all right. One full meal for an individual. This pertains to the thai items mostly.\n2) Thai and japanese food just dont mix in one meal. You can't savor each cuisine properly.\n\nRecommendation: go in large groups. have a little taste of everything. bottom line, the food is pretty good.
