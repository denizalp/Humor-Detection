The old saying, \"don't judge a book by its cover\" more than applies to Yoli's Cafe.  We actually considered passing it up because the surroundings are less than appealing.  We went around a side street taking us to the entrance rather than the back by the spray painted buildings with bars on the windows.  It's actually very cute and inviting when you go around front.  There was a woman with a parrot on her shoulder talking to people sitting around in the shade.  I was intrigued but much too hungry to stop.  Anywho, it's a very small little spot and we sat out on the cute little patio.  Our server was very friendly and helpful !  Both my boyfriend and I got different skillets which I forgot the names of (sorry).  But they were both delicious !  I would definitely recommend this little spot to others if you're looking for a yummy breakfast\/brunch ! :)
