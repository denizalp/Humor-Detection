First time at a \"Boiling Crab\" establishment. Came here with some family to break bread. \n\nWell lit and spacious. Young crew working the joint. Very friendly staff (the waiter asked if I wanted him to bib me. I got it homie). But I didn't come here to rate the employees. I tried to talk about the \"other place\" to our waiter. He says,\"he's NEVER BEEN\". Interesting... :P\n\nWe get four half snow crabs and an elbow of shrimp. Da whole shabang on both with their medium spice. Flavorful, but it could have used a little more spice. I'll have to ask for that next time. HNJ got them on their medium spice. We also ordered some gumbo and WHITE RICE. I was so glad that this establishment serves this very simple side. Mix in some of their whole shabang sauce into the rice then rub it all over your BODY YO!!! It compliments the seafood that you're stuffing into your face you FAT SLOB! It's okay though, because you know you're going to run a mile later for pigging out. SIKE!!!\n\nI thought this place was great. I thought the \"other spot\" has a tad bit more \"in your face\" flavor, but I still left here a happy camper. I'm sure I'll jump back and forth from here and the other spot. I'm such a seafood slut. GUILTY!!!
