My husband and I went last night. It was Saturday at 8:00 and there were 2 tables filled. One outside and one inside. We should have known then something was wrong. We sat down and ordered 2 top shelf margaritas. The server brought us chips and salsa with our drinks. My drink was good, very strong. My husband's was weak and sweet. Two more tables were now occupied, making a total of four. There were 4 servers. Our server never came back to take our order, but I could see her sitting at the cash register eating. We finished our drinks and asked for our tab. It was $17 for the 2 drinks, chips were free. We left and went to Moochies a few doors down and had decent service and food. Bummer... I was craving Mexican food. BIG disappointment.
