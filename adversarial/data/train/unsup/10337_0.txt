Infused Tea Lounge is a great name but lacks a certain wow factor about this place. Vegas is getting to the point of having the same amount of starbucks as there are boba places and the drinks here are just \"ok.\" Hard to say that at both times I've been here the drinks were just enough to quench my thirst but no tasteful impact. Service is always friendly and the staff seem to show no hesitation to adjust the drinks (adopting the brew tea bar customer satisfaction method) but not enough to make me a regular.
