Amazing ingredients for really some fresh and tasty fare. Organic vegetarian and wholesome. The people are very welcoming and warm. The guests seem to be very diverse and enjoy a good read. Anytime we want to Eat out..the wife just thinks of this place first. May appear  slightly expensive ... But it's worth the quality.
