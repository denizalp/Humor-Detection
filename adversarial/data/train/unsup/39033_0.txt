Its hard for me to give this restaurant a higher star rating. This is not due to the food by any means. The food is excellent and very genuine. I do however, take issue with the service. Everyone is pleasant enough, but none of the wait staff or take out order employees seem to have any concept of time. I have dined in at the restaurant for lunch a couple of times with other colleagues. We have a typical hour lunch break and this establishment is a mere 5 mins away. Lets just say both times we told the server we would be in a hurry due to work and both times we were at least 20 to 30 minutes late. Lesson learned. So we resorted to calling in our order for pick up. We were told it would be ready in 10 mins. \n\nThat was a sheer fabrication as both times we arrived and paid and waited for another 30 minutes for our food at the pick up window. (AKA bar). Now, why do we keep giving them another chance? Well, that's simple, it is the only authentic indian food in a 10 mile radius. Trust me, if we had other options we'd take them. \n\nBottom line: Great Food! Crap Service!
