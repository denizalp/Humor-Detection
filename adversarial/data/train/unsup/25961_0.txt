Please beware of this business establishment.  On a visit, I had taken my blazer for a fitting, and even brought my brother with me to fit his suit.  I lost all hope when the owners son came and started aggressively and abruptly talking over me, kept changing the price when his father told me another price, and firmly disrespected me when I questioned why the price changed? After I was insulted, I took my clothes and left.  They overcharge and have most of the undocumented sweatshop workers in the back that needs to be investigated.\n\nThere are so many better options with superior service then this tailor, who actually doesn't do it themselves and outsources it to sweatshop workers.  Look for a private tailor who's prices are reasonable and actually do it themselves.  Trust me on this!
