I have always had pretty good experiences at this location of CVS. This is currently the pharmacy I am using to fill my scripts and the pharmacists have always been very helpful and friendly. The overall layout of this CVS store is nice. It is really easy to find what you are looking for.\n\nThere is also one very nice cashier who usually works nights and she is very friendly and we always have good conversation. Overall I would recommend this pharmacy to friends living in the area.
