This is an awesome museum, starting with the beautiful and well manicure landscape around the parking lot to the vast collection of musical instruments.\n\nGeneral admission is $20, teen between 13-19 is $15, children 4-12 is $10, young kids are free.  No discount of any kind.  Hours: 9-5\n\nIt is a self guided tour, you are giving a headphone,  when standing in front of  TV you will hear music or a narrative of that particular display.  It's a vast array of musical instruments through the ages of every country, island and continents you can think of and much more. \n\nFirst floor is about artists, second floor is instruments.  We spent 3 hours here but could go for another hour or two more.  So be sure to give yourself plenty of time to explore.\n\nIt's truly a world class museum,  well worth the time and money!
