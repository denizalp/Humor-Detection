Gone for 3 weeks, and voila...this place pops open. Literally. \n\nI walked in still with a grieve in my heart over fresh n easy. Upon walking in, Dorothy knew she wasn't in Kansas. But you know what?! It don't matter! It is just nice to have a store within our vicinity offering such items! I mean come on, folks, it's not like Fresh N Easy had a ridiculous amount of inventory. It's a neighborhood store. Just enough to have what you may be in need of. Quite honestly, 4 stars for me because though there was a moment I was hoping to see or find more...Natural Grocers literally has everything I\/I'd need without having to make a 20 minute drive. Though some items might be a little more pricey, but consider it a convenience fee. \n\nMommy of 4 on the go here so most times my ass does not have the patience to drive all the way to the west side for organic\/vegan friendly\/gluten free\/nut free\/dairy free items or to the nearest vitamin shoppe for our homeopathic needs. 5 minutes up the road, sold.\n\nWelcome to the north side, Natural Grocers!\n\nDefinitely recommend if you're someone like me! Stroller friendly! Keep those kiddos hands tucked in because swiper no swiping!\n\nEnjoy!
