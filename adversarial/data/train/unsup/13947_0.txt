The girl taking my order was very rude and even though I repeated twice I simply wanted two containers of burrito sauce, by the time I got my food she said I can't have that and she will have to charge me and started arguing with me... even though I asked at the register for it. I did not appreciate the attitude and rudeness of the typical Woodbridge girl at the cash. Should probably screen employees a little better for customer service.
