I haven't been to other Johnny Rockets so I can't compare them but from the 2 times that I have been to the one on Langtree Rd and I have to say both times the burgers where juicy and hot as where the fries. I see when they first opened there where some opening blues, which is understandable, but I think they have worked out there kinks, the burgers I had where juicy and very tasty. They are expensive but I don't think you can get a gormet burger cheap in Charlotte area.
