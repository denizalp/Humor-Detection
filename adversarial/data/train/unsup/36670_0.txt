My miniature schnauzer seems to enjoy this place. He is very skeptical of anyone outside of his family, and this seems to be the only place he'll allow others to handle him. The staff is also very attentive and understand his ways! It's very easy to make an appointment with them and charge $45 for his bath and grooming.
