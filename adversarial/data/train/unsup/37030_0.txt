Great time at Vintage 95 Saturday night!  Started out with happy hour wines, deviled eggs and garlic fries. Garlic fries were OK, but the eggs were phenomenal!\n\nWe then moved to a table and had the scallop appetizer.  Great presentation and excellent preparation.  Followed that w\/ the Ahi with Kimchee, on rice cake with a hot pepper sauce!  Outstanding prep for the ahi, seared just so lightly.  The Kimchee had a dry heat type of seasoning which was unusual and excellent.  The hot pepper sauce went great with the Ahi.  Wife had the Bruschetta mix, which was equally good. \n\nWrapped it up with the coconut and banana Tres Leches.  Well made,  and not overly sweet.  Couple these wins with the knowledge of Jason the Somelier and our waiter Axel, and Vintage 95 is a must do again!
