We were looking for a family friendly, fun place, to watch the World Cup.  They got an outside patio, inside bar area, and another bar and lounge area upstairs.  We elected the upstairs area and settled in to watch the match.\n\nMajority of us all ordered Fish and Chips, with one dissenter, electing a burger.\n\nFood was hot, fresh and tasteful!\n\nFun times and very family friendly!
