I didn't think I would be overly impressed with a chain restaurant but I absolutely love this place.\n\nWe got the chicken enchilada nachos and they were amazing. Hot and gooey on every level of chip; a nacho lovers dream. I ordered the street tacos and they were also fantastic. If you're into cheesy bastardized mexican fare, like I am, you won't be disappointed. \n\nThe food was delicious, the service was great and This Guy below me blaming his timing and menu issues on the waitress can eat a bag of dicks.
