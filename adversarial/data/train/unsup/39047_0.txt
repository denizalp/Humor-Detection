**BE AWARE**\n\nI came here on a Wednesday and asked to buy a new tire. They said they didn't have my size tire at the time but they can give me a temporary tire now and I could come back on Friday for the new one. (Tire costed $40) I went ahead and did it since I was using my car's dummy tire at the time.\n\nI came back on Friday around 11am and was told they didn't have the tire yet and to come back at 1pm. Came back at 1pm and was told I have to come back again after 5pm. At this point I was very upset and left. \n\nI ended up not going back after 5pm and went first thing Monday morning. Great news they had my tire. \n\nThe gentleman changed my tire and I was on my way. Well so...... I thought. I headed back to work (which is less than 2 miles away) and a coworker tells me \"your tire is flat\" I went outside to check and my tire was flat to the grown. \n\nI called them and they said \"are you sure it was our tire\" I answered \"yes, I just left your shop less than an hour ago\" \n\nI had to put my dummy tire back on and drove there. When I got there, they checked it and said \"it has a hole\" I ask from what?? I don't see a nail or nothing. They replied \"well it wasn't like this when we sold it to you, it's $10 to fix the tire\" \n\nI was very upset at this point and told them \"are you kidding me, I bought a new tire from you and your telling it has a hole (less than an hour) the guy got mad and just said well patch it for free. \n\nHorrible service! Don't come here and if you don't speak Spanish.... turn around.
