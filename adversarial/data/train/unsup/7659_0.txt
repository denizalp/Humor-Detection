Was in Vegas for a conference and a fellow member suggested this place for some awesome food. Many many thanks! This place is a gem! First of all the view is amazing!! (See picture) It's a great panoramic view of the strip. The restaurant is located a few miles off so it's nice and quiet with a large private parking lot so you don't have to deal with Vegas parking. \n\nOn to the food. Starter was the fritto misto. It was good, but I wasn't wowed. Their wine selection is amazing! This place makes their own pasta. A definite bonus! One of my colleagues got the fettuccini with blacked shrimp (house-made pasta). Wow!! It was delicious. The noodles were silky but still had a nice chew to it. The other colleague got the tagliatelle with short rib (also house-made). Now on to my dish.... The game winning shot... The Ossobuco with saffron risotto. Omg this dish was a beast. The Ossobuco came bone in... WITH BONE MARROW. Yup! I'd say this is the best Ossobuco i've ever had and the risotto was decadent as well. Finished off with a scoop of pistachio ice cream because Vegas.. That's why.
