I absolutely love coming here. The staff is amazing and so funny. They're always playing great music. It's close to home, and the drinks are WAY better than Starbucks or any other coffee house I've ever been to. Being Mexican myself, I love seeing a small Hispanic business succeed, and Tres Leches has a loyal customer in me. \nMy favorite drink has to be the Tres Aztecas. So good and chocolatey and rich! My sister always orders the Tres de la Rosa Licuado that comes with a Mazapan. That one is also very tasty! Their pastry case is full of delicious Mexican cookies and treats! I don't think there is a single thing that we havw tried that we didn't like.\nThe only down side to this place (and I'm sorry but people need to know) is that it's not handicap friendly. My sister has fibromyalgia and can't get around easily. The steps outside are particularly hard to climb up. The tables are tight together so it's also hard for her to maneuver around. I think it speaks volumes when it hurts her to even get through the front door of this place, and yet, everytime this place comes up, she's so ready for it. We love this place so much! Keep up the great work!
