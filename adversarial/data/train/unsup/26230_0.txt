We have live in Surprise now for 10 years.  We have had many different experiences with this Chilis, most very good.  Lately however, slow service, no refills on our drinks, and just poor service.  We do like most of the food, but today I ordered off the lunch menu, quesadillas with a sauce that was God Awful.  Our waitress was so busy chatting it up with another table, that I couldn't get her attention.  The quesadillas were good, but needed more to drink and wanted ranch sauce to replace the yucky sauce.  Paid using the Ziosk machine, and never saw her.
