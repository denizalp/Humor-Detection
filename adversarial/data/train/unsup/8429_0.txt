This place must be in heaven thinking they got a one star from me when in reality they deserve a whopping ZEEEEERRROOOOOO. I mean, hey, we all must be idiots if we trusted the 5 star reviews written by people with two reviews.\n\nThe guy at the counter was a double d douchebag. You sir, run or own a flower shop - flowers are naturally beautiful and you managed kill them with your doom and gloom. I'm guessing this is the store that beautiful flowers, personality, and all things good and wholesome come to die. \n\nThis guy was so pissed that I said I liked the dahlias but didn't want him to wrap them up for me that I'm pretty sure I heard him hiss. At $4 a piece, you can put those dahlias in a gold pot. Oh I don't mind that you corrected the way I pronounce dahlias and I don't mind that you pretended not to notice there were 4 people who all walked out of your store at the same time after witnessing your attitude but I do mind that you forgot to put a sign outside that said 'do not disturb'. At least then, we would have known not to come in. \n\nThe only way that you can pay rent is if you are laundering money because I find it impossible to believe that you could even sell a bouquet to someone who desperately needed it for a wedding that was to begin in 30 minutes and you were the only flower shop open in town!! You definitely would sell out at the fair to celebrate the global death of humanity. \n\nLack of pleasantries aside, this shop is ridiculously overpriced. There were plants for $40 that even McEwans sells potted for $15. \n\nHere's a thought .....read these reviews, think about what good customer service and a little kindness can do and change. Don't be stubborn and just do it. You might be able to even pass off those super priced items to some unsuspecting chump with a little smile. \n\nGood luck. I can't wait to see what business opens up next here as soon as this Ecowaste shuts down.
