Bar + karaoke = fun.  Bar + libations + karaoke = funner.\n\nSeriously, the times they are a changing.  Just like your quintessential all-you-can-eat made for mass consumption sushi places, the \"book\" is a dinosaur.  It's archaic, legacy, and might as well spell out the prelude to extinction.  \n\nWhat do I mean by this?  Have you gone to a karaoke place and used the \"book\"?  You know where maybe songs are in a quasi-organized alphabetical order by song only, not by artist and there's no real index or way of finding what you're looking for?  Some of these books are big, jumbled and eventually obsolete.  Order by artist?  Perhaps not, perhaps but just like Encyclopedia Britannica,  you're left with a stack of pages of that were printed way back when Lotus 123 was the only spreadsheet program and Microsoft Excel wasn't even at inception.\n\nWhile karaoke can be considered fun, looking for codes to songs that you can't find because the book is such a hot mess is not.  Just like the AYCE sushi counterpart printed check lists and a pencil are like the Asian Speak and Spells with trying to punch in song codes.  I'll be one to say that F that technology because having a tablet with photos, search, sorting is so much simpler and being literally at your fingertips is superior supreme.  It's the difference between using a hard copy address book and dialing on a rotary phone versus going to your favorites in contacts and simply tapping a name to make a call.\n\nTablets with a user friendly interface are for the WIN.  Now, if I haven't stressed vehemently enough that I prefer selecting songs by using a tablet let me just come out and say it.  The books, burn them like it's a Handmaid's Tale, like it's the Hunger Games, like it's 1984 because dayummm having a tablet makes me feel like it's 2012 versus 19 something or other when 33rpm meant something.  Oh, Bar + has this by the way which is why I'm completely going off on them having this option.  I like the option can you tell?  Well, can you?\n\nOnce you go tablet, there's no going back and I seriously mean that.  I can't honestly step into another karaoke place and use that BOOK ever again.  I've been spoiled like my adorable niece and I swear there is simply no going back to the BOOK.  It would be like trying to build the Berlin wall again.  No.  We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.  Yes, that's a song, a Taylor Swift song no doubt but that wasn't the song I tried to sing.  It was my Favorite Taylor Swift song, Sparks Fly which I learned that I can't mentally or physically go down an octave and that it sounds so much better when she's singing it instead of me.  \n\nSume D (aka Miss Congeniality) has a VIP card here which she purchased for some completely nominal amount.  This allowed a small group of 4 of us to book a room at Bar + for an hour and half on a weekday (was it a Tuesday?) and it was barely 8 bucks a piece.  Hello, that was such a good deal.  The room we had was well sized for our group and although we had to fiddle a bit with the main system because some songs were much louder than others, overall it wasn't hard to figure out.  That tablet though... it was along the lines of the Star Trek universe where it felt like we were cave man before and now somebody just dropped a Federation piece of technology on us.  The Prime Directive being violated in this instance is acceptable.\n\nBar + = greater than (can't use those characters here, code you know) *.* karaoke places out there =\/= tablets. \n\nEND
