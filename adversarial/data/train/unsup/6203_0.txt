If I could put zero stars I would. Food was delicious,  service is horrible. The waiter (which is also the owner) didn't greet us, never refilled our drinks, walked away right when my friend was about to order. I mean I was shocked. We were the only ones in there and it took about 20 minutes after we were done eating to finally let us know that we pay at the front. The owner ignored us every time we tried asking for something, literally at every given request. Then towards the end we wanted to mention that he could have been nicer and needed to improve on the service and some lady that claims to be his family member started screaming at us and cursing at us to get out if we didn't like the food. I attempted at managing to explain that the food was delicious , we were simply trying to help him improve with the service because we weren't happy. This unknown family member proceeded to yell at us for having a very liberated opinion, which I believe any customer should be entitled to, and swore at us. I went on to explain to his family member that we owned a business and if a customer wasn't happy with our service, we would apologize and ask how we could improve. She said she didn't care and actually got into my sister's face as if she was going to assault her. I threatened to call the police. The owner apologized on her behalf. We stormed off.  I was completely shocked. They acted like animals and treated us like dirt for simply being dissatisfied with horrible service! We walked out of the restaurant completely ruffled and astonished. I have never in my life experienced ridiculousness like this. This place is a zoo! NEVER again.
