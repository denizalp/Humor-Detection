This place has been a staple on the Danforth for many many years.  I came here with 3 friends for dinner.  The decor and atmosphere of the place is nice and pleasing.\n\nThe AYCE menus offer a decent selection of expected hot items such as beef & salmon teriyaki, a small selection of udon, tempura, miso soup, etc.  While the sushi choices were the standard sashimi (salmon, white tuna, yellowtail, etc) and rolls (dragon, rainbow, unagi, etc).\n\nThere is a two-hour dine-in time limit but that isn't a surprise to any AYCE'er.\n\nEverything tasted satisfying but nothing really stood out compared to some of the other AYCE places.\n\nWe all felt satisfied after the meal with nary a feeling of hunger remaining.\n\nWe went on a weekday where I felt the price was more competitive and got great service.
