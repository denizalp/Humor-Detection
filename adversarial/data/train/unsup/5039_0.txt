The best hotel and casino in North Las Vegas!\n\nI had the opportunity to stay at the brand new Aliante this past weekend for an event.  Since the event was located at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway it made sense to stay here, the hotel is located 20 mins from the Strip and only 10 mins from the track.  I've stayed at the Cannery hotel before and this puts that place to shame.  I've also stayed at Aliante's sister hotel the Red Rock hotel and was just as impressed.\n\nAtmosphere: \nAliante is very clean and modern.  Once inside the casino is small and full of table games, slots, and restaurants.  The decor was nice and pleasant inside the casino as well.  The hotel was an even better treat.  The hotel has a tall ceiling and the lobby area is full of modern furniture to lounge on.\n\nVenues:\nAliante is full of great restaurants, a food court, ETA Lounge, Access Showroom, and a full movie theatre.  I checked out Camacho's for drinks and the margarita selection was amazing.  Pips Italian food and wine bar also caught my eye with the decor, but I didn't have a chance to eat there.  ETA Lounge was really sleek and made for a great place to grab a few cocktails and relax in the the dark room.  Drinks were about average and they had a great selection of alcohol.  I didn't get to see Steel Panther perform at Access on Saturday night, but did get a tour of it later and it is a great place.  Bigger than Wasted Space at the Hard Rock...this venue has tons of potential for both concerts and as a nightclub.\n\nThe food court was complete with a Dunkin Donuts, Rubios, and few others...definitely good choices when on the run.\n\nThe buffet was also a treat for the cost.  $12 or so w\/players card for Sunday brunch! Can't beat that deal.  The assortment of food was also good and most of the items I tried were good.  The ice cream is also a good touch.\n\nNext time I will be sure to try their surf and turf place MRKT and the original Pancake house.\n\nCasino:\nGood choice of games.  For a smaller hotel\/casino great selection and easy to find a table or slot machine.  There is a blackjack pit similar to the \"Pleasure Pit\" at Planet Hollywood and the one at Hard Rock, with girls in small outfits.  One bad side is the talent level was not  up to par...the games started at $5 hands, which is really hard to find.  My one gripe is that the Blackjack rules were changed for this weekend and player's were only allowed to double down with a 10 or 11 and could only split once...making the house have the advantage, as player's can't maximize their good hands.  I still walked away \"up\" so can't complain too much.\n\nHotel:\nI was fortunate enough to get the presidential treatment and because of my work was able to stay in their Presidential Suite.  This was one of the nicest if not the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in!  I'm confident this suite is larger than my condo.  2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, a living room area, dining area, kitchen, and bar area.  70\" plasma, surround sound, plasmas in everyroom including the bathroom in the mirror, and in the bar.  The furniture was modern and amazing.  Everything was controlled via a remote control from the lights, TV, DVD, to the curtains.\n\nThe beds were great too, not the softest or plushest, but nice.  Could of used softer sheets like the W or Encore.  Plenty of closet space and drawers too.\n\nThe bedroom bathrooms were incredible.  The bathtub was state of the art with multiple jets, lights, and even filled with water from the ceiling!  There was a large mirror w\/ a tv and side mirror.  The towels could of been a little more plush and larger, but did the job.  The glass shower was great as well complete with shower head that rained and 3 jets of water. But the best part by far was the amazing toilets!  Automatically opens when you stand in front, heated seat, bidet function, remote with multiple ways to use it, and one-touch flush.\n\nAmenities:\n- plasma TV's w\/ cable\n- free wi-fi access\n- access to the business center in the lobby\n- mini store in lobby\n- 24 hour FREE Fitness Center\n- free parking w\/ valet available\n- parking structure available\n\nRoom Service:\nAs we had such as great room, we took advantage and stayed in for dinner.  Food was fast and quick.  Good selection.  We dined on the chicken strips, burger, and side of veggies, while watching the provided copies of Entourage that was included with the room.\n\nPool:\nThe pool area was like Red Rock's only smaller.  It had cabanas and nice seats.  The pool was large.  As it was way too cold to test it out I look forward to it in July when I return.\n\nOverall, great place to stay especially if you want to get away from the crowds or need to be near the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.  I'm sure locals love this place as it can be a vacation away from a vacation town.
