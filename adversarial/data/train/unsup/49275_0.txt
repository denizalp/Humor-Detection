I've been contemplating trying this place....I was not disappointed! I had the Bulgogi and regular fries. I probably should have asked for hot sauce...It would have been over the top with hot sauce. Fries were good. I'll definitely go back. Next time i'll try something spicy! They have my recommendation. The cashier was nice. My only qualm was the strange looks from the cooks. They looked as if I was interrupting their conversation. A smile goes a long way and if you can't smile, don't make eye contact.
