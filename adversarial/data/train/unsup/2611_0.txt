I have never thanked God for Friday's but it was late, options were scarce and I was overruled on this occasion.  Immediately I was greeted by stench and a slippery floor so pregnant ladies beware (my sister is pregnant and was having a hard time).\n\nOur waiter was pretty charismatic and dealt well with my companions (I.e. my pastor was with me and asked if they could play Gospel music and other annoying little things). He wasn't that speedy but he was nice. \n\nI ordered Cajun chicken and shrimp after I was assured it was tasty. My table mates ordered ribs, chicken wings, shrimp, broccoli and fries respectively. \n\nWhen my food came out I knew it would be trash. Immediately. On sight. Throw the whole plate away. \nI did not spot a single spec of seasoning. No pepper, no Cajun.. nothing Jesus. The sauce was a weird pastel yellow color.. yikes. I tried it anyway..., gross. Worse than a knorr pasta side. My sister suggested I add the Cajun butter to it... took ten minutes to come out but it made a WORLD of difference.\n\n3\/4 ribs looked really dry. But the jack Daniels ribs looked superb. Reports say the fries were eh as was the broccoli.\n\nOverall not a good time for my tummy but I made it through.
