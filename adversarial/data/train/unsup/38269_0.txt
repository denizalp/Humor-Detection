The food is good and comes out SO FAST. I am impressed! I don't have to pay the meter in the garage for more than 40 min.\n\nMy favoritie dish here is the Massaman Curry with Shrimp. Oh sweet potato and roasted peanuts...so divine.\n\nPad Thai is sweet but I like it that way.\n\nThe portions are perfect.\n\nOnly gripe about this place is that a waitress once told me I didn't tip enough (and I sure did- and isn't tip supposed to be optional anyway?). She asked for more and I didn't think that was very classy!!
