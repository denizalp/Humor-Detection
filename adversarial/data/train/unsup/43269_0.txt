This is the building that is before (coming from uptown) the Bojangles Coliseum\/Ovens Auditorium.\n\n224k sq. feet of exhibit space doesn't seem like a lot when you're walking around the Southern Spring Show.  I expected it to be larger, but oh well.\n\nIt was clean and easy to navigate through.  I didn't go to the cafeteria or snack bar areas, so I don't know about that.\n\nIf you have a mid-sized event, this can be a great venue.
