I stopped in for the first time ever to make a Shared Branching transaction back on Dec. 31th.  It was approximately 2:15 p.m. and there were three tellers present.  I literally stood there for at least a minute without any of them acknowledging my presence.  They seemed more concerned about closing out for the day, with it being New Year's Eve and all, instead of servicing their sole customer.  Yes, I was the ONLY  one in the lobby and all of their heads were down, concentrating on whatever task they were each doing.\n\nWhen one finally greeted me after a minute of silence and asked if they could help me, they couldn't.  She didn't know how to process a Shared Branching transaction or couldn't for some reason.  I was helped by another teller.\n\nNot the best first impression your credit union gave me and based on it, Alhambra Credit Union doesn't deserve to have that heart on its signage.  Disappointing.  I will NOT be coming back and will use another credit union for my Shared Branching transactions.
