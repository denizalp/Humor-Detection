Their Soy 'meat' is a must try! I would recommend it to people who are meat eaters as well. I always get a burrito bowl and my most recent experience they gave me extra guac which was a great plus. Good if you're craving a burrito, one of the better burrito joints in my opinion. \n\nTheir hot sauce is pretty hot so 1-2 drops will do you just fine. I also like the taste of their vegetables all fresh tasting (raw tomatoes, peppers & lettuce). \n\nOverall never disappoints and I love that they're always open late at night.
