The place suuuuucccckkkss!  Fine, the waitress said she couldn't close my bar tab after checking with the bartender while she was getting our drinks (and she didn't even ask my name to make a good attempt at pretending), fine it was an hour and a half wait to get fries after ordering them, fine the onion rings came out cold after waiting one hour, fine the ham\/egg\/cheese sandwich came out cold (probably sat at the window for a bit less than an hour), fine the med-rare burger came out med-well, fine when i tried to leave to eat at local bistro they offered to comp my food if I left that I never received (I went back as waitress said food was almost done, my big mistake), fine they comp'd desert I didn't want that came out undercooked and had to  wait again for them to make a second attempt, fine they dropped and shattered a plate on one of the guests at our table... At least we got 25% ($10) off the bill.  Can't wait to go back and flush 3 hours of my life down the drain...awesome!  oh..also the $1 pbr special, fine u lied and not one of the five we ordered was $1... At least food was better than McDonald's, but at least there u get food within an hour that is cooked and they actually charge you the advertised price (granted whether McDonald's is quality food ...well it's a personal choice).  I choose to eat low quality food that will take 2 hours off my life rather than the 3 hours the grind @ greyhawk took off my life.
