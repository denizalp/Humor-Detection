I would have liked to comment on the actual food, music, and beverages here, but I can only comment on the horrible experience of having my friend verbally abused by the staff.  My friend highly recommended this place and wanted to return -- this time bringing me along.  While the place was packed, the guy at the front door started yelling at my friend for asking if it was okay to sit\/stand in the back by the bar and just get drinks.  Why would you call a potential customer \"an idiot\" and yell at him to get him to leave?\n\nThis really was the most horrible experience I've had in a long time, and I never plan on re-entering their premises.  If people working at this place treat their customers like this, then I have no doubt this place will either shut down or be under new management.
