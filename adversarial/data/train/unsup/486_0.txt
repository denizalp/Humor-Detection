They say their patio is \"dog friendly\".  Yet, then the waiter comes up to me and explains that my dog can't sit in my lap though.  She has to be on the ground.  She's a 5lb yorkie.  So give me a break.  Such bullshit.  Either you are dog friendly or not!  Not to mention service was also terrible.  Will not be back.
