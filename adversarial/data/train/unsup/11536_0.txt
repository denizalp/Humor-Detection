Wow this place is bananas.  And as you all know bananas are good!  Some really creative and delicious burgers.  This place blows the Burger Bar inside Mandalay out of the water and doesn't leave a hole in your wallet .  Those donuts they have, OMFG I think they put crack cocaine in them.  They are so addicting.  \n\nAdded bonus it's close by the office.  Kiki Burger, sauteed shitaki mushrooms.  That is my recommendation and I added some Thai Chili Paste for that extra heat.
