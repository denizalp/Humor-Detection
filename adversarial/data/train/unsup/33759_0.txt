I  contacted john from Bike and forth to service a Daymak  rickshaw  3 wheel  s bike\nThat was given to me due to my mobility  and every time we talked the price went up, I was told new batteries were needed and one inner tube, I mentioned at the beginning that  it was to be lubed an checked out upon delivery it was transported on its side breaking the side plastic fender it hadn't, been lubed nor were. Any parts tightened  as far as promises that we're made and came back without an alarm and mirror that haven't been fixed , I could never recommend this company ,with the attitude he was doing me a favour  never again
