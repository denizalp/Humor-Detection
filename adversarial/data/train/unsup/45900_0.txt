One lady at front was very rude on several occasions. I will get her name and update. Another persons review used the word \"cold\"to describe her & it was perfect. This person was so annoyed and rude & she didn't want to correct an issue sighing often making sure I knew how annoyed she was with me. She was a tall blonde but again I dont have her name.. Yet. Rude in person & on the phone. Then an Asian girl at the front ignored me and another person for several minutes while at the counter while she gossiped about another employee. She could've at least said I'll be right with you or something but just went on. The actual estitician who does the waxing is great and she is the only reason why I gave 3 stars. If it were based on the waxer alone (Shasta is her name), she'd get 5 stars, but because of the \"tall larger blonde\" rude woman and her sighs (that's the only way I can describe her), I had to give less. If you do go, I recommend Shasta. She saved this review from being a 1 star.
