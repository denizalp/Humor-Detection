ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  \n\nI have lived in Charlotte for 3 1\/2 years and only ate here for the first time tonight?  I apologize to my tastebuds.  \n\nPulled pork, ribs, pot roast, chicken.....each one had an incredible smokey flavor and were cooked just perfectly.  I can't get over how excellent those ribs were....great bark on them, not too cooked down but not too tough either.  \n\nGreen beans and mac'n cheese were excellent as well. \n\nEven got dessert...best coconut pie and pecan pie i have ever eaten.  You can tell it was homemmade! \n\nService was great, atmosphere was fun. \n\nDo yourself a favor and stop going to Mac's and make this place your go to (don't forget about Bobbee O's in Northlake too though because they still have the best brisket around).
