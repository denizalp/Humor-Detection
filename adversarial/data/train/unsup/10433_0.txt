This place is racist, which is ironic since they serve Japanese food in here. We came here for a group dinner. We paid a tip at around 12-15% at the end. One waitress came and say \"next time please tip above 18%. I know no tip in China, but This is United States. If u wanna good food and good service u need to pay more. I used to work in a Chinese restaurant and they put tip amount in the check. We are not like that so u need to tip at least 18%. That's how it works here.\" I told her I am offended. She said \"we r very busy. (Which is not true, at the time they only have two other tables) No time talk. If u r done, I will collect dishes now.\" \nI am very shocked by the attitude and the words she had said. I definitely would not come here again and I do not recommend their food that much either.
