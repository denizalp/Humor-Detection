Really good sandwiches. Line is usually long in the morning so try to get there early . The ketchup on the basic egg cheese and bacon sandwich is a little strange so if you're not huge on ketchup get it without. My boyfriend got the waygu beef sandwich and it was delicious! Coffees are small so I would get the fresh squeeze OJ and grab a coffee somewhere else after. Overall good breakfast and would come back
