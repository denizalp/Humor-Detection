This club is so poorly managed.  I have been an (unhappy) member for 15 years.  The gym is filthy and gross, the equipment never works, there is no wi fi, cable is intermittent, and no one at the desk upstairs or down to complain to.  The spa and steam room are awful and beyond gross! No one has any idea what is going on there.  The snack shop is not open and the grill has very limited hours, the food is expensive, small portions and not very good, yet as a member you are required to meet a rather large food 6mos minimum. Not an easy task, since they are barely open for business!  No cart girl either!  Just excuse after excuse.  Terrible!  Its giving our wonderful neighborhood a bad name! So sorry I contributed $$$ to save this club when it was in peril. What a colossal disappointment.  If you live in this neighborhood don't get sucked into the siren song of this Club, they have no idea what they are doing.
