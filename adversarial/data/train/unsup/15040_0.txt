Had to stop in here right quick.  Little one had to drop a deuce when she and I were walking around the Falls.  Very nice lady at the front desk.  Place is super clean and organized!  A tad on the smaller side but the erotic novel section was impressive to say the least.  There are worse places to take a dump on a Sunday afternoon strut...
