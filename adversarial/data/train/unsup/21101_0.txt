Touro is a Brazilian steakhouse which follows the typical green (feed me) and red (I'm full) coaster format.  First one I went to like this was Texas de Brazil, in Texas of course.  That restaurant is a winner through and through.  Touro is not quite there, but I can safely say it's better than Copacabana or Brasa in Niagara.\n\nI'm glad to see they opened up a patio and added an a la carte menu.  The AYCE is way to heavy and pricy for lunch.  If you want to have a chance of survival in East Beaver Creek area, you need a lunch crowd.  As is the interior, the patio is decked out.  Beautiful couch seating on imitation grass , comfortable table seating, TVs to watch the World Cup, etc.\n\nStarted with the 50% off Caipirinha (thanks Yelp!).  Not often I try a truly unique drink, so that was a treat.  Similar to mojito, but not quite.\n\nNext was the coconut shrimp appetizer.  Good sized shrimp, fried properly, and a sweet sauce with just enough spice.\n\nLastly, after seeing Jennifer K's picture, I ordered the Brazilian cheesesteak.  If I wasn't lazing around I would complain that it took 30 mins after my app to come out.  Just after finishing that sentence I was brought a complimentary beer, all is good in the world.  My cheesesteak was very good, had a pretzel type bun and loads of steak.  Should have skipped the app, but as always my eyes are bigger than my stomach.
