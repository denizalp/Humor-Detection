I've had this place bookmarked when it was still on the boat. I've had this place bookmarked when I thought po'boy was an offensive term for a male child of dire financial situations. Yes, it's been on my list for a long time and I've been hunting for a soft shell crab sandwich for well over a decade. Together with my SO, I've been able to try multiple items and not just the sandwich. So here we go, let's dive in!\n\nSoft shell crab sandwich: This sandwich is awe-inspiring. It's as big as my face and the crab's limbs are just sprawled outside the buttery buns in the most fantastic fashion. Taste-wise, good but not exceptional. I guess since I was looking forward to this for so long, I thought it'd blow my mind. Soft shell crab has a very unique and delicate flavour, but unfortunately it got lost in the batter. And while the batter was well-seasoned, and the sandwich was quite tasty, it just didn't wow me. \n\nThe Fob: Great flavour combination with the fried catfish, the sauce, and the kimchi...when you can get all of it in your mouth. This submarine sandwich was a beast. Also note to others, catfish has a very fishy flavour that might be off putting to some. \n\nLobster Roll: I'm gonna assume that the rolls at the pop-up shops are the same as the ones in store. Large, chunky bites of lobster with a buttery hint wrapped inside warm buns. This is probably my favourite item out of everything I tried and something I would order again (but at the restaurant since it's much cheaper)\n\nSnow crab fries: Well fried fries with a mound of shredded snow crab and light sauce. It wasn't particularly memorable but I remember them tasting pretty good.\n\nOverall, decent, tiny (emphasis on tiny) place for some greasy and crispy comfort food from the sea. Though it's not as amazing as I thought it would be, it's still a solid 4 star and I'd be glad to return. Fresh off the boat, landed in deep fried goodness.\n\n(71\/100) - 2016
