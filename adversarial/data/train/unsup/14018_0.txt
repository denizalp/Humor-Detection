This place is random.  R A N D O M random.  I don't \"get\" it.\nWent for lunch, while taking a break from medical testing at the Mayo Clinic.  This place was empty.  Ok, there were a half dozen other people there, but it barely counts with the size of the place.\nNow, I like that there is a stage (guess who thought of doing comedy there???!!!) and that they have live music that promotes local bands.  I am all for that.  But, there comes a point when you can't have the place seem too classy for that sort of thing.  Framed pictures of different musical icons are nice, but overplayed.  Everywhere else.  \nIt just doesn't work here at Compound Grill.\nI had the fish n chips for lunch.  5 nuggets of fish places over a bowl of fries that weren't anything special.  When will people stop serving shoestring fries????  It was cool that everything was served in a bowl made from an old record that had been warped into...the shape of a bowl, though.  \nService was friendly and attentive.  The manager or owner or whoever he was also present.  I'm guessing because they though there would be a lunch rush.\nFor this area, in N Phoenix, so close to the 101\/51 and N Scottsdale, I would expect a bigger lunch crowd.  Without it, I guess shows I'm not the first person to just find the place \"meh.\"
