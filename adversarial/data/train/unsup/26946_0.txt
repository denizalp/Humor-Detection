This is definitely one of my go to date night places! The service is always impeccable and courteous. The prices are seriously reasonable for the food and for the atmosphere. I love the bread and sauce that comes when you first sit down. That's definitely one of the biggest highlights. The wine selection is nice and the pasta is to die for. As well as all the pizzas! My favorite choice is the filet mignon though! It's so good!
