Where do you go when you are extremely hungry, have a yen for asian food and only have $13 to spend?  As long as you don't mind the sparse and tacky feel of being in a place that looks like it used to be a dime store in it's prior life then The Great Wall could just be the place.\n\nHey, ambience costs more.  The buffet is $9.95; drinks (soda, milk, tea) is extra.  The waitresses are very attentive and refill drinks without being asked at no additional charge.\n\nCome when they first open.  You may have to wait a few minutes for them to finish bringing out all the food but it's worth the wait.  At least you will have first pickings and it's all fresh.\n\nLots of dim sum in addition to what you expect to see at Panda.  They throw in a little Japanese tempura and a little Thai just for good measure.  All the dishes are marked clearly and indicate whether it's hot or spicy.  Personally, I am partial to the baby octopuss, crab puffs and baos.  For the kiddies there is some \"American\" fare like salad, jello and egads, chicken nuggets.\n\nIt's kinda funny really, but if you are not picky, what the heck.\n\nThis is not gourmet by any means, but they won't try to chase you out and they are kid friendly.\n\nIf buffet is not your \"thing\" they do have a regular menu, but why bother?
