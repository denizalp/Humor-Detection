This LUSH is too small to be in the Scottsdale mall. There is literally not enough room for all the products, staff, and shoppers!!! I hate visiting this LUSH simply because I feel claustrophobic and rushed (trying to get out of the crowded store as quickly as I can). I've been to the LUSH in Chandler and like that one better - it's a bigger store so everything isn't squished (and it's also less busy). Bottom line: LUSH, I know you're making tons of money at the Scottsdale mall. You can afford a bigger store!\n\nEmployees are very eager to help and you won't go more than 2 minutes unnoticed in the store. Don't be afraid to ask for guidance! It's a confusing and slightly unorganized store. Ask questions, ask to try\/smell items, ask for free samples! \n\nProducts I recommend: Olive Branch body wash, Juicy shampoo, Daddy-o shampoo, all of their face masks, Whoosh body wash, and the sea salt face scrub. \n\nDon't forget to save your black plastic containers - they give you a free face mask if you bring in 5 empty containers!! Score!
