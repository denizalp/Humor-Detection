Bold statement: This is the best bar in Westgate!\n\nSome of you might not think that's saying much, but Hell's Half is a bar everyone needs to check out. It is the happy medium between those who want a nice gritty dive to get hammered in, and those who wanna dance and flirt.\n\nThe drinks are strong. The drinks are cheap! My favorite special is the \"deer and a beer\". For $7 I got a shot of Cazadores Reposado tequila and a pint of Bud Light. If you're a lily liver, you can substitute that.\n\nAnd who could forget about the music selection? They play rap, country, emo, and blues. 10\/10 playlist, and I love the music videos on behind the stripper poles.\n\nBasically, Hell's Half Acre is Westgate's very own douchebag filter. You get nothing but fun crowds and good times. Come here with a good attitude, and I guarantee you'll leave with good stories to tell!
