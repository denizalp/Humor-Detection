Everything was 5 stars: food, service, ambiance. \n\nI had the St. Louis ribs, beef brisket, coleslaw, roasted corn, corn bread and I tried the pulled pork. Again - all outstanding. The ribs really stood out for smokiness and tender. I have to say too that the coleslaw was among the best I have ever eaten (pecan coleslaw). Oh yeah - constant re-supply of incredible cornbread biscuits!\n\nAs much as the food, the service was noticeably top notch. Various servers kept us informed about their role (drinks, taking order, bringing food, etc.) and our main server was attentive and well paced. The manager checked in and asked how we were enjoying our meal. Even the hostess gave us good information about where to sit. \n\nVenue: great lighting, comfortable seating, roomy (but not too much) tables and well managed noise level. All good.\n\nValue: $55 for two including tip and one drink each. Wow - for that meal, service and atmosphere, a tremendous value. Go here.
