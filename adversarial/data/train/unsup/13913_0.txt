This is very repressive facility.  I decided to give it a try.  By the time I arrived at the doorway, in a line, it was too late to escape.  The huge brushes buffeted my truck and I found later they damaged my vehicle.  They ripped a component right off!!!\n\nIt was very wrong of me to think something so new, flashy and imposing would use the best technology available.  Rather, these monster brushes \"did me dirty.\"  If you want your vehicle damaged this is the place!
