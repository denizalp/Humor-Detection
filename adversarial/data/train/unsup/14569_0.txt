Went here after going to a local bar Distill, got to the drive thru and they prompted us to head to the last window to place our order. We waited in the drive thru behind a car for about 5mins, figured the car ordered enough food for a football team. Awkwardly, the car drove off without being handed any food, so we pulled up to the window and couldn't even get anyone's attention to order. Mind you, the window was wide open and I could see workers in there. I tried to get someone's attention and failed as they kept walking pass the Window like idiots. Please don't have ghetto ass people working in a upscale area.
