Crafthaus Brewery located in the booze district is a great place to unwind and let loose.  Upon walking in you'll notice the spacious open seating and a large bar with a view into the taproom.  The friendly staff ready to find you the perfect beer, with the various choices on their menu a sample would be wise. \n\nThe brewmasters (Steve and Steph) and owners (Dave and Wyndee) are fantastic at developing flavorful beers that are full of flavor, passion, boldness and as unique as they're to your glass.  A few of my favorites are the Comrade, Jean Claude, and Belgard. \n\n\nComrade (2017) *   Stout - Imperial \/ Double *   10.2% ABV *   55 IBU\nFull bodied and definitely a sipping beer to enjoy each moment with this seasonal.\n\n Jean Claude Â·  Belgian Strong Golden Ale *   8.7% ABV *   26 IBU\nSneaky smooth will sneak up and knock you out if you're not watching.\n\nBelgard *   Coffee Stout *   5.2% ABV *   30 IBU\nCold brewed coffee deliciousness in every sip.\n\nEvents are held regularly here and their, Comrade Day and Jean Claude release parties are epic and draw large groups of beer enthusiasts from all over. \n\n No matter your preference of beer there is something on tap ready for consumption. Will definitely be back supporting this local brewery and business!  Cheers
