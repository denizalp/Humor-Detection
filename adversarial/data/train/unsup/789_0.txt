Sure I'll bite, thanks for Allison Y for being the first to review this iconic East-West road way in the GTA. When I was younger this was the \"cool-street\" to drive on because it took us Richmond Hill kids in our parents cars across to Woodbridge and beyond to hang out with other suburban kids in various parking lots along the Hwy 7 strip.\n\nPresently, Hwy 7, which is just a regular road way without a name as of yet, is a disaster to drive on anywhere East of Leslie. Until the Viva bus lanes are complete, do what you can to avoid this stretch, however, once it's completed from East Markham to the West end of Woodbridge\/Vaughan this will be the most convenient non 400-series highway for getting around the GTA either by car or by public transportation.\n\nEven better, with the upcoming development of the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre at the new TTC subway terminus at Jane and Hwy 7, this road will become the main vein for a new metropolitan downtown centre. Until it's finished, driver beware you're in for even MORE road delays running from Keele and Hwy 7 to Weston and Hwy 7.\n\nStay tuned for more updates. In the long term this road is going to be one of the reasons why the GTA Rocks!
