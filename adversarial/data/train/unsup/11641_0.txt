I love this place.  Its far from home so I don't make it there very often but when I do I always leave smiling.  The coffee is great; I'm a creature of habit so I always get the 'Kicker'.  Though the cup is hot as balls, the coffee is always perfect drinking temperature, never have to worry about a burnt tongue.  My boyfriend has some pretty intense allergies to things, including dairy and Dutch Bros offers both coconut and almond milk so they have a special place in his heart as well.\nThe staff is always so chipper and happy.  My most recent visit, I was hurried and rushing and to be honest, I didn't need to rush anymore, I just had to rush at a previous doctor's appointment so I carried the feeling with me.  I went to the walk up and was still using a hurried tone.  The girl at the window quickly took my order and came back to make conversation with me.  Asked me where I was headed (work), how long I worked there, if I enjoyed it, etc.  By the second question I wasn't in a hurry anymore.  She was engaged and interested and even related.  We talked about my daughter and her niece and where my boyfriend worked (because she asked where the second coffee was going).  She literally made my day.  I don't remember much about my work day or what I did when I got home; but I did remember this sweet girl at Dutch Bros...whose name I do not know because I'm rude.
