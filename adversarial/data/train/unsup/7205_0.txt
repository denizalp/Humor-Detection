TexAZ Grill is a low key hidden gem in Phoenix.  It's location is modest, its decor is eccentric, very Texan inspired, and the size of the restaurant is fairly small.  The portions however are not so small.  I went for Brunch and of course I had to try the chicken fried steak everyone raves about. I was not disappointed in the CFS, just as the man other yelpers state, it is Indeed very good. Not made of the usual ground beef type of meat, it was more of an actual deep fried thinly pound steak.  What also came as a surprise, was how much I enjoyed the side dishes. The gravy was amazing, as were the biscuits and if your thirsty, may I suggest the Turlingua Sunrise. I cannot wait to come back and try a big juicy steak. \nGod bless Texas!
