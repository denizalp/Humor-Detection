Being a newbie to Chino Bandido, I got to take advantage of the free samples and lesson on how to order.  I thought everything individually was delicious, but once everything was together on my plate, I wasn't so sure of the mix of flavors.  I ordered a carne asada burrito, teriyaki chicken, fried rice and refried beans.  I ultimately ate the burrito and beans together and then ate the rice and teriyaki together; otherwise, it was opposing flavors overload.  I will definitely return again if I find myself in the neighborhood, but I may just stick with a rice bowl or a combination that doesn't mix so many different flavors.
