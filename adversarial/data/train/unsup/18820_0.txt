The restaurant is called Pho Sing Sing but you shouldn't come here for the Pho. You can order the Pho if you'd like, there is nothing wrong with it, but where Pho Sing Sing shines is with its other regional noodle dishes. \n\nThis is one of the few Vietnamese restaurants in town that serve Northern style Vietnamese noodle dishes. I unfortunately didn't take note of all the names of the regional dishes, especially since I went the extra step and googled a few things on the menu to figure out what they were before I ordered them. \n\nCome here if you are looking for a greater depth of options in your Vietnamese cuisine. It's located in the same plaza as Wendy's noodle cafe next door to a Taiwan deli. So much good food in this little area of Vegas!
