Horrible. I went in for a gel fill yesterday and the nail tech was very rude. She kept pulling my arm and had a terrible attitude. Before I paid I asked if she could file my nails a little bit more. Before I finished my sentence she said no. I'm not happy at all with my nails and the service. Will not be returning
