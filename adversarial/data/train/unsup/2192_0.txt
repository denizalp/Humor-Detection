This Chatime is PACKED (or perhaps it is because I came on a Saturday afternoon). The lineups were nearly out the door for this Chatime, and we waited nearly 15 to 20 minutes to order.\n\nThe drinks area is a little small, so it's probably hard to staff more people to help out. The person who was at the front was really nice. I found it amusing that they had to handle these lineup orders as well as those that people order online? (I wasn't sure what the mechanism was, but I know she was tapping orders for a remote order). \n\nWe got the red bean with pudding slush drink large for around $7 which is around the price of regular bubble teas now. SPC users: if you have SPC, you get a free topping $0.50 off.
