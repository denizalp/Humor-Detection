Pizza connoisseur checking in. This is one of the best pizzas in the area. Their pie is on the greasier side, heavy on the cheese, more heavily browned than most cheese. The cheese: you can taste it. For the NYers, I don't know why you'd expect to get NY pizza outside of NY, like a local delicacy outside of that locality. Perhaps your standard of measure, but I say you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Although Sal's is now my pizza of choice in Madison for the price, Glass Nickel is closer, and I'll be back for an occasional Glass Nickel pie.\n\nThey have a set of coupons that they run in circulars and attach to their pies--they're everywhere. The main one is to either receive a two-liter soda with a large pie, or to get $2 off $16 (or something like that). You can usually redeem the coupon without presenting a copy (since \"everywhere\" includes the pizza joint too). Honestly, I would just prefer the $2 off the large pie, which comes just short of $16 I imagine on purpose. Occasionally they do me a solid and honor the $2 off despite the slight discrepancy. They also had a dine-in cash discount when I was there (I've never seen this location particularly busy), but I haven't received it for take-out and haven't dined-in in a while.
