After getting contradictory information, sent to ER that in no diagnosis or communication, and being told something grossly inaccurate, I went to Dr Wagner at Boca Park Animal Hospital. She did a thorough exam, verified what I saw, and reviewed other vet records and xrays. Explained areas of concern, possible causes, possible further testing and sent my dog home with medication and physical therapy exercises. I now feel better informed and at least have an idea of what else we may need to do. I really liked Dr. Wagner and her assistant. Both were very knowledgeable.
