I am not giving it a five star for its food but merely for its value.  Food is average and matches its prices on the menu.  It offers honest food for an honest price.  For this reason here is a five star to Great Wok!  I wanted a mu-shu tofu and Ron wanted a lemon chicken. Even though a Tofu Mu-shu isn't on their menu they made it anyways and it was very good. Now the Hoisin sauce was diluted but my dish was just $10. I looked the other way. Service was prompt, dining room was super clean.
