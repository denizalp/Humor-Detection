Come here EARLY!!!  We got there at 10:30am. and there was no line.  By 11am., we saw a long line forming and within just a couple of minutes, that line became a 1 hour wait.  Breakfast\/brunch ends at 1pm. ($39.99) and lunch starts at 1pm ($49.99) but do remember that if you don't get your lazy butt down here by 10:30am., you WILL be waiting for at least an hour before getting seated.  I'd never come here for lunch or dinner after seeing the never ending line.   \n\nThe decor inside this place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!  Not to mention the buffet kitchen area was just as gorgeous as Scarpetta in beverly hills.  Love the layout.  They pretty much serve everything from Chinese to Italian.  All the different cuisines are separated where you can easily locate and serve the type of food you wish.  \n\nOne reason I'd come back here again....THICK SLAB OF BACON!!!!!  O.m.g.  This thing can't be good for your diet but who cares when you're in Vegas!   It's pepper crusted on the outside and maple smoked on the inside.  If you love maple smoked bacon, you'll want this bacon to be the last meal on earth.   \n\nOnly reason why I can't give them 5 stars is because I wasn't impressed at all with their dessert station.  Despite the abundance of different types of desserts ranging from macarons to sorbets to cakes to cake pops to mousses and many more sweets, everything was TOO sweet.  Tasted like something from a market.  Basically, low quality.  Even cake mix would taste better than the way they make their desserts.  Very disappointed.  Skip the dessert unless you absolutely LOVE sugar.  \n\nService is outstanding and everything about the ambience can't be more perfect.  The menu difference between lunch and dinner is crab legs.   Unless you're willing to wait over an hour JUST to eat all you can eat crab legs, you'll be able to eat all the prime ribs and ham for breakfast\/brunch time as well.
