The service was awful. I mean awful. Our poor waitress was just clueless to the fact that she was giving us terrible service. My food was okay, but nothing that was served felt fresh. It all seemed like packaged leftovers. The portions were very generous. I'm giving the diner two stars because of poor service, and cleanliness. It just felt mucky in there. Dirty tables still filled with plates for no apparent reason. Moldy ceiling tiles with water from the AC dripping down the walls. I won't be going back.
