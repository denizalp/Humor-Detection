The Phoenix Ale Brewery is nothing fancy.\n\nA taproom with some tables and chairs and a bar. \n\nOh, please. You didn't come here ambiance - You're here for some delicious beer!\n\nAnd really, if you're one of those types who NEEDS grub to complete your brewery experience, quit your bitchin' and head down to their new location that has a kitchen. \n\nActually, I lied, this location has Panini available. Or just bring your own grub in. \n\nAndrew C. hosted his February \"Brews Cruisin' the Valley with Dude UYE\" here, and we had an excellent afternoon with a group of Yelpers. Marisa S. was a doll as always and crafted some lovely cheese, meat and fruit boards for us to enjoy! \n\nWe took the bus and light rail all the way from North Chandler so we could both imbibe with the lovely Groupon we had - Two Flights, Two Pints and Two Crowlers (32oz Growler Cans). \n\nBuckle up, taste buds! \n\nWe've tried the always refreshing Watermelon Ale and Biltmore Blonde previously, so it was fun to finally sample their other offerings at the source. \n\nWhat do I remember whilst pickling my brain in alcohol that fine afternoon? \n\nWell, I definitely remember trying the seasonal Cranberry Oatmeal Stout. That was a real treat! Definitely a heavier bodied beer. \n\nAs an IPA lover, I was surprisingly not a fan of the Camelback IPA; even more shocking, IPA hatin' Dude LOVED IT. \n\nFell in LOVE with their West Coast IPA, the Orange Peel. That beer was sweet, citrusy, hops-filled joy in your MOUTH, aka, Dude hated it. \n\nEnded up choosing this one as my full pint. \n\nTo round out the Groupon, we took home Crowlers filled with Biltmore Blonde and Fretzy's American Hefeweizen.\n\nI also must complement the bartender who handled our group with ease and kept our beers full - We were the largest group in the house that day. \n\nWe haven't made it back yet, but I'm looking forward to another afternoon at Phoenix Ale.\n\nPlease check them out if you haven't yet!
