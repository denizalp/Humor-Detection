Gettil air told me that I had multiple leaks and Freon was way low..told me could not do rejuvenation due to too many problems aid wanted to charge me for a rebuild...dr cool came out and the kid took a look and put his gauges on and checked my unit..guess what.1 leak which was a simple fix need a new cap and my Freon was not low..good service and the tech was down to earth..this kid was way cool and I am glad to say they did a good job
