This Sprint Repair Store is turning out to be pretty awesome!\n\nMy husband needed his badly abused phone repaired - so he took it in. He came home with a new - upgraded - phone that he just loves, and the best part is - it was FREE. \n\nI really can't expect much more from them. Their customer service is good, they have seating and the wait time is on schedule and if they can't fix it, they replace it (and if you are like my husband - charismatic! -  you get a free, upgraded phone). Pretty sweet!
