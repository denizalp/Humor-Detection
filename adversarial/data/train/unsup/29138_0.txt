The O show kinda freaked me out when they did some crazy stunt with a child.  I vowed to never see another Cirque show. And, I gotta say, I like the Beattles, but I am not a huge fan.  We had third row seats - cant beat that.  But, truthfully, at this venue, there is not a bad seat in the house.  The show and music were amazing.  So many elements, kept me wondering after the show - did I miss something?  I would HIGHLY recommend this show and would DEFINITELY return if I could! Enjoy!
