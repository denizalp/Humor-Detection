Sorry Guy, my experience wasn't the \"real deal.\"\n\nIt started off great. We were seated right away, in a corner table with a strip view. We browsed the breakfast menu, which is pretty limited. I understand keeping things simple but not everyone wants a huge plate of food. For instance, I like basic eggs & potatoes but don't care for breakfast meat. My only option was to choose the classic plate, which comes with bacon & sausage. \n\nYes, total rewards members get $1 off. My eggs & potatoes put me back $15. Fine, we ordered and waited. Then waited some more. Saw larger tables sat after us, on both sides of us get waited on and served their meals. We were still waiting. When our plates finally did arrive, nearly an hour later - I tried to eat the meats on the plate, as I paid for them but the bacon was cold & flabby. I couldn't even cut through the sausage & it had a very odd taste to it. My daughter tried a bite & spot it out. The potatoes were very good and I did enjoy the complimentary watermelon & mint gazpacho shot. Unfortunately, the sage biscuit was dry and my eggs were cold. \n\nAlthough multiple servers looked at us and helped other tables around us, no one mentioned or apologized for the incredible delay in the delivery of our cold food. No compensation was given at all on the check. \n\nThe bright side is that they make a pretty good chocolate milk? \n\nGuy, sorry but I v'wont be back.
