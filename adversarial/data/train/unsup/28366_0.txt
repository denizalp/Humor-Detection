This was a great stop after a movie.  We got in late enough that it was happy hour, and their tapas style menu was perfect for munching on.  Some notes on the items we had:\n\n* Spicy garlic edamame - nothing fancy here, just edamame tossed in some spicy garlic chili sauce, but it worked\n* agedashi tofu - probably not a standout dish, but I really like agedashi tofu in nearly any form\n* tempura - we liked this one a lot; nice and flaky panko as opposed to the dense, almost batter like stuff you'll get most places these days\n* fish tacos - again, a nice, flaky panko crust topped with a decent slaw, jalapeno slices, and a sprig of cilantro\n\nNeither of us was feeling like a roll or nigiri at that point - definitely looks like fusion style with the sushi choices, with lots of modern flair.\n\nOverall, a pretty rad happy hour, and I want to go back and explore their menu further.
