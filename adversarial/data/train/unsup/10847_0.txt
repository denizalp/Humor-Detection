First impressions were eek - we were greeted by the  hostess who was standing amongst all of the waitresses   and led to a booth , nice enough . We sat for a minute and I looked up to see all of the waitresses standing up and eating at the bar . Apparently our waitress was hungry so she finished eating and came over to take our order . \n\nWe both ordered  side salads , they were served in a side bowl on a plate. My husband ordered the Cesar's and it was basically romaine lettuce with parmesan  on top . No croutons and spicy ranch .... \n\nMain dish ordered steak - sent it back because it was served   rare after I stressed warm pink center . She said she totally got it and the chef would understand. Husband ordered the pasta and only ate  the chicken from the Snakebite Pasta and that's about it . Steak came back cooked to order along with a comment that the cook knew that I would send it back... Really , why did you serve it then ? \n\n For the price it was not worth it . We will not be back - but I wish them the best of luck .
