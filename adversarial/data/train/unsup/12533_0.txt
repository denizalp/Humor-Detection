UGH. How many Chicos, Victorias Secrets, and Zumiez could one suburban town possibly need?! I had such high hopes for DT Summerlin, and thought it would be laid out more like The Grove or Century City in LA, with pretty outdoor walkways, places to sit in the SHADE, and new and interesting shops or stalls. NOPE. The center driveway is for cars much like the District in GV now is, and there are no covered awnings or benches (which are made out of metal btw- LOL), so summer shopping should be a blast when it's 110 degrees. It actually had more of a vibe of an outlet mall, very sparse and dry. The two department stores, Dillard's and Macy's are on the far end of the largest parking lot, and Macy's looks like an old dilapidated department store, not one that just opened. \n\nThe walkways in between the stores are interesting, it's almost like the mall is cut in half and you have to go down an alley to get to the other side of the shops to see what you might have missed. The only restaurant open when I was there was Crave, which had a 2 hour wait, but other than that I think the only two additions will be CPK and Wolfgang Puck. The Nordstrom Rack, ULTA, Trader Joes etc. is on the OPPOSITE side, which is both good and bad. If someone just wants to go grocery shopping and run into NR, they can pull into that lot and not make a mess of navigating the mall, but if you are out shopping for the day, you'd have to move your car. \n\nI'll only return for Nordstrom Rack...
