Fusaro's is pretty great. I've never had a bad experience with them food-wise or service wise (though I think I've only ever eaten in once or twice). \n\nTheir pasta is always good (though I always get the same one or two dishes). Always tastes the same even at both locations. \n\nPrices and portions are reasonable as well.
