Located in the little plaza on Tropicana and Eastern, You can step back into time when you enter The Dispensary Lounge.\n\nYes there is a water wheel, but that's not all....old school lamps that barely keep the room lit, faux candles on the tables, and each booth sectioned off by cheesy fake Ivy crawling all over, mixed with people from all walks of life ranging from 21-70, throw in some live Jazz, and you got yourself a cool evening!\n\nThey have a pretty small drink list, and standard bar food, but the $3.95 1\/2 pound steak burger is pretty solid. Cooked to your desired temperature, it is served on a hot toasted bun along with an ice cold slice of beefsteak tomato, green leaf lettuce, red onions and a fat pickle spear. Additional toppings range from $.50-$.75 (Bacon. American, Swiss, or Mozzarella cheese, Sauteed Mushrooms, caramelized onions, and jalapenos)\n\nThe size of their burgers are huge like Kilroy's, full of flavor, and still cheaper than most burgers around town even if you add a few toppings. Loaded with fries on the bottom of the basket, it is some good econo eats, and their killer honey mustard goes better with the fries than the plain old ketchup. Service could use a little help though. There was that one poor cocktail waitress taking care of ALL tables on the floor... I'd most definitely return for their burger!...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(196\/365) \"Old School Burger at Old School Prices\"
