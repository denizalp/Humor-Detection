Really yummy and fast Korean food. You can get your food to go as I saw a lot of pick ups, but you can sit down and eat too. The lunch and dinner crowd is pretty popular here. I got the hot stone pot rice and beef meal and it was so good! It comes out in a hot stone bowl so the rice is sizzling! Hot! So be careful! The sides like cucumbers and Kim chi was perfect with the meat and rice. Restaurant was very clean and customer service is good. It's right next to Regal Movie Theaters so you can grab dinner before your movie starts!
