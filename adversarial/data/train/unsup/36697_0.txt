I have done my own taxes in previous years and have also had a CPA do my taxes. I did not want to spend the time this year so I decided to look for local options. I had my concerns about using a chain like H&R Block, but like most chains it is a matter of luck and which employee you get. The manager at this location was very knowledgeable and the staff friendly. They worked out through some fairly complex details and got me squared away. I would recommend this location to others.
