You know I really like this place, when I have to drive 45 minutes from my house. I was a little scare in the beginning to let just anyone perform laser hair removal on my body. But this place met my expectations regarding safety and explaining the procedure. Staff is friendly and they always do a great job to remind you about your appointments. The owner Anahit is very sweet, love her! Major plus, if you work for the Wynn you get a discount ($$$aver).\n\nI started off doing only my face and underarms. But now that I've been going and seeing results, I started my bikini area. I did not want to write a review until I had at least finished one of my sessions to see how great the results were. I've finished my face with 8 sessions, have had 7 on my underarms and 3 on my bikini area. My underarm hair is completely gone. And my bikini area already looks amazing (bf agrees too). \n\nPrices are reasonable compared to other laser places in Las Vegas. I am 100% satisfied with the results and I cannot wait to finish my sessions and start on other places of my body.
