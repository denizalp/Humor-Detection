I like the idea of this place far more than the execution. \n\nI've seen pizza cones on Pinterest for a while now, and have always thought it was a cool idea, but didn't know how to make it and didn't want to spring for the $40 set that I'd use once. So when I was looking for spots to go while visiting Pittsburgh and this place popped up, it was at the top of my list. \n\nWe walked in at around 3 on a Sunday and there were a few patrons inside. I immediately noticed a strange odor inside the entire restaurant. Not appealing, at all. But we all decided to split 1 pepperoni cone. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes of waiting, we finally got our pizza cone and left because I couldn't eat in the smelly restaurant.\n\nThe top of the cone was cheesy and bubbly, but once you got to the middle, the cheese was cold and barely melted. It was not what I had dreamed of, and I was pretty disappointed. I figured after such a long wait, it would be hot all the way through but I was wrong. \n\nI think this place is worth one visit, but not worth constant trips.
