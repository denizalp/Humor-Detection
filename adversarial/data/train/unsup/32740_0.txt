Excellent!!! My boyfriend and I were blown away by the food and service. Cannot say enough about this place. We were in town from California and wish I could eat here every week. Our server was fantastic as well and I wish I could remember her name but we were there on Sunday Aug 20th so tell her thank you from the couple from California who were the last to leave, and to Dave or David?  who stopped us on the street the next day and shook our hand because he recognized us from the night before. We're in the rest buis so I can attest this place rules!
