The only thing \"institution\" about this place is the food.\nMy husband and I made reservations for Friday night, and then were asked to wait for our table. We thought the point of making a reservation was that you didn't have to wait for a table. Nbd, restaurants get busy and tables don't always leave when you need them to.\nNext, I take my first sip of the fabled bottomless wine. I can only describe the taste as a combination of the cheapest jug wine mixed with grape juice - not only sweet but also dimensionless and nearly non alcoholic. I try both red and white, they are identical.\nWe order and the meal gets under way. \nSalad=overdressed lettuce, single huge slice of salami, single solid chunk of mystery white cheese, intermittent shaved carrots\/cherry tomato\/olive.\nEntrees=too salty and acidic tomato sauces with no other flavor, boiled chicken that is also overcooked and tough, and vegetables that have been accompanied by a healthy portion of water onto my plate.\nAfter dinner cappucino=we paid before we could experience any more.\nWe will never get those 50 minutes of our lives back.\nIf you want to pay Maggiano's prices for food quality less than my undergraduate cafeteria, giddy-up. Otherwise, eat somewhere else.
