Not the fanciest, or the best buffet in Las Vegas.........but there is a lot to be said about the Paradise Buffet & Cafe Restaurant inside the Fremont Hotel.\n\nMy mom & dad like to stay at the Fremont hotel for some reason, and a lot of times that they come here, they dine at the Paradise Buffet & Cafe Restaurant.\n\nThe buffet at the Paradise Buffet & Cafe Restaurant is not the biggest, nor do they have the largest food selection. What I can say is that this buffet is clean, has pretty good service, and they do make one thing that I really love...........the FRIED CHICKEN!!!\n\nWhen I do go here to eat, I always make sure that they are serving Fried Chicken that day. Ummmmm........Fried Chicken! What can I say............they know how to do it right! \nBig Meaty pieces of chicken, fried to perfection, & seasoned just right! If I could eat this everyday without any health ramifications.........I'd do it! :) Lol!
