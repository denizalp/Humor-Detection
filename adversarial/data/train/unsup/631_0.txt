Oh. Hot. Damn.\n\nWe slept on top of the sheets in all of our clothing (without the pillows) with a baseball bat next to us. I don't know where these \"remodeled\" parts of the hotel were located, but my friends and I were just... terrified. The stains on the carpet, walls, sheets, sink and in the shower freaked us out in such a way that we could barely manage 3 hours of sleep -- not that we could get more, as our next door neighbors started blasting music at 5:18AM. \n\nI have slept in many sketchy motels in my time on various road trips and this one was by far one of the sketchiest.  Never again.\n\nThe positive: we were able to check in really late (around 1:30AM) and we were able to park directly in front of our room.
