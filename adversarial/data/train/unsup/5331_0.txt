Wings, Beers and Sports\n\nBuffalo Wild Wings would and should makes any guys happy.... Any even I am a happy camper during my visit! \n\nTV all around showing basketballs, hockey and more... Never a boring moment! \n\nIf you not into sports, you can also play interactive poker and trivia games against other patrons. \n\nIf you are still bored or sucks in games, use their open Wifi and Yelp.. \n\nOf course there are beers and wings and more. LOVE their snack option that able to have an order of 5 and try different Flavour. FYI, blazin the hottest one on the menu is Not too hot. We also tried Mango Haberno and Buffalo flavors. \n\nTuesday 60 cents wings anyone? \n\nOr there are all sort of specials...
