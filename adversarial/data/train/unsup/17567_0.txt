I went there this last Monday for happy hour and dinner:  \nMost of my experience was positive....until the end. We did have a few small service issues, most of which are typical of a fairly new staff in training.  However, we did have a big problem regarding our bill at the end.\n\nDuring our meal on 8\/31\/2009 (dinner time), the manager came by and asked how everything was going, we let him know that it was great but to please send by our waitress as we hadn't seen her in awhile.\n \nWhen we received our bill, we were pleasantly surprised to see a few items comped to a 0 dollar charge.  I grabbed my card and gave it to the waitress to pay the tab of approximately $14.50. I was quite surprised when she returned the card and receipt (which had now been charged to my card) for more than $36.00 without even mentioning it to us.  She had also removed the original receipt and put a new one for the correct amount.\n\nI asked to see the manager, who came buy to discuss this with us.  Here is a quick breakdown of the conversation:\n\nQuestion from manager: Did we eat the items?\n\nAnswer from me: Of course we did...the issue wasn't that we were paying for them, it is that your staff substituted the receipt for a different one, charged us more than double what I authorized, and didn't notify us.  How can you do this without at least letting us know that you changed the amount?\n\nAnswer from manager: Well I am hearing a different story from her...she indicates that she told you.  Plus we have already given you a good break on the prices of your drinks.\n\nResponse from me: First off,  don't take it from me....ask the 3 other people at the table.   Secondly, it was happy hour...these were your advertised prices.  How is it that you gave me a \"break\" on your prices?\n\nResponse from the manager: Look, what is it that you want from me?  You ate the food, it was a computer mistake....can I have your business card?\n\nResponse from me: My business card, what does my job have to do with this?\n\nAnswer from manager:  It looks like you just left from working in a restaurant by the way you are dressed?  \n\nAt this point...I signed the receipt and left.  Zero tip of course (sorry to be an jerk...but I was not happy.)\n\nTo be honest, I don't remember ever being more frustrated with someone before.  I really wasn't expecting a free ride or meal, but an apology and explanation of HOW you can replace the original receipt with a new one for more than twice the original amount and charge it would have sufficed.
