See original review for AC purchase\/installation review.\n\nTHIS update is for follow-up\/warranty service!\n\nToday, yes, today, I finally turned on my heat (kills me to do so...) and well, nothing happened.  :-\/  Brr, I think. Perhaps my batteries are dead-ish?  Nope.  Still nada.\n\nSo I call Flores around 2pm.  I leave a message and get a call 30 minutes later from Mr. Flores. I describe the issue, pass along me info, and he says someone will call me to schedule an appt.  I receive a call from Michael (who did my original quote!) at 3:45, and he is at my house in less than an hour.  It was a quick fix, something perhaps wasn't connected properly on installation (props to admitting to a problem rather than making excuses as is the norm), and he was in and out in less than 3 minutes.\n\nSuperb service, and he made sure to talk me through some of the oddities of having a heat pump only (I had them remove my furnace completely and rely only on the heat pump for cooling and heating) to make sure I don't freak out if I am to see steam or get bursts of cool air in the AM.\n\nLove FLORES AC\/HEATING!\n\nFor those who keep messaging me to see how happy I am with Flores, I will be happy to sing their praises forever! :)
