You simply cannot beat this place. Bang for your buck at its finest with some of best noodle dishes I've ever had. The dumplings are to die for. The Pork Potstickers were so moist and flavorful, best dumplings around. This is a staple for us at least once a month. Be aware that when you dine in there is usually a wait on the weekends and the restaurant does tend to get packed in fast. So we tend to go early or go with their quick pick up.  The best part of this place is that everything noodle wise is made in house. You can watch the cooks making the noodles, and when you have them you can really taste the difference. A well priced one of a kind restaurant.
