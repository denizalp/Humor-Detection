Delicious liquid refreshment on wheels served up by some remarkably charming grouches. In fact, I think I may have been underestimating grouches given that Grouchy John and crew are always smiling and serving up quality coffee and other libations.  They offer smoothies as well, but I haven't tried one\n\nI have sampled the coffee and the chai, and you'll hear no complaints from me. They've got a passion for the bean and are happy to lead you to the right drink if you're feeling a bit indecisive. And, bonus points for having a local literarati manning the counter, Mr. J.J. Wylie. It all adds up to 5-stars.
