I'm a weirdo who doesn't eat seafood, and yet I still enjoy dining out at sushi restaurants from time to time. \n\nKabuku has two locations in Calgary: one downtown on 4th Ave and this, their second, in the Aspen Woods neighbourhood. Being a short walk from home, I've visited Kabuku several times.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I tried a few items from the menu incuding avocado tempura, tamago nigiri, inari nigiri, and a kimino roll.\n\nThe avocado tempura was awesome with firm avocado and a light batter. It's often hard to find good vegetarian rolls at sushi places as many just default to the standard avocado\/cucumber\/carrot sticks so I was happy to experience something a touch more flavourful with the kimino roll. This roll includes fried tofu, shitaki mushrooms, avocado, asparagus, cucumber and carrot.\n\nOrdering is easy at Kabuku as every table is provided with a laminated menu and a marker to tick off the types and number of rolls and pieces.
