Thank you halal cart for being open late!  It's definitely slim pickins in this area for late eats so when you come to town late at night look no farther.  Luckily this cart was also around the corner from my hotel!  I went with the traditional combo, lamb and chicken over rice and wasn't sure what to expect having eaten my fair share of halal carts in NYC.  I quickly took this delight back to my room as the area was a little sketch and devoured my meal.  The combo was honestly better than most of the ones I've had in NYC if not better, watch out halal guys. The meat was finely chopped and well seasoned over nicely cooked basmati rice.  And the kicker was the white sauce, not sure what was on there but wow the flavor was on point, well balanced and perfect compliment to the dish, just wish I had more!  Bravo!
