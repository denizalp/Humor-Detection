Been looking for a garlic tuna that was comparable to how the old sushibay used to have it, and here it is. Amazing! The only difference is a fried garlic slice as a garnish (not bad, but I prefer just the sauce). Chirashi bowl is a good rec and so are the poki tacos and pork belly appetizer (order rice with pork belly bc is has a rich flavor). Service was great, nice, quick, and friendly. Going to be a regular for sure
