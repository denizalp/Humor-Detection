Corned Beef made fresh sounded good to me. Most corned beef is served sliced or deli style and is usually inedible. Only a handful make it fresh and this bar did it right. Nice and crumbly and served inside toasted bread with saeurkraut and russian dressing. This bar had a few folks drinking about 9pm on a weekday and a singer also was playing. It is a long bar with plenty of room and seems like a good place to return because more Irish bars should handle their corned beef business the way Murphy's does. It is a Seahawks bar though...boo. Enough of those in the Valley.
