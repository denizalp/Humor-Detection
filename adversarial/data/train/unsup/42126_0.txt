Really = 3.5\n\nI came here with my sister and brother-in-law who were visiting.  Brother-in-law had a hankering for some gyros and I passed up all the Kabob Expresses along the way looking for something a little more whole-in-the-wally and we stumbled upon this place while looking for something else (I was tired of driving).  \n\nI had the Italian Beef with onions and hot peppers which I thought was yummy tasty. \n\nMinus 1\/2 star because I ordered another sandwich to-go for my boyfriend and they messed up my order and gave me the same exact thing that I ordered before.  \n\nI will gladly go back again to try the gyros which my brother-in-law really liked.
