Just went here to pick up a GPS. After asking an employee for help on getting one, we were ignored. After walking up to 5 employees standing around chatting with each other - we were ignored. After waiting 30 minutes by the GPS section for help, we decided to go to Walmart instead. If you like to be ignored - go here. If you actually want to buy something - I'd skip it. Does Best Buy train it's employees to be rude and not help customers? I don't know, but I do know we found a great $350 GPS at Walmart.
