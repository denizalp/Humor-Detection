I love Lifetime Smiles! They helped me get over my dentophobia.\n\nOkay, this is a bit gross and personal, but here goes... I had a horrible experience with my orthodontist growing up. It made me petrified of going to the dentist. I ended up going 11 years without a checkup, ick!!! I know it's important to get regular checkups but thought if I brushed like a madwoman I didn't need a dentist. I didn't realize stuff gets up under your gums that no amount of brushing and flossing can reach. Btw, flossing and regular checkups can extend your life by 6 years some studies say.\n\nI finally went to the dentist a couple years ago and found that it wasn't the dentist, but the teeth cleaning that bothered me. I thought about not going then did some research. I tried Nitrous Oxide with Sally at Lifetime Smiles. That's totally the way to go. I now get cleanings every 4 months. I only need the Nitrous in the first 5 minutes to calm my nerves. It's all good now. No more phobia!\n\nI highly recommend Lifetime Smiles.\n\nP.S. Costs less than getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.
