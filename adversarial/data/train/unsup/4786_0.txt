I don't know where to start with the Circus Circus.  My wife, nine year old daughter and I stopped here on a road trip from LA to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.  \n\nI knew that this was not going to be a good experience when I arrived in the lobby.  There was a line of people waiting to check in that snaked out to the front door.  Now it is Independence Day weekend, and I understand that the hotel would be busy.  I would expect to see every check-in station staffed and the management would be doing their best to handle the rush of people as quickly as possible.  My expectations were not met.  1\/2 of the stations were staffed and we stood in the line 30 minutes before we were helped.  After checking in, I visited the men's room in the lobby where I saw gang tag on the stall walls.  Yikes.\n\nWe had a Manor room, which is located in three story out buildings located in  the back of the property.  The room was large, clean and reasonably well appointed.  The room appears to have been renovated lately.  I understand why hotels secure the television to the furniture, but I'm not sure why the Circus Circus secured the $20 alarm clock to the night stand.  I went to move the lamp on the night stand and learned that the lamp is secured to the furniture.  In fact the only bit of electronics that was not attached to the furniture (the TV remote control) was missing.\n\nFinally, the level of people here was positively agoraphobic.  The crowds in the Adventure Dome and the Midway sections were so large, the midways were impassable for several minutes.  I understand that the Circus Circus is trying to accommodate whole families including children, but given the number of guests they have in the hotel, i'd think the fire marshal would want them to widen the halls.\n\nWill I be back?  Not anytime soon.
