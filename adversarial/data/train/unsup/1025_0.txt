Even Stevens is rapidly growing in the valley, and this Arcadia location is the newest addition. Located on the NW corner of 40th & Indian School Rd, this brand new structure can be easily spotted from the road and has ample free parking. \n\nEmployees and management are passionate about the food and their cause. Everyone was happy and eager to help. \n\nI got the Jackfruit Torta and added vegan aioli for extra flavor. This sandwich comes with jackfruit carnitas, pepitas, guacamole (however, I don't recall seeing guac on mine), salsa morita, radish, cilantro, lettuce, and pickled onions. It's served warm on what they call a sweet bun. This sandwich is delicious! I do suggest (insist) that you dine in with this one. Carry out doesn't do this torta justice. A pickle spear and your choice of either kettle chips or a salad is included with the price of their sandwiches. \n\nThey plan to expand their vegan menu and vegan desserts are coming soon! \n\nThis location partners with the following local non-profits: Joshua Tree Feeding Program, ICM Food & Clothing Bank, Friendly House, & Native American Connections.
