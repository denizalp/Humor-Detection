So I stayed one night here and was a good night the walls are thin you can hear the people in the other rooms. The next day I was going to stay again.  Around 11am I got a call from the front desk asked if I was going to stay I said I was going to pay online. So like 20mins after that all they called again said they didn't get it yet. I said I hadn't made it. Then they called 3 more times after that came to my door 3 times. Then 4 time they came to my door and made me leave. They made sure they walked me out the room and down the hall they actually waited outside my door as I packed my stuff. I will never ever stay at this place agin they could not wait 10 more mins for me to make my reservation not like me or the room was going any where I have never had a hotel treat me like this ever. I do a lot traveling  in 4 years I have never had this happen ever. If you want to be harnessed by the front desk this is the hotel for you.
