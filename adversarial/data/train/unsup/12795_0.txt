One of the best jack in the box's in the Las Vegas area. I've had jack's food for awhile now but it's not prepared fresh like this location makes it. Top service! Freshly made every time. They really follow jacks motto \" we don't make it till you order it \" also unlike other jacks I've been too, they don't make you park. The employees here are also one of the friendliest. I think that's what sets them apart from other jacks. I would rather drive 5 mins to get here than the one near my house just for the friendly people that work here!
