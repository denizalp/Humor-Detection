Thanks OnTrac for not delivering my Amazon package, I didn't really want it anyway.  I'm sure whoever ended up with the scrubs I ordered same day delivery to wear to work tomorrow will find them much more useful than I possibly could.   Oh, and thanks for answering your phone when I called to see where the package claiming to be \"delivered\" went.  You guys are really on top of it.\nSpecial shout out to Amazon customer service for not really seeming to give a f$&k.  \nIf I could give you zero stars I would, just like the zero amount of my order that showed up on my doorstep.
