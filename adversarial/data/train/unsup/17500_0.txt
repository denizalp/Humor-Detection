Cheers to new clubs in vegas!!\nThe newer the better. Why you ask? Because they swarm you, practically begging your group to come inside with amazing deals you can't resist. My group of girls got a free table with bottle service. Great crowd, attentive servers and good music. The guys at the next table were apparently wanting to throw their money away and gave us stacks of dollar bills to \"make it rain\" in the club. hahaha.. good times at Gallery.
