This place has some of the most fresh & flavorful options around. They have wraps, hummus, rice, and pasta dishes. They stick to fresh and local ingredients. Every time I eat here I feel ultra healthy, like I'm in that Seth Rogen meme. The prices are cheap and the portions are hearty. \n\nThe menu changes daily and they are pretty good with keeping their Facebook page updated with the menu, but sometimes they forget. I suggest calling ahead with any questions and\/or to get the daily menu.  They do have desserts sometimes, but I have not yet had the pleasure of trying them.\n\nThe employees are friendly and helpful. It's a small cafe, but the patio seating is prime for warmer months. I suggest carry out during winter, unless cold is your thing. It's tucked in the plaza off Mill and 4th. If you've been to the Escape Room, it's right next door to that.
