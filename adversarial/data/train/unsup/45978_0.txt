I've been going to this salon for over a year now and absolutely love it! I've gotten facials, brow waxing, hair cut\/color, and spray tans at this salon. It's become my one stop shop! I have naturally dark hair and have always had a hard time finding a stylist who could make it lighter without looking streaky. Sarah is the first person to ever give me natural looking highlights! Can't say enough good things!
