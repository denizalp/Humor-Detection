this place is pretty nice. very clean and minimalistic furniture and atmosphere. The service is very friendly. the thing I absolutely love about this place is the menu. \n\nLET ME TELL YOU! it seriously serves a very VERY limited amount of different dishes. Their specialty is obviously topoki so they have one page where you get to create your own topoki dish ranging from type of sauce, meat, and carbs that goes with it. another page is where the snacks are and then they have another page for specialty rice bowls. they also have a selection of drinks as well. \nI'm pretty sure that with every item combined on the menu... there's probably just about 20 items or so... prices are pretty good. 2 main dish with a snack was about $36 without tips. \n\nRecommendations: \n\nPopcorn chicken snack: very well done in terms of crispiness and flavour. comes with 2 sauce: wasabi mayo and some spicy red sauce i forgot the name to.\n\nBulgogi kimchi cheese rice: rice on bottom and bulgogi on one side and kimchi on the other side with melted cheese on top of everything, sprinkled with seaweed. Let me warn you... this kimchi is abnormally spicy for some reason... STILL AMAZING though. \n\nTopoki with choice of red sauce, seafood, and ramen: this sauce is pretty spicy compared to the ones you're used to in normal Korean restaurants. It definitely does not have that hint of sweetness you're so used to. If you can't handle spicy... i suggest you choose a different sauce because you will definitely feel it a couple bites in.
