An ok sandwich shop given that it is in the airport. It's located across from C8.\nWhen looking for something quick, not filled with tons of grease and looks & tastes like something you can make at home...this is it.\n\nIt's nothing to write home about because it should be hard to screw up a sandwich- two slices of bread, \nyour hearts desire in the middle and either toasted or not.  That said it comes down to service.\n\nIt was a small crazy rush and somehow I made it to checkout without ordering. No problem. She took my sandwich order and payment.  Then she went back, put on gloves and made my sandwich.  cool.  I had the turkey sandwich with 3-4 toppings toasted.No problems here. Service and sandwich are ok by me.\n\nThere are tables to seat 18, 12 of the seats offer dual power sockets and a TV to catchup on the headline news.  Not a bad place to post up during a layover.
