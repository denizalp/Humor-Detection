Funny thing. I'm not sure if I really like or somewhat dislike this place. The chocoholic in my loves it. The hot dark chocolate is yummy and who wouldn't like a chocolate dessert style pizza?!? That said, I also find the open industrial unfinished rustic look too cold and uninviting for the warmth and coziness that chocolate represents. The menu, which is a tad predictable and unoriginal, could benefit from more creative dishes and I was disappointed by some of dishes on more than one occasion. If ever you have a hankering for a chocolate & oatmeal breakfast, I'd avoid it here. Rather lacks in any taste and the use of milk chocolate instead of dark only adds to the blandness. That said, do try one of the sweet creamy cocoa oozy dessert pizzas. You'll feel like Miss Piggy, but it'll satisfy that sweet tooth for a while!
