Decided to go with some coworkers and finally try this place. The moment I opened the door I could smell the meat and spices (mouth watered). From there I got in line, if you have never been here there are separate lines based on what you're going to order. For instance, carne asada, chicken, burritos tacos etc.\n\nOverall the food was great. Each of us got different items and share. Thhe meat had great flavor, the salsa bar had a lot of variety and it looks like we may be back for Taco Tuesdays!
