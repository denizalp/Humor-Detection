I went for a free consultation. The place was dusty. The woman who gave my free consultation was in a dirty tee shirt. Her acrylic nails had months of regrowth and were a very poor job. It was too cost thousands of dollars and decided I would be better off else where. \nI received a phone call from My Tight Face wanting to know why I had not booked. The woman would not take NO for an answer. Finally I told her why I decided not to use their services. \nNext thing the woman from the consultation is calling me back screaming you FAT F---k! She continued using profanities. I never answered her and let her vent.\nI called My Tight Face back and told the woman to tell her that I know now I made the right decision.
