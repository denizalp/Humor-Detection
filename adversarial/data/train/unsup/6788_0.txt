Never again ... I purchased a Subi in 2012 from Cali. And have been coming to this dealership to get my oil change service as required and suggested every 7k miles or so. They are good in the fact that they get the job done and that's that, but they lack serious customer service.\n\nOn my last trip in though, after I no longer had my warantee, I had the worst experience ever. I came in like usual sat in the waiting room while I worked on some homework and within 30-40minutes I was called that my car was ready. \"Wow\",I thought they are on it today. I left feeling okay, but not completely satisfied. I started to drive off the lot and almost getting home my oil light comes on. I call the dealership and he assured me that it sometimes happens and sensors get messed up. I took his word and continued on with my day. After a week of working & school the light continued to come on and off . Then my water pressure light came on so I figured I would buy some windshield wiper liquid. As I go to pump my hood I was mortified. The cap to my oil component was off and set aside. Oil had spewed all over everything you could think of under the hood. I was appalled and angry. I immediately went in and had them fix the issue, which they did. They claimed they did a full service oil change, but here I am again not even 3000 miles in and I need another oil change.  Hmmmm doesn't seem right now does it ? Still can't believe how bad the service was .. \n\nI go to only one place now. The original dealership where I purchased my vehicle from. They are great always! \n\nGo Galpin!!!
