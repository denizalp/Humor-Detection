First off, I don't typically review big chains like Target AND I'm a loyal Target shopper. I will NOT shop at Wal-Mart, haven't in years - but this particular Target is a constant disappointment.\n\nFirst off - every single time I go there, they are out of at least one item on my list, but usually they're out of two - and a few times now the shelves around the products in question have been empty as well.  So poorly stocked.  \n\nSecond - I bought a PÃ¼r water filter pitcher there, got home excited about my new purchase, pulled it out of the box only to discover it all water-spotted and streaked as though someone had hastily tried to clean it and return it and it was apparently just put back on the shelf. Yuck.  I don't think it's too much to ask that a brand new pitcher in a box be unused.  \n\nCustomer service is also really lacking.  It's the closest Target to me - but I'll be driving the extra distance to avoid the frustration of this location.
