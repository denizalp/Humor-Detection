I just went here tonight with the gf (Sunday at 7).\nWe were able to be seated right away and it seemed somewhat slow with only 2 other groups there (though a few more came in as we ate).\n\nI wish I could find an online menu of theirs so that I could list the items that I had, but they were all quite delicious and fresh.\n\nI'm not sure why people are complaining about the size of the roll for the price, but they seem fairly standard $8-14 a roll with the more expensive ones generally being larger.  All rolls were a standard 8 pieces.\n\nThe waiter was quite nice, they had a lot of unique rolls and other items.\n\nAlso, giving a restaurant a lower rating because it's far away is stupid.\n\nAnyway, the wait staff were able to take care of us just fine, though I could see that if there was a sudden rush that the service may have gone done.\n\nThe atmosphere seemed pretty standard for most sushi places with what sounded like the endings to various anime songs playing (I'm exaggerating).\n\nOverall the food was quite tasty, appropriately priced, and we will definitely come here again.
