From start to finish, this was the best meal of my life.\n\nFirst off, I love any restaurant that uses OpenTable. When I realized it would take me much longer than expected to check-in to my hotel, I grabbed my phone and went online to change the time of my reservation. There was no need to try to speak to someone and try to yell over the sounds of annoying hotel guests and slot machines, three clicks and it was done.\n\nUpon arrival and quick seating, we opted for the $89 four course Elegance Menu. I won't bore you with a play-by-play of the courses, mostly because I hate reading reviews that are written in that style. Suffice it to say that each course could fend for itself as a stand alone dish. As the meal progressed, the flavor profiles became more complex but played off of each other in a graceful manner. \n\nThe course that really blew my socks off was the prime filet mignon that was served over baby spinach, wild mushrooms, salsify, and a red wine reduction. As if I had to tell you, the filet was accompanied by a creamy and buttery potato puree. It's been days since I've dined here, but I just can't stop thinking about this dish. There was nothing groundbreaking about this play on the classic meat-n-potatoes dish, it was simply executed to total perfection.\n\nTo top it all off, the service and general ambiance was top-notch. Word to the wise though, you might want to think twice about being seated in any close proximity to the entrance of the restaurant if there is a country music performance going down at the nearby sushi restaurant because the PBR rodeo tour is in town.
