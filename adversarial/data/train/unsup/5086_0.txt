Saturday night birthday party and this was the place to be! We were a party of 11 and we were more then ready to take on some good food! \n\nBeing my first time here, I was excited to see what the fuss was all about. We arrived at 6pm and there was no parking in the front of the entrance, so we decided to drive down to the extra parking spaces. We walked up a very steep steep hill and by the time we made it to the top, we were sweating! Ugh! \n\nWalking towards the entrance you have to come across \"Horney the Bull,\" as he is right by the door to get in. I'm so sorry Horney but you stank!! You walk right on in and you then have to walk another steep hill to go up to where the hostess will tell you where to sit. \n\nWe were pointed to the direction and told where our party was at and so we made it right on over. \"Turn left, then right, then go down the stairs\/slide, take a left then keep walking then you will see them on your right.\" We sat down and looked on over our menu. We were brought biscuits (these were as dry as some feet I've seen) and fried bread. (the fried bread was so hard I almost broke my tooth) \n\nI decided to order the salmon that came with rice pilaf, a corn on the cob, and I got an extra side of mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of the potato skins and my mom decided to give the fried chicken a try. The food looked so delicious and I was excited to dig in. Unfortunately, the food had NO FLAVOR. I became great friends with the salt and pepper that night. \n\nEverything was flavorless. Why? Service was great as our waitress was very attentive. We were there at 6pm so we were able to see the sunset! Beautiful! \n\nNo entree here is less then $16 so keep that in mind. Portions are pretty big but again, the food has no flavor.. we received free cotton candy at the end of our meal! \n\nOur bill came out to $70.84 for the salmon, potato skins, fried chicken, and two drinks. Come here for the cool cowboy experience, not for great food.
