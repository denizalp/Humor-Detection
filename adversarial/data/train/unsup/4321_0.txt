I walked into this location in Fashion Mall a little under a year ago and fell in love. Who knew they had such a line of wearable handbags and jewelry? I never even heard of the brand and a girlfriend and I browsed in-store for a long time! The sales person showed me a range of items which were all so fun and unique! I liked how I was able to say what I liked (silver accents, inside pockets, boxy plain shapes) and she was able to direct me to some options. I wasn't sure about buying, so I walked out and thought it over! Of course, I came back to purchase, lol. My friend got a few pieces of silver jewelry, too.  They even had a promotion going on that allowed us to save some % off (I can't recall, but I think it was an extra 10% off).  \n\nI am attracted to their minimalist purses that don't have huge logos all over and the fact that I can actually use their bags daily.  I have some bags that are easily dirtied or are not structured enough in shape. Since visiting Henri Bendel in LV, I have been to the South Coast Plaza and Topanga Canyon stores. I get compliments on my small box clutch and navy chain purse from there. I have also gotten my mom and sister gifts since I love their items so much.\n\nWhen they make that Jetsetter backpack with silver accents, I'll definitely get one! I have yet to buy a candle, but apparently they are super popular.
