Great for coupons if you're a cardholder & my parents find many awesome, very inexpensive items cause of it.  Mom & I were looking for Roman Shades.\n\nThe blind\/shades expert just stood there, shoulder length blond hair, Russian accent, didn't offer help just looked away.  I had to walk over & ask her, do you work in this department?  \n\nShe looked up the 40% off Roman Shades in 47' & we were thrown shade... $311 for one... What?  She said Roman Shades are very expensive, these were also made-to-measure and that it'd take at least two weeks, wtf?  I understand they are expensive, but I am looking for standard fitted ones.  If I wanted to have my whole house fitted for drapes that would be another story, which they've done for us twice so I do understand blinds & shades ma'am.  \n\nWe went to Bed Bath & Beyond around the corner & found the most amazing Roman Shades in excellent quality, colors & the blackout was included.  JC Penneys charges more for blackout or room-darkening blinds & shades.  Not to mention the 40% off discount at BB&B, I ended up buying four Roman Shades that were very simple to put up, look fitted and classy so read my review on BB&B for pix... grand total of $345!
