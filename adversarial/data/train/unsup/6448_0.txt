1 week later, my skin is still in shock, flaking, peeling.  I purchased the combined treament of a Signature Pumpkin Orange Peel and Micro-Derm Skin Spatula procedure. I guess I must have mis-read the details, because I thought I was going to get a Micro-Derm - you know? the kind that feels like sanblasting, but with crystals??  \n\nWell, this was nothing like that!  Guess what?  my face was scraped with a surgical steel blade!  ya, i was pretty shocked, (and scared to move a muscle).  \n\nThe rest of the facial massage, creams, pumpkin peel, ect. was all fine.  \n\nThe 1st day or 2, my skin was pretty much on strike (normal for agravating the first 1 or 2 layers), but on the 3rd & 4th day, my face actualy had scratch marks on it, like I had been literally scratching my face with sharp nails.  \n\nI have had many facials & micr-derms preciously, but never, ever had scrapes on my face, so much flaking, nor peeling.  I have been using serums, creams, lotions, and calming toners to try to settle and address all the trauma, but i guess it will just take so more time.\n\nNichole, (the owner), was very nice, and kudos to her for owning a business at such a young age, but I can't say that I have a desire to go back, and i definately could never reccomend a facial with a surgial blade to anyone.  I just wish i had the regular micro-derm I've had in the past, and with good results.
