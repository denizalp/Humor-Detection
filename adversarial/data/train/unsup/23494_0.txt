I bought a couch from them 3 years ago before they even became popular thanks to Houzz and some reality Furniture TV show. It was the same story then and probably is now. Needless to say, I will never buy from them again. \n\nThey tout that it is Made in America and copy the RH design. It's great if you are sure its better quality and end up saving yourself a buck but just compare the same couch at RH and you'll know it isn't the same. I am quite sure that even though Made in China frequently gets a bad rep, this Made in America couch was not \"more comfortable\" than the original RH couch as they claimed. \n\nLong story short. I ordered a couch and was over-promised on the delivery date. It arrived 5 months after the promised date. The owner promised all sorts of leather cleaners and claimed he shipped them out to me but some how it vaporized into thin air; never got to me. Needless to say, when I called to determine whether it shipped I received a rude response. The first excuse was that he personally placed the cleaner with the couch and it must have never made it on to the delivery truck. The final excuse was - that they don't use that particular brand of cleaner anymore and he'd send the new one out ASAP. Never received it and I stopped calling. \n\nOnce you pay, you are at their mercy and the worse part is you almost feel you have to be nice to this douche. They screw-up but get mad at you for bringing it to their attention. \n\nNevertheless, I sold the couch on Craigslist.
