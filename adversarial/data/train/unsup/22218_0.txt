For your viewing pleasure, below is a summary of my love\/hate relationship with Ikea:\n\nLove:\n- The Showrooms. I always walk around pretending that every kitchen, bedroom and bathroom is part of my gigantic blue house :)\n- The gadgets\n- The kids' section\n- The plants!!!\n- The size!\n- The prices\n- The food (hell yes!!!)\n- The service\n- The little imported foods section (You know, with the gingerbread cookies...)\n\nHate:\n- You have to build it. No one comes.\n- It's ALWAYS packed\n- It's easy to get lost or to lose the person you came with!\n\nOkay, so obviously, I love it more than I hate it. Just a couple reasons to hate, but overall, I, like the rest of the world, am a big Ikea fan.\n\nBusted.
