This is one of my favorite places for studying or just hanging out. There are a few bars, burger joint and my favorite oyster bar located inside amongst a few other noteworthy eateries. They have corn hole boards which they put out on the patio. I love the industrial style openness and exposed brick. It's a vintage warehouse space hosting community events and a farmers market. The atmosphere is unmatched!
