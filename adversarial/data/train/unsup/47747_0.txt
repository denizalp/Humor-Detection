McAllister's will receive 4 stars for multiple reasons. Is it a true deli? No. But once you realize that and understand that it is simply a fast food place that serves deli sandwiches, soups and salads you come to appreciate it. In this part of town there aren't many options to eat something quick and not have it be greasy. McAllister's would not be 4 stars if surrounded by other awesome food locations (probably 3 stars then), but don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten there (salads and sandwiches).\n\nPeople giving this 2 stars or lower are crazy and just had the wrong expectations....
