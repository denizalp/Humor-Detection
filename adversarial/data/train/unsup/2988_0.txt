I just walked by my old apartment. It was a good place. I didn't have any problems with them getting things repaired when needed. You know the saying you don't what you got til it's gone? That's how I feel with AZ Mgmt. I have this slumlord landlady in Tremont now. Now I miss having an organized property manager. Grass ain't always greener.
