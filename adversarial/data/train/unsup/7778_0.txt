I think all these 4 or 5 star ratings must be written by the employees here because this place doesn't even deserve one star. I'm not going to review the inside because...well...we never made it inside. My friends and I were greeted by a security guard who was looking us up and down with a dirty look, which made us feel uncomfortable upon arrival. I think maybe they're used to only seeing fat people over 50 at this bar.\n\nWe handed over our ID's and he stamped me and a friend in but when it came time for my cousin to get a stamp, the guy denied her saying she wasn't 21. Uh...yeah, she's 23! He said her ID was fake even after he scanned it and it went through. He said she must have stolen the ID even though it was her own ID and it looked EXACTLY like her! What AUDACITY! We weren't about to leave without a fight. After his bickering, he called over 5 SECURITY PEOPLE! How does it take that many people to do an idiot's job? So then they called over \"the head of security\" (what a douchebag!). He said he was going to refuse us service without any reason. We were completely polite to him and he still was an AHOLE. We showed him her credit cards, school ID's, everything and he said we were wasting our time!\n\nMind you that we had been getting into all the hottest clubs on the most poppin' nights (hassle\/cover free) before we came here and were DENIED!? Plus we were guests at the hotel so we complained to the hotel later [which btw, thats another story because the hotel itself, treasure island, is a piece of crap too]. We literally just came over because we thought it looked hilarious and we were tired from dancing all night. This place is a complete disgrace and apparently, after talking to management, we found out that this place is a new development and they're on a trial lease or some sort of short term thing. \n\nLooking forward to laughing at this place when it's shut down :)
