Disappointing....\nGot there @ 9:40am on the Saturday before Mother's Day. There were hardly any customers and they said they could get me in right away for a pedicure. Less than 5 minutes they sat me down and soaking my feet but it took them over 35 minutes to finally get to me. Then the callus remover hardly removed the dead skin and had to skip the hot-stone and lotion because it was already over my time on it but yet they still charge me full price.
