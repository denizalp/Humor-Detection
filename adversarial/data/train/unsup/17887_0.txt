Located inside Scarborough Town Centre.\n\nI appreciate the convenience of this Walmart. It's right across the street from my moms Toronto apt. I love that I'm able to walk to this location and grab whatever I may need for the kitchen or bathroom. \n\nI always find different candies here that I don't necessarily find in the US. Perfect gifts to take back home for family and friends. Cashiers are friendly and quick enough. I usually don't have very high expectations when shopping at Walmart. This place serves the masses. It's definitely not quality service. \n\nJust so glad I can find what I need without breaking the bank.
