True China food prepared like the east coast we're used to. I'm from MA and this place has the Chinese menu we are used to in Boston or even NY. It's not the closest one for us in Gilbert but it is the best. Have tried others but this will be our regular stop. Prices are reasonable. I have to give a shot out to the woman taking orders and ringing them up. I first gave my order to a man that was there and he had an attitude because I was using more than one card. The woman there took my payments with ease and professionalism. She knows how to handle a business. Didn't make me feel bad for using different cards. His expression at first made me feel uncomfortable but she made up for it with her attitude and grace. If you're looking for real Chinese food and good prices this is good place. They're quick and accurate when you place a phone order. Food hot like it should be.
