I haven't been here for a couple of years and a friend suggested for dinner and glad I came,  the place is clean and the whole staff is very friendly,  what a great manager\/hostess Angie is so friendly and our sever Carri was awesome.  Can't wait to go back and try more things. We had a pepperoni pizza. Yummy..
