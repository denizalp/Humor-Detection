I walked in an hour before closing: I was immediately greeted by a hostess with the worst attitude I've ever encountered. She said \"let me see if we can even serve you\" what kind of statement is that? I'd say four minutes later she sashayed back & said follow me abruptly. I should of walked out then and there. We were seated, our waiter thankfully didn't have an attitude. He wasn't pushy with getting an order in & got our drink order in right away. We got our drinks pretty promptly, then put in our dinner orders. That's again where it went bad. Our drinks eventually went empty and unnoticed for long periods of time. And I don't think I've ever waited that long for my entree to be cooked and served, EVER. (Anywhere) The waiter took more notice to the coworkers at the bar and a few patrons drinking. Then I noticed he had been drinking, in between checking in very sparsely with us. (NOT OK) We were finally served, our waiter stumbled as he did so. The food was okay, I just wanted to get the heck out of there so we are as fast as we could. I will never return due to the lack of class, etiquette and respect these jokers (staff) I ended up with food poisoning on top of it all, I feel like they messed with my meal.
