Rude idiot answering the phone... Gave me a price... Asked if he can do any better... Hang up on me right away when i was asking what his schedule is.. \nPeople like this dont need to be around and providing services. All i did was asked politely if he can do any better. I dont think its a crime to ask for a better price. What kind of customer service is this? Called him back.. No answer... texts me back saying to keep my money.. Lol.. He doesnt need low ballers... Have a good rest of your life....
