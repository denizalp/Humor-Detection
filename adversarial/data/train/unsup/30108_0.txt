I just had a bad experience ordering shirts on line. The picture of the embossed men's T does not clearly indicate the lines appearing in the fabric of the shirt on the website. I ordered the shirt because the picture of it is very favorable. The shirt itself is really ugly with the lines in it. After attempting to explain this to their customer service person, I was told that JF will not take back \"final sale\" items unless you either refuse the package at the door or the product is damaged. It is clear to me that they are doing whatever they have to to unload these shirts which few would buy if displayed in a store. Buyer Beware!
