My husband and I found this place on Yelp a few months back. We have been trying to nail down the exact month, however with an 8 month old, life is sometimes a blur. I remember going Valentine's day but I feel confident that wasn't our first time. Anyways, I digress. The food is great. The food is cheap. And the service is friendly. Go and enjoy!
