I've been hearing about LOS for such a long time. Today, on a whim, we decided to finally check the place out.\n\nPad See Ewe w\/chicken (4.5\/5)\n\nVery tasty and full of flavor, this is the dish I was most impressed with during my meal. Just the right combination of sweet and salty. Portion was just moderate, not generous but also not too small. I enjoyed the pad see ewe very much and will definitely order it again.\n\nLarb (1.5\/5)\n\nQuite the disappointment, both in terms of taste and portion size. First of all, the portion size was surprisingly miniscule and left me wanting more food. Not necessarily more of this larb, just more of some kind of food. Taste was also a let down as the portion tasted very bland. No more larb from LOS for me.\n\nService (3\/5)\n\nWe apparently went during the lunch rush, so it was quite busy. The service was adequate, but nothing outstanding. Granted, they were slammed, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAmbiance\/ Room (2\/5)\n\nI dig enjoy the wine cellar and bar area. Very cool. Otherwise, it seemed like an old, tacky mish mosh of items. Plus the tables are squeezed in too tight together, IMO. I could easily hear conversations around me with no effort at all. Plus the actual location is in a pretty sketchy area to begin with.\n\nAlthough it did not live up to the hype, it was still pretty good. We have already decided we are definitely coming back to try other menu items and hopefully that will happen during a slower time. \n\n3 stars.\n\nA-Ok.
