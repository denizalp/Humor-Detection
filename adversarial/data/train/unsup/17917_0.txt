Yes it is five stars without 5 star prices... but its not exactly cheap. Excellent menu, great food, and amazing presentation and service. I'm not one to get excited and throw out four or five stars.  Go here. Anything you get will be pleasing. I loved the nigiri, and spicy tuna was not simple like most places.
