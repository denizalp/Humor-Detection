Finally!  A good Filipino bakery in AZ!  \n\nIt's a wonderful place to find local fresh baked Filipino goods here instead of the plastic bagged ones shipped from California laden with anti-molding agents and dough conditioners.  \nI picked up a bag of Pan de Sal.  If you get there early enough, it will be fresh from the oven.  Siopao, a steamed dumpling filled with your choice of pork adobo or curried chicken is so good even after a couple of days in the fridge reheated.  My little cutie pie loved the loaf of sweet bread filled with coconut jam (macapuno).  The meat empanada was tasteless and dry, even the dough.  \nThey serve the usual lumpia, adobo, palabok and much more for lunch.  \nI am really impressed with their food and affordable prices. I will definitely be back to get some of the meryenda (glutinous rice snacks).
