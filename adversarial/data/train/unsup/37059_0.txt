Best apartment complex in Tempe hands down. Yes it is pricy, but you get what you pay for. The units are beautiful, the grounds are well maintained, the maintenance staff is prompt and very friendly. Reserved underground parking is a HUGE bonus in the AZ heat and with the crazy monsoons - your car stays cool in the summer, warm in the winter, and not crushed by falling trees :)\n\n Overall my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our time living here. It is a pretty quiet complex, you don't hear too much noise from other residents which is always a consoderation with apartment living. Every time I put in a maintenance ticket it was taken care of same day, I once put in a ticket on a Sunday for them to replace my air filter and had a knock on my door within an hour! Wow! \n\nThe office staff (shoutout to Apha and Albert) are all very professional and were always quick to answer any questions or emails I sent. I also was very pleasantly surprised to receive my whole deposit back after moving out. That is the true test of any apartment - I was worried they would try to nickel and dime me for any tiny damages they could find but I was very pleased that the did not! Seriously, I have nothing bad to say at all about this place. I would recommend Camden Sotelo very highly to anyone!
