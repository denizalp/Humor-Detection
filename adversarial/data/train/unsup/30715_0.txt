Oh, I get it. It's 8:30 on a Saturday morning and you don't want to work. So you take it out one the five customers who come in to order. Then proceed to make a lackluster sandwich. Skimpy toppings and you smooshed my bacon.  If this didn't help to prolong my tubing adventure I'd only give you one star. Disqualified!
