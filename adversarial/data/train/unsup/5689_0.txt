On my return visit to Instanbul Grill, I'm so glad we had a yelper with us who had actually traveled to Turkey and knew how to order. Hells yes, Yelp Int'l Supper Club! \n\nThe 4 of us sat outside on their cute, quiet little patio and enjoyed a cold appetizer platter. You can order different sizes, but the smallest one (meant for 2 people) fed the 4 of us perfectly. Speaking of perfect, the apps and dips were phenom. The only one I didn't like was the hummus, and I've mentioned before that I prefer way less tahini (it makes it a little bitter.) Everything else was to-die-for. The standouts were, again, the yogurt sauce, which did not have too much mint in it--thank god--and the baba ganoush. You could tell it was homemade and they used charred eggplant that gave it a smokey taste. SO. Good. Pair it all with their fresh, grilled pita and you'll be stuffed before your meal arrives. \n\nBut you'll still probably eat it because it's delicious. \n\nListening to my very smart and seasoned yelper friend, I ordered a combo plate of both their d√∂ner and lamb adana with rice. You could really tell everything was homemade in-house and fresh. The rice was pretty average, so I just ordered an extra side of yogurt sauce for dipping. Oh yes, it was divine. \n\nLastly, I'm totally cool with the prices here, which are a steal for what you get. Even with drinks your bill will be friendly to your wallet and you'll feel better for eating fresh, grilled noms, rather than a greasy, hot mess. \n\nI'll be back for sure, just not for that hummus.
