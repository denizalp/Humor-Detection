I don't know how to describe the food here... It was FANTASTIC. Went here on my 30th birthday in April, and I could not of had a better dinner anywhere. I wanted to savor each and every bite it was so delicious. Our whole group felt the same way and we each had something different. My meal was the salmon lasagna, you won't regret trying this! Also, the atmosphere was amazing. There a front outside area, theres an inside, and theres this garden area out back which is huge. we sat in the garden area in the back..it was so beautiful. It was heated so we were not chilly, and it was lively. There was a great jazz band on a stage..and different levels of tables all surrounding this stage. It was wonderful. Prices and service was great also.
