Pete's has been in my life since I was a little girl.  I can remember going to the original location on Van Buren with my grandparents.  All of the locations look less than to be desired from the outside, but there's treasures to be found within the menu.  \n\nMy staple used to be the 5 or 7 piece shrimp and chips.  Gotta get extra sauce.   While I still love the shrimp and chips, I've discovered a new front runner, thanks to my hubby J.  \n\nHe's lived here since he was 5 years old and had never been to a Pete's.  2 weeks ago this past Sunday, I had a preggo craving for some fried tasty goodness.  I directed J to the online Pete's menu and he figured he'd give Pete's a try.  \n\nMy order - 7 piece shrimp and chips with extra 14oz Pete's Sauce.  $6.10\nJ's order - Triple Everything Monsterburger.  Large chips.  $7.00\nI looked at J and said...uhh...are you sure you want a burger?  He said yep.  \n\nI dont know, something about ordering a burger from Pete's always kinda weirded me out.  But I figured...it's his gut.  So be it.  \nI go and order through the drive-through.  A few minutes later, I get our order and drive back home.  \n\nOMG!  This burger was freaking HUGE and looked AWESOME!!  J took his first few bites and I inquired as to how it tasted.  He raved about this burger.   It was so big though that he couldn't finish all of it.  That's saying a lot cause J can eat!  \n\nFlash forward to this past Monday.  I was craving a good burger on the cheap.  J suggested Pete's.  I about fell on the floor!  This burger must have been something else!  \n\nWell, let me tell you ~ The hell with the seafood!  Order a burger, people!!!\n\nAfter ordering my own Monster Everything Burger, I know where my go to burger joint is going to be from now on!!
