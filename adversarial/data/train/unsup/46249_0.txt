We will definitely be back here, what a quaint location that I hope to introduce to friends.  Got a loaf of milk bread to cut into nice thick slices to make french toast (try it you will be hooked too) and a package of three 'sticks' that had what looked like meringue spread on top with a raspberry  jelly in a criss cross pattern and they were light fluffy and just barely sweet the perfect amount of sweet to cure the craving :)
