Very very good lunch buffet.  It probably doesn't top the Wynn for lunch but it is  cheaper too so you got to scale things appropriately.  The highlight items of the meal were the raspberry chocolate mousse, steamed clams, and a fabulous variety of fish (even better than what was offered at the Wynn for dinner buffet).  The fish I tried included salmon, tuna, african bluenose, wahoo, steamed halibut, and chilean seabass!!!!  My favorites were the streamed halibut and the chilean seabass...they flaked off very easily and the chilean seabass has a nice natural oily texture..delicious!!!!\n\nThe cut meat like turkey, 7 spice lamb leg,  beef flank, and chicken were just average.  Still, a very great buffet.   I ate so much that I got dizzy and had to rest at the table...but it was worth it.  =)
