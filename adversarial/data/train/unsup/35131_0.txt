Holy crap! Was completely surprised by this little joint. The $8 for $14 worth of food yelp coupon is redeemable by smart phone, so you can buy it on the spot. \n\nGot the veggie burrito bowl - I don't say this often,  but this would have been just as good without the cheese. There was so much going on that it wouldn't have been missed. Meal was a touch salty, but otherwise delicious. My husband highly recommended the carne asada.\n\nService was a bit slow for lunch, and the music selections are a bit off-putting.  Otherwise, five stars.
