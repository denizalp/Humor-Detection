All the pretty pictures I kept seeing of the food here won me over to check it out. A friend and I decided to do a \"Frida\" day by checking out Frida Kahlo's exhibit at the Heard Museum and then coming here for a late lunch. El Panzon (slang for \"big belly\") Y Frida is a beautiful restaurant in Scottsdale that has an artsy rustic-modern setting. They serve up really pretty inventive Latin inspired dishes. When you first enter, you are immediately drawn to the large mural of Frida on the back driftwood wall. El Panzon Y Frida opens at lunchtime and stays open pretty late for the late night crowd. We ate light and ordered off the small bites and shared plates menu. The House Gyozas are similar to pot stickers and are filled with sweet potato, carrot and beet puree. The Orange Beef Taco Bites were delicious and the Ceviche (sea bass, mango habenero, cucumber and radish) was nice and light. Paulina Martinez is the chef here and she really creates some gorgeous colorful plates. It was happy hour so I ordered their popular Chili Cucumber Capirihna. The drink was pretty amazing and had a nice blend of lime\/cucumber with a hint of spiciness. They were nice enough to offer us dessert (a killer chocolate mousse) because my friend wore an outfit inspired by Frida. The service was probably the only part of our experience that could use a tiny bit of improvement. But overall we had a wonderful time. El Panzon Y Frida is a great new addition to the local culinary scene.
