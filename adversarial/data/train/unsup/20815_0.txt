There are frat dorm rooms that have more space and charm than this joint. But it still gets five stars because there's no Thai food in AZ that tastes this good. \n\nThis is what I want out of Thai food: delicious, and lots of it. And that is what Chanpen does. \n\nAlso, Chanpen sounds like an Asian trying to say \"Champion\". I am Asian so that qualifies me to make racially offensive statements.
