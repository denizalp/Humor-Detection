Started at about a one star...we didn't get into vegas until after 830 which was the last pick up time so we found our own ride here...lyft. we spoke with people twice saying that was ok. getting in was horrible and confusing. Having fun inside with the cute guys had brought it back up to a four. \nNow we're trying to use our included ride back and the person isn't responding and the door people are rude as fudge...to be updated later....\nJust downgraded to one because this is freaking ridiculous
