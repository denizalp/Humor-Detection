Food = 5 star  Service = 0 star\n\nThe best way to order... Pick a clear photo from Yelp and show it to the guy that takes order instead of trying to explain what you want. \n\nTip... When you order their whole duck, try to tell them you want the one in the showcase. \n\nI came back a couple of times after my first visit. I tried BBQ pork and roast pork. Absolutely delicious. \nStill, can't give 5 star to a business with rude service. On top of that, they only take cash and they are closed on Friday!? What kind of restaurant business is closed on Friday (especially at night. Major prime money making day for any restaurant business.)\n\n..... I will be back!
