I've been so excited to try this place! At 9am on Saturday we finally decided to give it a shot. The lines were long and all the seats were taken. On a rainy day, I was hoping to sit there and enjoy my donut but we couldn't because the small space was packed. \n\nI couldn't resist my oreo cream cheese donut staring me in the face from its clear box. I ripped into it in the car on the way home. It was delicious. Definitely more like a dessert than a coffee and donut type donut. But every bite was heaven. I can't wait to try more flavors. \n\nSome people came in asking for very simple donuts, such as glazed, and they were already sold out. 9am on a Saturday morning, I don't think ANYTHING should be sold out yet - especially some of the more \"basic\" varieties. I'll be back to try it again. Hopefully we will be able to sit and enjoy a donut next time.
