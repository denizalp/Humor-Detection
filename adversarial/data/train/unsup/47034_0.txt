Don't get me wrong, I actually like Muji for their look and their aesthetic. I lived in Japan for a couple of years and found they were a good balance between price and functionality. Yes, some of the items were a little pricey but overall I found them similar to other places in Tokyo.\n\nToday I happened to be in the Atrium on Bay and as I'm walking up the escalator I happen on a familiar site. I actually did a double take on seeing the store as it was truly unexpected. But there before me was a Muji so I had to walk in and take a look.\n\nThe store is tiny. Really, it's incredibly small especially compared to the ones I've seen in Japan. They only sell a fraction of what you can get over there and then you come to the elephant in the room, the prices. \n\nI won't lie, it's expensive especially for what it is you actually get. I wandered around the store which didn't take much time because of the size, checked out a few things and then turned around and walked out.\n\nMaybe it's growing pains, maybe they'll be able to find that balance between price and value that they got overseas but we'll have to see. But if the crowds in the store are any indication, they might be here for a while.\n\nNow if the rumours are true and we'll be getting a UniQlo sometime this year or next then I'll be really happy.
