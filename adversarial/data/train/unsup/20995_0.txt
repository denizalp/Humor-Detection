I know it is hit or miss with nail salons, but after my last experience here I was so frustrated I promised myself I would never come back. I came in for a fill w\/ gel and a pedi. After waiting 45 mins I sat down for my pedi. After my pedi, I asked where I should sit for my fill. One of the ladies then informed me that they don't have time to do a fill and to come back tomorrow. They acted like they never heard me even tell them I needed a fill! They had about 40 minutes to close and I begged them because I had a big event the next day and couldn't come back in the morning. They were super rude and were not accommodating at all. I was visibly upset and obviously really desperate in that moment. Nothing worse than when you're nails look yucky...makes you feel gross. Anyways I was so shocked about how awful they were being and left. I painted my grown out fill myself and was reminded the whole next day how pissed I was at that whole experience. I say avoid at all costs. I've gone a few times because I live in the neighborhood. Aside from the workers being rude, it is hot, smelly and gross in there. There are so many better nail salons in the valley!
