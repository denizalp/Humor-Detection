Decided to stop in here to get the truck washed. Gold service $20 + $2 for oversized vehicle. A person directed me into the proper lane for service. Strange guy checking my window trying (and not succeeding with a dry rag) to clean off spots. Service guy comes up, hands me a menu of what's available, I pick one and inside I go. Strange guy follows me saying something about my window chips but I just ignore him. I've been to 2 car washes in Henderson, and both times the window chip guy is there.\n\nATTENTION car wash owners - GET RID OF THESE SCAMS. Bad for business.\n\nI thought my truck was washed very well. The lady who did most of the hand work was very detailed, even put armor all on my side step rubber things. She did a nice job, I watched her for about 15 minutes. \n\nA few streaks on the windows, for me no big deal because its a work truck. \n\nI read a lot of the reviews after I sat down and some of them are pretty brutal. From what I saw they did a decent enough job. I've gotten a lot of car washes in Vegas, and this was as good as any of them. If you want your car detailed, I recommend going to a place that specializes in that service. This is a basic car wash, hand dry type place.
