Wowza. I am in love with GTBR! Following a Yelp event with the lovely @Sarah K. and her sister, @David B., and @Curtis G., I'm happy to tell the Yelp World that GTBR is one of the 'burgh's bests.\n\nI had no idea the extent of the riverfront trails in Pittsburgh until this event. The trails are a great way to see the city while doing something good for your body. GTBR provides a bike, helmet, and lock for your ride. The bikes have a water bottle rack and small pouch for anything else you need. GTBR was nice enough to provide us with water, but you can either bring your own or buy some there.\n\nYou can rent bikes by hour or daily.  GTBR offers pre-booking online with a discount, too. We rode our bikes over to Redfin Blues for a Beer Break halfway through our journey. I was def nervous about hopping on a bike after not having ridden for more than ten years, and it's true what they say that once you learn, you never forget. \n\nThere is a small part of the trail system that involves riding through the city and isn't an actual trail. However, plans are in the works for a switchback to complete that spot and should be ready within less than a year.\n\nSpecial thanks to our tour guide for the night, and Tom, one half of the couple that owns GTBR. Both were super-friendly, informative, enthusiastic, and passionate about what they do.  This was an AWESOME event! GTBR is a unique way for visitors to see our amazing city and for locals to remember why they love it here.\n\nDon't forget to cool off after your ride at the misting station out front.
