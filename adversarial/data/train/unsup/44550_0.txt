Love this place, i know a lot of people rate it low because its not like other lounges in \"big\" cities, but for the location and price, its a really good place to hang out with friends. Me and 3 friends come here and chill for hours for just 17$, cant really beat that.\n\nStaff is really friendly and they have a nice selection of flavors.
