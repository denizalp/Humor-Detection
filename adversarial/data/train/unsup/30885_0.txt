This is the only bad thing about buying an apple product.  Half of the employees stand around talking and the other half try and look busy. It's easier take an appointment with a top notch doctor and when your appointment arrives you hurry up and wait. Who ever designed the customer service model is an idiot. I currently count 8 employees standing around talking to each other. There is no organization or leadership, I would be embarrassed to be the supervisor   .
