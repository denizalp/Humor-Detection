Not sure if Q Bistro got a new owner or decided to give the old interior a new makeover, but I like how Q Bistro has improved from last year. \n\nThe tables used to have a curtain that separated them from one another and I'm pretty sure it got annoying having to deal with them every night. There was also only one server the whole night so service was slow.\n\nI initially stopped coming because their food was mediocre and the free shaved ice you get with your check in was just a bowl of solid ice. \nNow, the tables are set up in a way that the servers and the customers are able to maneuver around easily. There's this button on the table that you press when you need service and it finally works! \n\nMy sister and I have been enjoying the chicken wings with supreme sauce and the half half pizza. There are about five side dishes served with whatever you order as well. \nThere is also more than one server working and the service is quick. They usually tell us to press the button for service but the servers still come to check up on us.\nI do like what Q Bistro is doing and I do hope that they continue to do even better from here.
