We came here for a birthday dinner and had a very disappointing experience! Our waiter seemed confused and was very annoyed that he had to do separate checks. He hardly talked to us at all besides making rude or snarky comments. Some of our friends got service faster at the bar than through our waiter! It's been 17 minutes and counting and we still have not gotten our drinks! Terrible service. .. so disappointed!
