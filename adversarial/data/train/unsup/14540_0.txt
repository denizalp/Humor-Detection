EBC... World famous right? Well, they need to take a cue from the Hakkassan group in how they organize their pre-sale ticket lines cause it was no use buying pre-sale EXPEDITED ENTRY tickets when there was no advantage to that at all. We still had to wait in a \"guest list\" line. The wait was about an hour for EBC at Night featuring Marshmello. It was a bummer for sure. No one knew where to direct us where to go. We asked several staff and some security and the answer as to where to go was vague. Even the group behind us in line, who had the same type of tickets, had the same issue on not knowing where to go. Staff except one person that finally noticed our ticket type got us in but at that point we had been waiting in line so long that our IDs had been checked twice already... SMH. The general admission line was moving faster than ours. That should never be IMO.\n\nI've been to almost all the Vegas clubs and mega clubs so its just not sour grapes on my part. They really need to organize theirs.. I know EBC is probably the biggest capacity pool party but still. It was unacceptable. We have friends that work\/dj in some of the well known clubs in town and when I told them the wait time, they were shocked... That's what happens when you dont get bottle service for once, I guess... But that line wasnt moving much faster than ours either.\n\nIt's a big space. Lots of room to walk around. Sound system is great. Marshmello was pretty dope. He def brings the energy and gets the crowd moving. But the experience of the line was such a hassle especially when you pay more for EXPEDITED ENTRY which turned out to be more DELAYED ENTRY than anything.
