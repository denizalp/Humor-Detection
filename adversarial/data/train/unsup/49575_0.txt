Wow!!  After eating, we had told the staff these were the best burritos we'd had ever eaten.  This place surpassed all expectations---proving true to the age old quote: \"don't judge a book by its cover\".\n\nThe service here was fantastic with the cashier and employees interacting with us from the start.  We got some tips about local tourist spots to check out, valuable information for first-time Toronto travelers.  \n\nLocation wise, the room was kind of small and cramped.  In addition, there was an AC leak at the time ruining some seats, but the staff accommodated for us perfectly.  \n\nHowever, for all concerns regarding the location, the food was purely exceptional.  We purchased vegetarian bowls and burritos, and the staff took extra care to avoid contamination with meat items.  Even the medium salsa was quite mild and gave a tangy flavor in the burritos.  In addition, the lettuce gave a good amount of crunch and the balance of the ingredients was perfect across all foods.  The burrito was served well and also easy to eat.  \n\nWould definitely recommend, and we're coming back for sure.
