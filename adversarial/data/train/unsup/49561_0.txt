We had such a fantastic experience on 12\/2! There were 10 of us and everything was made to perfection! Tom gave great service, Sandra and her team made everything to perfection (the chicken and waffles seem pricey, but GET IT!) Karris took the dessert to another level (the nutella cake, banana pudding, the COBBLER!) Scott and Steve took care of us and Megan arranged for our return (Party of 15) on 12\/4! Bryce and Tanya handled our large party. Fried Tomato BLT is a MUST! I wish I more pics, but it was so good, we couldnt wait to take a pic! Everyone must come here. Now!
