weil i was actually hoping to get some real cantonese food here, but it disappointed me. however, in general, the foods here are good, just don't expect them to be authentic chinese foods. and i like the decoration here too. it didn't really feel like i was eating in a chinese restaurant. and the staffs were really nice. btw, if you are looking for a cup of real cantonese milk tea, you would probably not want to have it here. because it tasted like the one i make at home with mile tea powders..
