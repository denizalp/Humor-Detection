Yeah, yeah, yeah!  I know--the irony of a non-drinker going to a beer emporium for lunch.  Hey, I may not imbibe but that doesn't mean I don't like the occasional repast of good pub chow.  I went with my coworker Maria and to be fair, there are strict rules against alcohol consumption during business hours.\n\nBut o-my the food here is good, if a little expensive!  Maria and I began by splitting an order of wild mushrooms & leek tarts.  Picture a baked pastry filled with beer braised leeks, chives and shallots!  Mmmm, baked pastry. Pump that insulin, Susan!  Pump!  I was considering the Flemish Onion soup when suddenly the Belgian Burger caught my eye.   Oh baby, that burger was to die for!  Ground lamb & beef with shallots & bacon, topped with melted smoked gouda!  \n\nSo I guess my burger was gouda 'nuff!
