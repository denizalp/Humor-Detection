I came on a friend's recommendation yesterday. I ordered the black rice flavor. It was $7.05 after tax. You get two scoops, but they aren't very large scoops. For reasons unknown to me, they also make more than the put into your cup. Not a little more. Quite a bit more. Service is passable, but not outstanding, if you consider the price. The ice cream itself was nice and creamy and had a decent amount of black rice flavor, but it could have been a tad stronger. The ice cream isn't as sweet as your typical ice cream. I'm guessing they're catering to Asian palates. I could be totally wrong.\n\nWhat I don't like is that they don't wash the mixing bowls between uses. I'm guessing they have a bowl per flavor and when someone orders that flavor, they pull that bowl out and use it again. When I ordered, they pulled out a bowl that already had a good amount of purple rice cream mix stuck to it. I suppose that being doused in liquid nitrogen does kill a lot of germs, but it doesn't look good, especially for a product where I'm basically paying for a pretty show.\n\nI tried it once. I doubt I'll try it again. The show didn't impress me much.
