Food is awesome. But the service is terrible. The server ignored us all evening when he talked to all his tables around us. Why? Because our french accent isn't a good fit for good tipping. That's a fact. French people don't know how to tip. But we have been living in Las Vegas for 16 years and we know tipping and we know how to give a good tip to a good server. We still left a decent tip but not because we had a nice service. Once again go for the food you won't regret it one bit. It's amazing. As for as service goes you got my point.
