Whoa, best sushi in Toronto by a very far distance from everything else. I'm not even sure I could name another place with comparable quality. I went here with a buddy last night to try their prix fixe...very 'bromantic', I know.  We thought after the first plate (which had four things on it: sashimi, panko crusted black cod, duck salad, and salmon consommé --- I have a shellfish allergy, so i got duck salad instead of some soft shell crab dish and a lobster consommé), we thought we could probably add a platter of sashimi atop the tasting menu, so we got that inserted into our meal. Wow, it was amazing. Oh yeah, the panko crusted black cod was great too!! The rest of our tasting menu consisted of sushi, 3 pieces of which were blowtorched...eat those last! You'll want to savour them. And dessert was great too...not sure it was very japanese, but it was great none the less. Service was nice and friendly.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back here again. The platter we ordered was great, but we didn't really need it with the tasting menu. We were hungry and eager to eat as much as we could, I guess. But ultimately, I think the prix fixe by itself is a nice sufficient meal on its own. I don't know which I would chose between though...prix fixe or large platter? Roughly the same price...both equally good.  I've heard prior to coming that maybe the price point is a little too high here. I would have to disagree after the meal. I thought it was right on. Yum!
