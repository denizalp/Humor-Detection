So I'm writing this review not because I ate there which honestly I was really excited to eat here! But upon entering no one greeted me or my family, then when we asked for a table for 5, in the very empty place I might add, they said no we have a reservation at 8 for 50 people crazy huge but it's 5:30 when we entered and we weren't going to take 2 and a half hours to eat but alas we didn't get seated the two lady's that were helping us out kept looking at each other almost ignore us to I want to say just to make us leave. So we did not get great service what so ever and I don't yelp often I don't yelp bad reviews but just for me to step in here and say no I wouldn't come back is hard but I did it it's done my opinion
