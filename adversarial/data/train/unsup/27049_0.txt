I'm a big fan of celebrity chefs so my goal was to try to visit as many as I could. I came here ready to be WOW'ed and stumbled upon the \"Fresh Catch of the Day\" with some lobster and shrimp sauce. It was a small dish for $30 at lunch time. It was really good but a bit overpriced. I also had ordered a Mushroom Goat Cheese pizza which was a little better than average and a boring salad
