Nice spot to people-watch. It was enjoyable at night outside on the patio. The pulled pork sliders were yummy, but the garlic fries that came out with them were matchstick style and cold. Asked to have them exchanged for the kale side salad which was just OK. We shared the fried pickles - don't forget to let your server know when you check in for your free fried pickles or Brussels sprouts! They were interesting, and pretty good. Beers were over $9, kind of high. Overall a fun experience with good food.
