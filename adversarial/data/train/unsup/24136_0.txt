The pricing was confusing. All over the net it said that breakfast was from 7-11 am, and was $22.99  So when we arrived ta 9:30 and were charged $28.99 each we were a bit taken aback. Honestly that felt like a bit of a rip off. \n\nBut We have to admit the food was pretty damned good. There was a great selection of food from all over. Whether it be Asian or American or even a traditional British carvery, and the quality was amazing. I even went back for seconds. \n\nThe roulette wheel of gelato was amazing.
