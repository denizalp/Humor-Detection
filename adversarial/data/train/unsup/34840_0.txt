I used to always go to this deli for my perogies but on my last 3 visits the perogies I bought were very rubbery almost like they were old, freezer burnt and just not the quality they used to be which is a huge disappointment to this Ukrainian girl. The cabbage rolls with bacon are still delicious but the perogies definitely need improvement.
