Honest Ed's is more of a tourist spot than a great store, but when you live in downtown Toronto, this is the closest you're going to get to a Walmart (except for that Walmart at Dufferin Mall). \n\nThe inside of the store is confusing and it's designed to make you walk through the entire thing before you can actually leave. The hardcore money saving grandmas are aggressive on the weekends and the line ups are long due to slow cashiers who probably hate their lives. \n\nI don't mean to hate on Honest Ed's though, it still holds a special place in my heart for its sense of humor, weird finds, and Toronto landmark status. A must-visit for anyone in the Toronto area.
