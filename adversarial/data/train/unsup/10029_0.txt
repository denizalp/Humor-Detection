The decor is actually shoddy, and kitschy. The bathrooms are filthy. Typical Calgary, it's a dive that somehow purports itself as a classy establishment to self-justify its exorbitant drink prices.\n\nYet, Ming is a good place. Why? \n\nFirst: Deep-down, Ming knows it's a dirty swill-hole, thus, the staff is extremely friendly. The doorman doesn't treat you like a piece of garbage that's blown in off the street. \n\nSecond: The staff can mix a drink that's not on the menu. They can actually take instruction. This alone places Ming above the majority of bars in Calgary.\n\nThird: The gin martinis are great.
