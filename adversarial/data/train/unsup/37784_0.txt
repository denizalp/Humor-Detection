I came through the drive through with my two kids one evening for some chicken. I knew the menu was limited beforehand, but hoped that the chicken and fries would knock my socks off. Spoiler Alert: They did NOT knock my socks off. \n\nThe chicken is pretty good, the fries kind of suck, the garlic bread is soggy, and the coleslaw is delicious (and I'm not a coleslaw fan). The cane sauce is just your basic fry sauce (mayo, ketchup, and a wee bit of spice). There, that covers the entire menu. \n\nIt would be so bad except that the price is ridiculously high. I would much rather go to Chick-Fil-A for comparatively delicious chicken and much better other menu items. Sorry, Canes, but we won't be back.
