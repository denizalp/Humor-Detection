XO Karaoke\n\nLook XO, we've had some good times, some great times and a LOT of sweaty, ugly pics. But it seems like you haven't changed since 2002. Oh sure, it was great at the time when you were constantly getting new songs from the White Stripes or The Strokes but what have you done for me lately?\n\nYou're like that (proverbial) guy I taught ESL with in Japan in my 20s who decided to hang back \"just a little bit longer\" but now you're in your 40s and rocking a gross ponytail and going to underground sex clubs in Tokyo because everyone else has moved on. Now the only difference is you are stingy with the echo and music volume controls and I have to summon the staff to move a dial when every other karaoke joint in Toronto let's me do it myself.\n\nAnd the art on the walls? FML!
