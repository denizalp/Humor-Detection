Sandwiches aren't exactly gourmet, but this place certainly tries! I love their Vermonter which is delicious and unique - turkey, ham, cranberry mayo, cheddar and granny smith apples! The egg salad sandwich is also a bit of heaven. And their soups...! Everything was super fresh. \n\nTo top it off, I ordered online and when I walked in and got to the front of the line, the man correctly guessed that I was the one who called in an order for an egg salad sandwich! Maybe I paused when he expected an order, or was eyeing the boxed up order on the counter, but I'd like to think it's just another bit of magic - just like the food!
