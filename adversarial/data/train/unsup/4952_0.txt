I was a bit confused if this place is under new ownership or not as the sign above it implied it was.  I thought the Garlic Knots were average, although I never seem to like bread appetizers as much as most people.  They were definitely loaded with garlic if that's your thing.  \n\nPizza was solid.  Fairly thin and relatively crispy.  Sauce a bit too thin for my tastes and I actually like it a bit cheesier and greasier.  Price is reasonable.
