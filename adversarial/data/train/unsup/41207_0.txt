Vintner Grill is hit or miss. If you want to go to a chic date night place with your lady or gent, then this is a nice option in Summerlin. If you want to play some video poker, get some appetizers and drink some premium liquor, then you may or may not like Vintner. Depending on who is working at the bar, they can comp decent drinks every 20-30 minutes, no matter if you are playing with $100 or $20. The food is decent, but portion sizes could be better for the price. I'll still keep coming back for the atmosphere.
