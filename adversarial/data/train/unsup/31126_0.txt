growing up listening to the beatles made this show something I had wanted to see. The theater is custom built for the show. The seats have speakers built into the seats and the sound system is AWESOME. \n\nThis isnt your typical Cirque show however, so don't be expecting lots of feats of strength and acrobatics, however expect a good story, great music, and lots of fun. Definately worth the money we spent and really enjoyed the show.
