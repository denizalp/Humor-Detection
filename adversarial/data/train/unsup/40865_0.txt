Really awesome place; psyched that Charlotte has venues like this. It's intimate, it's charming, and yet it still has everything you could want - a stocked bar, easy parking, and even some seating if you arrive early enough. I saw an acoustic show here recently and the sound was perfect. I love this place and look forward to coming to many more shows here.
