Every Nova's experience is a bland one. The service is slow, the products mediocre.\n\nIt's more like you are interrupting them when you come in to order something. My coffee or tea is always served too hot to drink. I usually have to wait an hour before I can drink it, which kills the point of a quick before work stop. \n\nI ordered a cake, and the girl took 5 minutes to close the plastic container it was sitting in for hours anyway. Illusion of freshness not accomplished. \n\nMy friend ordered hot apple cider and she watched them open a jug of plain apple juice and put it in the microwave. \n\nI hope a better coffee shop takes it's place, because it's the perfect spot for one.
