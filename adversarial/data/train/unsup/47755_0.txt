Hands down worst McDonald's we've ever visited. Fairly nice employees, but:\n- slow service: the place was almost empty, but it took nearly 20 minutes to get our food\n- low quality ingredients: my prepackaged side salad was filled with wilted iceberg and dry carrot shavings\n- inconvenient: you have to ask for them to unlock the bathrooms, and you have to show a receipt for refills\n- poor service: they were \"out\" of water cups (even though they just gave one to the guy before me), and wouldn't give me something else for water instead
