The Town Center City Stop has long been the snack headquarters for myself and my coworkers who are right around the corner. Gas provided by Shell for several years, the quick five minute journey often helped those in need of caffeine, coffee, chips chocolate and soda. It also had a rewards card that gave you points redeemable on a monthly basis. Quite often, I'd get several \"$1 off\" coupons and an occasional free car wash. $2 for two Powerades and a fistful of $1 off coupons? Free stuff and a smile!\n\nThe past few months however, has seen Sinclair take over. Gas prices have decreased by around ten cents on a good day; which I suppose is fine, though not up to par to Shell in my opinion. This would normally be just alright, but the rewards system was quickly phased out without much warning. As one of the sole reasons I went there especially for gas -- this gave me fits.\n\nMuch of the long time staff has been retained, who are all very friendly and personable. They all know my name and give me the \"wink and a smile\" carwash here and there. Problem is, there weren't many longtime staffers to begin with. A mad scramble is being made to hire new clerks, but their inexperience shows -- especially when a flurry of customers hit. All of a sudden, the mail center is not being tended to, and several customers are in line up front while new clerks ping pong in a mad rush to cover both ends of the store.\n\nI will still go, and may even get gas in emergency situations. The fact its got a Capriotti's attached doesn't hurt. However, lower quality gas for cheaper prices wasn't worth the switch by Sinclair, and the sudden absence of the reward system is a loss I will mourn for a long time.
