I love this place.  Yeah, it is painful to see avocados at $1.99, so I buy them at Smith's for 50 cents each instead.  However, this store is great because I go here often enough to know staff and see friends.  They have free cooking classes sometimes in the middle of the store, which is awesome.\n\nI am partial to the seafood counter and the cheese connoisseurs because they are always so helpful.  I had been seeking Moliterno truffle cheese forever and after a year hiatus, it showed back up.  The cheese expert today told me a restaurant requested it so they started carrying it again, but if I see something missing, he will order it for me!  I love the $1-$4 cheese tasting tidbits - always tasting something new!\n\nMeanwhile, the ladies in the Japanese\/Korean area (they sell sushi, noodle bowls, satay, etc) are totally awesome.  They always recognize me, and will make anything fresh that you don't see in the case.  They have Tuesday sushi specials ($4.60 for a certain roll).  \n\nI also like WF because they give you 10% off on cases of stuff (like Teas Tea bottles for instance).  There are always iced tea samples too.  It is a good spot on Wednesdays ($2 off salad bar = $5.99 per pound).  They have raw and roasted beets in the salad bar so I am in luv.  I made handrolls today for lunch with the spicy salmon bowl from the sushi area, raw shredded beets from the salad bar, and temaki nori from the dry goods.  Save 5 cents if you bring your own bag.  The best part is I can walk here from home!
