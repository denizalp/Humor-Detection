The Scottsdale location is one of the better Red Lobster's out there...\n\nHad dinner here last night. Ordered a platter with three different kinds of shrimp, and all of them were good - but nothing to get overly excited about. A solid meal with good service for $25.\n\nNo waiting either, the place was slow at dinner time.
