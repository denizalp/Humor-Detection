This review is for the Concepts Spa which is right in front of the salon.\n\nAfter breaking out profusely, I decided to try a glycolic peel. I was desperate and and this was my last resort. I know that peels are not usualy recommended for women in my age group, but I was determined to try. Something had to be done. \n\nI had walked by the SPA everyday for four years and it was always busy. I had purchased products from there, such as Dermalogica and Phytomer, but never tried their services. (side note: phytomer moisture mask is incredible.) \n\nAt last I made an appointment. When I showed up, I was given a form to fill out (also had to sign that if anything happened to my face, it was not their responsibility...). I fully knew what i was getting myself into. The esthetician, however, made me feel very comfortable. She said she was an expert and was not going to 'burn\" or \"damage\" my skin. Well--that was reassuring. \n\nI went into the room and she first removed all my make up. She looked at my skin under the microscope and told me all that i was doing wrong (She was right.) Afterwards, she explained to me that it was going to BURN for 20 seconds, and that essentially, the peel removes the dead skin and makes way for new cell growth, increasing collagen production, reducing acne scars etc.. She also re-assured me that i was going to be glowing after. Alas, she was RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWARNING: IT REALLY BURNED FOR 20 SECONDS..it was EXCRUCIATING...But it was so worth it. My skin was GLOWING, my acne cleared up within the week and my skin (which has red undertones) had never been so even. She also gave me some products to put on when I got home. \n\nI have not had a peel since but when I do, i'll definitely come here again.
