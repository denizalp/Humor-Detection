I believe you pay for the view, not the food.\n\nThe menu is a bit pricey, considering the small portions, but the view of the harbour (especially on the patio, during good weather) is certainly worth it.\n\nMy husband and I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner here, all on the patio, and it was worth it.\n\nWe've enjoyed a glass of wine, during sunset, with a simple appetizer to add some serious romance to an ordinary work evening.\n\nService and quality of food have never been a problem.\n\nI've also noticed lots of children, so I assume it's family friendly.
