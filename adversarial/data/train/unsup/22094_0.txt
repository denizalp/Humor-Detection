Nice little place that distracted me from \"fat bastard burrito\" next door. They had a Tuesday $5 deal on a small cheesesteak or poutine, so I opted for the sandwich. \n\nSoft bun, but not a traditional philly-style. Lots of cheese choices and fresh toppings. \n\nBut my focus is the meat - after researching the whole \"Geno vs Pats\" in Philadelphia (sliced vs chopped ribeye), I'm up to speed on the subject, which is why the 'chopped and formed' pseudo meat here was a bit of a disappointment (this is the kind of meat you find in the freezer at a supermarket, and it is the hot dog version of ribeye: blended and processed, spat out into sheets, cut and frozen). \n\nAny place focused on cheesesteak needs to have real meet, so it gets a 3 from me.
