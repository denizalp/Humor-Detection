So, the only thing special about this bar is that it is the highest bar in Vegas.  Luckily we were there for happy hour so we weren't charged an arm and a leg for a drink.  The bartender was friendly enough and sports were on the tv, which was a plus for the hubs.  There are some seats and tables just outside of the bar where you can sit and enjoy the views of Vegas.  Nice place to grab a drink if you happen to be at the top of the tower.
