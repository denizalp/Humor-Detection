Another great evening with Chef Luigi preparing a special meal for me.  The sommelier--Joseph--also found some wonderful wines to enhance the meal.  Started with oysters Rockefeller--very nicely done, was so excited that I did not even take a photo.  These were pared with a sauvignon blanc from Italy--Vie Di Romans, a very clean citrus wine.  The salad Chef Luigi prepared was a terrine consisting of a layer of heirloom tomato slice, with wilted kale and fresh mozzarella slice topped with crispy artichoke and garlic chips and accompanied with a Romanesco sauce--very delicious and the textures pared great.  The next dish was a fish course, this was a special scallop and shrimp presentation.  The scallop was extremely fresh--a day boat scallop from Maine, and this was seared perfectly and accompanied with a yam puree and a vanilla sauce.  The shrimp was a whole shrimp, broiled and served with sautéed mushrooms--very good.  Excellent fish course.  The main course was a beautiful wagyu beef, sliced and atop bone marrow in bone all topped with a brown butter sauce.  This course Joseph pared with an Adelsheim Pinot Noir from Oregon--very great color, balanced, strong cherry aroma and hints of raspberry.  The dessert course was a simple crème brulee with fresh berries which topped this special meal.  Thank you Chef Luigi and Sommelier Joseph for a great evening, the rest of the staff was extremely dedicated to providing me an exceptional evening, as always. This is my go to place for a great time.
