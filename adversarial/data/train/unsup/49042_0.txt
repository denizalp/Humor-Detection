I've had brunch at the Good Fork a few times. The Nova Scotia Bennie is pretty freaking tasty - and this is coming from someone who rarely likes eggs Benedict. The service on the weekends is chaotic and slow, which seems to be sometimes because the restaurant is busy and sometimes because they could be better organized or use an extra server. The servers I've met have always been friendly, which is not always the case at brunch establishments. The last time I had brunch, my food wasn't very warm and it took a really long time to get our coffee and water. However, the restaurant had a line out the door and it looked like the credit card machine was down.  \n\nBottom line: there's a line up during weekend brunch. The food is pretty good, but they need more servers.
