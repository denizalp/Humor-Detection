This is the same as the other location in the Las Vegas Area. Good place to get those Necessities that you seem to run out of more than others. \n\nI have noticed that there are not too many workers on the floor. So if you have a question, you may have to wait until you reach the checkout line.\n\nAnd upon checking out, there are only 3 workers on the frontlines. One works the Self Check out Line, and 2 that work the Check out Lines. Just be ready for a slightly long wait.
