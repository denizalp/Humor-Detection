Two weeks ago I telephoned from Nashville and spoke to the scuba manager to confirm that  as an instructor that I could rent gear to certify my daughter during my stay in Las Vegas. I went to the store this morning and was told that since I was not an instructor affiliated with their store I COULD NOT RENT GEAR for a student!  Needless to say I was quite upset! \n\nRidiculous! As an instructor I can rent gear for students at any dive shop! I Drove 3 miles and rented all the gear I needed and MUCH cheaper than sports chalet was renting it for! I will never buy anything from sports chalet again! Or RENT!!
