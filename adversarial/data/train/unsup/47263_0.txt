meh, i can deal with the lines but the produce is always very disappointing - old, not fresh looking. the meats not too great either, i always have to ask myself why i came to \"this safeway\" again.. rather than bashes and frys which is right around corner, and cheaper, and shorter lines (faster cashiers)
