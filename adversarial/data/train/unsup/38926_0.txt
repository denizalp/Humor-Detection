There food is great of course, but I wanted to leave kudos for our server Blake! He was supper funny, and when I asked for a Sierra Nevada, and he accidentally brought me a Sierra Mist he made up for it by offering the next one for free and just had a great attitude. I hope his management team recognizes his potential and awesome customer service.
