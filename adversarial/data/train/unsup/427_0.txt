Nope. This place is terrible. The puppies are all in tiny display cages, no blankets or toys, no room to run around and play, no wonder they are all sick. \n\nAlso, they have open cages for a majority of the hamsters and small birds. Not many other pet stores do this, but for good reasons. The birds and hamsters are skittish because they aren't handled well, they are poked and snatched at by random customers. I've seen the employees yell at customers for sticking their hands in the OPEN cages. Also, leaving them open like that gives people an open window (literally) to steal an animal right out of the cage. \n\nIn my opinion, they shouldn't have open cages. If anything, the animals that DO need the open cages are the puppies.
