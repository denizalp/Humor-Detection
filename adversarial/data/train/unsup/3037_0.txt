I never got a massage from her because she was so rude on the phone. It was so unprofessional! \nShe called and said she was  \"calling about the 9:00am appointment I had\" and when i said \"alright\" she raised her voice at me and said \"ALRIGHT? I'm calling to confirm?!\"  I was so stressed out after the phone call with her I couldn't imagine actually letting her do body work on me and transferring her Rude, stressful energy vibes to me during a 90 minute massage. \nI called her back to tell her I thought I was handled very unprofessinally on the phone and said I would like to cancel my massage and she just said \"I don't know what phone call you got but You go right ahead and do that, I have massages all day I'll be fine.\" So I told her I felt like she raised her voice at me and it was stress inducing and she said \"Well then i'll just call the people behind you and tell them they can move up their appointment it doesn't matter to me!\"\nNO EFFORT WAS MADE to help me feel any better about the situation or to keep my business. I felt like I was not valuable as a customer at all. She acted like a highschool girl.\n\nPlease think twice before dealing with a woman of this character.
