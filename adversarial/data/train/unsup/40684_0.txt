Good off-the-strip (Las Vegas) family and friends eatery. Nicely decorated interior with pleasant ambiance. Attentive service by Shawnae. \n\nThe carmelized Brussel sprouts, shrimp tacos, campfire pot roast were remarkable. \n\nThe Brussel sprouts were served mixed with capers, oil and Parmesan cheese. They were nicely seasoned and a delight. \n\nThe flavor of the shrimp tacos was exceptional, served seasonally hot and spicy. \n\nThe pot roast was melt-in-your-mouth tender with good flavor and accompanied by creamed potatoes, spinach, and was resting on a small pond of gravy. This is comfort food at its best.\n\nEnjoy!
