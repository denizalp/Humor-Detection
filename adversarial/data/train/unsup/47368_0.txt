I like Drais nightclub and being a local I come here often. However last time I came to the club this past Sunday night and had received horrible customer service. Adam and Lilly are the rudest people I have encountered in a long time. They told me rudely to pay $100 for me and my girlfriend. We explained we had a table and they said there were no more add ons. Ok so I take the money out to pay and Adam rudely points and says \"Over there!\" So I go to pay Lilly and she's snidely laughing at me. And I hand her the money she says rudely \"Is this 100 or not?!\" I told her yes. I also asked them to walk us to the table please, (which is usually never a problem) They refuse and give us some messed up random directions. I asked them for their names and they both told me rudely. I would've easily given both of them a tip if I was just treated like a valued customer. Next time I think I'll go to Light or Omnia they don't treat me this way!
