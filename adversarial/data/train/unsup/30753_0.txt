From the moment I walked through the doors I was at ease. I have never been one to visit a dentist regularly, mostly because I need to take better care of my teeth. 2016 is a new year so I figured a new dentist to start fresh. The staff are all extremely nice and patient, not at all the ones you think will smile in your face and the moment you leave all sit and talk about you ( you all know what I mean) Everyone seemed very genuine, and extremely helpful. For the first time in a long time I have found a dentist I can trust.!
