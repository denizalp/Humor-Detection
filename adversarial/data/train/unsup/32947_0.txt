We stayed here when my husband was in town for work training (aka his work picked the hotel) and I joined him for a long weekend. The hotel is centrally located to downtown and the valet parking is pricey (but I have no idea what reasonable is for valet parking) but the valets were super friendly and super nice. Front desk staff was helpful although there were some annoying logistical issues with our bill upon checkout.\n\nPros:\n-downtown location\n-friendly valet service and front desk staff\n-hotel restaurant is good\n-free wine reception is nice if you like free wine\n\nCons:\n-bed are not good - they are firm but thin to the point where you can feel the bedsprings\n-noise of the train could be heard through our window\n-there are very few lounge locations to hang out without purchasing something. The hotel bar is open to folks who are buying from the bar and the poolside lounge doesn't allow outside food or drink. If you want to eat outside the room with outside food, you will have to leave the hotel and walk a bit to find a public place to sit outside.
