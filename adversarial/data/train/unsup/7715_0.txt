Meeh it is just ok.  But I have only ever been here for thier buffet breakfast between 1am and 3am after Pub Crawling downtown.  They manage to work with large crowds well and the food is typical of a hot breakfast buffet.  \n\nI can't speak for their regular menu items, but I do hear they offer a Happy Hour appetizer buffet that I may have to check out sometime.
