Does it make me less of a man to say that I LOVE Frances?\n\nVintage, hip, different. I have been to this store many times with my girlfriend. They have very little in the way of men's items and what they do have is generally for the more petite men than myself...but...\n\nI could easily shop here for every gift giving occasion for my girlfriend or any of the other women in my life. They have far out jewlery, and clothes, the most attractive item of clothing i have ever seen my girlfriend wear was a dress from here that she tried on and decided she would never wear so didn't purchase it. bummer.\n\nI enjoy looking around...it is like a museum set up to display all the things that a woman I date should fancy and wear. The prices can be up there but some items are very fair and frankly for the quality and origionality of the items I find them worth the price if you can pay it.
