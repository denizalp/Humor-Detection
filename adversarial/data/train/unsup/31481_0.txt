Came here with a few people and we all had a really good time! Easy access to the parking garage. You can eat inside or outside. We walked around the inside just to check it out. They do have bowling. There aren't a lot of lanes so I suggest you get reservations. There is also an area to play ping pong and arcade games. When we walked towards the back we saw another bar area. There was someone there from Noda giving away samples. There is also a bar area outside and towards the front. The front area was closed to the public. \n\nHostess and server was very nice. Our server was on point. Drinks were good and they do have daily specials. We started off with the cheese dip and pretzels. It was very good. Pretzels were lightly salted and soft and not chewy which I like. Cheese dip was garnished with green onions and tomatoes. I got the chicken tenders. Tenders were very fresh and came to the table piping hot. The breading was good but very thick around the corners. I got the hot buffalo sauce and ranch dressing for dipping. My husband got the chicken wrap. It was grilled chicken with pimento cheese. The pimento cheese was so delicious. It had a great kick to it! Everyone else got chicken and waffles and they all cleared their plates so I know it had to be good. \n\nCan't wait to come back again!
