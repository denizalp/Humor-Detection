I would give Wahoo's a 4.5 on service alone! My husband and I came in to try the vegan sampler (3 tacos:banzai, tofu, and mushroom) and the staff was very welcoming and informative...we ended up ordering a lot more! ... our bartender was also very attentive and made me a spicy margarita upon request. The tacos were delicious. The banzai taco was my favorite option, but I also ordered an extra taco just to try the vegan citrus slaw with tofu.  Definitely will order that again! I love that this location is is 24 hours with a full bar and menu. It's nice to know that there is another option other than PT's after work... no late happy hour with drink specials though.
