They overbooked and told me on arrival at 1am that they had no room. I had a reservation with guaranteed late arrival. In addition, I called on the drive to the hotel and told them I'd be late and they promised me it would not be an issue. Despicable. They simply resold my room because it is the start of TIFF and they probably got a few hundred more. They don't care about their guests.  Don't stay here. I'm sure there are good hotel chains that understand what the word \"reservation\" means.
