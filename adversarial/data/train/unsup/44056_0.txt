When I went to this location on 5\/8\/18 it was one of the worst experiences that I've ever had at a Starbucks. When I walked in nobody greeted or asked what I needed when I was at the counter. I called in prior to place my order and the manager had an attitude on the phone that I had to call it in due to the app not working, she stated \"she guess she can help me,\" instead of just taking my order. Then when I picked up my order my drinks weren't made correctly. I asked them to fix it please, while the girl just stood there looking at me. The manager finally had to tell the girl to fix the drinks for me. The environment seems very hostile and nobody seemed thrilled to be working. It was just an awful experience and the people working were rude and not friendly. They didn't create an environment that I would want to start my morning with, the worst part was the manager's attitude. When I asked for the District Manager, they were unwilling to give me that information. If you are looking for a Starbucks in the area, I would drive further and find another location.
