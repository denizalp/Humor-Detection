My husband and I went to Japan earlier this year and got to sample some amazing ramen. No ramen stateside has really hit the spot since... until this place opened! I am literally in our car typing this review on my phone because I am excited to spread the news about this place! \n\nLocated in the starting-to-get-busy plaza of the popular Hobak, Ramen Hashi presents itself as a more traditional Japanese ramen experience. You will sit along a long bar and fill out your ramen order on individual forms. The menu is straightforward, with three different ramen bases, and the option to add more toppings. We opted to try the tonkatsu and chef-recommended shio, which is chicken-based. I normally avoid chicken ramen, but the broth managed to be light, but flavorful, without the lingering taste of chicken bones I get at other ramen spots. I also normally get my ramen without bamboo shoots, but kept them here and was pleasantly surprised at how they complemented all the other flavors in the bowl. The chasu pieces were substantial, well-charred, and not too fatty. My husband had the tonkatsu ramen and had no complaints. Noodles were cooked perfectly and had a nice chew to them. We also shared a Chasudon (limited quantities available). The chasu here had a great smoky flavor, rice was done well, and served along seaweed. You serve yourself water from cold pitchers at your station, which also comes with sushi ginger, spicy sauce, and rubber bands to help people with their chopsticks.\n\nService was attentive and friendly, and the chef was eager for feedback and any recommendations we could provide. I thought it was a perfect, well-balanced bowl, and the restaurant add a much-needed genre of ramen Vegas has been missing. I haven't finished a bowl of ramen in a long time, but I slurped this one up! I'd love to see this place become a mainstay in Las Vegas, so give it a try before there's long lines out the door!
