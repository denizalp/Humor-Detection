I've been to the store once in a while to see their really low prices. However, tonight we stopped by and ask about playstation 2. The girl told my husband \"oh I don't know but you can look it up on google.\" I was like wait, what. That's not customer service at all, smart mouthing like that. Then two other clerks were behind the counter playing yugi oh I think. On top of the glass counter when I was trying to look at the games. And  when I was paying, the same girl was putting those Pokemon things in a binder and instead of helping other customers. She was worrying about my son 5yrs old ok, that he didn't open a candy. He was looking at it and it was a yoyo with candy inside. Omg she made it seem like He was about to do something bad. It's was what like $3-4 dollars, I would have paid for it. She is working in a customer service industry, she could of been a sales person to try and persuade me to buy it. But no,first her attitude with my husband, and then acting like that to my kid. It really upset me what kind of customer service we got from this place!!!
