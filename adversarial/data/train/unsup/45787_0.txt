Great place...we love coming here but the Timeshare sales desk really made me mad.  I am pretty calm guy but the lady (Analise or something like that) at this desk wouldn't take No for answer.   She wanted to get me to come in tomorrow morning for an owners updated and I told her no...at least 20 times.  She did not care about my agenda with my wife away without the kids.....she only cared about her numbers or sales....and just high pressured me and wouldn't take my No for an answer.  That is not good customer service and I feel bad for all the new customers and current owners who are high pressured like this.   Everyone else here has always been great....but with a person like that here I can not recommend this place anymore.
