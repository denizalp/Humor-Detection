I was an undecided voter until I stayed at Trump Hotel in Vegas.\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe check-in process was painless and fast. The friendly worker offered water bottles and even walked us to the elevator.\nThe king bed had comfy mattress.\nThe bathroom was super roomy with a bathtub, an enclosed shower and an enclosed toilet.\nTV in the bathroom on the mirror.\nKitchen with refrigerator, microwave and toaster. Lol toaster? Do I need to bring my own bread?\nBathroom scale in the bathroom. Hey, at least you know your weight before & after the buffets jk\nSuper powerful hair dryer.\nMagnifying make-up mirror.\nRobes inside the closet. I didn't get to use it though.\nIt is located right across the Fashion Show mall.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nOur lamp was missing a knob. We couldn't turn on the light and had to call the front desk to fix it.\nWe couldn't lock the door because the door wasn't aligned right.\nThe water pressure was low.\nThe soft water was weird. I kept rinsing my hands  because they felt sticky after using the soap. The same thing happened when I took a shower and washed my hair \nThe light on top of the kitchen cabinet wasn't installed correctly.\nOne of the security guards near the elevator was rude. The other security guards and workers were super nice.\nIt is on the strip, but still too far to walk to the other 5 stars hotels with casinos.\n\n\"TRUMP\" STAMP!!\nThis hotel screams \"TRUMP EMPIRE\" \nTrump name, Ivanka's shoes at the giftshop, bathroom scale, great hair dryer and magnifying makeup mirror in the bathroom for miss America ;)\n\n3.5 stars!! Okay I am still an undecided voter ;)
