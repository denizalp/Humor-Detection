Jennie is my spirit animal. But before I get into that, let me confess that I have pretty much zero loyalty to stylists and\/or salons. I have long, wavy hair that grows like a weed, so I've never too partial to keeping any one particular stylist for a head of hair that's going to do what it wants anyway.  Also - when I decide I want a haircut I want it cut within the hour...usually.  That really narrows your options, especially downtown.  On one particular Thursday afternoon, I decided it was haircut time and proceeded to call EVERY SINGLE DAMN SALON DOWNTOWN.  No availability was to be had anywhere.  I hadn't though it through that this was Valentine's Day weekend. Thankfully, a Pittsburgh Magazine article listing the Top 10 salons in the 'Burgh came to my rescue when it recommended Sognatore. I called and was offered a 5:15 appointment. When I was told that the cost would be $62 I figured I might be getting a junior stylist.  Given that the salon is in the Pennsylvanian, I assumed their stylists would charge well over $60.  No matter - I went anyway. And I'm so glad I did. I was tended to by Jennie, a 12-year (I think?) veteran of the salon.  She and I became fast friends and I absolutely adore what she did with my then-unruly mane.  She listened, took her time, and made sure I was happy, all the while chatting away about stuff I actually wanted to talk about (no offense to previously stylists who maybe...didn't).  The salon is also GORGEOUS and has a very welcoming environment. \n\nDare I say it? Have I found my forever salon? Pending their availability...I think I have ;-)
