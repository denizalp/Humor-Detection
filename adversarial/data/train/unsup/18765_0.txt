I have to go a bit further out of my way to reach this Total Wine, but it's worth it every time.\n\nBevmo says \"Oh this summer beer isn't in season yet.\" Total Wine says \"Of course, we even have it in the fridge.\" \n\nBevmo makes you carry a stupid rewards card that gives you 5% off a purchase after spending $250. Total Wine doesn't believe in stupid crap like that, their prices are good up front. \n\nI really end up getting lost in the beer aisle, not knowing what to do. Saying I look like a kid in a candy store is an understatement, I'm like a kid who has discovered some cross between Disneyworld and Neverland. All my beverage snob dreams (er...my liver's worst nightmares) come true in Total Wine. Would recommend for liquor, too. If you can't find it here, what you're looking for probably sucks.
