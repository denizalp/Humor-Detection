I was in the area, craving some moist cake. Ordered the strawberry spongecake and a bottle of Pellegrino (15$ tax-in). The cake I ordered was great- everything you want a slice to taste like; flavour, and texture wise. Service was good with no prolonged waiting, but I asked for the check right away after ordering to avoid an almost certain wait for a bill- which I recommend you do, as well to save time and aggravation- especially on busy nights. Avoid sitting by the women's wash room, it smells like a dirty moist mop or sweaty socks, at times. Too bad, considering the nice fireplace that is close to this area. Another observation, the cutlery for an 8-10$ piece of cake is ugly, cheap and unsexy to use on such a delightful desserts. Besides being too large, my fork looked liked it had been used in a prison cafeteria for 20years, then flattened by a truck. They need cutlery that is more proportionate to the food (if I go back, I will ask if they have a salad fork or coffee spoon)- I shouldn't be able to shovel the cake down in three bites. Little bites... think little bites; it's more enjoyable for dessert. Besides that, the parking is widely available in front and there might be lineups to get a table on weekends. Noise level is also significantly increased, which is natural considering that , unlike Starbucks, Rockaberry serves alcohol. So when it comes to choosing your seat, beware of \"twinzees\" bashing their ex-bfs over martinis and cake. Deadly combination.
