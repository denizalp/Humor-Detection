I remember my first burrito here - the haiibut - after a long night of dancing at a nearby club. It was heaven on earth and exactly what I needed.\n\nIt's been years (shhh...) since then, but the burritos are still good and I've moved on to the Adelaide location to occasionally snag a late-night (though not quite as late-night) meal.\n\nMy favourites are the halibut and the shrimp, loaded up with everything and some extra cilantro. And with the hot hot-sauce. That's it. I'm not a complicated girl.\n\nThough they're neither cheap nor fast, these burritos fulfil a need: late-night hunger pangs; but their burritos aren't going to blow your mind or make you a convert if you hate burritos. They're good - sometimes really good - but they're burritos. Enjoy them as such.
