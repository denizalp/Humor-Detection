It's DimSunday and here we are. I haven't been here in YEARS. It was a packed house and the carts were zoomin'. \nEverything was good here especially the pork shumai, and CRISPY PORK!!! AWWW YEAH! I spotted this first and was like GIMME SOME OF THAT!!! My fave!! It was friend's first time having the crispy pork skin like that and MMMM!! He loved it too!! I want some more!! I wanted some veggies in the mix too so got a plate of Chinese Broccoli and that was a great finish to our dim sum dining experience!
