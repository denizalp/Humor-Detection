Jackson's is just what it looks like-a neighborhood bar. However it has a surprise inside-they serve food. Not just any food, great prime rib, steak, etc....,with great prices.\nSo if you're looking for a dinner for a very decent price and is off strip with a local flare (smoky, gaming environment), go to Jackson's Bar and Grill. I was passing by this place with my friend whose name is Jackson. He wanted to go in,so we did and we were glad we did. The food was pretty good. Our steaks were perfectly cooked, chicken strips were so plentiful that two people could share the dinner and even take some home. I would definitely go for the steak. It probably is one of the best steak values in Vegas. \nGo to Jackson's if you want a real hometown Vegas experience, we're glad we did !!!
