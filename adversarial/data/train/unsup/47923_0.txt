We came in for brunch. This place usually has a long wait so I made my res on OoenTable. Let me just say that the service here was AMAZING.  Everyone from the hostess, the busboy, our server and the Manager, Steve  made this experience memorable. As an experienced customer service professional, I know that delivering excellent service these days is very uncommon - but the team at Yardbird knocked the ball out of the park!  Now let's get to the food. We had the fried green tomatoes -delish. A creative twist on a southern favorite. We shred the fried chicken with the savory waffle. I passed on the watermelon, I just don't like watermelon. The chicken was perfectly crispy and flavorful all the way to the bone!  The waffle was perfect and the bourbon maple syrup pushed it waaaaay past the finish line for me. We were smacking our lips and licking our fingers.  We loved it so much that we're going back for dinner!
