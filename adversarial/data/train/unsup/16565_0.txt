OH MY GOD! This is one of those moments when you take a bite of food and start believing in God's existence. The food here is over the top ridiculous! It's been quite sometime since I've been completely blown away with really great food. But I guess that's what makes it all the more special. Let me start by saying that they have the most amount of parking space compared to any other taco place that I've been to so far. It sets a positive tone right from the beginning. \n\nI asked for their most popular menu item and the cashier handed me a small cup of their green chili pork to sample. Holy Moses! This has got to be THE most amazing tasting pork I've had thus far at a taco joint. It does have a fair amount of heat so may not be for those with very low tolerance. But for the fortunate ones, this is unbelievably flavorful. The pork is perfectly cooked and the green chili sauce is to die for! It was a fairly easy choice from then on. I got a green chili pork taco and a chorizo and potato taco. Both of these were exquisite. \n\nMy friend special ordered a chorizo quesadilla. This is generally not the best way to go since chorizo is overloaded with fat as is. The cheese makes it all the more greasy. The pork fat ended up oozing and forming a pool at the bottom.. \n\nOverall, this is one of the best taco places around town! It is easily my new favorite joint for my taco fix.
