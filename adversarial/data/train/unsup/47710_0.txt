Not bad.  I was there with some out-of-town relatives who flew in for a wedding at Treasure Island.  I had not been there before and was quite surprised.  I'll be back.\n\nThe salad bar was minimal but still quite good.  They had hummus (not bad), Tabouleh (OK, but I usually pass), stuff grape leaves (not that good) and some misc salads, which provided a nice choice.\n\nPasta selection was good, according to the others in the wedding party.  \n\nI had stuffed halibut which was very good.  Also had some type of a steamed or baked white fish.  Maybe tilapia or pollock?  Not sure, but very flaky, mild and I had seconds.\n\nThe Asian selection was acceptable.  I had eggrolls and fried rice, both of which were good.\n\nThe deserts were delicious.  The Creme Brulee was very good.  They even had cotton candy.  Seriously!  I didn't have any but others did.\n\nWith free parking and across from the Fashion Show Mall, we will be back for sure.
