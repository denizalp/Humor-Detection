YUM YUM! My second favorite buffet in Las Vegas. Only because they do not have enormous crab legs and jumbo shrimp like the Wynn. Besides winning a bunch of best place in las vegas awards, this is a local favorite. \n\nThe best feature of this buffet is the huge selection. There are about 7 different types of cuisine plus a desert section. So you could have fried rice and roast duck with a side of hot dogs and hot wings if you like. I know that's a odd combo, but there should be a large enough variety to satisfy in the pickiest eaters.\n\nHighly recommend. Don't take my word for it. Just give the Carnival World Buffet a try. My only con is I don't have big enough stomach to try the entire buffet. I recommend taking small portions of the things that you want to try first, then later grab more of what you truly enough. See you there!
