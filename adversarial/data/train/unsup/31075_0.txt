Second time seeing the show and I loved it even more than the first! The first time it felt like since there was so much going on, you couldn't really focus on certain things accurately, but this second time I saw everyhing. Including all the little details I missed the first time. Any seat has a good view. If you can't find cheaper tix on travelzoo, try the cirque website.
