Aside from the murder outside our balcony, the trash left in our apartment from the last tenant, the broken toilet at move-in, the blood spattered on our bathroom wall at move-in, the hair on our walls that has simply been painted over, the seemingly constant unavailability of hot water, the death threats from neighbors for parking in our assigned spot when they claimed it for themselves, and the regular screams of women suffering from domestic violence, our experience hasn't been all terrible living at Visconti on Camelback.  I mean, only on 4 occasions has someone tried to break into our apartment while we watched TV in our living room.
