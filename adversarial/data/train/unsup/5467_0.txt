Called 4 times kept getting put on hold and never picked back up. Employees are kind of rude. Managers are a waste of $ they actually just walk around and do nothing. The cooks are the only ones working hard. When they finally answered to take my order they said 25 mins well it actually was 45 mins to make 3 tacos lol. They need to rehire a whole new staff w the exception of the cooks. That's why I gave 2 stars cause the food tasted so good. Hire managers, servers, and hostesses that actually smile. Nobody wants to pay to see resting bitch face.  \n\nMy tacos were very good. El Jeffe was delicious. I recommend Barrio, just not this location.
