This place really surprised me, from the outside it looks very boutique-y and overpriced... but when I went inside I found that every thing was very reasonably priced and I didn't see one thing I didn't like!  I ended up getting one of the cutest unique dresses I've ever seen and I'm really excited about it!  The employees were helpful and nice (always a plus) and I will definitely be back... I can't wait in fact!
