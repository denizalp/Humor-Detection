Ambiance same. Busy and noisy. \nService was adequate but rushed. The appetizer was served and could not be finished before the entree was served. Even the check was delivered before we were done with the meal. Rushed rushed rushed, and the food isn't that good to put up with it!\nI asked the waitress to make sure the food was HOT, explaining how it was lukewarm the last time and had to be sent back. The beef brisket and pulled pork was again served lukewarm. I would bet that the beef is precut and in a pan waiting for orders. The sausage was tasty and actually a hot temperature. The macaroni and cheese was also a disappointment. A layer of mozzarella lay slightly melted over some elbow macaroni and a watery sauce that was more like a soup than a cheesy wonder. The sweet potato fries were also lukewarm and the cream spinach must have been left in the microwave too long, as it was boiling hot. \nI am even more critical of this place, having recently returned from Austin Texas where I had some REAL BBQ.\nThe perfunctory service, along with the mediocre food confirms why they really deserve 2 stars and makes me scratch my head why people would give them more, other than the usual NC lack of a palette, so pervasive in the Tar Heel State or just simply not having another choice in the area other than Bojangles. I'm done though; strike 2 and your OUT!
