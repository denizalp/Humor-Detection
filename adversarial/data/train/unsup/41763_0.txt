This Barro's location has been a regular, Friday night outing for our family, for several years.  But, I'm not sure I'm going to be going to this location, in the future.  The employees are great, and I can't ever remember not getting great customer service, but lately the wings have been coming to the table, cold and to steal aquote from Peyton T., the Fresh Sewer Smell has been a little over the top.  This has been going on for months and they have attempted to aleviate the problem by using industrial deodorant, to the point of it wafting out to the eating area and making your food taste, just like it.  I've mentioned this to the management, but they just seem to want to put a bandaid over the problem.  I love supporting business's that are close to my house, but I'll probably start going to the location, near Moon Valley.
