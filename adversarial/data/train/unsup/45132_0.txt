I arrived on a nice hot and sunny day!  It's a line you take things away and you watch the car get clean!   \n\nIt's very clear as to what to do.  \nThe price are 23.01 + tax for a reg clean and they clean my inside also.    I would say for the time they clean and the price it was not bad.   \n You could add wax for a couple more dollars.  But I would rather do it my self cause I think you know it will be clean better.  \n\nI would return but if I need it clean fast when I can't do it.
