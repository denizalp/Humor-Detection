I ordered the \"Seafood on Sizzling Platter\" and it was fantastic.  I love the sizzling rice cake that it was served over and the shrimp was super fresh and tasty.  I did request that that they omit the squid as I am not a fan of squid.  I loved that there was such a variety of veggies and mushrooms on the plate.  \n\nMy husband ordered the Szechwan beef and I tried a bite and it was also fantastic.  It had the perfect amount of spicy and the meat was melt in your mouth tender.  They served it with plenty of sauce to soak up the delicious rice.  YUM!  We will be back !
