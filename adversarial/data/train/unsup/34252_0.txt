I ordered a hamburger that was out of my normal comfort zone because I wanted to try something very different for this experience.  Overall the burger was cooked perfectly, the meat was done \"smash\" style, which I like and it was tasty.  The bun was really good, and had all the right toppings.  It also came with fries which were also very good.  The service was a bit slow in my opinion, but the atmosphere was pretty cool being right on the strip.  We ate outside so we can listen to music and watch all the craziness going on outside.  Food is expensive as are most all places on the strip, but it was still worth it, and i think I would like to try some other menu options.
