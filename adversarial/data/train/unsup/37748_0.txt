Quick, cheap and tasty!  With not much time to grab a lunch during a busy day, I spotted Punjabi Dhabi from the road as I was about to pass it. With lightning reflexes, I careened wildly into the small parking lot and shoehorned in between to poorly parked vehicles. \n\nInside is small, simple, with a hot table style counter. I ordered the Non-veg Thali. Even though it looks like a cafeteria, they brought my meal to my table. \n\nVery tasty, good amount of heat, served with a freshly baked Naan. I hoovered it all down. \n\nBookmark this one for a fast but good meal when you are in the area.
