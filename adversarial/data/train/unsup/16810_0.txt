Cool Place To Get Your Laugh On!\n\nSuper clean and all around great spot to drop off the planet for a little unwind and laugh time!\n\nThe show was great, I laughed so hard at one point I got a year in the eye! I went on a Thursday so the crowd was only about 60 people or so, which was kind of better than the full packed room, so I recommend going mid week!\n\n$7 Angry Orchards is a bit high, but admission isn't bad at all and they don't have the 2 drink minimum like the Tempe Improv so I figure that makes it ok....\n\nEverything was great here, I'll definitely be back!
