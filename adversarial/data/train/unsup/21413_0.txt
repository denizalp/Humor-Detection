I hate writing these kinds of reviews. I understand how difficult it is to be a waitress. I always am polite and say please, thank you. I don't believe my friend or I to be difficult to please.\n\nMy friend and I had ate at this restaurant last October. We didn't remember the food, but we remembered the good service. This time it was the opposite. \n\nLaura didn't seem to be happy to be at work. The only time I saw her smile was when she over compensated because another table that accidentally was served my lobster chowder. \n\nMy friend and I wanted a leisurely experience, but not sure what we would like to have for dinner. After having bread, shrimp cocktail, lobster chowder, 2 glasses of reisling, 1 glass of vo and 7. But after the food being delicious and filling, Laura's bad attitude and sour service; we decided we were finished for the evening. \n\nEveryone else that was working were helpful and happy. We enjoyed our food and beverages, liked the background music and comfortable booths. \n\nWe all have our \"off days\". Hopefully it was a rare Laura's \"off night\".
