There are some unique qualities at this Cineplex Odeon, aside from being nearby First Markham Place where Asian food is last than a minute walk away.  \n\nMy friend wanted to DRIVE from the theatre to the restaurants, that's so environmentally unfriendly and I just dragged his fat-ass over to the restaurants.\n\nFirst is that much like other spots, there are 2 sets of doorways to past through, however the 2nd set stands you DIRECTLY in front of the Ticket Booth so if on those insane nights, you might be holding the doors open as you wait for your turn to purchase.\n\nSecondly, the entrance and exit are separate at least by one of those line up dividers.  The entrance leads you towards the booths and then to your choice of STAIRS or escalators, what's your preference??  \n\nThe exit set of doors allows you to go out but not in, so if you drop something on your way out and the door closes behind you, you'll have to ask someone following you to help you grab it.\n\nI like the SWIVEL back type of seating here, nice and comfy.  Avoided the mad rush of crowds because we decided to watch Karate Kid on a Wednesday night and there were maybe 20 people in the theatre.\n\nParking can be a pain on weekends when everyone comes to FMP for dinner and movie.  The lot is huge but sometimes it just seems like no parking is available just like any large scale mall.
