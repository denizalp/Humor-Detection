This is one of those times that I wish there was a way to do 3 1\/2 stars because I have mix feelings about this place so I am going with 4 because there were more good things than negative.\n\nI just wish this place was in a different hotel\/ casino or location. For some reasons this casino is so quiet and empty with a strange feeling to it. walking to the restaurant makes you feel you are going somewhere not very popular. The restaurant set up is very nice and we loved the decor, detail touches and the atmosphere but honestly we were very surprised to be one of the only 3 tables there. It was very empty and quiet so that make it little less exciting. \n\nBut the food made up for it. Even though it's kind of a pricey place with a smaller portions but the food tasted good.
