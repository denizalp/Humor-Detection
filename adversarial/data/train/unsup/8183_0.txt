This review is for customer service only, because I'm yet to see results since I've only had one session. Like many here, I brought a Groupon. I know those places use Groupon to attract people but I hope they also know that most people like me would wait to see results\/customer service before signing up for anything or purchasing more packages. Ive had all intentions to buy more packages but wanted to see if they are nice, if the thing works and if it hurts.\n\nI did my underarms. It hurts. Actually, it stings. And you can smell skin burning too, it's weird. I immediately thought how painful it would be to have my bikini line and legs done... but waxing hurts too, so guess it's the price to pay for beauty.\n\nMy issue was with the lady who did my session. I don't even know her name. She called from the front, and walked back into the room, didn't even wait for me, introduced herself, asked how I was doing, nothing. None of that. It was my first time getting laser done so I didn't really know what to do. She threw some glasses on the bed, told me to lay down and went straight to business. I didn't even know what she was doing. No explaining what was going on, no telling me it was gonna hurt, nothing.  Everything was done in 3.5 minutes. I asked her if she had any recommendation and she said no. So.... can I wear deodorant! Can I itch? Can I shower? Can I run? Anything? Any word? Anybody! Helloooo???\n\nI felt rushed. I know they want to make money but how are they expecting me to spend more money there if they don't even bother explaining things to me? Slightly disappointed. We'll report back on the hair portion after a few more sessions.
