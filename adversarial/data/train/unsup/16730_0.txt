I had to bump major stars down from Pho So 1 because of our second visit here - the food was drastically different! Although they offer a wide variety of unique traditional Vietnamese dishes, they are very inconsistent. \n\nThis time we tried: \n\n\"Pho Ga\" (chicken pho) - Great news, they give a huge portion to-go! It was a good enough size for 2 regular sized bowls! Bad news, the chicken was very tough and super dried out, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the plentiful pho noodles and the comforting chicken broth. I guess I was forgiving and not too picky, since I was sick and I needed hot broth to sooth my sore throat. Flavor rating: 3\/5\n\n\"Bun Bo Hue\" (spicy beef noodle soup) - Not good at all. It was really bland and watery. Plus the meats weren't tender. I wouldn't suggest ordering this here - Pho Kinh Do had a much more flavorful broth and overall tastier bun bo hue. Flavor rating: 1\/5\n\n\"Chao Tom\" (barbeque shrimp paste on sugar cane) - This dish was terrible. The shrimp paste on the sugar came was so bland and gummy. It tasted like I was eating some part of a plastic container - it's nothing that I would ever consider ingesting. Don't even bother trying this dish here. Flavor rating: 0\/5\n\nI raved about how they hooked us up with lots of fresh herbs and veggies on our to-go order last time, but not this time. I was really let down. :( \n\nIt won't stop me from eating here, also they are still so much better than Pho Kim Long (PKL) - They offer many unique dishes my Vietnamese taste buds crave, I just know what to expect now.
