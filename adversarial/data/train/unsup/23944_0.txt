First time here and what a great date night hang out complete with crafty cocktails and a DJ to keep the vibe alive. THE BEST BURRATA EVER! Seriously a must try if you love beets and arugula and burrata of course. The veal chop was also a favorite so rich and tender. Seared to perfection on the outside and a beautiful medium rare on the inside juicy good! \nThe deconstructed wedge salad had me worried but the creamy blue cheese, tart apples and meaty bacon were classic wedge wowza! \nHubby's yelp check in got us a free order of salt and vinegar fries yum! The truffle butter mashed potatoes tho! Omg! The evening ended with a salted Carmel butter cake with roasted peaches and vanilla bean ice cream. Yup. \nAtmosphere 5, service 5 and food super 5!
