I was looking for someone to bill medicare for my compression stocking.  These people were the only ones that would bill medicare. Great for this. Since Medicare denied my claim for the stockings they told me there would be no problem and they billed my secondary insurance company.\nFirst they gave me stocking which they happened to have in stock and did not fit me.  I told them that my vein doctor told me that they were not the right size.  They were several sizes to small and the compression was way to high.  Fine so I called them and they told me I could not return them because I signed a paper stating that they are not returnable.  But they didn't even measure me properly because they were out of shorts so they could measure me.  I brought my doctors RX with the correct measurements, which they refused to use.  I had to go out and buy my stockings out of the box and only paid $10 vs $219.00 that they charged my insurance company.  My insurance company refused to pay them because they charged $42.00 over the providers amount in the geographic area.  They were very unprofessional from the moment I stepped into that office.  Also since I am on medicare they can't charge me over the medicare allowable.\nDon't you think they should take the stocking back since they don't fit due to their own error\nI will never go back to that place and others should be aware of their unethical practices
