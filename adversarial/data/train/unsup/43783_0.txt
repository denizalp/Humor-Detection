AWEFUL! I love my primary Barbara Hoose, but I will nvr come back here. Charged my card on file without my permission which caused me to overdraft. Lost my medical records after they even called to confirm, and staff was extremely rude! They are just money hungry and even asked me to re draw all the labs I already paid for because they lost my original ones. Disgusted!
