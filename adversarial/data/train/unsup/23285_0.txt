I'm not a huge fan of either Cirque du Soleil or the Beatles (not that I dislike either, but if you gave me a choice of entertainment I'm not sure they'd make my top 5), so when I got free tickets to this show I wasn't sure what to expect.  But... wow.  It was beautiful.  The acrobatics were amazing.  The music and the dancing and the costumes and the props and the lighting were all spot-on.  One thing that is neat about Cirque du Soleil is how they involve the audience in the show, from the people who walk by and make faces at you to the part where they pull a giant billowing white sheet over everyone's heads -- I felt very engaged the whole time.  And yes, the part at the end where (spoilers!!) the little boy loses his mom (\"Hey Jude\") made me cry.  Even if you're not a huge Beatles fan or a huge Cirque fan, I would highly recommend this show.
