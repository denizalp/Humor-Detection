DIRTY DINING is how I summarize my experience at The Peppermill.  This place may be iconic Vegas dining, and the movie \"Casino\" might have been filmed there, but I am not ever coming back. After a meal of average quality, a 2\" roach crawled up on the table right after we paid the bill.  GROSS.\n\nAs we lunged for it, it flew and landed on the seat back of the neighbor's booth. (I have a photo of it.)  We pointed it out to our neighbors, and as they tried to kill it, if flew and landed right on their appetizer.  DOUBLE GROSS.  They immediately got up and left - good for them.\n\nWe reported to the manager who duly claimed they exterminate on a regular basis.  We were 60-70' from the kitchen, and a farther distance from the exit.  \n\nTo be fair, the customer service was good but not excellent.  The wait staff was sufficiently attentive but team execution was off.  They served a weak drink, and an undercooked (vary rare) hamburger that was ordered medium well.  Both were fixed, but they still charged us for the bad drink.
