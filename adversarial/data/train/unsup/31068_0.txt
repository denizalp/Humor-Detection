Olive and Ivy is by far my favorite restaurant. At this point I whole heartedly know that if I'm going to a restaurant owned by Fox Concepts it's going to be fantastic. I love the overall theme of Olive and Ivy. The mixture of old and new school class is really nice. Servers are always attentive and are great at time management and handling all of their tables professionally and Efficiently. I had Pita and Hummus as an appetizer and it's definitely my new fave. The prosciutto mascarpone tortellini is to die for. I sipped on White Wine Sangria while I thought was way better than some other restaurants I had drank it at recently. This is the perfect place whether you're looking for a light lunch or a classy date night on the canal. 10\/10 would recommend. Will be back many, many more times!
