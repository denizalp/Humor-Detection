After my favorite bar down the street closed down, we needed to find a new place to grab a quick beer. I think we found it. \n\nWe've been here a few times before but always at really odd hours on really odd days when it's slow. We finally came in early on a Saturday night and it really shows what this place is made of. \n\nOur bartender was really personable and he was able to have quick, relatable conversations with all of his customers sitting at the bar. \n\nThe selection is mostly Irish (lots of scotch, whiskey, Irish beers,etc) and we've never tried the food, but the atmosphere is friendly and it's a great place to get together with friends. \n\nService is the main thing here and they have it down pat.
