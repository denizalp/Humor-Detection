Came on a Saturday and suprisingly the place only had a few customers.  Sat there for over 5 minutes until anyone actually helped us.  4 or 5 people working but all busy talking in the kitchen or looking busy doing nothing.  Finally we settled in and ordered a few beers.  A new server must have just came on because she was actually great and chatted us up the whole time until we left.  She also knew her shit when it come to beer and the products they carry.  Now this place is serious about ALL beer, not just piney, chewey IPA that every overnight \"beer enthusiast\" crows on about.  I had an imperial stout and a nut brown on cask.  Both great and made me giggly.  Didnt try the food this time but I remember it being really good from times past.  Just remember though, craft beer now has taken on crack prices but this place is a tad lower than most.  Still, we spent 35 bucks for 4 beers with tip.  WTF
