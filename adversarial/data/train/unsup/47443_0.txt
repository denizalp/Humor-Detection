WARNING: DO NOT GO THERE! If I can give a negative star I would!\n\nMy 2 friends and I were looking to go get our nails done as a treat for their birthday and since they were the closest we called before we went to make sure it was enough time since they were about to close. They said yeah yeah come in. So we go in and not even after a minute they began rushing us that I didn't even have time to pick a color and just grabbed the first thing I saw. \n\nThe list of all the horrible this place offered to me \n1. The guy starts doing my nails and he was extremely aggressive that it became painful. \n\n2. He completely butchered the sizes that no 2 nails were even remotely close to matching another when it came to length or actual shape. \n\n3. There were flies all over that it was annoying and just dirty\n\n4. There full set was $20 and I told him I wanted my shaped as claw nails and at every other salon I have ever been to just charged me an extra $5 but this place charged me an extra 10 which I didn't even complain about or would have bothered by if my nails were done correctly.\n\n5. He didn't even bother to push my cuticles that literally the next day it looked like I needed a filling because they looked like they were already grown out\n\n6. I wake up the next day with one of my nails BROKEN when this never happened to me before and I didn't do anything to cause it to break\n\nSo I ended up paying $32 with tips. I wake up the next morning just infuriated by the state of my nails and just feeling like it was the biggest waste of money. My friend then convinces me to go back and get them \"fixed\". I go and tell them what happened and they guy that did my nails was there and of course they talk so much crap about me without even trying to hide it. \n\nAnd even after \"fixing\" them they were still awful and looked grown out and the shapes were horrible. Which led me to the conclusion that they are just awful at their job and do not know how to be nail technicians.  \n\nAnd this wasn't just me who got the messed up nails but my friend's nails were also extremely messed up too and had the same issues.\n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! I WOULDN'T EVEN GO IF THEY PAID ME!\n\nAWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!
