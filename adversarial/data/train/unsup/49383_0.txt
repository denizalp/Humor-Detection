was a tony and guy customer for years,  but i don't know what happened over the years the service has gone down and the lack of talent and experience has also went down.. I went over for a hair cut and i showed the stylist a picture that i wanted my hair to look like and (stylist) still got it wayyy wrong. not even close. I could tell the stylist was inexperienced just by the way he was cutting my hair.. \n\n I would avoid  this place if you want a good cut
