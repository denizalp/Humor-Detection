Wanted to love it., but ended up being underwhelmed by the food AND service. Went on a Sunday afternoon at 1pm.  It was moderately busy but not slammed. Plenty of open tables.  \n\nSon had the grilled cheese and soup which was tasty.  I ordered the chicken sandwich.  It had absolutely no flavor.  The bread was good and I was starving so I ate half of it and gave the other half to my teenage son...who took just one bite. \n\nNow, they are new and I can overlook that IF the server or anyone for that matter acted liked they gave a sh$t. I told our server what I thought of the sandwich and he did offer to get me something else....but we had already waited a lonnnng time for one coke and for our food to come, so I passed.  Either he didn't pass my comments on or management doesn't care about their customers experience...not sure which.  Along with that, waters were never refilled and by the time our server checked in after delivering food, the son was finished and I had eaten half my sandwich. \n\nWaited another several minutes for the check. While waiting, I looked at the wine list.  YIKES!!  super steep prices!! \n\nNot sure we will try again or just wait it out at OHSO. :o\/
