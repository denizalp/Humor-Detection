Bad service starting from the check-in desk.  They make you wait even though there were clerks standing not helping anyone.  When finally decided to call the next in line, they have such bad attitude and just don't want to spend one extra second with you.  The insulation is terrible in the room.  Being a time share, there were lots of kids staying there.  We could hear kids running all over on the floor above us and the screaming from next door.  The only pleasant person was the time share sales guy.  Thanks to the warning from others, we didn't take the bait. Even if you have to pay more, it's worth it stay away from this place!
