I recently started to install a whole house water filter. I cut through the main copper pipes and was having difficulty and wanted it done right, so I called Scottsdale plumbing. Roger came out earlier than expected and did a clean, thorough job of the water filter installation. I am pleased with the work and would hire them again if necessary.
