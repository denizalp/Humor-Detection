This place is on my way home and starving after a long day at work, decided to give this a try. Love the way they did the decor with the little wardrobe with the Chinese\/Japanese cups and foods. I wanted it for take out as it was snowing but they have tons of seats and very cosy and comfortable. \n\nThe lady is so nice. It's a family owned business and she's so sweet. I asked her for her recommendations as it's my first time here. She asked me some few questions if I prefer seafood or chicken? I finally chose the Vancouver Maki and it was delicious. It's really affordable for the quality and amount of sushi you get. I had 8 mini rolls and they were filling. The man makes the sushi right on the spot and asked if I wanted wasabi.\n\nIt was my first time here, not my last for sure. I'd keep going back for new plates and definitely would recommend it to all as they're amazing!  \n\n- :)
