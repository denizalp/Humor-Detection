Very authentic place, they serve more homemade dishes here than other izakaya I've been to in the U.S., such as motsuni-wow.  \n\nQuality of sushi is excellent and you can request belly cut.  Almost everyone who works here are Japanese, though service can be confusing at time so if you're doing English stick with English, don't mix Japanese and English together even if you have a native speaker lol\n\nDefinitely recommend to anyone who wants good authentic sushi and Japanese dishes.  By far beats all the so call high end Japanese restaurants on the strip that modernize sushi so much it comes out and tastes like a project while burning your wallet.  Save your money at the card table instead!
