I went here in May 2010 with someone.  I ordered the fish and chips and a milkshake, she ordered a salad.  She took one bite of her salad, looked at me, and said 'this tastes like sand.'  I thought she was out of her mind until I tasted it.  Lo, she was right!  Mr. Greenjeans figured out how to make a salad taste like sand!\n\nThe waiter delivered my chocolate milkshake and boasted that it was the best milkshake in the city.  It wasn't the worst milkshake I've had, but it did taste like a powder mix.  My fish and chips weren't that great, either, and, frankly, left me feeling a tad ill.\n\nAll that combined with a hefty cheque in which they list the 'recommended' tips, beginning around 20%.  I gave them 10% and still felt cheated.
