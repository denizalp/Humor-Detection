Ordered food twice here its really good! I mean its no pf changs but seriously good! Best part is they deliver it to you haha. Big portions aswell. \nTry the chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce, its really good probably my favorite. The chicken lo mein is really good\n I honestly just mixed the two together and omg so bomb haha. I will be 400 lbs soon :). But anyway yeah I recommend either of those dishes, my girlfriend got the orange chicken and said it was \"alright.\" \nI ate her left overs the next day.... was pretty good in my opinion. \nSo if your sitting there reading these reviews and thinking \"can they be trusted?\" The answer yes!
