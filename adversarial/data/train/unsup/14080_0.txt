To have a Trump poster in your lobby seems a bit absurd considering half of the country does not support him and even more than that, many of us are part of the minority groups he spewed hate against. That seems extremely inappropriate for a business. What's more important - making a political statement or keeping your paying customers comfortable AND coming back?\n\nThe two men working in the office were great and super informative but the pilot, AJ, was not friendly and seemed irritated. He stuck to his script regarding the tour but wasn't friendly.\n\nThe Red Rock helicopter tour should've been rescheduled due to the wind advisory that day. The ride was extremely bumpy and scary to the point I almost got sick - which never happens. Either way, the view was spectacular and we certainly have a story to tell to all of our friends.
