as a pet owner and dog groomer i come to ryans for nearly all of my pet and professional needs. cheap, wholesale prices, large selection, and friendly and helpful staff keep me coming back.\n\nthe warehouse is open from 8-4:30 m-f which is kind of a bummer because that is the average joe's work schedule and it might be hard for many people to get here during that time. luckily, i have days off during the week so visiting ryans is usually convenient for me. it's huge inside and you might get lost, but have a catalog handy and there are plenty of people walking around to help you find what you're looking for. you must purchase at least $25 worth of items from them each time you shop to keep the \"cost low\" for them. it's not very hard to do so it doesn't bother me much. they have everything for your pet you can imagine and all at reasonable prices. toys, clothes, leashes, brushes, shampoo, cologne, treats, all about 20% cheaper than your retail pet stores. you bring all your stuff to the front counter and the lady with foot long nails assists in checking you out. wam bam thank you ma'am.\n\nryans also has a blade\/shear sharpening and grooming equipment repair part to it (the side on the right). i always bring all of my grooming stuff here for them to fix\/sharpen and usually they can have it back to me in a day or two. they do a good job too. they also have lots of \"left over\" blades and shears that people left there that you can get at half the price of a new one. i got a pair of $70 shears for $30, and a $30 blade for $12. freaking sweet!\n\ni love ryans pet supply and will continue to give them my business over any other chain pet supply store.
