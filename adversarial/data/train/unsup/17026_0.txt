As I am writing this review, I noticed the numerous pictures of people posing with the polar bear on Yelp. Hhmmmm...I went to stand in line so I can get a picture with the polar bear, but was instructed that no cell phone cameras are allowed. They (store employees) would take my photo. I wanted somebody else to snap my photo while she was taking a pic in case I didn't want to purchase her pic (I'm picky about pics). Bummer!  I passed on that since I usually am not a fan of how those photos come out. That polar bear was so cool since the eyes blinked and he was very life like.\n\nBesides that, this shop has it all. It is next door to the Tix 4 Tonight and M&M's World. You could just go through all the collectibles or souvenirs they have inside here for hours. This shop has all sorts of items in here. I didn't get a chance to taste the refreshments from around the world as this place was super crowded.
