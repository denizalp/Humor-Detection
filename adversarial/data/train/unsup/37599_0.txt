i absolutely love this place.\nevery once in a while i crave mango sago from here and i also really like the mango pancakes here too. i have yet to try the durian pancakes here but i certainly will in the future. the 'tong yuen' are also very good and the only thing i can say is that sometimes the more traditional hot chinese desserts can be tooooo sweet. but otherwise. i really like this place.
