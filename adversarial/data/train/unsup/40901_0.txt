When I moved to Toronto, I was sceptical when it comes to my hair. I used to have really good hairdresser who already knew my hair and my style. Also, the hairdressers in Toronto are really expensive, but not sure about the service they provide. So, after reading several reviews on Yelp, I decided to give it a chance and make an appointment. The guy who cut my hair was great! He totally understood my idea and made my hair looking wonderful in less than 30 minutes! Only 30 dollars for hair wash, cut and blow-dry. I love it!
