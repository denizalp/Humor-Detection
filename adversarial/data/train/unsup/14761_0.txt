After reading this the people outside of Pittsburgh will hail me as their queen, and the people of Pittsburgh will want to wish I had never existed on Yelp, but I have to say Primanti Bros. is not living up to the hype generated by numerous segments on the travel channel and food network. \n\nI can't spend all my time on this review as I have many others on my cross--country adventure to tend to, but here are the high- and low-lights of my Primanti Bros experience:\n\n1. The bread needs to be much thicker and substantial to hold the massive toppings inside. I need something better than wonderbread here.\n2. The amount and quality of meat and cheese were not bad - no real complaints here.\n3. I really liked the coleslaw because it was vinegar based.\n4. Um, yeah I'm aware that it would not be a Primanti Bros. sandwich without the french fries, but first, can the french fries taste good (they were stale, mushy and lacked salt) and second, can you not make the entire sandwich taste like potato and cabbage? not pleasant.\n\nWell that's the 411 folks. I'll never feel the need to come back but glad I did try one.\n\nAlso, cash only and the poor service (we waited forever even though there was no one in the restaurant) are not helping.
