The first time I went to Cafe Tranquilo I was amazed I got the vegetarian burrito and all the flavors in it were outstanding and HUGE! both halves i had to grab with two hands. I ordered a watermelon water which was good too but in a small cup. This was around 6pm. \nThe next time I went around 8pm I was excited to order the same thing along with an appetizer I got chips and salsa the chips were so stale and hard to eat. The burrito was so tiny!!! Both halves fit in my hand. No sides were given and I ordered the watermelon water which was a normal sized cup. Needless to say my bf and I did not get full and had to eat somewhere else after. The service was slow and barely paid attention to us. I am very disappointed with the service and food. I am never going back
