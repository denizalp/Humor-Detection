I got chastised by my family for saying this place was 5 stars. I just thought it was such a good deal for lunch - $4.99. But they are right. The stars are right where they should be at 3.5. I'll give it a 4 cause it is so cheap like you wouldn't expect it to also be grand but it is def not 5 stars. Carry on!
