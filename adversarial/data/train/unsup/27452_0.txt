Wow, exceptional burgers here. Simple no bullshit menu with choice of single or double patty burgers. Quality beef and fries made fresh in front of you. Poutine tasted great as well. Not too salty and the cheese actually melts!\n\nGreat high quality burger place that can you access uptown without having to trek downtown.
