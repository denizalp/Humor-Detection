Way over price for the service you receive. They charge $65 for an office visit and then when they have to look into a microscope they charge another $50. Complete rip off. What does the office visit cover if they won't even tell you what's wrong unless you give them more money. Will never come here again. \n\nAny suggestions on a good affordable vet that won't nickel and dime you?  Please help!!
