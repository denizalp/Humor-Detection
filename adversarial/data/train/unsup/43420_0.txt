I can only rate 3 stars because it's a rental car center.  Only a 6 minute ride from the airport so location is good.\n\nAll but 1 rental car company is located within the confines of this cement jungle.  In Vegas it only makes sense.  I rarely visit the Center as Vegas is unusual to rent cars and most times people can not legally drive due to the amount of blood alcohol in their system.  Serves it purpose.
