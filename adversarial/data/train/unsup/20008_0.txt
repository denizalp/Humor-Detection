I've eaten a couple of times here - their noodles have always been pretty passable, and the price has always been very reasonable. Not the best you're going to get in Chinatown, but not the worst either. \n\nThis may sound cynical, but I don't really understand why restaurants have open kitchens where people from the outside, who aren't in the restaurant, can see in. Nothing good will come out of that. \n\nMy friend and I were walking down Spadina to get some noodles, and saw a lady preparing noodles through the window. We're big ramen fans and food voyeurists so we stopped, drooling, to watch her fill bowls for a bit before we headed inside to get food. She was up against the window, about two feet away from us on the other side of the glass. She returned with a prepared bowl of ramen (let's call this bowl #1) filled with what looked like chicken stock and yellow noodles.\n\nWe watched in increasing horror was she grabbed another bowl (bowl #2), filled it with a different kind of noodles, and proceeded to pour all of the broth from bowl #1 into bowl #2. Then, with a pair of chopsticks, she one by one transferred all the toppings (bok choy, meat slices) from bowl #1 to bowl #2. The only thing left in bowl #1 at this point were the noodles; she put a different soup stock into bowl #1, with different toppings but over the exact same noodles, and took both bowls out to be re-served. It seems kind of evident that they must have gotten an order wrong or something and as a result the customer had sent the bowl of noodles back, but instead of throwing it out and making a new bowl, they just recycled everything.\n\nThis was all a little awkward for us to watch - especially since she was at the counter right up the window that faced the street and we were watching her the entire time. We opted for a different noodle place.
