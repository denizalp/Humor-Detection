Did I just die and go to heaven? Wait no, I'm just at the dopest day club on the planet. (Well, to be honest, I've actually only been to day clubbing in Vegas, so I can't speak for the one's in Europe or South America, but this is easily the best day club on the strip).\n\nIt's like the adult version of Disneyland. You have to wait in a long ass line and pay premium prices to get in, but it's all worth it once you finally get inside.\n\nThe music is always banging as they have some of the biggest house DJ's lined up. Even trance and hip-hop heads can't deny that house music is exactly what you wanna hear when you're completely wasted and fucking shit up in the pool.\n\nCompared to all the other day clubs, Encore is extremely spacious and the crowd is noticeably more attractive. Yeah that sounds a bit shallow, but I guarantee you'll notice it and how much of a difference it makes to your day clubbing experience. If you ever hear people at your gym talking about how they're working out for day clubbing, I'm almost 100% sure they're getting ready for EBC.\n\n1) Drink prices are the norm for Vegas clubbing\n2) Get a locker if you don't want your phone getting wet\n3) Arrive early or else you won't get in\n4) Don't eat at a buffet prior to day clubbing (plz save it for after!)\n\nIt's a little pricier than most other day clubs, but it's really just that much better. Highly recommend trying tables here too if it's within your budget.
