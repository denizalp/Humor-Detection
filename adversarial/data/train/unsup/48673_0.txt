My aunt recommended Al to me as she had been going to him for years.  Every experience I've had with him has been great.  He's always had my car fixed the same day.  His prices are always reasonable and there's been a couple minor things I've went to him about and he fixed them real quick on the spot and didn't charge me a thing (trunk latch stuck and trunk wouldn't close...he fixed within minutes), or charged a nominal amount.  I never feel like I'm being taken advantage of as far as price, unlike almost every other mechanic I've encountered.  Very trustworthy!!
