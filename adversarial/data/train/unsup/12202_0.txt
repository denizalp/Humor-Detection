I didn't realize you could hate your job so much.  The servers here look like they want to die.  but kill you first.  and then die.\nThe food is just really subpar in an already bad town for sushi experiences.\nThe seaweed salad was frozen.  FROZEN and they just nuked that baby and said sorry...I spose there's nothing else they could have done if all their salad is frozen.\nThe rolls are filled to the brim with tempura bits and imo that's just a waste.  Disgusting filler.\nThe agedashi tofu was fried in old oil.\nNasty.\nDon't bother.  \nDamn -30 degree weather makes me go to the closest place available.  \n\ngross.
