Who would of thought 20 years ago, that cupcakes would be such big business today??  But, they are and this place is the Queen of cupcakes.\n Have to stay away from this place because, the temptation is too much. \nHowever, I do venture over here every now and then.\nFantastic cupcakes, and the frosting is wonderful. I could eat many of them.\nHowever at $5.00 each I cannot go crazy over eating these treats.\nNot sure which is my favorite, because, they are all so good.\nWorth it to check out this place.
