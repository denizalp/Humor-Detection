I have gone to two different Hickory Taverns within the last 3 weeks.  Not much different.  Big screens, TVs...a bar, and a decent menu.  The atmosphere was quiet during the day visit for lunch.  The night trip was also quiet...not too busy.  Service was typical for a bar restaurant.  The servers have to wait multiple tables....so not much interaction.   The food, especially the sweet potato fries, that were drizzled with honey and butter was good.  I ordered a salad with chicken.  I was surprised that the grilled chicken came out on the salad very cold....as if it was removed from freezer.  However the server was very quick to get a fresh salad topped with a very nicely grilled, chicken breast.  very good.  The other thing that provided the \"bar\" feel at one of the restaurants....was ordering bottled drinks (beers and coolers) and not being offerred a frosted mug or glass.  I thought that was fairly standard.  Should not have to ask...should have been offered.  I will return....with family and friends to see how larger crowds are handled.  good locations and good parking.
