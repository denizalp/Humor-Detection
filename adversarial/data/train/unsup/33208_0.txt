I had high hopes for this sushi place given the rating. There's a lot of great competition in the area, so for a $30 ayce dinner, I expected more. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. The food lacked flavour and was just okay. The service was good, the food came out quickly. I've had much better sushi. I probably won't go back. There's great sushi in the area where you can order a lot for a very reasonable price.
