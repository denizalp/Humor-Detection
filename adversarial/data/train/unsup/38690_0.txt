Let me start off by saying what's up with the name \"fun taco\"... Nothing about this restaurant was fun, The food was pretty sad, bland, customer service was not there, and did I mention the wait in a drive thru line is about 5 to 7 min and there is no one in the drive thru but you... \nFun taco if your reading this you need a different name because fun taco is not for you ... Also what's up with your rice and beans sorry no good at all, I will not be back to this place there are far greater taco restaurants around
