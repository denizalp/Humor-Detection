I'm giving 3 stars because it was neither good nor bad. I was looking for dress shoes for C's costume & they had 3 different pairs in his size (8.5). The shoe area was a mess & a lot of the shoes were in the wrong section for their size. The lady who checked me out was very nice & pleasant. I always feel like Ross is a dressed up Big Lots or Tuesday Morning. I guess I just don't get this place.
