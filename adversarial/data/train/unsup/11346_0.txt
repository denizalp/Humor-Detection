Step right up and barf away! If you are looking for an effective binge and purge weigh loss plan this is the place for you!  \nFirst let us entertain you in our line of agony while one person gets your drink and takes your money. This thrill ride of a line only lasts 10 minutes if there is only one family a head of you.  ( and its included in the price)\n\nNext imagine the look on your dates face when you hand her a clean plastic plate and silverware with crusty residue on it.  But don't worry. The residue doesn't show up on the knives because there are no knives to be found. ( Awesome)\n\nNow once you cross the room dodging folks and napkin debris on the floor you can make way to the buffet! Imagine all the nostalgia you will feel when you go up to the buffet and what should be a mix of baked fish, chicken, and meats. If a selection of stale breakfast items! ( left over from Monday morning brunch buffet?). \n\nFeat your eyes on crusty eggs, syrup that has congealed, and other things you experience in the government lunch program in your old elementary school.  Cheese sandwich anyone? \n\nNot into breakfast? Why not grab a slice of gristly, crunchy ham or nom descript fried chicken?\n\nThen when you have had your fill of such wonders head to the chocolate fountain where the cute little rug rats who picked their noses are sticking their fingers and licking it.. Hmmm hmmm can't wait to have some of that.\n\nSo like I said. Best diet plan out there. You come in, loose your appetite, and what you are you loose in the parking lot.   Awesome!
