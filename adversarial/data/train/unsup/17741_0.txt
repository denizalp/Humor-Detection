May Garden has got to be one of the best Chinese restaurants.  I used to live near the May Garden in North Phoenix, and I loved it.  I used to eat there regularly, then one day it closed :(    I could not believe it.  It was just gone.  For years I was upset..........then one day I saw that there was 2 locations, and only 1 closed.  I knew I had to go!   The unfortunate thing was I had moved to California, so stopping for lunch was kind of out of the question.  So, on my last visit to Phoenix, I stopped by the other location.  It was just as good, if not better.  Do not get the buffet (not that it's bad), but instead order from the menu.  The chicken fried rice is really to die for as well as the egg rolls and crab puffs.  You will be in heaven!  Even though you are in the middle of Maryvale\/Westridge area.  Its really worth the risk of getting shot.
