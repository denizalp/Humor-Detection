I came since I was working a tradeshow at the Sands Expo.  The line was always filled with business men due to the tradeshow. I found out that they do order to-go! We skipped the line and ordered via phone. They say they'll call you when it's ready.  But when I checked in 15 minutes, they already had it done! Love it. I'll order to-go again! I had the Singapore noodles. Pretty on par with what I thought it would be. \n\nI actually sat down at the restaurant later in the week.  I gotta say..as an Asian used to Asian service, the customer service is standard for an Asian restaurant. It seems gruff for a Vegas location, but just right for an Asian noodle house. They sit you down, take your order, bring you food, and take your money. That's it. No more, no less. They were so busy during the show. \n\nMy friend is on a gluten free regime. She said the beef rice noodles were great!
