Bad service!   Bought a vegan cake for my sons birthday.  Asked if they could write Happy Birthday on it.  Woman tells me can't I'm not a cake decorator.  First time in 40 years I've had a bakery not willing to write Happy Birthday on a cake!   This store gives zero shits about the customer experience.
