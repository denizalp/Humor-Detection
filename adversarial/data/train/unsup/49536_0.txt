My girlfriend and I definitely felt Glaze was worth getting up early for.  She got the Green Tea donut and I kept it simple and got the cinnamon glaze twist.  You could immediately tell how homemade these tasted.  All the donuts are formed by hand which is impressive considering how many donuts they make.  The green tea flavor was very rich and strong and the cinnamon was a simple, classic yeast donut that never fails.\n\nThe folks inside were very nice and welcoming.  The inside was clean, although there is a lot of space left empty.  But that's understandable since they haven't been open a full year.  There's a lot of potential in the shop so I'm sure they will utilize their space to the fullest.  Definite must try for any donut fans!
