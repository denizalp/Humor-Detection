When someone says brunch, I'm expecting a combination of breakfast and lunch items.  No such luck here.  I found no breakfast items awaiting me.  The only redeeming factor...prime rib.  You don't have to wait til 4pm when the dinner crowd start to wander in.  You can have it early.  And you can have it the way you want it...rare, medium, thick, thin, etc.  Pair this with the spicy fresh horseradish and you've got a clear brunch winner.  Or have it with a side of bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and a grilled lamb steak...I did, along with a plate of peeled shrimp.
