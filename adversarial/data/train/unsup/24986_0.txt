Upon entry, our eyes needed a moment to readjust from the glaring midday sun to the dimly lit interior of the pub. After stumbling about for a bit, my husband and I settled in a booth next to the bar. A friendly waitress greeted us quickly to hand us a few menus and take our drink orders. With a request for a good IPA, she returned with no less than three tasters in hand. Impressive! Lunch was off to a great start (especially with Whitesnake playing on the jukebox!).    \n\nGRILLED CHEESE ($6.99): I went with wheat bread and steak fries as my side. A simple rendition of the classic but perfect for the price-point. 4\/5\n\nTHE RACHEL ($11.99): Husband described the size of this turkey ruben sandwich as \"ridiculous\". He could only eat half. He went with sweet potato fries as his side. 4\/5\n\nThe waitress at Shakespeare's was awesome and the grub was good. My only gripe was that there was a noticeable lack of vegetarian options on the menu. A veggie burger option would be amazing. A girl can dream, after all.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #60
