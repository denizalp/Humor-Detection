FULL OF POSERS!!!\n\n**** GET A RECEIPT IF YOU PAY COVER*****\n\nI am dead serious about getting a receipt! Despite the long line..I didn't wait in line and got in immediately but I did have to dish $20 for cover. After 5 minutes of pure hell and seeing people just standing around looking for Christina Aguilerra or whatever stupid celebrity was supposedly there (I didn't see her btw) I told my friends it was time to leave. They insisted there was a cooler party upstairs where the pool was.. so we walked up there and the pool area was closed! \n\nI went back to the entrance and asked the bouncer for a refund and with a smirk on his face he said \"Well do you have a receipt?\". What a jerk! So, definitely get a receipt for next time! \n\nI left this place after 5 minutes. It was full of followers\/posers and there wasn't even anyone dancing.. just people standing around wanting to be seen or god knows what. Pure crap. \n\nAll this happened on a Friday night.\n\nPS- Tryst is amazing! Went there the next night :)
