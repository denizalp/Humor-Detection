This is definitely a gemstone! They are serious about their foods! My favorite is Banh Xeo. It's by far the best Vietnamese crepe I've eaten. It far surpassed the ones in Westminster California. They make it big and put many things on it such as shreded squid\/octopus (?), pork belly, yellow beans, bean sprouts, etc.. U guys definitely should try this one!
