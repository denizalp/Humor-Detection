Just got my first Hydra Facial Ladies I highly recommend this procedure , I feel amazing and instantly saw the difference on my skin actually my  customers all day said my face was glowing , let me just say it was a fantastic experience every step the girl went over in detail what was happening to my skin remarkable and at the end she shows you all the black and white heads that are floating around its insane honestly if you are not into facials at all.... this is one experience that you must at least treat yourself to , I cant stop talking about it its great and the girl at the YONGE AND EGLINGTON  location was very well informed about what to aspect throughtout  the treatment love love loved it cant wait to go back again
