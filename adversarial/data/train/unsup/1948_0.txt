My food was super cold when it came out and that's not because it was waiting in back. They made it to order and my friends got theirs faster. Rather, it probably had been cooked awhile ago and just plated. They reheated everything and gave it back but I wish I hadn't even gotten it. It was super bland. All three of us tried everything on our plates (ribs, sausage po boy, fried chicken, cole slaw, Mac and cheese, beans, and rice) and almost everything was significantly under seasoned and bland. Way to expensive for shitty food. Go down the street to Panchos or Amenos instead. \nAlso, food didn't look anything like those initial photos.
