EAT FRESH...................DONUTS?\n\nHow often do you see a Subway share the same room with Winchell's Donuts? NEVER.\n\nSo you want to eat healthy by getting a 6 inch turkey on wheat. Maybe a footlong if you're hungry. Of course lots of extra vegetables. \n\nAs you move over to the cashier, BAM! DONUTS! It hits you hard like a bad vague topic on the Vegas Yelp Talk Thread.  So much for eating healthy. When a chocolate glazed donut is screaming out at you, you cant help but rescue that poor, sugary, chocolate goodness from it's glass case dungeon.\n\nOk so this review kind of strayed off the main road and into a dark forested area so let me try to restore order.\n\nIf you are not easily distracted by shiny things then you should always take advantage of Subway's specials every month. There is always a designated footlong for 5 bucks. So far, every February is Februany. You can get most of their footlongs for 5 bucks. The premium ones this year they have for 6 bucks.\n\nOther than wanting a footlong roast beef on a maple bar, I dont see why they have Winchell's up in here. Its like trying to run a marathon with stilettos on. It's just not a good idea.\n\nService here is hit or miss depending on who just happens to be working at the time. Some of them see it as just a your basic minimum wage job. Others just plain dont wanna work. \n\nOn a positive note, the wifi signal is very strong from the Starbucks next door so you can stay here all day and play World of Warcraft or whatever choice of game you are addicted to. Im sure the employees will leave you alone as long as you buy a sandwich or two.\n\nSo to me its just ok. Every time I have gone here, it's a different atmosphere. Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.
