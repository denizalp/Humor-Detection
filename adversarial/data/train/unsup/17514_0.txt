Ducked in here to try sweet confections after first getting my hair done down the street at Pageboy Salon (do check them out) and dining at Tamari (ditto, check them out).  It seemed only right to finish off a nice evening of discoveries (I'm rather new in town so am busy \"discovering\") with dessert.\n\nI was greeted by sweet, upbeat Camille (appropo in a sweets shoppe) who helped me with all the cupcake offerings.  I opted for the cheesecake cupcake and a cheese danish, which in no way resembles a tradiional cheese danish.  \n\nI actually did manage to wait until morning to eat the danish which was good but I do have to say I wanted cheese with each and every bite and, to that end, it was lacking.  It was quite good, nevertheless. \n\nI was going to wait to eat the cupcake later.  Yeah, that didn't happen.  I popped it into the microwave to warm it up from being in the fridge and \"Wallah!\"... Just what the doctor ordered.  They do prescribe cupcakes, no?  It was so moist and yummy.  I want more!  If I had ordered 3, then 3 would have been eaten on the spot!\n\nI didn't think the price of a little over $5 was unseemingly for the rewards of both the danish and cupcake.\n\nA nice find in Lawrenceville and I'll be back.
