Such a cool space.\n\nI've been to this place numerous times-for local artists and yelp parties and just love it every time.\n\nNot only is it an abandoned warehouse turned into an artist haven, it has artist workspaces all over the building. Sure, it's older, but to have a bunch of local artists in one place..especially in a building that's very\"CLE\" is definitely cool.\n\nAdditionally, just the other weekend, we found out there was free pinball on certain weekends of the month. Not fancy new pinball, but the old school ones and tons of them on the 3rd floor. Very cool.\n\nHighly recommend playing a game of pinball in addition to supporting local art.
