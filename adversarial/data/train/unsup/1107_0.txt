This is probably my least favorite location thus far. I grew up eating at a Aloha Kitchen and I was super excited to see one open near me, however, I was disappointed that it's not as good as the other locations. They just opened recently so I do expect change for the better. Currently this place is just the restaurant, but soon there will be a bar and gaming.\n\nMy favorite thing about this place is that the food is fresh. Everything is made to order. I love coming here for all things Spam. Their spam musubi, their spam saimin soup, and especially their spam and eggs for breakfast. Their adobo fried rice is good choice if you'd like a big order. It is fried rice wrapped in eggs. Their salad isn't great, they use cheap lettuce so it's tasteless. Their macaroni is really good, I love to add it to my orde if they don't already come with it. Their lumpia is decent if you're craving it, but it can be over fried sometimes.\n\nTheir staff is friendly and they really pay attention to their customer's needs. I have to critique this place because they are new and I hope they can improve. Their food portions are very inconsistent. One day their is too much food for me to finish by myself and other days, there is literally nothing on my plate.  I love their recipes, but I think they need to uphold the standard that the other locations have left. Quality of cooking needs to be improved. I will be gladly returning to hope they take note of their customers demand.
