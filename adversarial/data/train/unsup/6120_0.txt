If Justin Carlisle is their chef still, then you're in for a treat. He is one of the best Midwestern chefs I have had the pleasure to work for, although he was only the sous at the time. \n\nI've tried many meals from this kitchen and everything has been delicious. I believe the hanger steak is the staple I this restaurant. The marinade and tenderness of the meat makes it the best thing I have ever eaten.
