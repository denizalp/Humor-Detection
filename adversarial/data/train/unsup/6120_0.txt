I love me some tacos and I love me some Cherikee Red. Together in harmonious entwinement they make for an incredible experience.\n\nThe dudes are friendly and the options varied and creative. Words aren't enough to describe the Thai chili slaw and avocado cream is the stuff of taco dreams.\n\nThe truck always pops up when you need it with such brilliantly delicious clairvoyance you'd swear they were tracking your belly thoughts with some PRISM-inspired culinary surveillance.\n\nNever skip it. No matter how long the line.\n\n\nDon't even think about it. They might know.
