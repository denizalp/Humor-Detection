The day after a fun and crazy house party, my husband and I discovered that the lens on our Canon PowerShot was slightly dented and wouldn't go back into the camera body. Because it recognized a \"lens error,\" the camera also wouldn't take pictures. I called Canon's support line but they insisted that I send the camera in for a free diagnosis. I was suspicious that the issue wouldn't be covered under warranty and we would end up having to pay a lot to have them repair it. So, based on a recommendation from a Yelp talk thread (thanks, Chris T!), I decided to check out Tempe Camera. \n\nWhen I walked in the main entrance, I quickly saw the repair desk on the right (it was clearly marked and easy to spot). There was no line, so the woman working behind the counter called me right up. She patiently listened as I explained the problem. She did say that the lens issue would not be covered under Canon's warranty and that Tempe Camera would cost me ~$175 to repair ($100 for part; $75 for repair). I truly appreciated how up front she was about the cost and the fact that she didn't try to convince me to pay for repairs when replacement would probably cost the same or less. This honesty made the business come across as very reputable and trustworthy. \n\nI doubt I will be back to Tempe Camera since my photography efforts are limited to taking digital pictures of my cats and posting them on Facebook and it seems that it costs more to fix digital cameras than to replace them. However, I appreciated Tempe Camera's integrity and would recommend them to anyone who takes photography seriously and has a really nice camera that needs repairs.
