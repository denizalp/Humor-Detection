Ohhhmyyygoodness! Wow, this place is awesome, so glad I decided to try it! I am not a huge hot dog fan but I loved it! The prices are great the food is great and the service was great. So we had the Chilli cheese dog, fries with seasoning, euro special(fries), chilli cheese fries, east coast dog, Chicago dog, and a Philly steak dog, naked hot dog and corn dog(chicken)!! There were different sauces to use for dipping for you fries and so many delicious add on..... they were great. There are so many options for hot dogs and other food besides that. There was also a check in offer for 10% off your meal which was great! Highly recommend this joint if you want a plain dog or a fancy one! Food was quick, hot, and fresh! And the beef was out of this world as far as quality goes. Definitely my top spot for a hot dog and fries.
