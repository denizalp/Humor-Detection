am not impressed---thought i would take a walk over to the Cromwell---liked it better when it was Bills----you feed the public and you live with millionaires--you feed the rich and your live with the poor---they have tried to take it way upscale and they can not compete with the wynn or the ventian---first it is too dark---any nobody around so i am not going to play with myself no not at my age--take that anyway you like---and i can have more fun with a 25 limit  wynn ---people more interesting-----could not find the wonderful coffee shop that hd the best chinese food in vegas ----Ceasars has been a failure it has been broke before and it can not go on  i then walked over tp Ceasars and they put in a poker doom and really downsized the sportsbook and wil never go back---the Cromwell will be a failure and the pool parties--over priced selling over priced drinks and who will pay what they want to get in these pool parties are a total rip and a disgrace to las vegas frank
