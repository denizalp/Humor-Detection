I guess the nickname \"Wasted Management Open\" makes sense for this tournament.  It's got to be the only PGA tournament were more people attend for the non-golf activities than to actually watch golf.  It's an amazing event for sure.  Some observations:\n\n+ Valet parking is the way to go.  It's near the entrance and although it costs $$$, it is worth every penny in my opinion.  The other lots are too far for my tastes...I'm an impatient guy.  Luckily, I scored a Valet pass.\n\n+ Be sure you plan to give your liver a rest after the tournament.  If you're going to do this the right way, you'll be drinking like a fish for 4+ days\/nights.\n\n+ The best golf holes to watch in my opinion are 17 and 18.  I like the pin positions on the 17 green and the water hazard surrounding the green makes you pay dearly if you try to hit driver off the tee and go for it in 1.....it's a short Par 4 and it's fun to watch many pros go for it off the tee.  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=iCtOHGnWFqKSp8S1vfz9Gw#iCtOHGnWFqKSp8S1vfz9Gw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=erXOqEtueb9h-gV5vcXBWQ#erXOqEtueb9h-gV5vcXBWQ\n\n+ For a 1st timer, 16 is a must see.  However, unless you can get in a skybox, it's tough to get in on Saturday and Sunday.  I heard people were waiting since 7 or 8 AM to get in on those days.  Luckily, we were in a skybox.\n\n+ The Thunder Dog is really good.  Priced at $5, it's a deal.  You can find a Thunderbird stand selling them between Hole 16 and the practice range.  It's worth waiting in line for it.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=3LcsrNyLWjcQPFvhem6B3Q#3LcsrNyLWjcQPFvhem6B3Q\n\n- The Bird's Nest is fun for a first timer.  However, this was my 2nd year going and I didn't have much fun there this year.  It's way too packed and it gets uncomfortable.  Last year, Will.i.am rocked the house.  This year it was Dirks Bentley and Roger Clyne.  Roger Clyne had the entire tent packed...he could have headlined all by himself.  It's way too crowded and full of drunks.  Next year, I will pass on this for sure.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=vZZ7fH_yuL7Z-Mg6QigccQ#vZZ7fH_yuL7Z-Mg6QigccQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/waste-management-phoenix-open-scottsdale?select=NWQnPDf8WzWFO1QR4cgiPQ#NWQnPDf8WzWFO1QR4cgiPQ\n\nOverall, it's a pretty fun scene.  It should definitely be on everyone's bucket list to experience at least once.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
