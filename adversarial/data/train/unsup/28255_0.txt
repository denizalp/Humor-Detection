We got take out sausage sandwiches, some marinated cabbage and some sausage. \nThe sausage sandwiches were divine, soooo good\nWe made some cabbage stew with the cabbage and sausage, it was so goooooooood!\n\nThe only down side is that they do not have a sitting area.... but it's a grocery shop anyways
