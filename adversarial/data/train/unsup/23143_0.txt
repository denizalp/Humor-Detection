This place is ridiculously expensive for meh food.  I tried some lasagna, also had the quesadilla and some chicken strips.  The food was fine, nothing special, but it cost a ton of money!  I have no idea why they charge so much, this is the simple casual place.  There are many other restaurants in Vegas with similar price points with much better ambiance and food.  Go to one of those.
