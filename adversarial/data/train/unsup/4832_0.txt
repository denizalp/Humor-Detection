So this is the first belt sushi place that I have been to here in AZ. I have been to several in the Seattle area, and I have had both amazing and crappy sushi from them. I am a little bit of a sushi fanatic so I kinda know my fish lol. \n\nPrice: 4.5 stars. The price is per plate like all belt places. They range from $1.75- $5.25. Most plates are $2.25- $4.25. I got 6 plates and spent about $15 before tax. But still this is the price for 2-4 pieces of fish and can add up really quick. \n\nService: 5 stars. I was greeted as I walked in and taken to a seat right away. The servers are great and if you ask a question they will make sure you are taken care of and make sure that someone is taking care of you. \n\nSize of roll or fish: 5 stars. The rolls were a good size, and the cuts of fish were very large in comparison to most the belt sushi places I have been to. \n\nQuality of fish: 4. stars. The fish is good, but I guess I am just spoiled with amazing fish so I can't quite give it 5 stars. \n\nRed Snapper $1.75 for 2 pieces. Not amazing but not bad at all\nTuna $3.25 for 2 pieces. It was a different texture than I'm used to but was good tasting\nSalmon $2.25 for 2 pieces. Delicious salmon no complaints at all\nPhilly Roll $2.25 for 4 pieces. I enjoyed this basic roll. \nLas Vegas Roll $2.25 for 3 pieces. This thing is amazing. Don't hesitate. Just get it.
