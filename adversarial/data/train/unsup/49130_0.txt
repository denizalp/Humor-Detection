I gave this place a whirl Saturday afternoon while E tried Weeziana across the way.  First of all, there was NO ONE there except one person eating.  Very quiet.  It took me about 5 minutes to get someones attention to wait on me.  I ordered the pork chops meal, not smothered.  The young lady just looked at me like I was crazy.  Then finally said is that all?  I said does it come with anything?  Ummm yea two sides.  Ok great, can I have the mac and cheese and the greens.  She said 8 minutes and that was fine by me.  \nI took the food home and couldnt wait to dig in.  The pork chops were seasoned perfectly.  I wish I could say the same for the greens and mac & cheese.  The mac and cheese tasted like Velvetta Shells and Cheese and they just threw it in the oven.  ICK.  The greens were flavorless.  No salt, no pepper, no nothing.  I was disappointed to say the least.  Nothing I would try again and surely not for $13.00.\nSorry forgot to take pictures :(
