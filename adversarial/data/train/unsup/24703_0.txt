What a fantastic neighborhood restaurant. The type of place that makes me want to move to old town.  And such a great Saturday night crowd! A perfect demographic mashup that felt more like Santa Barbara than Arizona.  For dinner I ordered the panini with prosciutto and caramelized onions. It was very tasty but arrived at our table a little too cold. My butternut squash soup on the other hand was piping hot and excellent. Just right for a chilly January evening. \n\nUnfortunately I was a little under the weather on this particular evening so I couldn't drink any of the wine but I am feeling better now and look forward to returning and getting a nice red wine buzz started.
