So far my experience with this place is a ZERO.  It's been a month since my dog passed, we paid for a private cremation wanting the ashes back as well as other items that come in the package.  We went through our Vet who said it should only take 7 to 10 days.  A month later the vet is still trying to find out from THIS PLACE what happened.  \n\nAll the paperwork according to the vet was done correctly, they have checked and can verify, the transfer was done correctly, but yet THIS PLACE is saying they have no record of a private cremation???\n\nThe vet only gave us two choices of places, this is ONE I DO NOT RECOMMEND and will NEVER attempt to do business with again.  It's been a month I am sure they screwed up now as there is no way my dog's body is still around there and there is nothing that will be acceptable at this point.  If they try to produce ashes and a paw print, it will be completely FALSE and not our dog.\n\nThey screwed up and should admit it instead of being deceitful and try to lie their way out of it.  This will also be reported to the BBB.  WATCH OUT for this place....
