We have been on two TWK Adventure Tours.  The first was in South Africa 2014 and then again in Fiji 2017.  To say that these trips were fantastic is an understatement.  Instead, I would say that both trips were life-altering.  Seeing the world as a family is more special then words can describe.  Showing your 12-year-old daughter what life is like in a South African township or being in the bush tracking rhinos can't be forgotten. \n Sharing in a kava ceremony in a small fijian village and waking up every day on a new beautiful secluded island seems like something out of a dream.\n\nWe have made lifelong friends on these journeys.  We can't wait to share more adventures together.  \n\nIf you are looking for a safe family-focused way to see the world this is the way to do it.  We like to say that you can spoil your kids but you can't spoil them with travel.
