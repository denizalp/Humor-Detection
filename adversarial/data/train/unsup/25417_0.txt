If you love country, this is the place in Vegas for you!\n\nMy boyfriend surprised me and took me to Vegas for my birthday and it was my first time at the Toby Keith bar. I'd heard about it from friends who loved it and I sure loved it too. The bar is very big with lots of tables and a dancing area to dance to the live band. I didn't get any food since we all just wanted to get drinks. The staff was friendly and served quickly. The music is loud and the drinks are strong! They're a little expensive but I guess it makes sense since they're served in huge mason jars. Seriously they're huge and really heavy and I'm not complaining. I got a long island for $30 in a big mason jar and it's totally worth it.\n\nWe stayed for quite a while dancing until a little after the band took a break. This place has a great vibe and an awesome atmosphere. I'll definitely be returning when I come back to visit.
