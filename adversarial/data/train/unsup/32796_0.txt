This location is very busy and they do a great job of managing the line. There is not a lot of seating when it gets busy, so prepare to do some standing during the busy periods.\n\nI had the Mangonada, and although the mangos were fresh, the flavor combination was a huge turn off for me. What redeemed this place was the coffee horchata! I highly recommend it. It may not look like the best drink on the menu but this is by far my favorite.\n\nTotal wait time: 1 hour 15 min \n\nDrink total: 3 drinks
