I was here a few days after Standard & Pour opened.  I joined two friends in returning to try items on the menu we didn't have the first time.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nCrispy oysters\nEndive and date salad\nDate and bleu cheese jam spread\nSpicy shrimp\nThree beans\nMini burgers\nWhole smoked romanesco\nMeatball sliders\nKimchi tacos\nRibeye cap\nFruit loop panna cotta\nLost bread\n\nThe crispy oysters and the date and bleu cheese jam were repeats and just as good as the first time.  Some of the new items we tried that were amazing were the three beans, spicy shrimp, and whole smoked romanesco.  I had never seen a romanesco in a store but I was blown away by the great flavor with the red onions, capers, raisins, and herbs.  The smoking gives it a fantastic flavor.  The spicy shrimp lived up to their name and I could have eaten the entire serving myself.  Finally, the three beans with a house XO, fish sauce, and garlic.  The beans were crisp, spicy, and very tasty.\n\nFor dessert, the fruit loop panna cotta was not available the first go round.  This time it was and it's quite good and what a take on a cereal.  The lost bread--pain perdu--was better than the first time around.  The cinnamon flavor comes from being made from cinnamon rolls and the bread was moist throughout.\n\nStandard & Pour has an extensive enough menu so there are choices for almost any type of eater.  For the more inquisitive, try the romanesco, the beans, and the date and bleu cheese jam spread.  You won't regret it.
