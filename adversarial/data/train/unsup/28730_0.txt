We came to celebrate my nephew's birthday today and was told after calling to confirm on Friday it's ok to have a cake even if it's not in the party room. Then we placed the ice cream cake in the freezer...still was not told at the front desk. Then, after trying to let the cake thaw for a bit to make it easier to cut we were told that we couldn't have a cake. So after complaining we were told we could then eat it but could not sing, light a candle, or draw attention to the cake. So ridiculous...who doesn't allow a cake for a kids birthday? I don't recommend this place for a birthday. Unless you want to be scolded by the owner after an employee tells you it's ok and deal with an owner that has no customer service skills.
