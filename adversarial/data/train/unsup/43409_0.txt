Had dinner here for the first time last night and it was delicious! The staff was incredibly friendly and gave great recommendations. I had the strawberry fizz cocktail, which was my first sake cocktail, and was not disappointed! The brussel sprout appetizer and the pork belly buns were my favorite!
