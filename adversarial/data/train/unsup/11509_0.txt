I give this theatre a solid 3.5 stars. I'm rounding down to 3 for now because from what I've seen over the years this place is on a downward spiral and i think the review should reflect it.\n\nThe pro's: great seats, arm rests\/cup holders that can be moved out of the way (so that horny teens can fool around unrestricted or larger patrons can claim ownership over more real estate in comfort), good size screens, lots of theatres and plenty of leg room. \n\nOK that's all well and good BUT so what? Since Famous Players was bought out by Cineplex they've been doing the same things across all their theatres. Even going steps further with IMAX, and ULTRA AVX theatres. \n\nMost weekends this place is more than 1\/2 empty (or less than 1\/2 full for you optimists) and I feel like this once progressive theatre company is endangered and slowly moving towards extinction. \n\nSomehow they manage to hold their prices higher than at other theatres... some how, and they seem to operate on a skeleton staff these days. \n\nProtip: visit this place if they're showing a movie you want to see and it's sold out elsewhere, they'll probably have available seating.
