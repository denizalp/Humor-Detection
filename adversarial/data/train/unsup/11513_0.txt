That new TV commercial with the chattery LeBron muppet slapping all that dust around almost makes me wanna dock two stars offa this glowing review of the best team in the NBA. Not even the most buffoonish ABA cocaine clown could've acted that jittery or so brazenly call out a three-time-champ living legend like that nutty little LeBron muppet. I don't care how unbeatable the Cavs look, or how vulnerable the Lakers look....That commercial is too much fuel for the Lakers fire. Did LeBron sign off on this?!?! Dude...DON'T JINX IT!!\n\nBut seriously...This team made a huge step in 2008-09. You should be proud of them. I figured the team for about 55 wins if they stayed healthy, but this kinda dominance hints at the potential for a history-making dynasty run. And it's happening in just the right way and at the right time to give you Clevo folks hope that LeBron will stick around. Forget about those hypotheticals placing James and Bosh in Knicks jerseys after the 2010 sweepstakes! I had an eerie dream--er, shall I say an Erie dream?--that they were both wearing Cavs jerseys the next year. (Careful what you wish for, though....I think your defense might be compromised a bit in that scenario!)\n\nHey! Who's the ad agency that produces Cavs promo spots? I got an idea for you.......cue up the Pere Ubu 'cos when Mo Williams becomes the X-factor of the NBA Finals, you will know him as the \"Final(s) Solution\"....Huh? Huh?\n\nAlso, waste no time extending Mike Brown for another 20 years!\n\n(Why do I have all this excitement to spare for you, Cavs fans? Because I am a Kings fan. F'real, though...Get that LeBron muppet off TV now!)
