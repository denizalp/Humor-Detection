This in one open air, many seller shop. They have vintage and new, crafts, soaps, baby stuff, garments from India, (beautiful), so many varieties of things. I do wish there was a separation between the sellers of vintage and antique items and the craft and newer items. But that is just me. They don't seem to get a lot of \"new\" old items as far as we can tell but we always stop and visit just in case. I usually end up finding something I want to buy. Old or new. It is worth it every time.
