Eh it's alright. Promoters kept making us go back and forth in line. One promoter will say one thing and then another promoter will say another thing. We got in there it's too packed we could barely dance on the dance floor. It's best to go there if you have a table. Other than that.. Music is great. The vibe and atmosphere is great.
