After reading other reviews, I  expected to be wowed by the food.  We ordered street tacos and a chicken burrito.  The tacos were very good, as were the side of beans, full of flavor and nicely spiced.  The burrito,  on the other hand,  was heavy on rice and light on chicken.  It also had quite a bit of gristle and some unidentified crunchy somethings I  suspect weren't supposed to be there.  I may return to try a grilled chicken plate,  which looked good,  but the expectations are now much lower.
