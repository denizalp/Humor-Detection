This star is strictly based on the service and NOT the food.. I didn't get as far as having food because I wasn't pleased with the way a staff member talked to me, really rude.\n\nI understand they were really busy, it's a new establishment so I will be going back to try their food.\n\nAgain the star is just based on the service.. keep in mind I drove 40 minutes to get there so I was even more upset with the experience.\n\nInterior was beautiful, really clean
