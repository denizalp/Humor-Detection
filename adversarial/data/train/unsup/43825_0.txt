This place is like bachi burger, but for hot dogs. You get great topping portions for the price. You get a ton of interesting flavors you never thought you'd get with a hot dog. I had the hawaiian dog which was packed with pineapple salsa and pork belly. It had a great sweet\/salty balance. The staff was also very friendly and knowledgable. One of the employees was explaining the menu and you could tell he took pride in their food which they should. I'll Definitely be back.
