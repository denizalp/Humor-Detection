First time here! I have been meaning to try this place but every time I walked by it was packed. There isn't a lot of seating in the cafe, it's especially busy on Friday evenings. \n\nI got the Green Tea crepe which was filled with red bean, sponge cake and green tea ice cream. I also tried the Caffe Latte which arrived with really pretty latte art! Both were delicious and enjoyable. The crepe was especially fresh and tasty. \n\nThe service was casual but friendly. Clean washrooms. Prices were OK. I definitely would go back to try the other items on the menu.
