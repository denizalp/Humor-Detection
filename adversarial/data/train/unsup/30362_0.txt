The octopus was full of oil. The lobster pasta had way too much pepper in it. Every bite you took you had to sip it down with water. The fish was over cooked, it felt crispy in your mouth. At 60 per lb I expect way better quality than this. Every other bite had bone in it. Beware of this place. The prices you see on yelp is not what you will get in reality. Overall, this place is a total rip off, you don't get the quality what you pay for. At 300 plus for four people I expect the quality to be top notch. I will never go her again, the waiters look like Bosnian scumbags, trying to sucker you into buying overrated crap. beware!
