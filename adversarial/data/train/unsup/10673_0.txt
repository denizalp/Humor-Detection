This is in my 'hood and I came in really wanting to be WOW'd by the place. But what I didn't expect was a walk down memory lane.\n\nService 101 memory lane.\n\n1) Always greet the customer when they enter the restaurant. Bachi Burger could really embrace the hipness of the restaurant by shouting out \"Hello\" or \"Goodbye\" when people enter and leave the restaurant. Choose a language. Shout a burger name. Something.\nBUT DO NO LEAVE THE CUSTOMER STANDING AT THE DOOR UNSURE OF SEATING THEMSELVES OR WAITING.\n\nWhat's sad is that there weren't *busy* at the time and even the manager who was by the door didn't greet me. He was busy making change for someone at the register. I know y'all can multitask and look up for a split second to smile and say, \"Hello! We'll be right with you!\"\n\n2) Bus the tables, immediately.\nIt's gross to walk into a restaurant when there's a bunch of dirty tables.\nAgain... the restaurant wasn't busy. In fact the waiter told me, \"Whew! we just got through with the busiest night!\"\n\nGreat.\nBut just because I came at the end of the rush doesn't mean I should have to sit in a dining room of dirty glassware and dirty tables. \n\nWhen I was showed to my table, the waiter paused at 2 tables before deciding the 3rd table was the winner. I had to laugh out loud because it seemed so disorganized to me. I think he mistook my laughter and explained the other tables hadn't been wiped down. He was very sweet and the poor guy tried to explain his way out of not greeting me and the dirty tables.\n\nWhat really got me was that the waitstaff physically expressed their tiredness from the rush by leaning on tables, stretching in the dining room and squatting to stretch their legs.\nHey gang. Do that in the kitchen where the customer can't see you.\nBetter yet, get a move on and get the dining room cleaned up.\n\n3) Know the menu.\nI've never been here so when I ask the waiter what do you recommend and you look at me blankly and say the burgers.... you've totally lost points with me. BURGER is in the name of the restaurant. I KNOW the burgers are supposed to be good. But which one? Why? What's in it? What's your favorite? You're the freakin' expert. You got trained, right?\n\n4) Don't sweep the floor in front of me when I'm eating.\nWe're not at McDonald's. \n\n5) Be attentive to your tables and the ones around you. If you're going to help a fellow waiter out, KNOW WHERE THE GUESTS are in their meal. I had a waiter try to take the plates I was eating from three separate times. Really? I'M STILL EATING. You're cute and sweet but go away!\n\nLearn to read the table. You don't have to come ask me every 5 minutes if I'm okay. You can tell if I'm okay by walking by the table and observing. If I make eye contact and LOOK like I need you, THEN come over.\n\n6) Sense of urgency. Yeah, the rush may be over but there's still work to do. Watching a waiter mull around a dining room is unnerving. It's about as fun as walking into a store and watching the shop girls gossip with each other instead of servicing the customer and getting ready for more customers.\n\nFinally... for the food.....\n\nI had the Kurobuta sausage appetizer and the sausages were cooked perfectly with a slightly crisp skin that clicked as your teeth pierced through. I could have used more mustard though. The last 2 sausages were eaten dry because there wasn't any more mustard in the dish.\n\nThe truffle fries were good when the kitchen went heavier on the truffle the second try. \n\nPork belly steam buns were an unusual twist on the peking duck buns. The horseradish sauce was pretty good with it but I particularly liked dipping the sliced boiled egg in it.\n\nWhat was most memorable to me was the cherry yuzu soda. I loved it. It was delicious. I'd come back just for the soda.\n\nThe potential to be great is totally here. Nice people work here. But they need better training. They don't realize they're doing anything wrong.\n\nIf I could see and taste past the service, the food is good. But once a guest has a sour taste in her mouth because of the service, it's hard to get past it.\n\nI know these guys are new and working out the kinks. I really want to love this place so I'll come back in a month or so to see if the service has changed and when I do, I'll update this review.
