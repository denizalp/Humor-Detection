My name is David and I am addicted to sweets. I started my day with a trip to Crepe Shack and still stopped at Sweet Ruby Jane to look at their selection of desserts.\n\nFor a long time I thought that the Southeast was falling behind to Summerlin, but not any more. The growth of unique, affordable, and fun eateries has made it so that I rarely venture up north anymore. \n\nSRJ offers many delectable treats for a reasonable price. Before committing to anything, they offer tastings of the day. The macadamia white fudge is magnificent. They were not pieces of the nut, but actual whole ones mixed into the confection. Since I had eaten my amount of sweets for the day, I had picked up a piece of pumpkin cake ($2.25) and a package of peanut butter cookies ($3) for my parents. I took a bite of the cake while sitting with my mom and it was moist, had the signature taste of fall, and not sickeningly sweet. The cookies were on sale since they were not made that day. A pack of four large cookies were only $3. I felt them and they were still soft. \n\nThey were doing a test run on seasoned roast nuts. The curry one was nice, but needed more spice. The lady behind the counter was very receptive about suggestions. Nice to see people wanting an honest opinion instead of asking and turning a deaf ear.
