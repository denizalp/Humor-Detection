I'm pleased that they have a lot of vegan options, including a tofu scrambled for brunch on the weekends and brunch includes a 10oz beer or a mimosa. They also have about 10-12 different kids of mimosas, which is super dope. They have about 15 of their own brews, and their blonde is really delicious. \n\nThe vegetable pate on the appetizer menu is great, but I was not a fan of the ragu hot pot. It had a weird citrus flavor with the tomato sauce they didn't go well together.\n\nIf you sit at the bar, service is great, but every time I've sat at a table the service is a little slow. \n\nThey don't have sour cream, avocado, or their own salsa but they have Sriracha (they charge $0.50), Tapatio, and Chahula \n\nOverall I enjoy it here and it's a good place to satisfy both vegans and \"normal\" eaters. Definitely prefer it as a brunch place or happy hour spot.
