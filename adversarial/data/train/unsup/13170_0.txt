Entertaining enough for a Vegas show, but nearly naked dancing men isn't really my thing.\n\nWe bought our tickets at the half price ticket booth for an 8pm Sunday night show. The tickets were about $32 and we sat in row G - 7 rows back, but the theater is fairly small so you can still see all the dancers' faces, six packs, back dimples, etc. \n\nThe night we went, Jeff Timmons from the boy band 98 degrees was featured in a show as an emmcee and singer. At some points during the show, i felt like i was at a teeny bopper concert.\n\nIf naked dancing men isn't really your thing, i suggest you un-sober yourself before going.  The show is pretty entertaining and involves a fair amount of audience participation.  I think about 7 or so audience members were pulled onto the stage.\n\nPictures with the cast after the show is $20 per person.  \n\nLook out for Jace. He's the one with the hair and is super hot. Hubba hubba. lol
