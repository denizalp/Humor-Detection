Only when buffets in Vegas are free is when they're good!! Hehe. But no really, I didn't really expect much of this buffet since it's not one of the big ones like Wicked Spoon or whatever the hell people are into these days.\n\nI did think that the food here was better than I had anticipated and a lot better than the other buffets I've been to in Vegas. The crab legs were definitely delicious. Their steak was also pleasing. And tasty. I really liked that at first glance you can see all the food. I guess that's not a good thing for some people cause they're super pigs, but like I said I don't typical enjoy the idea of overly stuffing myself at a buffet, but this buffet was intimate enough that it wasn't overwhelming for me. I did enjoy the food very much and I would come back here.\n\nThe service was grade A too. Our server was always around and attending to our needs whether it be clearing up the empty dishes, or refilling our drinks. She was very attentive. And I liked that.
