Absolutely appalling service. Waited 5 minutes to even have a hostess come and greet us... Were finally seated and had to wait another ten minutes for a server to come to the table to ask about drinks. It was not busy whatsoever. I had time to change my pants in the bathroom. \n\nWe left. Shall not return, ever.
