A decent restaurant in the north Etobicoke area. The food was fine. Their in-store service isn't that good, so home delivery or takeout would be a better option. \n\nWe went for Chana Tikki, Veg Kurma, Tandoori Roti, Amritsari Kulcha Combo and a Gulab Jamun. Chana Tikki and Veg Kurma was good. Tandoori Roti could have been a little better as it was burnt at many places, especially around the edges. Amritsari Kulcha Combo was good, and so was Gulab Jamun. The food, overall, is fine but no wow factor. We also had a chai once we went to their restaurant, but it wasn't really good - had to leave it there itself. \n\nThe ambiance is very restauranty. They have a decent seating capacity with about 6-7 booths. However, the cheap Punjabi pop music playing on the TV and a gigantic mood killer. The service was a little slow. The second time, when we ordered, we went for home delivery instead of dine-in. \nThere is a limited parking outside the restaurant but the plaza adjacent to it has a large parking, so that can be an option as well. \n\nOverall, I would avoid going to this place - but still a decent option for takeout or home delivery.
