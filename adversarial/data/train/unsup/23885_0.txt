I love this club!  My girlfriends and I went here on a Sunday night, and after a disappointing Saturday at Tao, we were eager to make up for it.  Body English did not disappoint.  Awesome music, not too crowded, friendly people, strong drinks.\n\nSo, how do you have a good time at one of these clubs?\n1) Be a girl.  \n1a) Be a cute girl traveling with a pack of female friends.\n2) Dress UP - ladies, that means heels and fun dresses\n3) Get on the guest list.  We got on the list through a contact at one of the stores at the Forum Shops (seriously, ask around while you're shopping...club promoters drop passes off to those stores all the time.  In our case, a bartender at Body English has a girlfriend who works at one of the Forum shops, so we were able to contact him directly.)\n4) Get there early and stand as close to the bouncers as possible.  After waiting in line for perhaps 10 minutes we were approached by the man with The List.  We were polite, smiled, and soon the velvet rope was lifted.  We were in, along with free passes and some drink tickets!\n5) Use your free drink passes at the bar, and order something strong.  Even though it's free, be classy and tip the bartender anyway.\n6) Hang out near the VIP area.  Make some friends.  Get invited to sit down.\n\nYou now have a place to sit during the evening, and free drinks.  Be nice to the guys who have invited you to their table, but don't feel obligated to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.  Now go out on the dance floor and have some fun!
