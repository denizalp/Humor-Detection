I have been looking for a super clean Lexus LX 470. I find one at a Mercedes dealer? Go figure. The vehicle was advertised factually, I asked that a couple of minor cosmetic issues be fixed and they were. Lou Gordon handled all paperwork with style & grace.  The car arrived with a full tank of gas, all promises kept. Mark me down in the 'very happy' category.
