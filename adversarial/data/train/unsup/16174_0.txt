I really wish I could give this local bar more stars :( \n\nWe walked in around 7pm on a Friday night.. It took us over 10 minutes to be acknowledged or given a menu. The bright side is that our server acknowledged our wait and treated us to our first round (thank you- you're the reason there's 2 stars up there!!) Our server was blonde with dreds in a ponytail- she was very polite and tried to connect with us! However, she was one of 2 servers holding down about 14 tables in the small bar. We had mozzarella sticks that were closer to room temperature when we received them, but they were lightly battered, which I appreciate. I ordered a club sandwich and my husband had Whitney wings. He said they were pretty good, but we both agreed they can't touch Zipps Golden Medium (this bar offers honey hot wings, but our server politely warned me they are hot!) I had asked for avocado on my sandwich (I saw our server write it down!) There was no avocado on my sammich, though. It was a standard sandwich, not memorable although the ham and turkey were thick, fresh cuts. While the wait for a menu was long, the wait for the check was (is?) even longer. I've had time to write this whole review, hear the table next to us order drinks.... Receive drinks... Order dinner... I might just walk up to the bar to ask to pay. \n\nTL;DR: long waits, short staffed, mediocre food, kind servers, decent atmosphere- not worth the first round free and I STILL don't know whether we were charged for the avocado. :(. Sorry Whitney, I wish this could've been a good one.\n\nUpdate: our server was genuine and apologetic - she deeply discounted our tab to make up for waits. We were charged for the avocado but she more than removed the $0.75 charge. I'm sorry I didn't catch your name, blonde server, but it's because you cared that we will give this place a shot again!
