I am extremely impressed after my visit today! I was concerned after moving to Rock Hill that the closest cat-only vet was in Ballantyne. After a personal recommendation, I decided to try Catawba. \n\nEveryone that I interacted with was incredibly courteous and understanding. My typically anxious cat was visibly more relaxed than I expected him to be. Our room had a cat tree and soothing bird noises, which my little guy loved. \n\nI also appreciated that even though my kitty is a new patient, they used the information my previous vet had and they did not make me go through the process of redoing x-rays (a huge money saver).\n\nThanks, Catawba Animal Clinic for a great experience and fair pricing! Bruce and I appreciate it.
