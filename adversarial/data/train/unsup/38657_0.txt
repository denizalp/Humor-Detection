I think this place is great! After calling around for different prices at different places Tirecraft had the best prices and on top of that the manager suggested some tires for my car and they are excellent. Nice to drive on. \n\nWhen I first went to get my new tires put on they told me it would take about an hour. It actually took quite a bit longer than that because they for some reason ordered the wrong size for my car. I thought that was strange since I gave him the exact reading for my car. But anyway, after it was all done and I went to pay, it turned out to be less than he quoted me on the phone! Maybe that was because I had to wait extra long. In addition to that, because I bought my tires there I get free tire rotations when I need to get my winter tires put on and then back to all-seasons. Plus, free tire repairs if I get a hole or a leak in one of my tires. I was quite happy with that!!\n\nRecently I needed basic maintenance on my car so I took it there for a belt change and air filter change. They did the job for a reasonable price. It did take longer than it should have because for some reason again, they ordered the wrong belt for my car. They had to drive to the other side of town to get the right one. Good thing I live in walking distance so I waited in the comfort of my home. \n\nSince my first visit having to wait there so long I now just drop my car off and leave right away and either walk to Chinook mall or home, which is better 'cause I usually have time to bake cookies or something while I wait. haha  For that reason, living so close makes it very convenient. And I like that they're are open on Saturday.\n\nI think it's better if you call before you go there and get quotes and such instead of just doing a walk-in or should I say drive-in.\n\nI've been happy with my service at Tirecraft despite the occasional longer wait time.
