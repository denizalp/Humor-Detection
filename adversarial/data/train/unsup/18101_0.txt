Okay, so here's my initial review.... You can't ask for more from this place on multiple levels!!!\n\nWe are from out of state (California) and wanted to have the best of the best for my boyfriends FIRST TATTOO! After much research, we decided on Skin Design Tattoo!!! I initially spoke with Ileana and then Michelle. Both were prompt and considerate of our requests and accommodated our timeline. We corresponded over multiple emails until finally coming to the store and being able to put a face to the names... \n\nLet me say, they were as nice (if not nicer and more professional) than I had envisioned via our technology based interactions. And as they promised they paired us up with the perfect artist (Derek) for our tattoo idea! The shop was immaculate and designed to showcase their artistic abilities and accolades. \n\nDerek was so amazing working with us through the design and the alteration of it! We we still trying to get it to perfection and Derek (& Michelle) were so understanding. They let us take our time and EVEN reschedule for our next visit in April! \n\nWOW, thanks Derek!!!\n\nYou truly allowed us to go through this with such professionalism! We will recommend Skin Design Tattoo to everyone we know! \n\nCan't wait to see you again next month!!!\n\nTHANK YOU AGAIN DEREK AND MICHELLE!!!
