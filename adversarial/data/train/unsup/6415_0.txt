The coolest Taco Bell ever! Located in front of the cosmopolitan, near many night clubs and fun attractions! \n\nItems ordered: 2 Doritos locos tacos, and a jack and coke slurpee! \n\nThis Taco Bell is hip and just so cool! It's has an outdoor patio with great views! The atmosphere is different than any other Taco Bell. Since it's considered a Catina they have alcoholic beverages available. They even carry some fun Taco Bell clothing items! \n\nOverall, fun experience. The slurpee with alcohol was $20! Worth it in vegas!
