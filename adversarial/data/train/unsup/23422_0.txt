Came to Yu-Yu for a get together dinner with the LV Yelp family... In our group, there were 11 of us, but the resto could easily accommodate a group of 20 max. \n\nFOOD:  Panko-breaded skewers... Shiitake mushrooms, King Oyster mushroom, Curry beef tongue, Tiger shrimp, Squid, Bacon-wrapped mochi, Quail egg, Zucchini, Potato Yam, Asparagus, Broccoli, Okra, Gingko nuts.\n\nTASTE: *** [Wasn't too impressed... Every skewer practically looks the same... and after a while, everything started to taste the same.  Guess I was most impressed with the Shiitake skewers... guess that ain't sayin' much.  The bacon-wrapped mochi didn't seem very \"bacon\" at all.  I had to ask if there was any bacon in it, they said just a hint.  :-|  I also enjoyed the complimentary curry salt, chili powder, & raw cabbage palate cleanser.  The daikon ponzu sauce was okay, I preferred the House sauce best.\n\nDRINKS: Currently working on alcohol license. \nCONVENIENCE: **** [Located in the Chinatown plaza, ample parking.]\nAMBIANCE: **** [Well ventilated, enjoyed the memory foam seating, resto accommodates large groups.]\nSERVICE: *** [Friendly, decent service... no problems splitting check among group.]\nPRICE:  $$ [Skewers range from $1-3 each, can easily add up.]\nOVERALL: ***\/* [3.5 stars... they offer a wide variety to choose from, but after a while of consuming the panko breaded skewers, it really started to taste the same.  Not too impressed, but at least good for groups.]\n\nNuff said.\n\n[#19 of 100 YELP CHALLENGE 2013]
