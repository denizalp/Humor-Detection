When people say Korean food, what do you think?  KimChi?  Galbi?  Rice?  Really hot food?\n\nWell, something I feel is that Korean's are the king of amazing stews and soup - or JiGaes, Tangs, and Guks.  We have KimChiJiGae, GalbiTang, SulLungTang, MeYahkGuk, DdukGuk, GamJaTang (yes this is the Pork Bone Soup), and the list goes on forever!  For those who don't know what I listed off - read some reviews and go try them!\n\nBesides Pork Bone Soup, which is funny because Koreans call it Potato Stew, the other popular stew is the SoonDubuJiGae.  The spicy tofu stew.\n\nBCDST is a very well known place for the tofu stew.  They are also known for their DorSotBiBimBap (mixed veg\/meat with rice in a hot stone bowl), but the stew is king here.\n\nThere are a few locations sprinkled around in Toronto and the GTA.  I usually frequent the one at Yonge and Finch but today, I found myself in Hurricane Hazel's backyard.  Wanting some stew, decided to give this location a try.\n\nThe storefront of the place is on Hurontario, however, the parking is north of the restaurant.  Unlike Yonge and Finch, the parking is free - bonus!\n\nUpon entry to the establishment, we are promptly greeted and offered various seating choices.  The one detraction is having messy tables while seating people nearby.  Nobody wants to sit next to someone's garbage.  The menu is the same, but I think the prices are a bit higher than North York - around a buck per dish.  Not earth shattering.\n\nI have to say, I like the food here better than North York.  I ordered the HaeMul (Seafood) SoonDubu.  The broth is so important.  It was richer and heartier than their central location.  Usually, half way through the meal, the stew starts to cool and the soup loses it's consistency and flavour.  Not here though.  Really enjoyed it.\n\nFinished up with the NooRoonBap (the burnt rice that is softened with water in the stone bowl.). Yum!  A good meal was had by all - even though I burnt the mouth again!  Oh well.\n\nCheers!
