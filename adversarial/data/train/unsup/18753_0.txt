In A Nutshell:\n\n-The Club at LAS in Terminal 1 is very tiny.\n-Here you'll find a small bar (which is great), some snacks (instant noodles\/chips\/bananas) & two small lounge areas.\n-There is no bathroom, so you'll have to use the terminal bathrooms.\n\nOverall, the highlight are the free drinks & a place to hide from the busy terminal.  Better than nothing!
