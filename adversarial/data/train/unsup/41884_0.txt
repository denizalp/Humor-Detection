Took a look at the menu, and thought \"this should be good\" We ordered the open-faced prime rib sandwich and the California chicken sandwich. The prime rib (requested medium) was way over cooked and very tough, it was cold in the middle and burnt on top.  The sweet potato fries were just Ok, nothing to brag about.  The chicken in the chicken sandwich was also over cooked.  Even though Coleslaw was ordered with the chicken sandwich, it came with French fries and no slaw.  The fries were interesting, if you like the taste of fish. Not sure if they had not changed the frying oil, or were really cooking fish in it.\n\nAlso had ice tea which had a bitter taste from either inferior tea, or letting it steep to long.  In either case, not pleasant to drink.
