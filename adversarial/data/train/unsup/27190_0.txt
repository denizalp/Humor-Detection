This place is great!  Discovered it a few months ago on Yelp and been going here ever since. The staff is wonderful and a joy to work with while you decide what you want. So many decisions!  And try the Tatz - Customizable nail art in seconds! The owner, Diana, designed her store and it has a wonderful ambience.
