Not much to say, if you know about Tesla's you know this is not a typical \"car dealership\".\n\nService center:\nTools in the service center? A lift and a computer, that's all you need.\n\nShowroom:\nYou order you car, that's it. I'm sure they will let you test drive but don't fool around just for fun. If your serious about the car test drive one. Most first \"sighting\" was at CES two years ago. \n\nSometimes (very rarely) will you be able to get your hands on an orphan. Otherwise your car is delivered to the address of your choice (home, office, etc). I guess they could do a big ceremony for you to take delivery of your car at the dealership because now that Vegas has this location...it's a new choice.\n\nGet one, you will not regret it. \n\n(And I can't wait for the X!)
