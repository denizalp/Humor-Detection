GO POZOLE - GO POZOLE - GO POZOLE, GO!!!!!!\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nThey have pozole here! And it's delicious. It's the first place I've seen it on a menu in Toronto. Pozole is a spicy stew with pulled pork meat simmered with dried maiz (which looks like giant kernels of corn). It comes with some round crispy tortillas, lettuce, veggies, extra spices and dried herbs that you add to the stew and mix in.\n\nThe Yelp party of 7 I was with stuck mostly to the tacos here, which looked okay but I'm glad I tried the pozole.\n\nI would go back here if it wasn't located in the middle of nowhere. (Rogers Road, wha?!??!)\n\nGreat service and you can watch tele-novelas on the big screen and listen to authentic Mexican tunes. Decor basic but functional. \n\nQue bueno
