This is a review for the 3rd floor venue, not the shop or restaurant.\n\nI have been here a couple of times and it's great.  The 3rd floor hosts many concerts\/shows and is very intimate.  If you don't like large venues, this is a great spot.  There is a large bar just as you enter, with plenty of seating and a large patio, overlooking the Strip.\n\nThe staff is friendly and prices aren't horrible.  My only knock is that this place is obviously marketed towards tourists, based on it's location alone.  They don't really have their own parking, so if you are a local and going to a show, you could park at the Showcase Theater garage, or across the street at Monte Carlo.  Even the MGM garage isn't too far of a walk, but none are particularly convenient.\n\nAnyhow, I've seen a couple of shows on my radar, so hopefully I will stop in again soon.
