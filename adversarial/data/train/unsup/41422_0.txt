Hubby is originally from Southern California and absolutely loves Fatburger and since there aren't any close to where we live in the Bay he had to visit Fatburger on the strip while we were in Vegas. \n\nWhen we entered we noticed how small the space is and how you just know it is not clean. \n\nMt husband ordered a fat king burger with egg and since I was not hungry I decided not to place an order. \n\nThere was not very many people in the restaurant but it did take a little while for the food because the food is made to order. \n\nWhile we were waiting we met a very nice lady from Utah who was with her family. \n\nIt is the typical fast food burger joint that has a lot a kids working. \n\n3 stars because my husband's burger was pretty good and typical of Fatburger. \n\nI bet we will be back when we visit Vegas again.
