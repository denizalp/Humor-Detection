I took Geology, Communications, and Italian last Spring 2012 semester all here at the Henderson campus. The whole campus is tiny, composed of three major buildings. All my classes where in the main building so it was convenient. Parking is the only thing I have no complaint about, I never had a problem finding a decent spot close to the building. Like many others have expressed, YES! This place does not feel like a higher education institute. It is full of kids that I could go to jail for (underage). I guess a lot of them come from the high school next door who are taking post secondary courses. Whatever the reason is, I think 89% of the student population is under 21 and behave like under 10!\n\nThe teachers I had were excellent! Very enthusiastic, knowledgeable and they were very interactively fun. I enjoyed the small classes compared to UNLV but hated the fact that almost nothing transfers from out of state schools. The Academic Counselors are rude and they don't care to help you out much, all they want is your money. \n\nI doubt I'll ever take classes here again, unless UNLV needs me to retake any of my general education, core classes. I forgot to mention that the computer lab is actually pretty nice. All the computers are fairly new and there's tons of them available all the time.
