So far this is a incredibly tranquil and friendly experience. However I will review as I go. I've ordered a combination plate and have chosen the crab cakes and zucchini wraps with extra artichoke and spinach hummus. .....I am awaiting the arrival of the order and am excited.   Ok so my food has come and it's freaking delicious... End of review..5 stars for this place. Hope it sticks around!!
