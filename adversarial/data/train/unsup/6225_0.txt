Ok, I'm going to preface this by saying I'm now in a Marshalls 12-Step program as I can no longer realistically expect to  go into this store and not walk out with something, usually 3 or 4 things actually.\n\nThe prices and selection are phenomenal...now I'm a Marshalls fan from way back.  I know they're owned by TJX (Winners, etc) and the concept is the same - you have to search for what you're looking for and there are some great finds, but the brands are higher end and I've always managed to find a good deal.  Their shoe section alone is unbelievable..even for a budding Imelda Marcos such as myself.\n\nThe store is well organised and I find it very easy to locate what I'm looking for.  Their toy section isn't huge, but let's face it, since I don't shop for toys, I couldn't possibly care less.\n\nLove their home department, cute quirky chairs and lamps, one of kind items to give your personal space a little character...it's small, but it'll do.\n\nPrices are reasonable...on a recent visit I purchased 2 dresses and a cute summer top (all brand names) for less than 1\/2 the price I spent on another dress I purchased somewhere else 2 days earlier...that's pretty darned good.\n\nI've visited the smaller Marshalls on John Street, but I much prefer this one.
