When judging  Chinese restaurant, you can't use the American standard to judge.  Well, by all means, the environment, hygiene and service.  All these 3 elements costed 2 stars deducted.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food here is worth 4 stars! \n\nMy fav was the radish pancake with egg, it was delicious.  Everything else was authentic but not the best.  Beef stew noodles was yummy but the noodles was kinda soggy.  Leek & egg pancake was good.  The oyster pancake sauce was way too sweet and the oyster was disgusting.  Salty soybean milk tasted a little funny with the pickles.  Simmered beef shank\/ tendon\/ tofu in chili sauce was good.\n\nMy mom and my picky husband didn't wanna go back because it wasn't nice and clean.  Haha! But i will go back for the radish pancake!
