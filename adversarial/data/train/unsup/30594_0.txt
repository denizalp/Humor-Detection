A true five star gem for any history buff. Beside the outside beauty of the statues and architecture, the inside is also well worth the tour. The bronze murals,glass work, floor and thousands of names carved on the inside walls are very moving. The staff provided some unique insights to the history and recent restoration work. Highly suggest you head inside rather than just touring the outside.
