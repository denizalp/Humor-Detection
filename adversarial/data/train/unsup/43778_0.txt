I had originally posted this in Ellis Island; my mistake.\nI went on Tuesday for their tacos and tequila for $5 special.  The place is located inside the Ellis Island casino; and I do mean inside.  It's a small take out taco bar.\nThe tacos were okay; but you had to go to the bar for the tequila.  Not a relaxing meal.  $5 is fine, but I would not be\nBack.  Sorry just not worth it to me.
