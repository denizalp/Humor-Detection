I'll be honest and say I'm probably giving them an extra star just for having a SUPER cute asian boy working the counter. The ladies need their eye candy too, and I was quite impressed! :} He could've passed as a pop-idol or something, fo' realz ladies!\n\nWalking in, the menu is pretty small and could be a little confusing. I looked for a minute then decided on an iced caramel coffee with added boba. I found the boba on the softer side, almost gooey, and there were a whole lot of them left when I finished my beverage [1\/4-1\/3rd of the cup?]. The combination wasn't as delicious as I had hoped, but the coffee had a good flavor [slightly bitter, earthy notes complimenting a lightly-sweet caramel background]. I think the combination of coffee and boba was just incongruous to me, so next time I'll try a fruity flavor instead or green tea for the win. \n\nThey have a cute little chalk menu listing daily specials or a new menu, as well as having soups and pastries available on top of the frozen treats.  There's a small area for hanging out in, but it's pretty minimal. I opted to take my drink to go but a couple was enjoying the space while I dropped in.\n\nIt seems like it's a good addition to the overall Greenland space, so I'm glad it's there. The coffee itself isn't ridiculously outstanding when it comes to higher-standard brew [free-trade, organic, sustainable, shade-grown, etc] but it's not bad, either. \n\nTheir pastries looked yummy! And the shaved ice sounds great! I'll be back some time.
