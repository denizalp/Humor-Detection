If you are looking for a place to get your hair done, this is it: ask for Adriana. To see her amazing color work, find her on IG (@adrixherz). Text her to book an appointment about two weeks before you need to go in, she books up fast and has a packed schedule. I was lucky that she could see me so quickly!\n\nI was thrilled with Adriana's work- she spoke with me about what I wanted, then described some ideas for what to do, and executed them well. She was friendly and easy to talk to throughout my visit, and styled it and took photos before I left. She even gave me a little lesson on how to use a curling iron, a tool that has baffled me for years. Adriana transformed my brassy, single-color blonde (with messy, dark roots) to a complex, natural-looking shade with browns and reds that will grow out in a more flattering way.\n\nThe salon itself is tucked into a shopping center next to a Mexican restaurant, and inside is bustling. Hair and nail services are done here, and there's a relaxed and upbeat atmosphere. Though I only worked with one stylist, I saw lots of great cuts and colors as I sat in the chair. This isn't a girls-only zone either, men were getting cuts and they also carry a line of men's beard grooming supplies!\n\nEDIT 09\/2017: Adriana is now at My Salon Suites in Henderson.
