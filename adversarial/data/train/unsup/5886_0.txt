Went in for lunch, should've just kept driving. The restaurant is so dirty that I am considering calling the health department. The  floor, the walls, tables, chairs haven't been cleaned in a long time. The pizza came out luke warm, which is a mystery if it just came out of a 500 degree oven. No napkins or silverware were brought out, even the plates seemed dingy. \n\nWon't be back.
