Second time here, and they have not disappointed!  Excellent choices for all the phases of your buffet gorge-fest.    Shrimp is hit or miss.\n\nDesserts are less than the Wynn, but overall pretty good, and always fresh.  \n\nSalad bar seems to be a vast desert with no takers, they could easily reduce this and put in another meat station...\n\nIt's pricey for dinner, but they've got crab legs by the crateful, so it's worth it.\n\nYes, I'll be back.  Again.
