I go to this location from time to time because I'm a Black card member. I gave this place 4 stars because they don't have any kettle bells for weight training and some of the cardio machine don't work. Staff members are nice and pleasant nothing more you could say. Environment is clean most of the people here wipe the equipment after using it. Wifi is good even better on non peak hours. Restroom\/lockers for the most part are clean, never had any issues with the lockers being full. I haven't tried the tanning bed or massage chairs yet, so I'll update this review. \n\nIMO: this place is suited for people who are starting out in their body transformation journey. I'm already planning to jump to LVAC next year after my membership is done because the max dumbell they carry is 80 lbs (total 160 lbs for two dumbells). \n\nTip: If you plan on working out avoid this gym from 6pm - 10 pm Mon - Thurs it gets really busy... Unless you want to share a machine or workout next to someone sweating :(
