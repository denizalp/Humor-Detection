We enjoyed good food and good service at Culinary Dropout, but wished they could invest is some lights so you could read the menu!  We, and every table around us, used their phone to read the menu.  This level of darkness at a restaurant is ridiculous.  \n\nOn to the food.  Everything was delicious! \n\nStarters: Soft pretzels w\/ provolone fondue $12.  OMG, this creamy, velvety fondue is one of the best liquid cheese creations I have ever had.  I could eat it everyday.\nCheap House Salad $6.  This was just okay.  No taste complaints, but the 'buttermilk ranch' was not really evident.\n\nDrinks: Between You & Me: Belvedere, grapefruit, cranberry, and lemon.  Very refreshing and a little tarte.  Enjoyed.  The BF had a beer on tap- can't remember which, but it was nice and cold the way he likes his beer.\n\nMain course: Ma...the Meatloaf!?! $18. Served with green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy.  This one took me back to grade school.  I could have sworn that my grandmother was back there making this meal.  If you want 'comfort food' with a homemade taste, this is the dish for you.  \n\nFried Chicken $22 served with mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw, and a buttermilk biscuit.  Really good chicken.  Super crispy golden exterior, juicy flavorful chicken inside.  Same tasty potatoes, and the cole slaw was a bit bland.\n\nDesserts: Bourbon Black Bottom Pie $7 and Salted Caramel Custard $8.  The pie and the custard were both too rich for us, but the salted caramel corn that comes on top of the custard was like crack!  We could have eaten a movie theater bucket of that stuff!
