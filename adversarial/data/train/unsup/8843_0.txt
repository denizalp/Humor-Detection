It does not get more authentic than this!!! Delicious Greek food and great service! Would recommend this place to everyone looking for great food in a quiet and inviting restaurant! But the overall shining plus about this place is QUALITY! In its food, environment, service, and its owners! Hard to find so I'm happy to have found this gem that puts quality first!!! \n\nTry the Spanakotiropita to begin with! Difficult to pronounce but AMAZING!!!
