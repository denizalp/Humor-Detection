I loved everything about my service experience with Shults Ford in Harmarville!  One of the dreaded dashboard lights came on in my vehicle a few weeks ago and instead of trekking to my usual dealership in Greensburg, I decided to check out Shults Ford because of its proximity to my office.  I was able to easily schedule a service appointment online and they even have a courtesy shuttle that got me to and from work that day!  \n\nEveryone I came in contact with here was simply spectacular. From the gentleman who held the door for me, to the shuttle driver (Jim rocks!), to Brian who handled my service, to Alan who walked me to my car when it was ready.  Top notch service all around.\n\nShults made me feel beyond comfortable and I am one happy customer.  Even when my service visit had to be extended to a second day, they were accommodating to me and my schedule, not the other way around.  I cant recommend this place enough.  It will be a while til I am in the market for a new vehicle, but in the meantime at least I know I have an outstanding option for service so close to my office!
