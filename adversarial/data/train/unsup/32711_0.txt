I got put on to this hole in the wall. My first time entering it was super sketchy because it's like, underground. But now I can't stop coming here. They make exactly what you ask for right in front of your eyes and it's quick. I think 8 slices for $5. You cannot beat that!!! I hope they never shut down. Friendly, fairly clean, and fairly priced.
