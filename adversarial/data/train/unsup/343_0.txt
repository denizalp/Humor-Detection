Well I am so glad this establishment is open 24 hrs because I can order a Nutella tiramisu whenever I want. It is a bit more on the pricier side but I spend just as much at Brew Tea Bar. I mean it depends how much you like coffee but I'm more of a tea drinker so I'm more hesitant to spend when I come here.\nI always come in the early morning so it's either incredibly full and busy or it's empty. The service is pretty spot on but that's because I see the same barista for the early morning shift :-) \nHe's very nice and super quick so I never wait too long for my drink. \nNow for the drinks, they're pretty good. I recall ordering a red velvet latte once and then I stuck to a mint mocha afterwards. Both are delicious drinks and I do also recommend trying out the other desserts. They have vegan desserts and the drinks can be substituted with soy or almond milk! \nThere's plenty of seating inside and outside and the decor is majestic, very. \nYou really can't go wrong with doing homework here either. Overall I'd still come here to hang out with friends, do homework, or eat my tiramisu by myself.
