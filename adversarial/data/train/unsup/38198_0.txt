Who says you have to wait for summer to have ice cream as a treat?\n\nFriendly staff and delicious ice cream make for a winning combination. You can either use the drive thru or walk up to the window to order. This is THE place for cool treats. \n\nIt had been some time since we had visited and we were craving a brownie sundae. We decided to share and save up our holiday calorie allotment. Score! The sundae was the size of an adult's Head! A warm brownies was topped with two scoops of great ice cream in your choice of flavors topped with fluffy whip cream and a cherry. \n\nDefinitely a cool spot for cool treats.
