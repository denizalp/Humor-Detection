This is one of the better hotels I've stayed at in Las Vegas. Take this review with a grain of salt, because I've stayed at alot of craptacular hotels especially in my younger days. I'm talking Rodeway Inn, Hooters, Riviera, Circus Circus. I thought I was bout dat life when I was in my twenties.Thought I was doing it big. ha.\n\nAria is a modern hotel with really awesome conveniences that one would expect at this price point. I believe they were charging $450 the night we stayed. When the wifey and I walked in we were greeted with a spacious room, modern decor, a mandigo sized bed and views of the strip that were gnar. Everything in the place was  controlled by a tablet  that allowed you to open and close the blackout curtains, dim the lights. Very convenient. Very pimp. Very Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\n\nThe lobby and checkin is like Lindsey Lohan. A hot mess. However, once you get through that painful line it is all good in the hood.\n\nI really can't see myself staying at a hooters or circus circus again. I can't.
