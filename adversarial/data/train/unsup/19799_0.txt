Checked out this boutique spin studio on a recent weekend using their $10 first-time-rider promo. Cyclone is located inside Inferno Hot Pilates, and the businesses share a lobby\/locker room space. \n\nPROS: \nThe black light lighting in the cycle studio is a cool touch, and I like how the first two rows of bikes aren't tiered. The bathrooms are nice, with toiletries and showers. The instructor was enthusiastic and motivating, and most of the class was obviously regulars. They seem to have a great culture here, with positive attitudes and a variety of ages, races, and body types. This place felt a lot more comfortable than some of the other boutique studios in Henderson and Summerlin!\n\nCONS: \nThe staff weren't particularly helpful for this first time visitor. I had to ask about shoes, towels, etc. rather than being informed. The bikes themselves are basic without a computer display to view your resistance, distance, etc. and there are no visuals. Note that they charge for shoe rental ($3), and their cancellation\/no-show fee is one of the highest in town ($20). Package prices are more competitive than their monthly rate. \n\nIf you live in the area, it's a good spot to spin. There are a lot of breakfast\/brunch restos across the street at the Gramercy- makes a fun option to meet up with friends afterward, and perhaps partnering with one of them will help drive in more traffic, as the location is a bit difficult to find.
