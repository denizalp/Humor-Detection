Sun Valley Stereo was awesome!  My stereo went out and according to the car dealership the solution was a $300 repair!  I  found Sun Valley through Yelp and they squeezed me in the very next day.  Turns out all I needed was a new cable which they replaced and charged me $15 dollars for!  No labor. No charge to figure out what was wrong and the people there were SUPER nice.  They had me in and out in less than half an hour.  If you have any audio or alarm needs, I would strongly recommend visiting them first!
