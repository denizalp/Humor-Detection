Wow, so this is quite the place on a weekday night!   Lots of TV'S all around the joint!\nYou won't miss a thing. The girls are all nice looking to say the least. Super skimpy outfits.\nI think it is a lot better than Hooters, The food is so so but, not horrilbe. Give it a try,it is for sure something very different.
