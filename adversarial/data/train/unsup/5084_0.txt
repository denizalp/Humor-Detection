If I could give less than 1 star I would!!\nThis is very disappointing since I stayed hear 5 years ago and it still has our favorite Italian restaurant.\n\nI paid full price for a fountain facing suite for 5 days.\nOn arrival they have us smallish room facing the freeway, they're moved us to another suite, still not fountain facing but pool facing and a little better.guji\nM\nThe room seemed a little hot so they said they would loom into it.\nWe went to the pool which was plain nasty and slimy could go in the water \nWhen we can back the room seamed a little hot again so we dressed and asked that they please to have the ac checked.\n\nWe returned from a great night at about 1 am and tried to open the door it didn't work \nMy wife's card also did not !\nWe had to call security to have the room opened ... When we entered the room was now really hot , son was I I had enough \n\nI called and spoke to a manager who said the following when I complained about the door in addition to the AC not working \n\n\"It is our policy to lock you out the room so you would call the front desk so we could inform you that the AC was still not working \"\nReally .... How about a note on the door?\n\nWell this now made for out 3rd move in the middle of the night somewhat tired after a night on the town.\n\nNothing like packing your bags for fun at 2 am !\n\nIn the morning when called the day manager new nothing about the night mare experience but did comp the room that night and offered to upgrade us ...... Mins you back to what we has originally booked.\n\nThey said it would take 30 minutes ....\nAfter an hour I called the Wynn and booked into another suite packed my bags again and on the way out the door 2 hours later the Belagio phone rang to let me know 4 th room was ready ...........No thanks I have moved out !!!!!!!\n\nHad a great stay at the Wynn won money and enjoyed the next 4 nights \n\nAbout to give the Wynn 5 stars in my next review
