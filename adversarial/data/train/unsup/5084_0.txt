I was touring Pittsburgh and I was craving Mexican so I picked this restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square area in Downtown. The food was just ok. I was not impressed with the food at all. The guacamole dip did not taste like what a guacamole is supposed to taste like. Ditto for the 4 cheese enchiladas with the side of rice and beans. \nIf you are ever in the Pittsburgh area, I suggest another type of cuisine and do thorough research before choosing a place to dine anywhere in the Steel City.
