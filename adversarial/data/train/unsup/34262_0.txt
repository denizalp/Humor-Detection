They have the more advance cooking plates for kbbq.  Pretty cool. Only disappointing thing for me was my dinner party didn't get to do the cooking ourselves whereas other diners got to.  The server kept cooking for us, which us weird as I'm used to going kbbq and found it all by ourselves. It's a more fun dining experience that way.  Could it be because I brought two Caucasians to try kbbq for the first time? Hmmm.....  \n\nThe food was not bad but I'd prefer other places for kbbq.
