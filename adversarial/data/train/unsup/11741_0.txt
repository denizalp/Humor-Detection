This was my 2nd visit to RE. Both times I got take out. I will have to dine in one of these days for their Mon\/Tues night special. \n\nTheir empanadas are really tasty! I like that they are crispy fried rather than soft baked. I bought 6 to share with the BF; 5 savory ones and one sweet. We had: El Capitan, Boricua, Pernil (pork), Chicken, Chicken & Mushrooms and the Caramel Fig one for dessert. My favorites were the chicken and pork. I didn't really care for the more complex ones. The caramel figs one was pretty good also. I think I would've preferred lesser caramel to taste more of the figs but I might be in the minority with this. \n\nI have to say though what makes these empanadas over the top is that delicious green sauce that comes with them. Don't forget to ask for extra!
