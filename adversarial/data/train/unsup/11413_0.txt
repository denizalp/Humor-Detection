This is the perfect place to end your night. Delicious, greasy pizza, YAS!\nEvel pie has a variety of pizza- if you love pork and bacon, they've got a pizza with bacon for you. They even have pizza with snake meat!!\nI had pizza with some sort of meat, sorry I don't remember exactly what pizza I ate as I came here to end the night. The pizza was delicious.
