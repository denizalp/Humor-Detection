I have been eating McDonald's since I was a child. I was recently super happy McDonald's began serving Breakfast all day. However I was greatly disturbed on my last visit. \n\n\nI ordered Hotcakes, as I normally do. When they arrived, the Styrofoam plate was melted on the outside and the pancakes were melted into the plastic. I am not a scientist but I know cooking food on Styrofoam is extremely unhealthy. \n\nI was in disbelief, so I ordered another Hotcakes and watched to see how they were cooked. \nWhat I saw made me sick, They would just plop 3 pancakes on the Styrofoam and them microwave the hotcakes right on the Styrofoam plate. Melting the Hotcakes into the plate.\n\nI am still amazed by this. I wonder if this is McDonald's protocol, or the employee just being lazy. Anyways Eating McDonald's may be more carcinogenic than it appears ( which is bad) \n\nGo to McDonald's and watch them melt your food into Styrofoam!! Sounds Yummy?
