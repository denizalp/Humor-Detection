Ales & Tereza are absolutely amazing!  Thank you so much for taking care of my car and it's major service recently. This will be my new German auto shop from now on for sure. Great customer service, extremely knowledgeable & listens to all client needs. Hourly rate is legit. Las Vegas audi owners really needed a shop like this. OH!!!! can't forget about their custom dyno tunes. Yes they have a AWD DYNO!!!!!! Yes it's a one stop shop! \n\nI'm thrilled to get my S7 tune by Ales. Keep up the great work you two. You guys are On the way to the top! Highly recommended shop in Vegas. \n\n#VegasAudis Out
