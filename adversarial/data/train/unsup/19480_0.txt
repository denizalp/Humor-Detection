Dr. Hardison accidentally left a pin in my wife's knee during surgery! Now, she'll probably have to have a 2nd surgery to remove it. My wife will have to be out of work, again because of Hardison's mistake. \nHardison has a poor bedside manner. He is arrogant, condescending & usually in a bad mood. He's never on time for appointments. His staff isn't too bad...if you can get through on the phone. It may not be in your best interest to make an appointment with him, unless you're willing to wait, or take his attitude.
