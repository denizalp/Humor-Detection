This is just for the to-go slices, since our group wanted to hurry and eat and return to the casino.\n\nWhile not cheap, this is one of the less expensive places to grab a quick bite. My friend had tried the Godfather, which was a meat pizza and encouraged me to get that. However, I couldn't resist the mushroomy goodness of the fromage. It tasted every bit as delicious as it looked, and those slices are huge! Definitely a good place to visit if you want something yummy fast.
