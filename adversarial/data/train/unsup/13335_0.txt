Sorry DOG. This used to be the spot for a great Chicago dog or a slider or an Italian beef or sausage. Back when Louie and Eddie a couple a wise guys from Chicago actually owned the joint! \n\nThe new owner is a tool! It reflects in the crappy food. This jag off is a whiner too. I'd like to smack him in the head with the soggy ass chi dog he served up. You can't skimp on the poppy bun either! This stugots is screwing up a good thing.\n\nLike I said before selling the recipes to a new owner isn't always going to be a good thing. Here it is not. \n\nRUN FORREST RUN! Nothing to eat here.
