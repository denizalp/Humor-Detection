I actually got this store information from a guy at Walmart wearing a metro police shirt. \n\nAt first i started to gather my needed equipment from American Shooters, but they seemed to only have a set variety to choose from and mostly carried armory type supplies. I could not find the specific security material there nor New Frontier or Nellis AFB. \nWalking into this store, i knew from the first aisle that i was finally in the right place. From pink handcuffs to taser guns, these guys are stalked with police\/security officer supplies and some;) Lol. The owners who helped me find my items are friendly\/retired military guys that know their info and are more than willing to help with your needs. They hooked me up nicely on some items too!
