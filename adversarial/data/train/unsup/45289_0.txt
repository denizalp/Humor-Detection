The spring broke on my garage door.  The home warranty company called this company.  The receptionist was friendly and helpful and made every effort to work me into the schedule on New Year's Eve since they were closed on New Years Day.  The repairman named Ramon came right before 5pm.  He was very professional and friendly, he fixed the spring and took the extra time to oil all the rollers and change the light bulb in the garage opener unit.  \n\nExcellent job fixing the door, and I was so impressed that at 5pm on New Years Eve, when I'm sure he wanted to call it a day, he came and did a great job.  He was friendly, professional, fixed the broken spring, AND he still took the time to do the extra things like oil the rollers and change the burnt out light bulb in the unit.  That kind of service needs to be acknowledged!  I would definitely use them again and recommend them to anyone who wants the job done right, done quickly, by and done by friendly people.  No nonsense, no drama - just got the job done.
