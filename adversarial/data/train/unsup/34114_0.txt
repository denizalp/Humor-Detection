First time here after seeing it advertised over the years. Service was great on a beautiful fall Saturday. I had the Galley Boy with onion rings and a peanut butter shake. My wife had the hamburger with lettuce and tomato. The special shake was pumpkin which may have replaced the pecan. Lots of fun and will be back.
