Great meal! I don't have too many pictures as we were too busy enjoying the food. Wonderful service and food. \n\nI am always looking for places that have great salads (hard to find) and has options for days I need vegetarian options. Aladdins is a great option for both. If you go try the hummus - with hot sauce  and veggies.
