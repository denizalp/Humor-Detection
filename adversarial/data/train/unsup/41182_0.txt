Jet's Pizza is a chain from Michigan, but don't hold that against them.\n\nTheir menu is pretty much the same as all the major competitors - pizza, wings, salads, bread, subs, dessert, and soda. That's where the similarity ends.\n\nThe pan pizza (available in small, large, and extra large) blows away their competitors. It has the correct amount of mouth feel (buttery). The standard pizza sauce is fairly good too. They offer 8 different crust toppers. \n\nTheir bread ($5-6) is just ok. Marco's is much better. But Jet's offers better choices for dipping sauce, such as jalapeno cheese sauce.\n\nOnline ordering, while convenient, is horrible. As in it took 8 minutes to place an order. Will definitely call next time.
