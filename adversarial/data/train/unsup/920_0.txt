Crowded,  and 120 degrees.  Not a good nigh for a long walk. Although it's eventful and I'm sure it's a lot of fun but the Heat killed the fun today. \nMusic and all kind of enthusiasm from the crowd \nLots of night clubs and All kinds of streets performances.  I'm coming here next month , I will review again then .
