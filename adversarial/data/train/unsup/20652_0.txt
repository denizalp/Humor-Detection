The last time I was in the hotel was probably over 20 years ago. I remember staying here with my family when I was younger because it was the cheapest hotel next to Circus Circus, and also this was the next \"kid friendly\" hotel with the arcade they used to have...\n\nWalking in 20 years later, everything looked and smelled the same; definitely brought back some childhood memories. \n\nMy visit was short and sweet. The fam bam and I used the connecting tram from Luxor to Excalibur and we managed to find our way to the buffet on the second floor. The breakfast & brunch cost of an adult is $19.99, not bad at all. Instead of waiting in the long line to get in, I used the kiosk to pay for my hubby and I. Once you print out the receipt, you by pass the paying line and walk right up to get seated-use the kiosk, people! \n\nOnce seated it was game time! The have a \"build your own omelette\" station- so hit this up ASAP! \nThey also offer the regular breakfast items like waffles, pancakes, hash brown, and more! It was nice to see that at 11am, they had baked chicken and Mac n' Cheese! \n\nPretty good food selection for Brunch, I would recommend this place, simply because of the price and huge selection!
