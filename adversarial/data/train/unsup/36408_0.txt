Stumbled upon this place while waiting for my cousin to do her G1 test. Cute little cafe with lots of comfortable seating. It's gives a quiet atmosphere, would totally chill here on a nice afternoon!\n\nI ordered an americano and a muscle flex sandwich (chicken breast, avocado chickpea spread, roasted peppers and pesto). Americano was great! Very flavourful and smooth :) sandwich was pretty standard and a good size for lunch! \n\nWould definitely come back if I'm in the area!
