HORRIBLE HOSPITAL! nurses are all rude, unprofessional, OLD ready to retire type and doesn't know what they are doing! ER doctor is only an NP! inexperienced NP! FNP\nnot even an acute care NP! i was rushed here for my allergic reaction to something and my heart rate was really high! Then i was discharged with the same Heart rate! Ridiculous! They're all incompetent and rude. They will triage u while standing. Wth! And u have to wait for hours just to get into a bed even if u are critically sick. worst hospital ever.
