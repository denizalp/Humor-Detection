Reading the sad news about Aiello's closing their Central Ave. location reminded me to share the good news about this place. So... Aiello fans, take heed: You have an alternative and it is GOOD!!\n\nI had the. best. stuffed artichoke I've had in a looooong time here (see photo) and, for that, I am a devoted fan! The artichoke was giant and must've weighed at least 2 pounds stuffed! I also enjoyed the eggplant rollatini - the eggplant was soft and sweet and LOADED with ricotta filling. The sauce had the perfect acidity. Seriously, for as big of a fan as I am of the food and as convenient as it is -- it's dangerously close to home! \n\nThe adjacent pizza place has a white pizza that's on my list! Looks PERFECT but can't fully vouch for it... yet! ;)
