This is a great place to stay. It is in a hip neighborhood (Ohio City)  that is within easy walking distance of great cocktail bars, restaurants and even a Tiki bar. So, if you are looking to do any cocktail\/Tiki tourism, as we were, you cannot beat this location.\n\n I stayed in a private room which was really nice and no-frills. I did check out the dorm-style rooms and they were nice as well if you are looking to a save a little. The kitchen area was very impressive and would be great if you are looking to save on making your own food. There is an amazing city market nearby. There is a roof deck with a great skyline view and even a gas grill. There is a parking lot across the street \n\nThis is now my go to place to stay in Cleveland.
