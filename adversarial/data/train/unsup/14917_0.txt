After my fav beautician, Jenelle moved from this salon, I was lost.  I asked Mika & Brittney, the two best spa receptionist's ever what I should do.  They recommended a person, but it's tough when you're comfortable w\/ a particular person.  I mean it's your hair.  \n\nI went to her, who cut my hair perfectly, but toned my hair down to almost an ashy-brown color.  With the kind of year I had, I asked to be toned up, w\/ alil pizazz, maybe brighten-up my blond highlights & add some lavender.  \n\nYes, it's been awhile, maybe September since I had a touch-up cause Jenelle left & I was searching for someone.  My roots were horrible & my highlights looked streaky.  I was totally disappointed two hours later w\/ the beautician.  After trying to figure out what to do, I was at a loss for words, she said she wouldn't charge me & would fix it.  Time is valuable, the haircut was great so I paid for that & booked w\/ another beautician she recommended in the morning in hopes it could be fixed.  I also yelped the Salon & Alejandra showed up as well.  All pix I saw were good & so was our phone conversation.  I texted her the before & after pix, along w\/ my hair goals lol.\n\nToday, I met Alejandra who did an awesome job.  My hair was even soft & not weighed down w\/ product afterwards.  It's shiny & the perfect blend of blonds so I can't wait to see how it transforms in ten weeks!  Also for the lavender, extra blond or fun festive color add in, she recommended that I pick up a 'tape-in' piece of human hair from 'Nicoles'.  She said to keep the integrity of my hair w\/o over processing it.   Overall, I am happy & feel like I've found my new beautician for years to come.  I really like when someone cares about your hair & is honest.  Then, it becomes easy to leave it all in their hands & trust what's trendy or your beauticians stylistic advice.  Even mom & dad loved it!
