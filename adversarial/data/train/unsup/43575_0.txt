For some reason this place is always packed. The sushi is good and the fish to rice ratio favors the fish but I have definitely had better. It's really crowded and noisy and it felt like I was at dim sum where all you can hear is us Chinese people chatting it up super loud. However, even though it was so busy the food arrived pretty promptly so I was surprised. Although the food is good here, I would much rather be at the recently opened Toro.
