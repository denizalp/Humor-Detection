The Good the Bad and the Ugly\n\nThe Good, \nFood and friendly sincere service that is available \"late night\" will defiantly earn my 4th star.  \n\nThe menu is so large that you can very easily miss an entire page. And the food offered is all over the place from meatloaf and cheesesteaks to great dinner items you find in upscale dinning restaurants.  \n\nThe bad,\nDrink Specials are tempting enough to go here to get bombed.  If you are a binge drinker or just love great deals, Armadillo Grill is your weekday hook up. \n\nThe Ugly,\nSorry staff and management I love you guys but pointing fingers does not keep a restaurant  clean.   But it does keep the local dive bar feel alive and I'm ok with that.
