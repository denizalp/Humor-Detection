This place was good but I wouldn't say \"amazing\".  Coworkers said the pad thai smelled good upon reheating, and it was.  I stated \"mild\" for the papaya salad, but there was no heat at all.  Crispy pork was more like a karaage than deep fried pork belly, but was edible.  Probably would order again in a pinch.
