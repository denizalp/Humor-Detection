I absolutely love this place. I didn't have an appointment, I just wanted to see what they had. They were so nice and very helpful. My consultant was Brandi and she was so sweet and made me feel so at ease and comfortable. She really wanted to know what I liked or didn't like about every dress.\n\nShe brought in a dress that makes down to clearance and I feel in love! I have never looked so good in a dress! And to top it off, it's originally 3000 dollars but they have it to me for 95 since the next day was their 95 dollar clearance sale. They went so above and beyond and made finding my dream dress so amazingly easy and fun!
