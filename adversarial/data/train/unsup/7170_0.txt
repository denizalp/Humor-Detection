Went there on a Saturday Night. Waitress took 20 min to get a refill. Two other waitress were using the back booth by the kitchen as their hang out spot. Oh and by the way... they were lesbians. So I have my kid asking me why two girls keep kissing each other. That was the last thing I want to explain to my three year old at the dinner table. I have nothing against lesbians , but please don't make out when your suppose to be working, and especially in front of my kid! The food was soggy and greasy! Stay away from this restaurant! I wouldn't go there even if they paid me!
