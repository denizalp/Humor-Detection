Friendly people , good vibes and good surroundings. I would give this 5 stars, but it would be for just those first 3 things I mention. This theater needs a major renovation. Seats are old, dirty and plus they don't recline at all. Which just their is a big buzz kill for me. I will be taking my business somewhere else until they get newer chairs that recline.
