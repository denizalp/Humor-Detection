We live in Mt. Lebanon and decided to give MeKong a try. What a great decision. We ordered take out and the lady who took our order was super friendly. When we went to pick it up, the same person was so nice in person and very welcoming. We ordered the Garlic Chicken and the Szechuan Chicken. Both were excellent. It's very small, with only 9 tables, and it's an old building, but that's part of the charm. We'll be going back soon!
