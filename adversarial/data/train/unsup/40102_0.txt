Highly disappointed with my order through skip the dishes.  I was really looking forward to some good Thai and a hot tom yum soup on a cold winter night.\nI ordered Tom Yum Soup with Tofu (and put in the notes Vegetarian Tom Yum) but received Tom Kha soup with no tofu.  The vegetables were old looking and did not taste fresh.  \nThe Vegetarian Delight portion for $11 was a small portion and once again, old looking \/ tasting vegetables.  \nThe Pineapple friend rice with pork (which had 3 pieces of pork) was not a very nice flavor at all.\nPaying $43 for what we received was extremely disappointing.
