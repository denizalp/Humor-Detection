Why this place didn't have a line on a Friday afternoon, I don't know. My friend and I stopped in for lunch (until 2 pm) but they were also serving breakfast (what a menu!) and $5 pizza. Forget Little Caesars. This rocked- they actually asked how we liked our crust! We like crispy, paper thin crust and that's what we got as an appetizer. We thought we'd take home leftovers- but there weren't any. It was great. We took our main courses home instead. Super friendly service. Can't wait to go back!
