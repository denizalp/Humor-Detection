This restaurant is quite alright indeed. I was been a bit concerned due to the reviews that I'd read on this and word-of-mouth, but alas on December 24, not a single other place was open for lunch so off we went. \n\nThe restuarant was empty, and the decor was pleasant and so was the service. The IPAD ordering was very straightforward, and overall it was a very accessible ordering process. \n\nFor $19, the selection of AYCE for lunch was pretty diverse. Sure, you don't get the sashimi and a lot of fancy sushi, but you get the great staples such as the salmon avocado roll, which is superb for fish quantity, they didn't skimp on the salmon at all. Overall, the food quality was reasonable for the price, and there were no issues with the fish. The tempura left something to be desired, but overall it wasn't offensive.\n\nWhile generally I only go for sushi at AYCE, their extended menu which included thai food was also pretty attractive. \n\nFrom a value-quality ratio perspective, I think Fusion is pretty good. I would definitely go again, considering that if I were to order 20$ worth of sushi I'd get less value than if I just spent $20 on the AYCE. \n\nOverall I definitely think the negativity that I assumed was overblown. This is a solid restaurant. I definitely would go back.
