First and foremost, this is a NIKE CLEARANCE STORE, so pretty much everything is discounted to some degree. If you come in here expecting to find the latest styles and products for a ridiculously low price, you will probably be disappointed. They have a lot of merchandise, but it may not have what you are specifically looking for. If you go in with no expectations you will feel like you've hit a gold mine.\n\nI was lucky enough to find EXACTLY what I was looking for: Flyknit Lunar running shoes in my size! After all of the discounts, they ended up being $35! An incredible steal. I also got a new tank, sports bra and running capris. I probably would have walked away with a lot more but I was somehow able to hold back. It CAN get like a zoo in there and it seems like everyone has 2-3 shopping bags each. I swear I saw one guy seriously buy 20 pairs of shoes, and I'm not exaggerating. THAT'S how affordable the stuff here is. There was even a crowd of people waiting outside before it even opened! My advice, get there early, go to the shoe section first, then hunt around for apparel afterwards. \n\nI love this store and I will definitely be back!
