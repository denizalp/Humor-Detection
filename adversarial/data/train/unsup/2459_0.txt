This place would have been 1 - 2 stars if my son hadn't enjoyed the unlimited rides.  We went to Fry's and got the family pack for $67 which included 2 adult passes, 2 child passes and 2 unlimited ride wrist bands.  We ended up giving one of the child passes to someone in line buying tickets since we only had 1 child.  The festival is quite large with tons of food vendors and a lot of rides.  \n\nThere is one booth there that sells their souvenir cups for $5 and then you can come back for free refills - they have about 4 different flavored lemonades (strawberry, blueberry, regular and mango) out on the table, and you can walk up and refill your cup.  If you need more ice, they'll gladly put more in for you.  The lemonades are a little bland, but for free, it's worth every penny considering the other food vendors charge $2.50 for refills.  \n\nAs the evening wore on, the lines for the adult rides got extremely long that it wasn't worth the wait.  The kiddie rides had about a 5-10 minute wait depending on what ride you wanted to go on.\n\nAs for the ostrich?  I thought this was an ostrich festival - at the VERY far end of the park, there is a fence with TWO ostrich in them.  That's it.  Just 2.  You could see more ostriches if you went to the ostrich race, but you have to get there to get a seat at least 45 min before the race or you won't be able to see a thing.  We later saw that they were selling ostrich burgers...maybe that's why there were only 2 ostrich on display.  \n\nOverall, this was basically a miniature version of the state fair.  I wouldn't drive all the way from North Phoenix to go to it again considering we thought we'd see more ostrich with more ostrich-like activities.  But like I said, our son enjoyed all the rides and the smile on his face was enough for us.
