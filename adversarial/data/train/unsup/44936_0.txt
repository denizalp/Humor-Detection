The baked goods here are scrumptious, have a fine texture, and are not overly sweet. The breakfasts and lunches are very appealing in taste and presentation. Jewel's amazes me with its ability to get all of these food aspects right, which is truly a feat when it comes to gluten-free food (the cafe does not serve anything with gluten). Beyond the food and beverages, the appeal extends to the bright, eclectic atmosphere of the cafe. The staff is very friendly,  the cafe's location is convenient, and the availability of parking is excellent. Plus, free WiFi  with a good strong signal; my tablet browses the Internet really fast when I'm in this bakery\/cafe. In all, this is a most pleasant place to get a great meal or to have a leisurely nosh of coffee and delicious baked goods.
