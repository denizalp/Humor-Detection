Unfortunately this is low stars for the efficiency and the service not the food. We made a reservation on open table and it appeared that they don't monitor that or have a hostess\/check in station at all so we just waited for someone to stop and talk to us. The wait to get water and even drinks should have been a warning sign. It took a while and to get the appetizer as well. The meal continued wth difficulties such as forgotten water refills, ketchup delivered after the meals were already eaten, half the table done eating while others waited for their food to arrive. My mom didn't get salad dressing until after everyone was finished so we just sat there and watched her eating before we could leave. Not very apologetic and no effort to reconcile the difficulties. For higher prices and upscale neighborhood it wasn't worth it and we probably won't be back for a while. \n\nGood stuff--Food items themselves were very very good. Nice menu selection, expected prices for Chagrin Falls, cute atmosphere. My grilled romaine salad was inventive and flavorful. The chicken was cooked perfectly. I was envious of the baseball filet, it was a nice cut and good portion.
