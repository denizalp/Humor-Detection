The bathroom remodel on my rental house was surprisingly easy and stunningly beautiful. Re-bath came in demoed both bathtubs and reinstalled their new product. It took about one week to complete once construction commenced. When one of the bathtubs was demoed to my horror I noticed a significant termite issue, but Re-bath was there to help and they corrected the issue with no additional cost.
