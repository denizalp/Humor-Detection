WSS has excellent food and a fun place to be from top to bottom.  Despite their name, the menu offers a variety and it is great food across the board.  The Garlic Parm. wings are my favorite, but you can get them at varying heat intensity levels (Mild\/Medium\/Hot...), they realize that everyone has different \"heat\" thresholds...And if you like extra sauce, you can get them extra wet.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating even on the busiest of days.  We recently visited the restaurant and Laura was our waitress.  She went above and beyond to make sure our large party of 10 was completely satisfied.  Recognizing that it was a busy night and the food may take slightly longer than usual, she offered our young son crackers and crayons to keep him entertained.  This may seem like an expected offer from a waitress, but the place was packed and she had several other customers to take care of.  We didn't have to ask, she just wanted to do what she felt would bring a smile to our table.  She was so attentive to us and even held napkins over a dripping cup so it would not drip on anyone as she delivered it across the table.  The entire staff is very friendly and considerate, but given the circumstances of how busy the night was, Laura went above and beyond to make sure everyone was satisfied and she did it with a smile.  Great place, great staff, great food!
