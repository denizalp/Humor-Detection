Schezuan cuisine is one my personnel favorites! My last true taste of this cuisine was in China, I will definitely say that this establishment is truly authentic! From the produce, sauces, and presentation of the dishes, Chengdu Taste knows what it takes to make your visit special and memorable. \n\nMy favorite dish of the night was the simmer caldron of Boiling Beef in Sichuan Hot Sauce. The beef was tender and mixed with the fantastic sauce giving every bite a nice bit of spice and peppers really hit home! From all the awards and accolades around the dining area is a true testament as to the best Sichuan restaurant of Vegas!
