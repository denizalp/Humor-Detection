We go here quite often. The service is great and the food is delicious. From the salsas to the flaming fajitas to even the chicken fingers, everything is delicious. I love the flaming fajitas and they come on a sizzling platter so that really makes them even more appetizing. The shrimp cocktail and ceviche is very well made too.
