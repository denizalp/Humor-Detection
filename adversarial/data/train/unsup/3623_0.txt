Old town Scottsdale has long been a haven to buy kitschy bolo ties and hear about rumored legends of Paris Hilton's time spent clubbing here.  EVO solidifies this area, along with Franco's and Marcellino's as the Valley's \"Little Italy\".  We welcome back the original 'Cuoco Pazzo', Chef DeRuvo and he brings back many of the dishes that we have loved at his past spots, namely the Raviolo, Arancini, and Focaccia di Recco.  The only mild disappointment was the Squid Ink Chittara which was a little too soupy and clumpy for my taste.The ambiance and bar are nice enough but the draw for me is what is being made back in the kitchen.
