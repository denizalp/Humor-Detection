I frequently travel to Toronto for work and I figured this was a unique enough experience to check out.\n\nThe other reviewers have covered the experience itself well enough, so this review is more about the overall value.  For ~$200, I was a little annoyed that they only give you 2 printed out photos and a DVD.  \n\nBe honest, who are you going to force into watching you... walk... I mean, I don't like being forced to watch babies take their first steps.  Though now that I think about it, perhaps I'll send this along to the next person that sends me one of those.\n\nIf you want a CD of digital pictures for Facebook updates (because lets face it, half the reason we do things is to show them off to others), it's another $16.99.  I think they could've at least given us the option of if we wanted the DVD or CD.\n\nIf you're in Toronto, it's a good way to see the city and better than just taking an expensive elevator ride up the tower.  The pass gives you access to the rest of the tower as well.  Let's face it though, once you've walked around the outside, there's no real reason to do anything else.
