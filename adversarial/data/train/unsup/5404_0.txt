Located inside the District at Green Valley Ranch.. Rachel's Kitchen has never disappointed me!\n\nSmall, up-to-date, cute restaurant. Friendly staff and good service!\n\nThey have breakfast and lunch items to choose from! Wraps, sandwiches, pastas, salads, etc. My favorite items have to be their pastas -- either Signature or Garden Pasta, substituted with their gluten-free quinoa pasta! Very tasty, healthy food!\n\nSuggested for your reps to bring this in the office for lunch meetings and such!
