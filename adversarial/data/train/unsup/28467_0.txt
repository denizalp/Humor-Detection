Liv is a nice place to be.  You cannot beat the neighborhood!  We use the adjacent walking paths every day.  The reviews that complain about the smell should not have moved to a rural area by dairies.  The pools are nice, the sand next to the pool was probably not a great design as the pool is always full of sand.  Kids splash pool and dog park are nice.  I would suggest for future properties that the dog areas be made around the perimeter as our patio looks out to the main grass area and it's not so nice to sit on the patio and look out to 30 dogs pooping twice a day.  We will probably move to a condo when our lease is up because of the overhead noise from kids running around upstairs and drawers\/doors slamming constantly but that's typical apartment living.  Staff is nice but we miss Megan, she was so awesome!  One day the whole staff was replaced without notice.  Overall, it's a really nice apartment property in a great location!
