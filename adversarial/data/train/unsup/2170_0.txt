For Valentine's, my guy surprised me with a couple massage at the Grand Spa inside MGM Grand. I don't think anyone has ever successfully surprised me with anything before so I was absolutely floored. \n\nWe walked in on the later side of the evening so the spa was pretty empty and we had it all to ourselves. I didn't have time to enjoy any of the other amenities so this review is strictly for the massage we enjoyed. \n\nOur massage therapists were extremely friendly and professional. I don't enjoy talking during my massage so they kept it to a minimum which was appreciated. The pressure was excellent and the surroundings were relaxing and smelled lovely. \n\nWe enjoyed our Valentine's Day treat quite a bit and I would recommend their services again.
