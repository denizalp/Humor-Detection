I'm always thrilled to find myself arriving and departing from Terminal 3. Both SWA and Virgin have most of their flights here, which means not having to take the airbus to the baggage claim and ground transportation. For such a busy place, it's pretty spotless. There are plenty of choices on food and beverages. Seating in most places are a premium, however you can tow up to a bar and conveniently take your drink (yes, it's a Red Bull, LOL!) on your flight! Lost a star, because I never have won anything at the slot machines!
