We had never heard of this restaurant but with it being Mother's Day we relied on our handy dandy Yelp reviews to find somewhere new. And good thing we did because we fell head over heels for this unique and delicious restaurant. It is a must for any foodie!!! The food was very good and it was all pretty unique and creative. I was expecting a different menu but like I said it was Mother's Day. So they did have a set menu for a fix price or you could order from the menu. \nMy only complaint was that we went during lunch and ate like it was dinner. I wish I would have known the menu was changed so i could  have gone during  dinner and with a larger appetite. Try it for yourself.
