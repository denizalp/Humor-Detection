Odd there are so many negative reviews about this place. When I looked around at the crowd, everyone seemed to have lost their minds (in the best way possible). Perhaps it was Hardwell working his magic? :)\n\nI don't know how to write this review without going into details about the night that I was there with my girls on 4\/20 (opening weekend)... but it was a memorable one!!!\n\nPros: \nx Lines move fast -- I think. I was a little tipsy.\nx Bouncers\/security aren't rude douche bags.\nx Temperature perfect at all times. Yay for no sweating.\nx Good lights and sound great sound system\nx Elevators\nx 3 different ways to enter\/exit the dance floor\nx contracts with top DJ's so you can always expect someone good to spin no matter what week you go!\nx Areas you can get away from the music for a breather.\n\nSide note: I wish I could comment on bar area\/service and drink prices, but I don't quite remember that part of the night :P JUST BEING HONEST HERE, don't judge.\n\nCons:\nx Confused as hell where I was every time I was going up\/down the stairs. No signs.\nx Some of the tables are all the way in the back, you can barely see the DJ.\nx  Dance floor is a bit small in my opinion. \n\nIn all, I had a great experience here. Good review or not, let's be frank here... doesn't matter the venue, people will follow the DJ. This place has got it good overall. \n\nOk, I'm having insane Vegas withdrawals right now.
