While visiting Toronto I was brought to Sneaks for pop punk Tuesday. This is an interesting little place. I was not too stoked on paying five dollars cover so that I could listen to The Used and Moneen all night, but sucked it up as my friend was rather excited to show me this place, and was buying drinks. \n\nHad I scoped Yelp before hand and realized the food ruled here, I probably would have dragged myself downstairs for some vegan tex mex as mentioned in some of these other reviews. Instead, I hung out upstairs drinking from their shitty selection of beers and watching grown men in their 30s who hadn't grown out of their \"scene kid\" stage try and pick up 19 year old girls, all to the soundtracks of my youth. If you feel like yelling out Taking Back Sunday lyrics really loudly into the faces of strangers, this might just be your place. \n\nSHE SAID \"DOOOOON'T.... DON'T LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD! BOYS LIKE YOU ARE A DIIIIME A DOZEN! BOYS LIKE YOU ARE A DIME A DOZEN!\" SHE SAID, \"YOU'RE A TOUCH OVER RAAATED, YOU'RE A LUSH AND I HAAATE IT\" BUT THESE GRASS STAINS ON MY KNEES THEY DON'T MEAN A THING.\n\nIf you stay until last call, you even get to witness what jerks the bouncers can be when they kick everybody out for the night. \n\nNow I want nachos.
