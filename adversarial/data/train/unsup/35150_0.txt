Very nice staff, cute interior, and it's nice you get mimosas and stuff (one free and pay for the rest) but not worth the cost... They wash your hair quickly and not thoroughly. If you show them what you want, what you get doesn't match the photo. My curls also fell out before I left the establishment, and there's a hefty tax charge. I paid like $65 I think before tip, for literally, nothing, but one mimosa. Disappointing, particularly since it was for my friend's bachelorette party. Wouldn't recommend this place or go back :(
