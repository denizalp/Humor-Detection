This place is just nasty.\n\nNo matter how much of a penny saver you are, nothing could possibly be worth subjecting yourself to this sorry excuse of a resort otherwise known as the Quad (formerly the Imperial Palace). Since hearing of the new \"remodeling\" done here, I decided to bring some relatives and check the place out. Unfortunately, said \"remodeling\" seems to only pertain to exterior surfaces, as the rooms are still as spectacularly shoddy as ever.\n\nAs has been well-documented here, we're talking stained carpets, questionable looking bed sheets, and extremely antiquated \"amenities.\" But by far, the most unique aspect of my room was the putrid stench that wafted from the telephone's microphone (the part where your mouth goes). My aunt theorized that the previous guest was probably using it, fell asleep (with the phone in position), and then proceeded to drool all over it before setting it back.\n\nAll in all, while the casino is entertaining, this place is a no-go.
