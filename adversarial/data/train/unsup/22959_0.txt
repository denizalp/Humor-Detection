I've passed this place several times and it's always jam packed and difficult to find parking, so I when I saw that it wasn't too busy one night, I stopped by.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get a Popper Burger (Sauteed Jalapenos, Onion Straws, Cream Cheese, $9.50) and to wash it down a Four Peaks IPA.\n\nThe Burger didn't disappoint, it was very good!  The combination of Jalapenos & Cream Cheese made this Burger unique and tasty.....with a little *kick*, just how I like it.  The Four Peaks IPA was a perfect match for it as well....yum!\n\nI sat at the bar and the bartender\/server was very friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to come back.\n\nReturn Factor - 97%
