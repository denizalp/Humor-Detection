I first learned about this place when I was in Isreal. And I instantly feel in love with it. I didn't know they had locations here in Toronto. The coffee is the best I've ever had. The food, which is made while you wait is suburb! It's just excellent! The salad portions are very generous, the fresh shakes are just to die for. And above all, it's not that expensive. \nI've never posted reviews for establishments, it shows how much I love this place!! And they're opening up a location at Yonge & Eglinton soon.
