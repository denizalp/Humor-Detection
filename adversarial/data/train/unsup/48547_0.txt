Good spot for breakfast, lunch or early dinner (Tues-Friday open 6:30 am til 8 pm. Other days they close at 5 pm). Large dining area and smaller dining room in the back. Great deli items and classic favorites - something for everyone. I highly recommend The Bagel Cafe when you're craving a deli experience.
