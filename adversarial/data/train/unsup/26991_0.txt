Love the food, service is mixed.  We were promptly greeted, it seemed busy for  a Sunday night.  Once we got our drinks however and stated we needed a few minutes, one was two, two was three, three was fifteen minutes later so that was a little annoying.  I wanted something new so I ordered the Athenian sphagetti and I added gyo meat with it and had their salad.  We also ordered the hummus trio.  The food was awesome.  My spaghetti was great and I'm not much of a pasta person but my choice with the add on was perfect.  I think if the place hadn't been so unexpectedly busy on a Sunday the service would have been a bit quicker.  I won't hold it agaisnt them as it is hard to find a greek food place open on Sunday.  I'll be back.
