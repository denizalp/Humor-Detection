In keeping with the thought that I needed a treat today, I stopped by my favorite Scottsdale cupcake store, Lulu's.\nI didn't say my favorite cupcake store (TC, you know who you are and you're delightful), but my favorite in Scottsdale.\nThey had a special on today, 2 for 1, so I brought one home for the beautiful Carin and then cut them half so I could have 1\/2 of Blonde Bombshell and 1\/2 of PB, hold the Jelly. \nThey also had a \"D-Cup\" cake (I do so love double entente's), but strangely enough, it didn't really look so hot.\nAnyway, both cupcakes were good and just what I needed to restore balance to my life (esp. for the extremely reasonable price of $3.00 for 2).The BB was moist and icing rich and flavorful (if you can truly say that vanilla is flavorful...which I do...probably something to do with my Norwegian heritage).\nI thought the PB was less successful, the cake was a little dry (why do so many cupcake places, and bakeries, for the matter, have trouble making a moist chocolate cake!?!?). The icing, while tasty, had that little bit of crust that says \"I've been sitting here a little too long\".\nBut both were good and LuLu's is my go to when I don't want to leave Scottsdale for a cupcake.
