Customer service put a bad taste in my mouth! I ordered a small smoothie and the drive-thru attendant seemed annoyed that I was paying by card. I tried to present him with the coupon from the Giant Eagle receipt I recieved for $1 off...to which he says that if I want to use the coupon I have to pay cash but if I want to use my card I have to pay full price; which I did.  \n\nListen, if you're going to be nickel and dime-ming customers then don't offer a coupon OR if it's that much of a problem indicate on the coupon how much you're comfortable sacrificing for the sale...say $1 off $5 or $1 off Medium smoothie,  something like that. Nowhere on the coupon or the  menu board does it state cash-only payment is expected to use the coupon. But to act as if it's an inconvenience to take a card because the price is low comes off as disingenuous!  \nI was glad to find out there was a natural smoothie place near me, but I'll have to push this incident way to the back of my mind if I decide to go back again. The smoothie itself was okay, which is why I left 2 stars. \n\nSee photo to see I'm not bullshitting about this coupon.
