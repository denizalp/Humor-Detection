this place is a real treasure! never in a million years would i have guessed such a swanky steak & seafood joint lies beneath the Four Queens! my in-laws discovered it on their last trip to Vegas and insisted we come back for their 40th wedding anniversary. they handed all the ladies in my party a single long-stemmed rose before they escorted us to our dimly-lit, circular booth and placed the roses in a vase for us. it felt like i was on the set of Mad Men or an old school New York-style steakhouse. \n\nthe menu is expensive, but i felt it was worth every penny. most of us ordered entrees because we wanted the full service. first comes the table-side salad service, and they let you choose every item - mine had hearts of palm and anchovies and a lovely vinaigrette. then a 'palate cleansing' mini-cone of raspberry sorbet - darling! and then the entrees...  i had the salmon en papillote, which came with a dramatic table-side preparation of salmon steamed in a puffed-up little parchment bag, then deflated and cut away, and served with julienne vegetables on top. absolutely fantastic. i pretty much never do dessert - too heavy, cakey, creamy, etc. but i was terribly pleased with dessert at Hugo's - chocolate covered fruits! strawberries, apricots, and figs, all my favorite things! \n\nit was just wonderful. attentive and expert service, very cozy space, with light classic Rat Pack lounge tunes piped into the background. very highly recommend this place. i would love to return for another special occasion.
