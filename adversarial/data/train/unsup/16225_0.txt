I'd had pretty good Tibetan food before so I came in with high hopes.  I wasn't really disappointed.  They accommodated my vegan palette with gusto and altered a few things to make them vegan, without complaint, eye rolling, or any of the other uncomfortable weirdness of some other restaurants.  My waiter?  He got it.\n\nThe waiter was charming and even though the place was absolutely packed and busy, he took his time to explain the meals to us and to ensure everything would be vegan-ified for me.  They have a Tibetan menu and an Indian menu.  My concern was that the Tibetan food would be a little bland as I've had some bland ass Tibetan food before.  I ordered a bunch of stuff - I honestly can't remember what everything was - but only one thing was a tad tasteless.  Hey, I won't lie, the vegetable curry was bland as hell, but the experience in general passed my litmus test.\n\nOrder some of the moist Tibetan bread that comes in this roll thing.  Just do it.  Sort of like Fruit-by-the-Foot style.  You dip it in your food and in sauces and stuff and it's delicious.  I loved it and it really hit the spot.  The samosas were also far superior to the samosas I'm accustomed to eating.  The dessert was a sweetened rice thing with raisins.  It was alright, but it normally comes with yogurt so of course the texture for me was a bit lacking; however, if you're not vegan, that won't concern you if you order it, of course.\n\nWhile they did not have any Tibetan beer - the waiter explained to me that most Tibetan beers were home brews and they obviously couldn't sell that stuff in a restaurant - I must say that Tibetan food makes an excellent buffer before a night out drinking.  So yeah.  I'm coming back.
