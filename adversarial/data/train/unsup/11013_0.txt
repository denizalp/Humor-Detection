Where can you find snow in Las Vegas year round? In the parking lot of the ice center. The zambonis dump their ice in the parking lot in a couple huge piles making for a great place for kids to play and get into snow ball fights.\n\nAs for the ice center itself, it's older and beat up, but still fun. There are two rinks, one where the Wranglers practice and one that is open to the public. We've been here twice -- both times for a kid's birthday party. For parties, you can rent out a private room and order food and beverages provided, I believe, from Brooksy's next door. During both parties they also had an \"open skate\" period which made the rink way too crowded, especially for little kids. All the kids still had a great time, but not sure if the parents enjoyed it as much.  It also gets pricey if you're going to have a kid's party.
