Not very good. The margarita tastes like it came straight out of a pre-made mix you get at the store. House made salsa = terrible. I probably would be happier with a jar of Tostitos salsa from the store. Not much flavor and what little flavor it does have doesn't have a good flavor profile. We got the guacamole tasting appetizer and it's...disappointing at best. Again, flavor profiles are weird and don't make sense. The chips are decent though. Atmosphere (we sat on the patio) is fine. Music was unmatched to the general theme of the restaurant but whatever. I'm sure there are decent things on the menu but based on other reviews this is highly disappointing. I certainly won't be returning.
