This place is amazing from the cool local coffee shop atmosphere to the fact that they grow their own coffee beans through family members. The Coffee is amazing and I'm a big fan of the chemex!I look forward to their pretty lattes in the fall! Next time I'm in I plan on ordering the nitro coffee which is supposed to be comparable to a coffee flavored stout without the alcohol which is super creative! Who needs starbucks!
