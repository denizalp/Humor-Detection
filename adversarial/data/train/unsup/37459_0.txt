I have shopped the re-store for many years but........give me a break. I can get BRAND NEW stuff for the prices on very used items.  I have to believe your traffic is dropping off because it is truly a waste of time to browse unless you want a good laugh. Whoever has pricing responsibility, you obviously do not have ANY experience with retail and reality.
