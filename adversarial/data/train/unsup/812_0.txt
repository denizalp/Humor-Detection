Can't believe I am about to review a Motel 6 but I think this one deserved a good review!  \nMy friends and I got into Vegas at 1am on one of the busiest Vegas weeks of the year.  We stopped into a couple hotels and it seemed everything was sold out!!  Tuesday night sold out? Crazy!  So we ventured our way a street down and laid eyes on a Motel 6.  uh oh.  \nMotel 6 usually has a stigma attached to it and from the outside this was no different.  It we were approached by some left-over Ladies of the Night or mugged and beaten we would have totally expected it...but that wasn't the case at all.  \n\nThe rooms were so clean!  Yes, surprisingly clean and perfect.  The a\/c was freezing cold and amazing and everything great from check-in to check-out.  \n\nSo for $35 a night and a 5 minute walk to the strip...this place is just right.
