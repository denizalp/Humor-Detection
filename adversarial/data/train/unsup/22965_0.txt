One of the worst organized places I've ever seen.  Came here for a table for 3 at 8pm on Thursday without a reservation, but I was willing to wait.   They said 30-45 ... Ok fine.  1.5 hours later, nothing.  Always, 10 more minutes ... The reception area is vacant without an employee for 20 minutes ... I timed them so I know.  There was an empty table in front of us that would fit us perfectly available for at least 15 minutes, but they couldn't give it to us because \"that section is not in a waited section and servers wouldn't really have the time\".  If you don't have the staff, don't make stuff up so we can go somewhere else.  Don't waste our time.\n\nBy the way, I'm still here waiting.
