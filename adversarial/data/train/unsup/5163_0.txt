This place is nothing to write home about.  Hidden away in a corner of the shopping mall near Decatur and Sahara, one would almost miss it if they weren't already trying to track it down.  As the restaurant is only open till 2pm, if you take too long to find it, you won't make it in time.\n\nWhen we entered the restaurant, we found our table and the waitress dropped off the menu's without asking us if we'd like something to drink.  This would be understandable if it was slammed in the restaurant.  We were one of two or three tables occupied, however, so this with the fact that it took her another 10-15 minutes to return diminished our hopes of an enjoyable meal.\n\nI am one to believe that a restaurant should not be entirely judged on one particular meal alone.  Much like Lotus of Siam, where it is said the Northern Menu is what the restaurant is best known for, the Hash here is supposed to be excellent.  I, however, am not a big fan of hash so I chose to not eat it (as well it was lunch).  The food that we did order (the Peasant Lunch was my choice) was decent but again, a bowl of chili, plain toast and a small cup of strawberries and banana's did not seem to be worth $6.99.\n\nBetween the two Hash House moniker's, I would recommend A-Go-Go.  Forget about the looks of either place...at A-Go-Go, the food is better all around (I don't have to limit myself to one particular type of food) and the portions are huge.  If I want a small, decently cooked home-made meal, I'll go to the 50's Diner on Jones near the 215 or Black Bear Diner on Jones and Tropicana.  Both are much more appropriate choices with better service and decent food.
