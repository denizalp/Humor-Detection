WOW, WOW!!!! Thanks for your helpful reviews. I am a Realtor who sent Damon\na couple of clients a few years back, when the company was just getting started when he was very ambitious and accommodating. I am horrified  at the reviews.\nI was about ready to refer him again. There is no way I want to damage my\nreputation and possible future business with my client. So sad that Damon has\nlost his ambition, this could be very damaging to his business. Thanks to technology\nthis is one extra client and many future clients he will not be getting!!!!\n\nSo disappointing!!!!!
