All these reviews don't lie! This place is killer! Let's just say, if anyone comes here and says they don't like it or it's just ok...don't trust their taste buds or reviews anymore. :P\n\nThey have a variety of flavors that change daily and some of them sound really strange. Flavors like pear\/blue cheese, avocado and cucumber\/ginger sound weird but venture out and try them! Everyone here is super nice and genuinely seems excited to describe and let you sample different flavors. One of our favorites is the chocolate sorbetto (cioccolato) which is just downright amazing! Mix that with one of the gelato's and you will not be disappointed! We also got a cupcake there and it was one of the best I ever had. Ridiculously good chocolate flavor and super moist!\n\nI tried to think of anything negative that would warrant 4 stars but I just can't! The gelato is amazing, their customer service is beyond top notch and the prices are crazy good for the location. It is a little bit tricky to get to and the parking isn't the greatest but who cares?! It's worth it!
