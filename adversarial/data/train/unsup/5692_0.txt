This was my second time being here and have to say the place is indeed just an average eating experience.  The decor is nice, but the food is nothing to write home about.  The best thing on the menu is the pork belly buns, they are so tasty.  The chicken buns, not so much.  Of the infamous ramens, the smoked chicken ramen was also just plain and not tasty.  The signature Momofuku ramen was a bit better but still overpriced for the quality one would expect to receive.
