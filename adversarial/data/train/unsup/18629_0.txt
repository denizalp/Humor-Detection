Let's talk about the many, many reasons why I love Assorted Table Wine Shoppe.\n\n1.Any store that's retail pricing instead of four times restaurant mark up, makes me happy.  \n\n2. Community farm table, where you can socialize with Not Just Coffee patrons too!\n\n3. Knowledgeable, unassuming staff, you can be a total novice or an oenophile and you feel welcomed.\n\n4. Plenty of hidden gems, not just the everyday stuff.  We tried a Prosecco or some sort of bubbles from Barcelona (I think) for $26.  Delicious, obscure and affordable. #hellyeah\n\n5. My favorite Vermouth, Dolin.\n\n6. Location, 7th Street Market- great meeting place, where everyone can find something to drink\/eat and be completely content.\n\n7. Outdoor seating\n\n8. Free parking for 90 minutes!\n\n9. A large selection of Bitters!\n\nAll this talk makes me want to go there now!!!!
