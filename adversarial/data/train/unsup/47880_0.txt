Had Prado give me a quote to do some pool remodeling a couple years ago.  We ended up not doing the job because of personal reasons.  I called to get them to come back out for a new quote.  The owner, Mark, told me the new quote would be much higher because of \"getting the pool tile\" and if it is available.  Pls. note it was standard pool tile I chose.  I told him I had another company come out last week and give me a quote and it came in the same price as his 2-yr. old quote with the EXACT remodeling items listed on his old one.  He then stated that it would not be \"worth it for him to WASTE his time and effort and gas\" to come back out to give me a new quote if I WAS GOING TO SHOP AROUND FOR THE BEST PRICE!!!!  He also stated that he would ONLY come out if I would commit to him right then and there.  Really??  Commit without a written quote?  In this economy??  Congratualtions a company is doing so well it will tell potential clients to go with another lower price quote from a competitive company.  Which is exactly what I am doing.  Money has no place with arrogance.
