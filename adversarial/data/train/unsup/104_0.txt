I was at a kid's birthday party last weekend where they were serving pizza and cupcakes for lunch. When I found out that the cupcakes were from Retro Bakery I started getting a little anxious. I only saw a few cupcakes sitting out on the table so I wasn't sure if they were just for the kids or if there were enough for the adults. I was ready to bum rush the table and push aside any toddler in my way to get my hands on Retro's infamous buttercream. After thinking about it (and picturing my wife's look of horror and anger if I did) I decided to do the mature thing and wait. \n\nI waited and waited. I waited patiently as each kid went up and grabbed a cupcake with their tiny little hands. When the green light was given to the adults, I quickly made my way to the table, weaving through the crowd of kids and parents. I was like Barry Sanders back in the day -- spinning, juking, cutting from side to side to reach the end zone. As it turned out, they had a ton of mini cupcakes. There were more than enough to satisfy my appetite.\n\nEverything I tried was as good as I imagined. Soft, moist cakes topped with rich, flavorful, and silky-smooth buttercream. Here's how I would rank them:\n\n1) Chocolate fountain (chocolate cake topped w\/ chocolate buttercream and dipped in chocolate ganache)\n2) Hop scotch (vanilla cake topped w\/ vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache)\n3) Cookies and cream (chocolate cake toped w\/ crushed chocolate sandwich cookie buttercream)\n4) Red Carpet (Red cake topped w\/ almond buttercream and red glitter sugar)\n5) Strawberry banana (fresh banana cake topped w\/ strawberry buttercream)\n\nThe mini-cupcakes were a great way to go. I got to sample several flavors without making myself violently ill. There's a lot of hype around Retro Bakery, but it's all well deserved.
