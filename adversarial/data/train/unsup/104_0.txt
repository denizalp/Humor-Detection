I just randomly walked by here and saw the nice displays of macarons, donuts and muffins. The vibe of this place reminds me of cafes in London and Italy so I decided to try it. I got the salted caramel and chocolate macaron. Was delicious! Loved it.. My gf got the Nutella filled donut, it was good but nothing amazing. I'm for sure going to try the crounut next time...
