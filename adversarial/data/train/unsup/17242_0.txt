What took me so long \n\nI went to Blaze Fast Fire'd Pie for dinner last night with my sister and nephew and I have to admit we really enjoyed our meals.  Blaze has the same concept which is similar to Chipotle.  You create your very own pizza masterpiece.\n\nBlaze, has an assembly line concept for Pizza or salad if you  prefer.  You walk up to the counter and walk down the line.  As you walk down the line you tell the Pizza cooks what to add to your pizza.  The price remains the same reguardless of what or how many topping  you add to your pizza.\n\nI ordered a pie with tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, roasted peppers, pepperoni and spicy sausage.  My sister and nephew  ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes. \n\nThe line moved very quickly so we built or pizza creations, paid, and filled our drinks.  The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.  Blaze offers a good selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and vegetables and the  prices are modest.\n\nThe staff is friendly, accomadating, \nthe food is good, and at a reasonable price. \n\nIf your in the area give it a try.
