I'm feeling the review below me - CiCi's pizza isn't located anywhere near me. But there's some in Vegas?!? We gotta hit that up.\n\nIt was cool - I like pizza... \nI am accustomed to larger buffets though, and less expensive fountain drinks. Everything was the kind of quality that could whip up in 10 minutes or less. It also didn't help that there was some weird fundraiser going on where this loud guy was announcing all this weird crap I didn't care about. I was still hung over and wasn't prepared for this kiddie festival - excuse me. The commercials don't advertise that it's like a Discovery Zone without the playground.\n\nNonetheless, some of the pizza had tasty combinations. And I suppose at $5 you can't complain too much when it's all-you-can-eat.
