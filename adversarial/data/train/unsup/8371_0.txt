Been a while since I've had Mongolian BBQ. As one reviewer points out, Mongolian BBQ is woefully inaccurate but when you can get someone to grill up bowls and bowls of shaved lamb before your eyes, they can call it Karl Wears Panties for all I care.\n\nUnlike most buffets were it's quantity over quality, Genghis Khan gets the quality just about right. In addition to the noodle buffet, they have some chinese favorites (dim sum weekend mornings) on the side tables. The dessert table's chocolate fountain is pretty fun. Ladle some of that on your ice cream and it forms a nice hard shell. \n\nService is great and prices are cheaper than Mandarin.
