Taco Bell must offer some of the cheapest calories in America. At this TB cheap calories come with great service.\n\nRare for an American fast food restaurant, I have never experienced a single episode of bad service at this TB. Whether it's the friendly girl who upgrades my nachos (gratis) to the next size or the incredibly animated man who also works the snack counter at the AZ Center AMC, this TB's employees have one thing in common: they aim to please.\n\nThe food, of course, is nothing exceptional. It's TB. It fills you up and, at this location, it has consistently filled me up without causing food poisoning. When you're talking TB, what more could you ask for?
