Wow, I'm so glad I happened to find this place by accident one day after going to Best Buy.  \n\nI'll admit, I'm not sure what traditional 'greek' food is to be honest, but I know I like this place.  The gyros are EXCELLENT and their hummus is THE BOMB!\n\nBig servings, clean but small place, and quick.  I can get in and out of there in about 30 minutes, so easy for lunch.  \n\nI've seen some comments on the prices, but the prices are fine with me, especially considering that this stuff is grade A quality fresh.  \n\nYou know, on that subject; one thing I've noticed is that a lot of white people...and it is mostly white people... white people with money...tend to beaaach a lot about prices in ethnic family owned restaurants.  Whether it be Mexican or Greek, they sure to like to complain about a few extra bucks.  But by golly get some funky new hamburger joint, like five guys, where they charge over $10 bucks for a hamburger and fries (no drink), and they just LOVE the place (must be those damn peanuts...)\n\nSeriously folks, quit being such whiners about the price of food when it's anything but your standard American corporate white food.  Whether it's Asian, Mexican, and evidently now Greek, you are a bunch of cheap buggers who have no problem dropping money on some 'currently in and hip and new' hamburger joint (or any other corporate restaurant that is currently dropping their loads via new chains all over the US), but pay an extra buck or two for something else...you scream about getting screwed over because of the price.  Give it a break folks, and stop being so damn cheap.\n\nAlso, the staff is friendly, and I think they are actually greek... which is a good thing I guess.  They're all kind of hot also, including the guys...which never hurts.
