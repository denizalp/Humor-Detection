Have stayed at the Mandalay Bay a few times now, mostly for business conferences. The most recent was the weekend of 12\/11\/15-12\/13\/15 for health seminar. Lunch on 12\/12\/15 at 12:46, I had Mahi Tacos at CITIZENS which is in Mandalay Bay just outside the conference center. By dinner time I was very ill. Tried to ignore it and went to watch the UFC, had to literally run back to my room. This was the worst food poisoning I have ever had. Details, I will spare you. Called the front desk 3 AM, they sent paramedics. They checked my vitals. Declined transport to emergency due to my vitals being passable as long as I stayed hydrated. Next morning I missed the seminar and test (which cost me a lot of money). Filed a report with security. Was told Hotel would follow up with me. Never heard from them. Checked out, flew home, still extremely sick. Called Mandalay Bay multiple times in the following weeks, management Flat Out refused to speak to me. \"Risk Management\" gave me this email, if you can believe. mbh-riskmanagement@DENIED.com Unreal! Denied.com, really? Emailed, no response, called, no response. Still to this day, nothing. Spectacular customer service. Needless to say, Mandalay Bay nor their partners will ever get another dime from me or my family.
