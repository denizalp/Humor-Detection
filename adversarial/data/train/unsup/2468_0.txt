I have to give Vivace 5 stars for a number of reasons: \n\n1. Service is outstanding. Go here and you will be treated the way I wish EVERY restaurant in the world treated their customers-friendly and respectful staff, no snobbery either. \n\n2. The food. Here are just a few of my favorites: \n\nMussels: If you are a mussel fan, get these. A large portion of mussels (none of this 10 dinky mussels in a dinky cereal bowl type of thing). The broth is excellent. Want extra bread for dipping (recommended)...no problem! \n\nCured Meat and Cheese board: You can select a variety of cheeses and meats for a yummy appetizer. The staff has never steered me wrong when asking for a recommendation. \n\nWarm Bittersweet Chocolate Cake: I have come to Vivace solely for this dessert (after eating dinner elsewhere!). Be difficult like me, and ask for plain vanilla gelato, if they have it, in purist fashion. \n\nI have tried a variety of their entrees, the salmon and duck particularly stand out. Oh- and their brunch options are delish, and will cure even the sickliest of hangovers, with class of course. Portions are very nicely sized. The atmosphere is lively, modern, but still relaxed and un-stuffy. Please go to Vivace, it will not be your last visit.
