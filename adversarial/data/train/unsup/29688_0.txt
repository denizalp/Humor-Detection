I've been there twice and I love the food and atmosphere, you get a lots of food for what you pay . The service is ok I've never had any problem with services, the only things make me give it 2 out of 5 is the cleanness ,which is as important as food itself, the container on the table for condiments are dirty as well as the table itself, you can see coffee stains and finger prints all over the stuff on the table the basket of bread has a lots of greasy residue on them, I don't think they have been washed for a while , lots of food pieces on the floor. I would have give it 5 out 5 if the restaurant would clean up  better.
