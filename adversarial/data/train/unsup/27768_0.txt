I am so pleased with Amy's Bridal Makeup and Hair services!!! \nFrom the very beginning I contacted Amy she was very responsive to my inquiries, and accommodating to my schedule and place. \nShe made my makeup and hair for my Big Day, and also the makeup for my Mom and Mother-in-Law! Three of us looked absolutely astonishing that day! ()\nAmy came on time and with lots of energy and joy to work on us. She was extremely detailed oriented. Even when my eyebrows needed extra work she was always very patient. \nBefore leaving Amy even also helped me to wear the hoops for the dress, as it was a big one. Very kind and polite. \nOn the Big Day everyone complimented my look. I owe it to the great work and delicacy of Amy!!! \nI'm so so happy I found AM Makeup and Hair, so is my Mom and Mother-in-Law. \nGracias dear Amy!!! \nMay GOD bless and prosper you \nWe're happily married, you made our day more special
