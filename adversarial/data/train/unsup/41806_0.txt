A hidden gem which is not actually hidden, but always seems to never be crowded but has a steady stream of business.  I like the fact they have organic items there and even though it is not very big inside, it is very warm and a friendly environment.\n\nStopped in to have a meeting with a friend and it was nice and relaxing to just sit with a cup of coffee and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nI have never tried the sandwiches there but a lot of people came in and ordered food and the food look amazing.\n\nI like this place better then the other bigger chains as the coffee and tea selection here is better, healthier and the staff are very friendly.
