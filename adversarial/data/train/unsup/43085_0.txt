Located in strip mall next to Encore. I had gel mani and regular pedicure.  Kevin did pedicure, average job. \nBEN (owner) did a ghetto quality mani. It was nothing short of sloppy and disgusting. Ben stank of cigarette smoke, had yellow fingers. He used the power rotary tool to sand off gel polish even though I told him to use a soak, but he was pushy. I regret not stopping him. He ruined and severely thinned out my natural nails which are going to take months to grow out and recover. Hubby had a massage. That guy was equally gross. No sheets on the massage table and only put a towel because hubby insisted. There was a dirty pillow, and he squirted cold cream on my husband's back. He didn't know how to operate the music and played heavy-metal. My husband had to use his own iPhone to play spa music. Mid way, hubby stopped the guy and refused to continue because it was clear this guy had no massage training. Please save your money. This place is really really bad.
