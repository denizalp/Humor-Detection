Had a reservation for a specific car and was told it was not available, I am confused on why I even needed to reserve a car then? Anyways, when I waited in line he had stellar customer service with the person before me however when it got to me, he suddenly remember that he needed to report some numbers to his boss. He excused himself and I assumed it would be a quick email or something discreet. However it wasn't, it was a FaceTime call and he was unprofessional about it. Anyways I waited at the counter until they had their fun jokes and found out that the car I wanted wasn't available and he was going to put me in a different one. After questioning why it wasn't available, one similar suddenly came available. Not sure if they were trying to upsell me but it sure did feel like he was trying to get advantage of me due to the fact that I am a female. Of course the whole spill of purchasing their insurance was a back and fourth battle for a bit but I think that's normal for car rental places. If possible, stay away or stand your ground when handling them.
