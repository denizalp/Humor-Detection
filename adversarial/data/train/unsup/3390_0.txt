This is like the CVS of the large chains (Wal-Mart, Target)- only go here when there's a sale. Vicks VapoRub @ $7.00- regular price. Really?! Ridiculous.\n\nYou walk in and it's terribly outdated- you feel like you're in an older Albertson's or Von's store. It's depressing. The food aisles are really bad and minimal at best. (The selection at Target makes this one laughable.) We came here recently and didn't get anything in the food aisle. Higher prices also the norm in the food aisles. \n\nWhy are people still shopping here? Every time we pass by, there are a lot of cars in the parking lot. Must be the only store around. I'd rather go to the Walgreens down the street.
