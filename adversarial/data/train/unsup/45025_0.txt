Service and environment was fine. Portions were large for a fine dining establishment. That said, the food was only good. Grilled squid was tasty and large, but simple. It did have a good smokey grilled taste. The Skate ( stingray) main course was huge and well prepared but again kind of uneventful. Simple preparation is fine, but at this price I  expect more complexity and artistry.
