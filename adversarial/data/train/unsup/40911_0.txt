Pretty good place. First visit tonight, not something to write home about but not the worst either.\nFirst, the atmosphere can be quite loud like you would expect from a bar. It fills up in there so come early or you will be waiting.\nWear layers because its quite warm inside. The door offers a blast if cold air every now and then but overall warm.\nCarry cash or have your ATM card- they do have an ATM in the bar with only 1.00 fee so nothing outrageous.\nService was very slow. We asked for a straw with the water, never saw that. Also they do not have steak sauce so inward told I could get their homemade version, didn't see that either. It took quite a while for someone to notice we needed a box and bring the check.\nThe food, only bright spot in my visit. Excellent fish fry & hanger steak. \nI am sure I will return at some point but not my go-to spot.
