A few of my colleagues and I drove about 70 minutes round trip to try Happy Dog out for lunch...and we left happy.\n\nMy personal opinion is that the spot itself is a bit questionable. I am not a fan of the bar scene - and this place is definitely a bar - but it was clean, well laid out, and well staffed.\n\nThe ordering process left a bit to be desired: paper tablets where you configure your hot dog that, to avoid the confusion some of us suffered - should be considered as one page per hot dog. There was a list on the front of toppings and sides were presented on the back.\n\nI went with two dogs and the tots:\n\n#1 - hot dog with pimento mac and cheese and bourbon baked beans\n#2 - hot dog with yuengling kraut, truffle mustard and cheddar\n\nBoth were tasty (I only made it through 1.5), but #1 won me over and will be the reason for my return.\n\nI also tried the tater tots with the dusting of something-or-other and would recommend them as well.\n\nThe verdict overall: good dogs, inventive toppings, worth the trip for sure!
