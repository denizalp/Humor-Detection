Eye Love is a radiant beauty bar in a second-floor Queen Street loft. It has a clean, crisp ambiance created by an abundance of natural light and luminosity -- an atmosphere that is complimented by unique hue accents and classy, retro, and re-imagined furnishings. The service is also possibly the best in Toronto with an attentive, friendly, and highly skilled beautician who has obviously mastered her craft.\nI had my eyebrows done at Eye Love last month and have never been so impressed with the way they turned out. I have also never been properly matched with a pencil before I went to Eye Love (being fair haired). They really know what they're doing there -- I will definitely be back.
