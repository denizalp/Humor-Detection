I leave Chandler for a few years, and it turns to Scottsdale.\n\nBeing a fan of Chandler bars like the Pecos Lounge and ... well ... the Pecos Lounge, I was shocked to see this sqeaky-clean, themed, yuppie bar in a neighborhood that used to mean death for white people.\n\nAs my drinking buddy noted, \"I know it's an Irish pub, but do they need to beat you over the head with it?\" Green backlit alcohol displays, racist comedy on the video screens, Shamrocks and green crap all over the place ... please stop.\n\nAlso, I hate when bartenders need refer to a video screen to place my order and give me a total. It was a gin and tonic and a whiskey Coke. You should be able to do that in your head, take my money and let me go have fun.
