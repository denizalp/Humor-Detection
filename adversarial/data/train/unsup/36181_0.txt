We came here for a quiet Friday night date night. I was really pleased to see a nice variety of food on the menu. We ordered the kale salad, steak grilled cheese and the tomato bisque. Honestly the stand out was the soup. It was amazing. Service was also quite good. Prices are a little high, however the space is quite nice. There is a good bar area if you are interested in something more casual. I will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu!
