SO. Good. And dangerously close to my house.\n\nYogurtland has some awesome flavors, is always spotlessly clean (they even use those little mini vacuums to clean up the toppings off the counter) and has great service. All of the staff is always super nice to me, especially when I'm embarrassed that it's my second visit in one day.....\n\nThe only thing I would change is that they switch up the toppings every once in a while. Maybe some seasonal additions? \n\nRegargless, I'm always scraping my cup clean with my little pink spoon.
