Just moved into a new house and had tons and tons of boxes and packing material to get rid of.  After one trip to the dump, we decided that was way too much effort and it would have taken way too many trips making it not economical at all.  One quick call to Junk Removal and they came the next day and picked it all up in one fell swoop!  \n\nSuper nice guys and they even swept out the garage after they were done.  A service that was well worth it!
