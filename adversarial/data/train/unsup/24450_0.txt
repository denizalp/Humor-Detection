We came on a Tuesday night around 8PM and saw a lot of people dressed up. I expected this to be the \"crème de la crème\" of buffets at Vegas but was pretty disappointed by the food offered.\n\nService: Front desk was professional but not very warm or inviting ..... or happy. Maybe because they were overwhelmed by the number of people waiting to get in? Thankfully I had purchased a pass prior to going so I got to use the VIP line but even then I had to wait 15 minutes or so to be seated. Our server was Victor and he was FABULOUS -  An older gentleman who had wonderful stories, great sense of humor and was extremely accommodating - We love you VICTOR! If we come back it would be for him :D\n\nFood: Was surprisingly mediocre. I just expected more interesting things to try but everything was pretty basic with the exception of the Kobe carving station and tuna poki. I'm not a picky eater but with the price this place was charging you would expect better.
