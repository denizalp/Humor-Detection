I loved discovering this little green space while walking through the busy streets of Charlotte one Friday afternoon. Located near the end of the \"business\" side, off Tryon, The Green has it all. Short walking paths, scattered seating, both shaded and in the sun, a clean public restroom, water (in the form of fish fountains as well as water fountains) to put you into a peaceful mood or run through. And, my favorite part, beautiful, artistic sculptures and eye catching signs. \n\nLook for the hop-scotch pattern to play a game or the lovely Mediterranean concrete pillow seating. If you're a lover of poetry or literature, you'll appreciate the many author influences and sentiments. The Green is a perfect spot to run into accidentally and take a breath of fresh air while still being in the middle of busy downtown (actually uptown!) Charlotte. Lay down in the grassy null and rest awhile or visit one of the handful of shops and restaurants that surround the green space; they even have a mini-museum if you want a tiny (very, very tiny) taste of the big guys across the street.
