The service was exceptional. We had two Celiac diners who ordered the gluten-free fried chicken. It takes twenty minutes so make sure you have time. There was a mistake on the order and you can tell that doesn't happen often as the whole management staff came to our table to apologize. Best fried chicken in Vegas. A half chicken order can feed two people.
