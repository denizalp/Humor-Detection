I have to agree with the previous reviewer, Scott C, on the customer service at this Sally's. \n\nA couple of months ago I was in the market for some hair chalk and basic accessories for a costume. I had just come from Ulta across the street and was greeted by the nicest gals there. And although they didn't have everything I needed, they made up for it in their attention and service. \n\nI then headed to this Sally's across the street and was treated like they were annoyed I was there. Two ladies were very busy restocking and doing what looked like a floor set (changing displays, etc.) You know... things that are normally not done during normal business hours. So, when I asked for hair chalk and hair ties, I found myself tensing up in anticipation of the attitude I was going to receive. With a sigh and obvious disdain, the girl who looked like she was in charge responded with showing me one, dusty package of pink hair chalk. Then she told me that they don't carry ANY hair ties beyond basic black rubber bands, which I know couldn't possibly be true. \n\nInstead of spending extra time in the store looking myself, I immediately left. I didn't feel welcomed or wanted. Therefore, I didn't want to spend my money there. \n\nSally's really needs to work on who they're hiring as associates because that's the worst service I've received in a long, long time.
