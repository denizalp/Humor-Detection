Yeah, it's nice there are a lot of veggie options, but I feel like they are spreading themselves too thin.  No one I went with was really impressed with their food, and the weird thing was that the waitress brought out half the table's food, making a few people wait.  Anyone who's been a waitress knows not to do that.  I do appreciate tempeh, seitan and tofu on menus, but it would be nice if they did it well.
