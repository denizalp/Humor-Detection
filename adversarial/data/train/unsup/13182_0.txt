Only had a few drinks here before, but never tried the food until recently. The braised beef tacos were about seven bucks for two - ala carte style - and they received only average reviews. My chicken Pannini was way better as it is a bar favorite according to bartender. This sandwich had some good elements including guac and a tomato spread on decent bread. The fries were made non-garlic for me and were hot and decent. This is basically a good place to pick up women also if your young. We saw some dude at the bar easily grab the number of a redhead and it was only 8pm or so - good job by him.
