This Provigo is located in the new Carr√© Lucerne shopping area, and honestly, I really enjoy doing my groceries there...Why? Apart from the fact that I can access it by foot, I must confess that it is really well thought out. The Provigo is built on two floors, the first one is used exclusively for shopping carts, which is great especially during the winter season, no need to wander in the parking lot to get one, everything happens inside and you can go upstairs with it easily, there are not only elevators and escalators for customers but also escalators for shopping carts! My kids love it, but maybe not for the right reasons lol ... In terms of groceries, this Provigo offers a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables and a nice caterer section, I love their take away soups ... And of course the service is second to none.
