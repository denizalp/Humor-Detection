I like M Nail Salon! The salon is clean and the folks that work there are always nice, including the owners. I use to go to the sister place Envy but this location is closer for me and parking at the other location was a hassle. I agree that wait times could be better (one way to avoid this is to go during off peak times like avoid lunch or after work) but this is for sure one of the better places in the area for nails. Great selection of OPI, Etsy and Chinaglaze plus gel. They take credit cards though not sure if you can include tip - I always tip in cash.
