I was quoted 30-45 minutes for a wheel change (I had all the necessary parts). The process took an hour, and the moment I arrived at the register to ask about the status of my service, the person quickly handed me the keys. This makes me wonder how long he's actually had my keys for.\n\nHe told me the price and handed me no invoice. Then I was charged for a tire disposal service of $3.50 even though nothing was disposed. I asked for a refund and he gave it back to me. I really don't like that.\n\nI went back to my car and noticed that they replaced my metal valve stem cap with a shitty plastic one. I also didn't like that. I went back into the shop and asked for my original cap, and they quickly gave it back to me.\n\nThis seems like a very dishonest place and I'm not a fan of providing my car, which is something I love and pay detailed attention to, to a company that doesn't seem to pay attention to the details and was dishonest to me three times in one hour.
