Wow, don't waste your time even viewing this apartment complex! Never have I been treated so rudely! When I called about this apartment a very nice man named Jefferson answered the phone and set up a time for me to view the apartment. I went In and viewed the apartment and then decided I wanted to apply. I stated that I made enough income to apply by myself. This manager comes over to Jefferson's desk and leans in real close to me questioning my income. I let her know I would be more than happy to provide any necessary paperwork\/paystubs they would need. As if this lady couldn't get any closer she leans in and starts an argument with me saying that there is no possible way I make enough income by only working the weekends. when I reassure her once AGAIN that I do make the required income as I am a manager at a hair salon receiving a salary pay she gives me a dirty look and continues to argue with me stating that  she will go over every piece of document I provide with a fine tooth comb. I replied to her saying okay that's fine. She then continued to argue with me so I got up to leave because apparently my money wasn't green enough. Jefferson being the sweetheart that he was offered me to take the application with me and I told him no. So glad I didn't even waste my money on an application fee. These apartments are outdated and over priced for the area. If you are looking for a place go check out Almeria they are super professional and very updated!
