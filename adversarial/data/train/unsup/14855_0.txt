Being from Los Angeles, we have so many trendy burger places popping up that use all sorts of random, fancy ingredients.  These places tend to be 'hit or miss' with me, as I never know if I am going to like their secret ingredients that make their burgers so special.  What I liked about eating at BLT Burger was that most of their selection was made up of standard ingredients that you can find at most burger places.  BLT Burger separates itself from other places by using high quality products instead of obscure ingredients to create unique, tasty flavors.  \n\nMy meal here consisted of a BLT burger and sweet potato fries.  The burger was very good.  All of the ingredients tasted fresh and very flavorful.  The sweet potato fries were a bit too shriveled, and I would have preferred for them to be chunkier.  However, they were still very good, and my wife kept raving about them.  \n\nI also noticed a lot of people ordering shakes, and I probably would have done the same if it wasn't such a cold day.  They looked amazing, and seemed to be a very popular item.  The next time I go back, I will get a shake for sure.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal at BLT Burger.  It was nice to have a really good burger with out all of the trendy hype.  I can't wait to have BLT Burger again the next time I am in Vegas!
