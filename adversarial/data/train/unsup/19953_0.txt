Usually when I get off the plane from San Francisco to Vegas, my ultimate commute, I need a beverage. I don't like to drink that much on the plane anymore, even though I love landing buzzed (makes me less nervous and medicated when I think I'm going to die). \n\nI'll usually drop by my palace (aka The Palazzo for those who don't know yet) and head on over to the Wynn in order to sit down at Parasol Up, and sometimes downstairs outside at Parasol Down. Same place basically, just whether or not you're ready to be separated from your gambling addiction yet (inside upstairs) or want to be in front of the second waterfall (downstairs). \n\nBar snacks are nasty in my opinion. Couldn't get any worse unless you're broke, starving, or incredibly drunk already. I love the snacks at this place. Tasty little oriental mixes, and not the cheap ones. Delicious wasabi covered peas, and seaweed wrapped little goodies, along with some peanuts and such. Delicious, and goes great with, well, any alcoholic drink in my opinion. \n\nI'm a strong drink kinda girl. I like to get things done, no pussy footin' around here with me, but I love their mojitos. Fresh sugar cane sticks and perfectly muddled mint. I have them make 'em wicked strong. Just killer. I drank six last time I was there. Let's just say I had an excellent time on the pole that night at Tryst. Just excellent. I bet that night was fun to watch, huh boys?
