We love coming here for brunch. Be sure to call in if your party is bigger than 2, it's normally a 10 minute wait for a couple of people. It's always packed so service can get a little backed up. We sat at the patio yesterday, they have heaters, don't worry. I prefer to sit inside though, better to people watch while you wait for food.\n\nI like to start off with a hot chocolate and those heavenly love cakes. The love cakes are soft but flavorful black bean cakes smothered in tasty salsa verde and topped with a dollop of sour cream and feta cheese crumbles. This is literally my favorite item on the menu and it doesn't make you feel bad for eating it. The chicken sausage gravy is my runner up fav menu item, it's so good with everything, especially home fries.\n\nI normally order the smoked salmon scramble or the souther biscuit Benedict if I want to get crazy full. I only really like the Benedict if I take it home and reheat it. The salmon scramble has this amazing cream cheese and dill sauce. We've also got the side of grilled Mac and cheese, it's ok but needs some seasoning. The biscuits and huge and chalky, you will need gravy, butter, or jam to get through it. \n\nWorth the wait, must try at least once.
