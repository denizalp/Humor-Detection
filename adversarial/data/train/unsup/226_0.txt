Walking in, the girl at the counter was telling people to just sit wherever as there was no particular order. Few minutes go by and another girl comes out and makes everyone move seats because there apparently was an order; obviously the employees don't communicate with each other. \nCustomer service is non-existent. Budtenders have no interest in recommending\/describing different strains. The tatted out skinny Hispanic looking woman \"helped\" my girlfriend and me out by asking us what we wanted. We just wanted one pre-roll and she responded with, \"just ONE pre-roll?\" Very condescending tone from her. \n\nI was going to give a bad rating, however; since none of the employees seem to care enough to double check what they put in customer's bags, we ended up with three extra pre-rolls for free.\n\nThanks Thrive for your buy one, get three free special on pre-rolls.
