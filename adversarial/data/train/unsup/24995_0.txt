I'm from Southern California, and I was in town for business. \n\nI watched ABC on Kitchen Nightmares, and I had to drop by to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nThe show didnt do this place justice. The restaurant was extremely clean. I wish restaurants here in california were clean as ABC. \n\nThe owner Sammy was very accommodating and went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. I had my dog with me, and he went into the back to bring him a treat. He was extremely nice. \n\nThe desserts are amazing. Very delicious. I strongly recommend them.\n\nI really feel bad for this place. The owners take a lot of passion and care into this restaurant. The restaurant deserves a higher rating, but filled with reviews from people who only watched the show and never visited the place in person. \n\nI was caught by surprised how great this place was. I will definitely drop by again.
