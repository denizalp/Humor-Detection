We came to this hotel because we were so fixated on the pink dome attached to it.  We had also heard that it had actual free circus acts so we decided to go give it a try.  At first glance the casino seems very dingy.  I do not think they have good ventilation as this casino had the worst smell of smoke that literally brought tears to my eyes.  The circus acts were entertaining but dont expect Barnum and Bailey.  We didnt have time to venture into the adventure park but based on what we experienced, there are better Casinos to visit.
