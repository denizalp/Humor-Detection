Solid for shawarma. Staff can be a little brusque, but it's the only place out of the Bay area to get a good stuffed pita that isn't an Americanized wrap or made with store-bought bread. Ask for it with everything, but beware it includes spicy sauce that overpowers at times. \n\nAs stated in Sheila's review, the chicken itself is a bit of a mystery- can't tell if it's dark meat or white meat, it's flavorful but a bit on the odd side and I can't place my finger on why. \n\nIf shawarma ain't your thing, menu includes a lot of options, including falafel, schnitzel, and $3 AYCE salads, as well as plates.
