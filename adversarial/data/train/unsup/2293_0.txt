This place is classic, the food is great. The service is horrible, hence why it's getting 2 stars from me. I believe service to be a critical component of the dining experience. \n\nThe manager is extremely rude and not at all accommodating. I tried to organize a dinner party for about 30 people here, the manager told me that he was unwilling to accommodate a party of our size during dinner. He said we could come at 5:30 or at 9 because our party would take up too much space and he had other patrons to think about. Guess what manager, you just turned 30 people guaranteed to order 30 dinners... Idiot. \n\nI've never been spoken to so rudely. I'll never come here again. There are several steakhouse in the Las Vegas area, no need to come to this one and be treated like crap.
