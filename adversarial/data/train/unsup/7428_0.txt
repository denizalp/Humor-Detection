I hike part of the Shoreline Trail several times each winter when the temperatures permit.  The Shoreline Trail stretches from the former Las Vegas Bay boat launch area to the 3 Islands Overlook at 33 Hole about 2 miles south.\n\nWhen I hike this trail, it's because I'm hiking through what's known as White Owl Canyon and after going through some pipes to get to the old road, I return to the car by joining the Shoreline Trail about a mile from the parking area for 33 Hole and the 3 Islands Lookout.\n\nSome volunteers have done some nice work over the last couple of years by placing boulders along the trail so one knows where to go.  This section has changed over the 7 years or so that I've been hiking the trail.  The boulders work now because the level of the lake has fallen so much there's little danger that the trail will be covered by water and the rocks become useless.  In fact, it has been very discouraging to watch the level of the lake drop so much that you now have to leave the trail to get to the edge of a stream that was once the lake.\n\nIt is nice to see the water fowl and it's a pleasant hike when temperatures permit.
