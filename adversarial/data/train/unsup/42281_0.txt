Wonderful dining experience. The ambiance is great as it feels like you're at a dinner party at someone's house. I really enjoyed all the food we ordered - the baked goat cheese was perfectly flavored, the truffle polenta was appropriately rich, and the korma tacos were surprisingly tasty. The coffee creme brûlée desert was also a hit, not overly sweet and perfectly textured. The service was great and it was nice to see the owner coming around and introducing herself. Overall, a great neighborhood restaurant that I hope  to frequent again.
