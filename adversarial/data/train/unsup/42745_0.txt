I bought a Groupon for 3 massages here. The first two I was pleased with but when I went in for the 3rd, the massage therapist told me the business had changed their practices and what I had signed up for was relaxation massages and she had given me therapeutic massages the first two times and it would be an additional $10 today. \n\nAt this point, I felt the whole situation was unprofessional and a bait and switch type of thing. I got up and walked out and told them to consider my Groupon fulfilled and I would not be back. \n\nAt no point during the first two massages did the therapist ever note that I had signed up for specific kind of massage nor did I ask her to do different type... If I signed up for one type that is what she should have given me from the beginning. Very unprofessional.
