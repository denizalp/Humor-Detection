I needed to get a photo done for a Brazil visa that I was applying for. I was impressed that he knew the photo dimensions that were required - these are non-standard 2x2 photos that are different than regular passport photos. My wife went to get hers done somewhere else and got photos that were the wrong dimensions. This guy definitely knows his stuff. Conveniently located right by the subway entrance\/exit. True to his word, the photos were printed within 3 minutes and I was out the door. He also fixes watches, sells home phones and other stuff. Nice guy and great service. The photos were $16.95 + HST. You can find lower prices, but I'm happy with the service and convenience.
