I will probably go here a lot more times in This Year Of The Monkey 2016, but I will not order the fucking Xiao Long Bao here. There is no soup in the soup dumplings. Just so you all know, getting soup in your dumpling is the same as winning your date. Like, seriously, it is adorable already because it's a dumpling. Like, \"hey girl, you wanna get dumplings?\" is like best boyfriend award material already. But then there's delicious rich broth that pours out when you nibble it.\n\nBut When the lady wants dumplings and we go get XLB and she sees dried dumplings her heart breaks. Now, I have to deal with that heartbreak. I could, say, tell her that we got the wrong order (we didn't). I could hold her in my arms while she eats what is decidedly not XLB. She would probably be crying, but I wouldn't see it because I'm sensitive and I'd be crying, too. She could turn over the table in disgust and I could protest along with her. Rargh. I love my boo, so at the end of the day, I can't think of a way to love Nani.\n\nPlease fix this, Nani. I tell my friends about you and how you have so many good traits, but your soup dumps are the worst, so like. Whatever.
