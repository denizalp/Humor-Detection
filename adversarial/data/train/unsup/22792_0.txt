When in Vegas, I always stop by Cabo Wabo. Not too sure why because we have one in LA. I've always remember this place to have a friendly staff. Eh, not this time around. I don't know if the staff was burnt out from partying the previous night but some looked like they have make up on from last night. The host are point of contact and I'm huge on customer service. The girls in the front have NO personality what so ever. Rude, no smile, plain straight face that looked like they own that damn podium stand, haha. Another girl who handled the drinks in the front looked at me up and down and rolled her eyes. Whoa, girl I was just wear a trench coat completely covered up. Seriously?! What kind of restaurant? Eh, when in VEGAS, I'll leave cabowabo alone. 2 stars for good wings, less 3 stars for terrible customer service.. I mean who wants to deal with attitude before even getting served.
