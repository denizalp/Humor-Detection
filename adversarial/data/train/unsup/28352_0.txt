Ordered General Tso's House Special Chicken and Beef Chow Mein Noodles for delivery. \n\nThe food got hear really fast. Less than 45 minutes. But that's about the only good thing I can say about JC Cuisine. \n\nThe General Tso's Chicken was dry and didn't taste fresh. If you've ever ordered a Chinese dish that's battered and fried like this you know the taste goes downhill fast if it sits out. \n\nThis General Tso's Chicken tasted like it was sitting out before being delivered. \n\nThe Beef Chow Mein Noodles were even more tragic...\n\nThey were flavorless. Even worse, the noodles were only half cooked. It was like chewing on thin strands of raw dough. \n\nThere are a lot of good Chinese restaurants in Vegas so I won't be going back here.
