Well. I realized that I am LONG overdue for my first-ever review update, and what better place than Double Wide, a place that I went from loathing to loving. (Okay, not *loathing* so much as *being kind of weirded out by and disappointed in*. But definitely to *loving*!)\n\nEvery year, I help run the Pittsburgh chapter of National Novel Writing Month. We are an unruly bunch of writers, some of us meat eaters, some vegan, some of us gluten free, and all of us really really hungry before the month begins in November. So, we gather at the end of each October to get together and eat and chat before the stress of the month turns us into a bunch of crazy sleepless writers.\n\nOur old spot was no longer working out, so a friend recommended we try Double Wide a few years back. I was skeptical - my initial visit in 2011 was less than enthralling - but I agreed to try. A small group of us went in for brunch to eat and chat with the staff about hosting our event. \n\nI have never once regretted our decision to start using Double Wide as our Kick-Off Party headquarters, and we have been back three years in a row now.\n\nOur group ranges from 25-40 people, and each year, the staff has handled us with ease. Lots of menu options to choose from? No problem. Separate checks? They don't bat an eye. Special menu items for our friends with dietary restrictions? They are ON IT.\n\nI really can't say enough good things about the staff. They are just fantastic, from the management, to the servers, to the chefs who put out all sorts of tasty snacks.\n\nSeeing as how I can't teleport back to my experience in 2011 and check myself, I'm going to assume that we just visited on an off-night, because it's been nothing but awesome on our last several visits to Double Wide.\n\n#1. The salads are huge and terrific and come with CORNBREAD. A+++++\n\n#2. In the summer, you can come mid-bike ride on the GAP and they don't care if you are smelly as heck!\n\n#3. YOUR DOG CAN COME HAVE DINNER WITH YOU IN THE SUMMER. (Haven't tried this one out yet, but the first nice day of 2017, Miss Layla Grace is hitting up the Double Wide patio!)\n\n#4. Drinks are cheap and yummy.\n\n#5. Seriously the service is the best. Every server is amazing.\n\n#6. They are not scared off by your massively large unruly group, and they are easy to get in touch with, easy to schedule, and they follow up and everything is heaven for scheduling.\n\n#7. They will refill your water ten billion times during dinner, and I know this seems like a minor detail, but it is actually very important. Because, you know, hydration for your health and all that. ::love::\n\nSo yes. I'm still not huge on the trailer park decor, but WHATEVER I'm a convert and I love this place. Thank you, Double Wide, for welcoming me back after a not-very-impressed first visit and showing me that there is beauty in the South Side after dark. :)
