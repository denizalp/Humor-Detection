We were seated right away, clean restaurant, awesome Jamaican Cowboy cocktail and my steak salad was wonderful. Our server, Matthew, was the best waiter we've had in awhile. Matthew gets 5 stars!! He made recommendations we were happy with and kept checking on us. We're just visiting the area but would definitely come back again.
