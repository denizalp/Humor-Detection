This medium size hip-hop \/ karaoke bar used to be pretty fun when it was Big D's but over the last couple of years has deteriorated rapidly. \n\nI am not commenting on the karaoke side of the bar or the weekday traffic as those have always been decent. I do have a serious problem with how the hip-hop side of the bar draws in real riff raff. I have no problem with hip-hop but when someone gets shot in the parking lot at closing time I tend not to return.\n\nThe patrons on weekends are thuggish. The drinks come at an ok speed. The main side of the bar (hip-hop side) is often a bit over crowded. This bar has no business charging a cover fee it is not even close to nice enough for that.
