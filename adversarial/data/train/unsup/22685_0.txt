Open the door and prepare to be amazed. The unassuming strip mall location hides an incredible interior of crystals, candles, herbs, incense, and more, in a beautiful store. Displays of religious statues and beautiful art coexist with a selection of used books and every kind of spell ingredient you've ever heard of, along with some jewelry. \n\nPolite and soft-spoken staff are happy to help you find whatever you need. Limited crystal selection. I found it curious that there are several fun gifts sprinkled throughout the store, giving what could be an intimidating shop a bit of character but some may find it disrespectful. Items appear to be of very good quality, and many have labels that they are organic, handmade, or locally made items, such as the aromatherapy candles, bath salts, and incense blends. Prices skew on the high side.\n\nThere are several closed-off areas of the store where different services are provided like tarot readings, reiki, and such. A sign at the door indicates that various workshops and classes are also held here. This isn't necessarily my kind of place, but they definitely have beautiful and unique items you aren't likely to find elsewhere.
