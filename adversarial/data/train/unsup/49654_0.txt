I've been here a couple times, they always do a great job!  Today I chose the OPI pedicure which includes an aromatic scrub ( choice of scent), foot mask, hot stone massage and hot towel. The leg massage was so relaxing!  They can do whatever design you like,  I usually find one on Pinterest and they can copy it.  Great service,  friendly people and good prices!
