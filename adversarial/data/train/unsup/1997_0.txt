NCIX has opened up a few retail stores in GTA. It is really a web-based computer hardware retailers that concentrated their sales and effort in Greater Vancouver Area but now they are trying for the GTA market.\n\nThe website is really helpful and informative... it is great to do all the research online, do price comparison and then now you can in fact go into a store and talk to someone face to face if you have questions.\n\nDropped by the store on a cold winter night and they do have notebook, desktop and accessories on display... price seems to be inline with other stores...\n\nThe reason I giving NCIX a 3 star is because the sale associates here were super nice... even I look like someone not going to buy anything or not even know what I am looking for... he came over and gave me a desktop calender. I know it does not worth much... but it is really the thoughts that count??!\n\nNow at least I have a good impression of the business and if I am looking for something... NCIX will be one of the business I will consider!
