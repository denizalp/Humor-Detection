This place is a very very sad excuse for retail and a great reason to shop on line in order to avoid the attitude of the employees.  My wife purchased a dress and with in twenty (24) hours, my wife attempted to return the dress due to it not fitting properly.  \nUpon her arrival to the retail location @ Kierland Commons, and making contact with the clerk at the time, my wife was treated like a 2nd class citizen upon making her requested for a refund on the dress that she purchased!  A simple $89 dress is all that is was\/is.  The clerk then went in a f%*}ing rant on how the previous employee should bid advises my wife that there are no returns or exchanges.  \nTalk about being slighted by a retail company!!!\nThank God for Amex and being aCenturion Member, as Amex is handling this issue.
