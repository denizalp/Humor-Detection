We have been here a few times. The food is ok. I find all the large chains like BP's, Tony Roma's, etc. offer average quality dishes that look good in the pictures. We had a 20% off coupon to use so we still ate here. \n\nI had a steak dish, it was again ok. The steak wasn't seasoned that well, but it was cooked the way I requested. It came with a small cup of beans and a loaded baked potato that wasn't bad, but you could tell it and the plate had been ready for awhile and sat under a heat lamp.  \n\nMy wife had the ribs with mashed potatoes that also sat under a heat lamp for awhile. She also added the kapow shrimp which tasted pretty good. For an extra $5 you could get this in an all you can eat side. \n\nI will say the prices for the entrees are a few dollars cheaper than many other places and the service was good, they checked on us many times.
