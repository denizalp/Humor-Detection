We stop be here for lunch from time to time. Always delicious! We get the smoked chicken & brisket combo. Their fried okra is a must try. \nThis Thanksgiving we ordered their Turkey Dinner! WOW!!! The turkey was incredible! And with all the side dishes we fed 6 with leftovers! Highly recommend! \nService is good!
