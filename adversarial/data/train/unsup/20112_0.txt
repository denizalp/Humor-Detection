A friend told me about this place. Just off of Vic Park, just north of Finch. So, I made a stop in today. I think that Nicey's chicken roti is going to be a new Christmas Eve lunch tradition for me. \n\nThe roti was not too big, not too small. I inhaled this bad boy. So good. Perfect consistency, and they don't try to put potato in to create filler in their roti's. For just under $8, you can get a fabulous chicken roti that will fill you up and put a glorious blissful smile on your face. And now....I need a nap! \n\nThis plaza is a one stop hoppin spot. Next time when I stop by I am going to check out the grocer next door (Nicey's Food Mart). \n\nNote that this take-out does catering as well. The line up was out the door (at 2 pm), but I didn't have to wait too long. Also note that there is no place to sit down and eat, so you will see some happy people eating in their vehicles. \n\nMy only disappointment...no doubles : ( \n\nDebit is accepted at Nicey's. \n\nBe sure to check out the website - they even offer up some of their recipe's!
