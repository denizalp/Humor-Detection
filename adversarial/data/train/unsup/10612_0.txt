The Europe is a lot like The Country Style on Bloor West, but with more space to move around in. (Which is useful after eating their food.)  Hungarian food has fallen out of favour with health conscious people, With good reason, the portions are enormous and heavy on the meat and grease. It used to be popular with poor students but is no longer particularly cheap or vegetarian friendly. The restaurants on Bloor between Spadina and Bathurst are mostly all gone, replaced by sushi restaurants. I'm glad the Europe on Lawrence and Bathurst is still upholding the tradition. The food is great! you can get schnitzel with dumplings, goulash, cheese noodles, strudel and palacinta (a crepe with walnuts or jam inside).
