Jeff was awesome! I was able to make an appointment very quickly with him. He arrived on time, send me a message on his way over, and was very quick with fixing my brakes! He also has very fair and reasonable prices. He walked me through everything over the phone and was very thorough. I would HIGHLY recommend Jeff to anyone needing a mechanic.
