First time visiting today. We went at lunchtime and ordered pad Thai and beef broccoli.  It was busy and the food took awhile to arrive.  Both the food and service was ok.  I've had much better beef and broccoli - meet was overcooked and flavorless.  There are so many good reviews and it's a DDD stop so we may give it one more try....
