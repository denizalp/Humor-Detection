Just finished dinner at Bottiglia, when ever I come here I enjoy it every time! Kobee was our server for the evening and he really made it a memorable experience. He recommended a great rose and we ended up buying the bottle which entered us into there wine club! The chicken parmesan was my fave!! I love this restaurant!
