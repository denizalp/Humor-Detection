My daughter just came back from attending a children's party.\n(March 10, 2018)\nCustomer service was really bad. Worst customer service.\nMy 7 year old said she waited a long long time and felt she was ignored.\nwhen i asked my husband who was with her..\nHe too, confirmed what happened.\nit was indeed true..\nthey were the 2nd guest to arrive and my daughter told the attendant that she wanted the \"Butterfly\" to paint, which was one of the choices.\nThey waited, and waited and waited..\nguest came in and was given right away with their pattern to start working on. All the guest had arrived, the last guest came and the table was filled. \nThe 1st one who painted was done with his work..\nand my daughter was still waiting for her pattern  to paint.\nNobody from the staff, ever told her to wait.\nwhen it finally arrived, the whole time my daughter was working on her\ncanvass, nobody from the 4 attendants who was there ever asked them, How they are doing. You could hear them asking every now and then from the rest of the guest but NOT with my daughter and my husband who was beside her.\nwhen my daughter told me what happened, i called the Paint and Party right away.\nOf course, she remembered them.( the one i spoke on the phone)\nShe said,\n \"it just took her a while to get a pattern for the butterfly , and she said the guest who came late asked for an easier patterns.\n\"WHY would you include a Butterfly in your choices, if it would take you forever to get it.?\"\nand her answer , why NOBODY from the 4 attendants asked them.\n\"Because, she was doing okey\".\n\nfor a 7 year old who felt she was ignored and felt they did it to her because She was different from the rest of guest was a big NO NO.\n\n\nAnna
