Between the $20\/hr foot massage or $30\/hr deep tissue, go for the $30\/hr one. It will be the best $30 you spend & best hour of your day, guaranteed. And tip the ladies at LEAST $10. They do an incredible job & for the price, they definitely deserve it. We usually tip $20 because here in Hawaii, an hour massage of this quality would cost at least $50\/hr & that doesn't even include tip. Also, if you use a credit\/debit card they'll charge you a $0.50 transaction fee but compared to all the money you'll blow at the casinos gambling, drinking & eating, it's nothing.\n\nMy bf & I have come here every time we visit Vegas as we found the employees are friendly, the place is clean & the head to toe massage is the best out of all the places we tried in Chinatown. We always have a room with 2 comfortable massage table\/bed with a curtain separating us from the other beds. Never had a problem with hearing other customers or feeling like we didn't have enough privacy. The masseuse always checks how you like the pressure & is very attentive to your problem areas. They even use hot stones on your back. It's pretty great.\n\nIf you plan on coming back (which you should) they offer a stamp card that gives you your 11th massage free after you buy 10. Definitely a great deal.
