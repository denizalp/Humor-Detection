Well the fact that's its only 10.00 a month for a fully functional gym is pretty good. The fact that's its also 24 hours is another plus. There are numerous machines to burn calories and get your cardio on. Rows and rows of treadmills and elliptical. The bathrooms I must say are maintained every other hour and are very clean for the most part. Not a big weight selection as far as free weights are concerned. No flat benches and random handles to the pulley machines scattered on the floor. Other than that, my complaint would only be that during the peak times about 1800-2100 it can get really crowded. I go in the morning about 0500 to avoid the rush. Other than that it does everything I need it to.
