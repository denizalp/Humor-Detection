DROPOUT FOR A REASON...\n(3.25 stars)\n\nWell, one needs to re-enroll and learn how to plate dishes.\n\n\nAfter several rounds of slots at the Hard Rock cafe, we came to Culinary Dropout to get something to eat. It wasn't our first choice or a priority, it was a place that came to mind last minute. I'll be honest, I didn't have any expectation. When we entered the restaurant it was pretty empty. I'd expect a little more of a crowd knowing ReHab is just around the corner. What I noticed was the minimal selection on the menu, nothing caught my eye. With no appetite and no prior research of \"what should I order\", I picked something quick and simple off the menu. Our table had fried chicken (heard it was good - didn't taste it), french toast (took a bite, pretty good!), and my order....\n\nTHAI CHILE CHICKEN WINGS - cashew, toasted sesame, cabbage, and lime. First and foremost, presentation was UGLY. Why would you blanket the wings with Asian coleslaw. I had to dig through the messy Asian coleslaw just to see a wing. Digging for chicken wings. The wings aren't the dry wings, they are coated with sauce. The sauce on the wings and on coleslaw are the same and it's that repetitive Asian sauce you see at many American restaurants on Asian dishes. After a bite into the wings, I was presently surprised that I actually enjoyed it. The coating on the wings weren't too thick but it does require napkins and wipes afterwards. \n\nI don't think I'll return because there are far more restaurants in LV to explore next visit. \n\nUntil the next review....
