I would call this place \"fresh and tasty\" if I was in charge of naming, because lets face it, I have no idea how to pronounce the name. And Fresh and Tasty would not be an ironic hipster named place, a place teeming with thick-rimmed glasses, Ben Gibbard look-alikes, and MacBooks, because Ariyoshi is fresh and.... wait for it.... i see you shiver with antici....pation..... tasty.\n\nI got the chicken teriyaki and my date got faux-sushi (i.e. no fish were harmed in their making). I was impressed with both. The chicken was well cooked, and the sauce was amazingly good. The miso soup was miso soup-esque, so if miso is you thing, dig in. My entire plate was wonderful.\n\nMy date's shrimp and crab roll things were reasonably priced for sushi and good as well. But I was too busy trying to fumble around with chopsticks and get rice to fill my gaping maw. \n\nThe service was also amazing. Our server was always around without that weird hovering thing that waiters seem to love to do at places.
