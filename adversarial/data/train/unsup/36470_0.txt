This place is awesome!\n\nAs you may be able to tell from my other reviews, I am a beef eater. One of my vegan friends took me here on whim, so I figured I would try it and likely not like it. Boy was I wrong!!\n\nI have had so many incredible meals here, I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this place is. How do they make beans \/ soy taste like the most perfect piece of chicken I have ever had - I am unsure.\n\nThe best thing I think I had had, was a special. It was mock duck done in a french style - called \"the donald.\" I am a huge duck fan - and this did not disappoint. I strongly recommend you try this place, and go back often to try new dishes. I have yet to find a dish I did not like.
