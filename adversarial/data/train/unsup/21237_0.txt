I'm here in town visiting and I scheduled an emergency hair dye last minute with Raina. I has also hurt my back this morning so it took me a while longer to get ready and I was running late. I called to let them know and they were very understandable. I get here and the salon is super cute! Raina consults me first and is being honest but I need it! Ha. I attempted a DIY hair color. Raina explained everything and what I needed to do to make my hair healthy again. She was very attentive informative and nice! Very decently priced as well. I will be coming back just to get my hair done with her! Nice cut, nice color, nice styling! Highly recommend!
