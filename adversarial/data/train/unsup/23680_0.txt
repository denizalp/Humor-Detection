The people here are cool and nice.\n\nEight months ago I asked for a white ink tattoo. \n\nWhen obtaining a white ink tattoo, it's imperative that the tattoo artist knows not to press the stencil down too hard, which is exactly what this artist did. I really liked these guys but seriously, I have what looks like a cross between a burn scar\/ half charchole imprint\/ on my wrist. It's like this gray sottering mark. It's not even a little bit white. \n\nIt isn't like I can ask for a new goddamn arm, and I'm not going to put some colored shit over it, because it's my wrist. I went in to have them fix it once and all it did was scar it. \n\nUsually people exclaim \"Oh, my GOD - what did you do to your arm?!?!\" Or my favorite \n\n\"Wow what phase of tattoo removal are you in for that? Does the laser removal hurt.\" \n\nHonestly, I have a sense of humor about it all. What the fuck am I going to do ya know? \n\nI've seen the work these guys have done on other people and it's awesome, but honestly, every time I look at my arm I have to force myself to laugh at how awful it is - and at least take down my 5 star review of this place.
