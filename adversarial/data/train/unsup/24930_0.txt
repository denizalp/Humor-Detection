I believe physicians all across America need to pull out their prescription pads and recommend a healthy dose of \"casino action\" for their patients who lost the zest for life. Lets face it, people in the US are over medicated and with a mere 40 hour work week they have too much time on their hands.\n\nI believe people should work 60 hours a week. Six days a week at 10 hours a day. That would keep people out of trouble - they wouldn't have time to feel down let alone go to the doctors office. Sunday you would have off but you go to church and work some more as a volunteer only with no pay. Well, given I don't run things luckily you have a cushy 40 hour work week and two whole days off. I recommend you book at stay at CP and make the most of it.\n\nThis is time sensitive - you need to drop everything and make reservations fast. The end of summer is soon approaching and you've been thirsting for relief from the rut you are in. Dump the kids at grandmas and hop in plane, train or any other kind of transportation and get over here without delay.\n\nUpon arrival you will be overwhelmed with luxury, excitement and all your ills will fade. Your center strip in the best location that Vegas has to offer. Beautiful rooms, delicious food, some night life and interesting people from all over the world to get to know.\n\nIn the afternoon enjoy the comfortable dry heat and let your pale blinding white legs catch some sun. Splash around in one of the many pools and cool off with some poolside drinks.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? You've had enough of the screaming kids. Its time to get away.
