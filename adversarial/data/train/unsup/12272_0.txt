When my friend Shauna told me about an amazing Zumba class she'd been taking, I was intrigued.  And when Saturday rolled around and I slept in past the 8am spin class I'd been planning on attending, I remembered that the Zumba class Shauna told me about started at 10:00.  I called Shauna that morning and she told me the class was at Bricks Studio. \n\nSo convenient, the studio is right down the street from me, yet I never paid any attention to it before.  But I pulled in to some very friendly people, and just before the clock struck 10, I paid my $10 and was dancing up a storm with Marissa, the awesome instructor and a class full of women (and one man).  Great energy, instruction, music, and more... I've never been a huge fan of Zumba but I am now!  I may just make this a regular on my workout rotation!\n\nCome sweat it up with me some Saturday... I think you'll be impressed with the studio, and even more so with Marissa.  Her class is extremely fun and an awesome workout all at the same time.  Don't take my word for it though, come show off your moves at Bricks! See you there.
