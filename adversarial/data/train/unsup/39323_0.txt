Went there looking for a new fridge. Knew from the beginning they were going to be dented and messed up a little but the one we got wasn't horrible. The sales people that helped us were super helpful with making a decision and nice. Then they two guys that delivered had some of the greatest customer service I have seen in a long time. We will go back when we get up the money for a new washer and dryer.
