Amazing food!! Great atmosphere and dog friendly!! LOVED the Butter Cake and the Caramelized Brussel Sprouts are a must have! So many great items to choose from in this diverse menu! Best of all, our waiter, Miles, was a rock star! Such wonderful service, friendly, and engaging!! Will definitely dine here again and ask to be seated in Miles' section!!!
