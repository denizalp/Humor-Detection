Possibly the best fast food experience of my life. I was greeted upon entering a bright and spacious space with comfy seating - a great first impression!\n\nAs I approached the counter, my host graciously explained the process and helped me build a delicious box. They provided suggestions, but let me do my thing.  You pick your base, protein, veggies and toppings and sauce. There are just right number of choices: Enough to be able to change it up, but not so many as to overwhelm. The hosts were kind and seemed genuinely happy to be there, which is a nice change for a fast food joint. \n\nThe food was fresh and healthy, and the portion was huge. I'm over 6ft and could barely finish my bowl. I'd love to see a regular and large option to reduce waste. All said and done,  I'm very happy to have stumbled into this new place. If you're in the area then you should definitely give it a go! \n\nThe only thing that bothered me was that they only had a garbage. Add a compost and recycling and I'll definitely be back here!
