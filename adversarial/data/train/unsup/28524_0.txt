This was our first time at Oak and it  is definitely on of the best dining experiences we have had in Charlotte. We happened to be there during Queen's Feast restaurant week. Because a 3 course meal is only $35. We weren't expecting to get the caliber of food and service we received. My husband and I both ordered the Summer Salad, 8oz CAB Filet- with whipped potatoes and seasonal greens. I had the peach cobbler and he had the Queens Chocolate Cake. The salad was a beautiful a light locally sourced delicious way to start the meal. The steak!!! We have had a steak at pretty much every high end steak house and restaurant in Charlotte. This steak blew most of them away!!! It was absolute perfection. High quality meat, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, just delicious! The peach cobbler was every southern girls dream. I will order it every time I see it on the menu... yes even over the chocolate cake! Our server Grace made our experience even better. She was knowledgeable and fun. She was able to answer questions about food and wine we had. She definitely added to the overall experience of our night and we will be requesting her whenever we make reservations in the future.
