Boy was this place packed! We are so glad they're here - as our \"dining out\" options just turned into \"dining in\" choices from the prepared foods section at Whole Foods. I'm super excited about that. Some of the freshest produce around..... just prepare to fight for a parking spot and be patient checking out, it's going to take a bit to get out of there.
