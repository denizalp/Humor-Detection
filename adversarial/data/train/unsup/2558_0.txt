As the other reviews say -- great cheap donuts, all hours, charmingly eccentric proprietor.  But I don't think the other reviews adequately emphasized the absolute surreal kookiness of the place.  Imagine this: 3am, seedy strip mall on east side of Vegas, you want a donut so you ring the buzzer (for after-hours security).  Inside, it's all about dingy linoleum, molded plastic chairs and styrofoam dinnerware.  The wood paneling on the walls is barely visible due to the dozens of oversized photos of Sote (the owner) in various patriotic bad-ass soldier-of-fortune get-ups, posing with police, servicemen and other Real American Heroes (TM).  Come to find out, he was a freedom fighter from Cambodia, and now takes his U.S. pride to the xxxtreme!  I get the distinct impression that if some half-witted no-goodnik even TRIED robbing Sote's humble establishment, Sote would go completely apeshit kamikaze on his ass!  And that would be an awesome sight to behold.\nn.b. The donuts are good, but pretty much standard fare for a decent donut shop in my opinion.  It's all about the atmo here!!
