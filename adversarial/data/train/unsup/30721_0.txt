A great place to stop by for a drink if you are in the area. The Local Company is beautiful. Modern, clean, and they have awesome service. The staff were very courteous and quite funny. \n\nUnlike the typical Greek Mediterranean restaurants, this place could stand up to the King St. West folks. They only use local ingredients.\n\nThe food is alright. I was a bit disappointed with my Butternut squash gnocchi served with a cream based sauce. Not enough flavour in the gnocchi, and the sauce was a bit too salty to my liking. I had a taste of my friend's grilled salmon, and it was prepared perfectly, very moist. Accompanying sides (spinach, and ride pilaf) were really good. So I was not as lucky.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't get a chance to try out their dessert. The description looked really good. It was my friend's birthday so we brought our own cake. Lucky for us, they did not charge us a cake-cutting fee unlike some other restaurants.\n\nThe Local Co. turns to a lounge after 10:30 pm, which is quite nice that way people don't have to relocate and find something else to do after dinner. The music was good on Saturday. I hope they keep it up.
