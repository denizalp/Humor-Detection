I went into this salon to get my eyelashes done for extensions. I had booked a 2 person appointment for my friend and I to get eyelash extensions together. I show up 15 minutes early and checked in. By the time I get in it's 4:45 due to me \"not booking correctly\" however they were short on staff and put two people ahead of me who appointments were later. Very disappointed, my extensions stayed on for a week and started falling off after even though I took good care of them, my friend having the same experience.
