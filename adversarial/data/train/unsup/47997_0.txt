Why have I not checked out the new Avenue until now? Came in for breakfast on a Sunday morning and yes they take reservations and yes they have a large parking lot.Seating was not a problem in the newly renovated Avenue.They have a build your own bloody Mary bar, one of the better stocked I've stumbled into or (from)!! They did a nice job on the remodel with happy and friendly employees, good food and a relaxing atmosphere! Will be in soon to check out the happy hour and evening meals.
