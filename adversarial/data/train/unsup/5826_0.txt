Nori is inside of the mall next to yardhouse.  Siri is almost useless in this area so dont trust her.\n\nI tried several items: gyoza, tuna sashimi, green tea, tuna carpaccio, and a philly roll.\n\nThe gyoza was too soft and the sauce was a bit weak.  I would have liked more of a crunchy texture to the dumpling and some seasoning in the sauce.\n\nThe tuna sashimi was tough and didnt melt in my mouth as a good piece of tuna should.\n\nThe carpaccio was cold and wrapped around asparagus.  I prefer hot oil carpaccio but there were some nice flavors in this dish.\n\nThe philly roll was very average.  Nothing special but good.\n\nAfter this first impression I would say this place is decent but I doubt I would come back or recommend it to others as there are far superior sushi places for the same price or less.
