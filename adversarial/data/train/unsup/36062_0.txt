I needed a tow for a vehicle that wasn't running and found Shaun's Towing on Yelp. I highly recommend them to anyone needing a tow service. Called and spoke to Shaun, he had Alex contact me to set up the details. Left the keys gave both addresses and everything was taken care of. He even put the vehicle on the side of my driveway as requested. Other tow companies I spoke to said they would have to just leave it in the street. Add that to a flat rate fee of $75 and you're crazy not to use them. I've had to use other towing companies when my roadside assistance have sent them and had to pay a fee on top because of mileage. I will be using Shaun's from now on and having my insurance company reimburse me. Alex was professional, fast and friendly. Thanks!
