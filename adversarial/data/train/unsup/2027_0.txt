Having seen this library about a zillion times in my travels, I thought it was due time for me to actually step foot inside. Yesterday I made an impromptu stop as I travelled via C-Train. \n\nFirst things first: Could this library be ANY easier to get to?!?!? It's situated right across (literally a 10 second walk across the street) from the Lion's Park C-Train stop. \n\nThe library itself looks quite small, until you step foot inside. It's a lot bigger than I expected it to be - looks really can be deceiving! \n\nThey've got 10 complimentary computers with Internet access available to everyone, immaculate washrooms right at the door, a calm, quiet crowd and a very friendly and efficient staff. \n\nI'm most definitely a fan of this branch. Easy to get to, cool vibe, and shopping right next door - I'm one happy camper!
