Best Korean BBQ I have ever had!!!\n\nTheir AYCE is amazing.  I can't believe they're able to offer such high quality beef for such minimal price.  You must try their Kalbi.  Marinade is very tasty & the beef practically melts in your mouth.  \n\nI do not go any where else to have Korean BBQ any more.  It's WooNam Jung\/Lee's Korean BBQ all the way!
