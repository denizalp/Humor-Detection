I cannot say enough nice things about Philly's Famous! From the moment you walk in the door, you love this place. Everyone that works there is so friendly and so helpful, in a very genuine way...and the food really is AMAZING. It reminds me of all the little family-owned restaurants I grew up with in Jersey\/PA. My husband and I can't get enough of this place!\n\nTip: Get a Philly cheese steak, with sauce :)
