I was first introduced to Ahimsa Essentials at AZ Certified Local Festival, and have been a fan ever since! I love using the deodorant, body butter, and therapeutic balms. Just knowing that the husband and wife team use food grade and environmentally-friendly ingredients in their skincare makes me so glad I switched over from the \"mass produced products.\"
