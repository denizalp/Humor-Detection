Ok, so I gave this location two tries. And they struck out on both. The recent reviews are very on point. \n\nAs I stated in my reviews for Plato's Closet, I have a background in fashion. I was named best dressed in school every year. If anyone knows INCOMING fashion trends, it's me. If anyone understands business (Rutgers, baby), it's me. But telling me that the clothes I had weren't appropriate is downright laughable. I even called before going to see what they wanted (Spring) and took half of that and half of the transitional items. \n\nThey took... NONE. \n\nFirst of all, they need to get over themselves. There are legit vintage places and thrift stores across the street and next door. There are also some amazing eateries up and down the street as well. Don't know who told them they were cool by association, but trust me, they are NOT. LA Buffalo has attitude. Vegas Buffalo should be effortlessly cool. \n\nMy husband found a used pair of sneakers that were $20 more than he could buy new. The pricing here is very wrong. You should never be able to say that in a place like this. \n\nI posted some items that I took here on a clothing app. Sold a few of the things that were rejected here within a few hours of posting for roughly $20 a piece. I'm sending the rest in to one that sends you a bag to send your items in and pays you. That is the future. Places like Buffalo are going to go the way of the T-Rex soon enough. Behaving like this and having the wrong people buying are going to make it come much sooner.
