I've been meaning to get over to the new brewery and the recent snow storm afforded me the perfect opportunity. Why? Because my S.U. was flying into Madison and was stuck getting de-iced on the runway in Chicago. I figured, hang at the Ale Asylum brewery, bring my laptop because they have WIFI (the airport doesn't) and wait it out with a pint of Hopalicious.\n\nWhat a spot! Open and airy, nice wood. Several different areas. You could get lost in this place. I had heard that I shouldn't expect much of the food but I had a more than decent pulled pork sandwich and a fresh pint of Hopalicious. They have a wall behind the bar with sign for each beer that they brew. If it's lit up, they have it.\n\nThe place was pretty quiet  for a Thursday night, there was a snow storm after all. I was told that it's usually packed on Thirsty Thursday. While I considered having a second pint, I didn't. Not because a second flight would have caused me to drive too slowly and swerve around on the road, the snow and road conditions made everyone drive like they'd had a few too many, but I saw on the flight tracker that the S.U. was in the air and due in 15 minutes.\n\nA great space and an awesome place to wait for the call that says, \"We just landed, meet you out front\".
