Nothing bad about this place. The food is delicious and it's great portion sizes. We went on a Saturday afternoon there was no wait. Wait staff was friendly and quick. The quesadilla is huge. The only thing I would say needs improvement is the decor. Pretty boring in there and there is a ton of seating. That doesn't affect how good everything else was though. Would definitely recommend, and will certainly be back.
