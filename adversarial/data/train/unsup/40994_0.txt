I was utterly disappointed with my order- got the shrimp with lobster sauce and cannot believe they consider that food. First off, the shrimps were those cheap ones with shit still in the backs- the broth looked and tasted like puke and the customer service was horrible- NEVER AGAIN- sticking to Spicy Dragon if I want Hakka!
