Best bbt in pmall!\n\nThe location on the second floor got revamped into a beautiful fruity oasis and is very much underrated.\n\nFruity doesn't have the 2 for 1 deal like many other bbt places in pmall but the quality of the drinks is worth the extra money (starts at $5.5) . I got a large (read: huge) mango coconut sago to share and it was so fresh and refreshing. A large is more than enough for two people and if it only cost us $7.25, I think it's a much better deal than the 2 for 1 deals elsewhere.\n\nThe standout about Fruity is that they actually use real fruits and milk instead of the powder artificial stuff used frequently by competitors. I watched them put fresh slices of mango and boxed coconut milk into the vitamix. If you stick your head over the counter you can get a whiff of the sweet fresh fruit aromas.\n\nDo note that this is more of a fruit\/vegetable smoothie\/slush\/fresh juice joint with the option to add your typical bbt toppings (Tapioca, aloe, sago). You won't find your original tea or taro flavours here. But if you're in the mood for fruit based drinks like mango, watermelon, lychee, berries, or even durian give this place a try instead!\n\nCome to fruity and make your next bbt less of a guilty pleasure but rather a dose of your daily fruit and vegetables made delicious.
