The navi sent me on a mini detour but I finally found this place after being recommended by my fellow Yelper Rocky. :)   And I feel very fortunate because this place is a hidden jewel that only the locals know about.  I had never even known frozen custard existed and i'm not even sure if there is another place anywhere that serves frozen custard but if you're in Vegas it's well worth the stop.  I was expecting it to taste like frozen yogurt to be honest but it's not to be confused with froyo! This is definitely NOT froyo!  I had the Western custard which was topped with caramel, fudge and salted pecans.  The custard at first glance appears like yellow froyo but when you taste it, you really taste that egg base and note the smooth quality.  No icy pieces or airiness to this.  Very smooth, dense and tasty!  Even the salted pecans were fresh tasting!  :)~  mmmm!
