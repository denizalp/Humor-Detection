TLDR: Borderline dump, and this is by far the worst customer I've experienced at a hotel in the U.S.\n\nFull story:\nWe arrived super late on inauguration eve (like 2 a.m.), so there were a lot of drunk townies in front of the hotel and in the bar. Pitt can be a little gritty, which I like, but I felt transported to Southern Maryland.\n\nWhen we got to our room after a grueling hour-long search for parking (valet is $40 and we had 2 cars, so being a bit cheap) and a 20-minute check in, this drunk freak in a bathing suit\/cover up starts yelling at us and tries to come in our room. For 30 minutes. Boyfriend goes for the phone and the lines are dead. I peek out the peephole and this weirdo is cackling and swaying side to side with a towel over her head, totally channeling the girl from \"The Ring.\" \n\nSince it's 2017 we call from our cell phones. Management finally comes to get her, but doesn't switch our room even though we requested it. They say they'll fix the phones the next day, but they never do. When we walked through the lobby to get coffee one morning, we passed by 6!!! staff people and nary a one even looked at us, much less said good morning.\n\nI would never stay here again, not even for free.
