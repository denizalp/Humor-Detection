Been to a Hornets game and a couple of Bobcats games at this venue. The seating is built up more than out so even in the nosebleed seats you don't feel like you are too far from the action. Plenty off food and drink options as well. Would get five stars except there is no way around walking at least a block to park. Best option is ride the light rail in.
