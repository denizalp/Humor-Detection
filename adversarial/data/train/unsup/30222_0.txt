After all these years of late night clubbin and drinking, I always ended up here to get one of their burritos and honestly, it's still the same (besides the price increase). It was here I was introduced to a Carne Asada burrito and I've not been disappointed. \n\nThe location is open 24\/7 and is one of the best ways to get your Mexican style food fix when your hungry and looking for something good. Granted that have a bunch of drinks and other items but I find myself sticking to a buro. Decided to pick up the California Burro which is a carne asada with crinkle cut fries... Yeah... crinkle cut fries... \n\nI've never been in, only via the drive thru and the greeters at the windows have always been friendly and courtesy...even at 3 or 4am in the morning. \n\nIf your looking for some something on the go or needing to get your \"grub\" on... you won't be disappointed with the food size and quality. Make sure you get both red and green sauce if you want to take it up a notch. \n\nI gave 4 stars only because for 2 burro's I spent just over $12 or $13 total...
