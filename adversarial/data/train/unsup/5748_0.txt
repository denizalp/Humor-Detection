Four dudes decided to go to Vegas. If you know the workings of Vegas, you'll also know that four dudes in Vegas equals a whole lot of spending.\n\nThat's why we decided to book the cheapest rooms in a classy hotel--kind of a cheap but great value combo deal. \n\nBally's was the perfect choice. We paid around $80 for a couple of nights, but we booked early. It is a fantastic hotel that is decked out with everything Vegas,i.e. lots of shiny things, a casino, respectable rooms, a giant slot machine, etc...\n\nBest of all, it is directly linked to \"Paris\" and thus offers tons of choices for dinner, shopping, and excessive gambling. It also served as a great home-base in the middle of the strip to visit the best bars, clubs, casinos, and the like.\n\nI'd go here again for sure.\n\n-----\n\nDistinguishing factor: Best price\/value combo in Vegas. Four-star hotel that could not be better placed in the strip. Did I mention they have a giant 10-foot slot machine?
