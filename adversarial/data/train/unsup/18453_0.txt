This is an interesting place - a bit of a foreign experience for me.  The place is moderately-sized and seems to attract health-conscious people looking for alternative cures, and other little things.  There are lots of interesting items to look at, like individual bags of herbal remedies, boxes of incense, barrels of ginseng, and more.  I almost bought a herbal tea mixture but was turned off by the dried up roach carcasses that made up part of the recipe (so glad I looked first).  I'd definitely come back here out of curiosity, but I will not be buying any dead bugs.
