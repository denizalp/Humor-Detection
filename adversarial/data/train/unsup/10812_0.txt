I made my first visit to 40 Westt for my cousin's wedding. Being not from Montreal, I was not previously familiar with 40 Westt, but was curious to see how a wedding would function at a steak house. I was definitely pleasantly surprised. I actually think the food was way better than I've ever had for a large scale event. The seating was slightly tight but it was very well done. The ceremony set-up was quite beautiful. So while I can't comment on what it would be like for a normal dinner, it seems like a really upscale place. The lounge area is also really nice, although I missed most of the cocktail hour. The only thing I don't really understand is the location but I guess it works for the rich families living more in the suburban areas of montreal.
