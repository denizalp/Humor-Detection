I've been coming to this Fausto's for a few years now and it has been my number one choice to satisfy my Mexican food cravings. This location is nearby which is convenient. It's a quaint little joint much like the other Mexican grills and eateries around town. The service is quick and friendly and the food is always good. Their portions are SOMETIMES inconsistent but that's never stopped me from returning. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, Fausto's never disappoints. \n\nIf you're not too sure of what to get, my top choices consist of the following:\n\nCarnitas Plate\n\nCalifornia Burrito (Stuffed Fries) - The main reason I'm reviewing this place. Carne Asada burrito packed with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and French fries. Simple but easily the best. \n\nBreakfast Burritos - Solid choice any time of the day. Bacon, Ham, Chorizo, and Steak options. \n\nFish Tacos - Not the best, but they'll do! A cut of fried fish with the usual toppings. \n\nAnd of course, the Carne Asada Fries!\n\nAlso, be sure to take full advantage of their salsa bar! Limes, pickled jalape√±os\/carrots, and 3 types of sauces to perfectly pair with your meal. Happy Eats!
