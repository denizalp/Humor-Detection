WHO talks about alcoholics, domestic abuse and rape all within 15 min the presenator at Wyndham Mr. Audrey thats who. \n\nLadies and Gentleman, i own a timeshare and i was eager to learn about what Wyndham had to offer. On July 12th at approximately 12:30pm, I went to the Harrah Casino on the trip to listen in on the presentation. The sales representative was very nice. I wish I would have captured his name. However, when the presentator (Audrey) came on he was obnoxious, insensitive, high strung, jerk. I have never been so disgusted in all my life. I just so happened to be staying at another hotel (Venetian), however he made very alarming remarks to those who stayed else where. Here are the top things he's said and you be the judge: \n\n1. You \"people\" are here for free food and free drinks shut up and listen to my presentation.\n2. Your wife will cheat on you because you stay at the Flamingo. \n3. You husband will drink himself into a stopper and then beat you if you stay at a low end hotel. \n4. Your husband will rape you readily if you stay in a motel 6. \n5. Last but not least he further stated that women deserve to get abused for not given their men sex if they do not stay at the Wyndam.  \n\nHe went on and on how he was Italian descent and constantly put down those who A. didn't drive a BMW or B. stayed at the Harrah\/Flamingo Casino. \n\nHe went on and on about how he left his law firm to work for Wyndham and how he left his wife for a newer\/younger model. \n\nHe went on and on how we were poor and we were on there for free gifts and food. \n\nHe went on and on how your wife will cheat on you if you don't stay at a luxurious hotel. \n\nHe went on and on how there will be domestic disputes because you have no time to vacation. \n\nWho does this flying fawk think he is? \n\nI left out of there furious, not only will i NEVER purchase a timeshare at the Wyndham, I won't stay there or with any of its affiliates. \n\nI've reached out to the CEO of Wyndham and other associations to protest this jerk from ever speaking again. Wyndham get it together. \n\nResearch who you bring into the company. sit in out the presentations every once and a while I guarantee you will feel the same way. Needless to say the sales person tried to recover, i walked out without receiving; he offered but I respectfully declined.\n\nAugust 2015 Update: \nAfter speaking with corporate, they acknowledged that Mr. Audrey's speech was unacceptable and was awarded a few nights stay at one of their resorts. The VP of Sales and Marketing were extremely concerned about my experience and thoroughly handled my  compliant with care, after staying at one of their resorts i will follow up again on my experience. My stars still reflect the \"pitch\" from the harrah's casino Wyndham and not those of the entire corporation.\n\nJune 2018 Update: \nGuess who finally stayed at the Wyndham?!?! This chick. The rooms were wonderful, I stayed in a two bedroom. It had a full size living room, balcony, full kitchen, two bathrooms and a den. I still wouldn't do the timeshare but the weekend rate exceeded my expectations.
