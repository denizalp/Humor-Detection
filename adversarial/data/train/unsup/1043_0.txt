Decided to come here after finding out that my usual restaurant was closed today. I've heard great things about this place thanks to a few yelpers, so I thought it was a perfect opportunity to try it. \n\nWhen I arrived with my friend, the restaurant was empty and we picked the table in front of the large window facing the street. \n\nWe were immediately served warm tea (perfect drinking temperature!) and given menus. We spent so much time choosing! We ended up ordering a taco party (non-traditional Korean) and a Korean BBQ (traditional). \n\nWhile waiting, we got our free kimchi (yay yelp check ins!). We wanted to taste it first, then wait to eat it with our food. However, it was just too good! We could stop, even if we kept saying \"this is the last piece. Stopping now.\" We ended up finishing the entire thing... oops! \n\nThe taco was obviously a Korean-Mexican fusion dish. It actually tasted amazing! I don't know what they add to that guacamole, but it's delicious! This dish was somewhat oily though, so I had to go wash my hands afterwards :) \n\nThe Korean BBQ was also quite tasty. The flavours were nice. The broccoli in it was AMAZING! Sadly, there were only three pieces :( lots of other veggies though! \n\nWe then shared a dessert, 1 scoop of ginger ice cream and 1 scoop of red bean ice cream topped with pineapple coulis and 2 ginger cookies. It was so good! \n\nWe also drank A LOT of tea... way too much tea. I had at least 7 glasses. Probably more. \n\nThe price is also very reasonable. The entire meal cost us about 25$ each after tax\/tip. \n\nThey run such an amazing restaurant. Definitely worth a visit!
