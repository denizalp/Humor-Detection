My first experience with a tailor and I'll definitely be coming back! I came here because the store I bought my MOH dress for a wedding couldn't be altered in time. All it needed was to be hemmed! I came to Q's Tailor and she quickly measured and marked- it was so easy! She gave me a 5 day time frame but asked if I needed it earlier. Great customer service and reasonably priced- especially for wedding related services that most places charge an arm and a leg for. My dress turned out perfectly. I highly recommend coming here for quick, quality work!
