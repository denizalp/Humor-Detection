They have a rifle range that is only open 75 minutes per week.  Minutes, not hours.\n\nI've been trying for weeks to shoot here, but it just isn't possible.  It's public land controlled by an old boy's club.  So it's a great range you have already paid for with your tax dollars that you will never get to use.
