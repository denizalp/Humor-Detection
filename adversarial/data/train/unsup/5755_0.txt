A fantastic old school barber shop. I mentioned that it was my first time, and the manager came around to give me a personal \"tour\" of the meat case, explaining the different cuts and origins. Great service.\n\nPrices are very reasonable, and they offer packages that you can order in advance for pickup later. In addition, there are sales to be had, which just makes the value greater. Also, they have marinades and rubs available for sale that are custom made for this shop. If you are a carnivore yo owe it to yourself to give this place a look-see and take a cut home with you.
