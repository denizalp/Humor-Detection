If you're visiting from out of town, make sure you stop by here.  They have a varied selection of yarns that are at least dyed in the area.  I bought a lovely locally dyed yarn to make my daughter a cardi, and another locally dyed yarn to make myself a cowl. \n\nThe staff were knowledgeable and friendly.  The coffee was good.  They have a good variety of non-coffee beverages, which made my husband very happy.
