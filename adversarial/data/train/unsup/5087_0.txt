I can't believe I have driven by this place almost everyday for years and just recently tried this place.  Very cool old school!  This place looks like it has been here for ever!  They have a lot of regular customers.  There was not one open place at the bar. You just know when you fist come in here that this place is the real deal for Italian.  They have almost as many specials as regular items.  Soup AND salad come with the entree plus steamed vegetables cooked to perfection.  You also get a basket of warm bread.  I had the orange duck which was cooked perfectly.  The sauce was too sweet for me but I don't have much of a sweet tooth.  My wife had the sea bass over spinach which was  very good.  Service was good which you would expect.  Wine was good, again no surprise.  Overall a very pleasant experience.  I will be back.
