Well this is my first time going to this place and its no wonder why they have 5 stars. Awesome service with our big work group! My pizza The \"Calexico\" with artichokes was perfect. Nice crust and great sauce. \n\nNobody in our group of ten had complaints, especially when the manager\/brick oven god came to our tables with tasty cinnamon sticks and garlic bread on the house! \n\nGood job and keep it up! Ill be back for more!
