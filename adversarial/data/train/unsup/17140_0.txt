So I guess if I enjoyed live music and DJ's more (my man works with things like this for a living, so you could say I'm burnt out), I may have been able to disregard how godawful half the place smells. It's like a big urinal punch to the nose, and it sucks, big time. The bartenders are sometimes repulsive but always more repulsed by your presence without cause. It's almost like how Emerald Lounge was, but at least there, you kinda really did feel that you may not be worthy. This place just sucks. \n\nAnd who the hell's idea was it to carpet a bar? Seriously.
