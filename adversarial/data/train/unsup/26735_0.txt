Nice atmosphere, great date spot. Cozy.\n\nFood wise, I would say on par with other creperies. Their drinks are pretty average. I ordered a chocostrawberry milkshake. It tasted like the borderline of no name triple flavour icecream. You know, when you reach the small strip of strawberry icecream and you get a bit of chocolate. Exactly like that. The crepe had a nice vanilla flavour but the toppings are OK.\n\nMy gf got a white hotchocolate but it wasn't sweet enough and the chocolate was faint. However, was cute, had a heart from coco powder.
