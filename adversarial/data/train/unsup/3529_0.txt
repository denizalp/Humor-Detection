Really nice nail salon! It is big and spacious. Very clean in there and I liked how it was almost set up like a bar where you get your nails done ha. \nI went here with a gift certificate today, it was my first time here. It was actually pretty busy, but they were able to help me right away.\nI went for sparkly yellow\/gold and it turned out pretty! The lady doing my nails did really good and was friendly. Overall a good experience, I would come back.
