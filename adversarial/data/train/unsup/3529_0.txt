So for the longest time I heard how amazing Five Guys was.  Whenever some one mentioned the place, all I heard was \"ahh, yeah, that place is just amazing!\".  So, based on all these amazing verbal reviews, we decided to eat here.\n\nTo my dismay, I was quite disappointed!  My expectations of this place had been talked up like no other, and was quickly shot down when I received nothing more than a double cheeseburger from the likes of Burger King.  Yes, it was pretty good; however, it was no gourmet burger.\n\nI will say that the fries were fantastic.  When ordering I figure I should probably get two fries because we would all eat them; that was a mistake.  Ordering two fries gave me more potato than Idaho produces on a good harvesting year, which left me leaving that place having consumed more fries than what my insides really needed.\n\nOverall we enjoyed the restaurant itself.  It was very kid-friendly, with a casual environment.  The food was served quite quickly and the location itself was very clean.\n\nI will eat at Five Guys again; however, I'd be just as happy with a Burger King double cheeseburger as I was with the Five Guys burger --fries not included...
