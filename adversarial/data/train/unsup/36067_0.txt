I initially had a bad experience here with one nail tech. I posted a bad review because the nails were horrible. Like really really horrible. 3 days after they were done I had one pop off and several more loose. BUT....I came back in that third day and a girl named Vivian (I believe) redid them all for me with many sincere apologies. She was so sweet and did above and beyond to make up for the other bad nail experience. I brought my step daughter in for her birthday and they even painted her nails for free too. I will keep coming back now, only to see Vivian. I'm glad I gave them another try. Nails are amazing now. Thank you!!!
