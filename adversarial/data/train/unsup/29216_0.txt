FOB is very conveniently located, an ideal spot to grab a quick bite after a day of shopping or work. We came here on a weeknight around 7pm, it wasn't busy at all probably due to the construction on Queen st.  I ordered the Fu-schiken which is their Asian version of surf n turf served with broccoli slaw. I thought my beef and shrimp sandwich was just ok. It wasn't  short of meat but I would have liked a bit more vegetarian ingredients in the sandwich then it had described like kimchi and cilantro. I was particularly disappointed at the slaw. We order 2 sandwiches and the bill came up to $35 without drinks. I think I'll skip over to Bahn mi boys next time. Cheaper eat for similar style.
