Great coffee!\n\nLocated in the Rio Hotel & Casino, Hash House serves an extensive breakfast menu. \n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles with coffee. The coffee was superb! The fried chicken was interesting. It was coated with corn flake batter (seemingly), but lacked in flavor. The chicken pieces itself were actually small, and the batter was heavy, but pleasantly crisp. I pulled off the batter and picked at it. The chicken was very moist. \n\nThe waffles were stuffed with bacon. Yup, you read right, BACON! I had no clue until I started ripping in between the waffle squares in the midst of feeling like I was having a heart attack.  \n\nIf you're on a low cholesterol diet, DO NOT ORDER this dish. This dish should come with a nutritional warning. \n\nOverall, good service. They kept the coffee coming and hot!
