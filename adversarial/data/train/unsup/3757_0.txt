Day 1: After clubbing at TAO, we come back to the hotel and we go... \"What should we eat?  Nothing is open... Coffee shop is open? LET's GO!!!\"\n\nDay 2: After another night of clubbing... \"FAWK we are back at the hotel already... sooo hungry.. should we walk around the strip? nahhhh lets just go to the coffee shop :(\n\nDay 3: Cracked out after 2 days of clubbing and a full day of pool party... \"F*ck it.  Coffee shop it is\"\n\nOk... We ate at the Coffee shop 3x while we were in Vegas for the weekend.  Not because it was good, but because we had no choice...  They trick you with convenience... This place is open 24 hr and is located right next to the elevators.\n\nService is bad, the food is bad and overpriced!!!  Can we PLEASE remember to get food before we come back to the hotel next time?!?! This place is so not worth going to.  With the amount you spend here, you can get better food elsewhere. Here's a good example: Their spaghetti with meatballs is like $18 and it tastes like chef boyardee spaghetti with meatballs http:\/\/static.px.yelp.com\/bphoto\/rLhc543pshadqbfgelyHiw\/l (which you can get for $1 a can when you buy 10 at Ralphs) UGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!\n\n*edit* NO THERE WERE NO OTHER OPTIONS I SWEAR!
