Worst chinese food I ever had .\nThe food is so greasy or dry ! \nMongolian beef was swimming on oil like sause with drenched vermiceli  on the bottom. \nChicken friend rice was so hard and dry that we didn't even eat  it while very hungry. \nHow can you crew up friend rice ??? Unless it was made 3 days ago! \nHot and sour soup  was so sour ,no joke ! And I ordered it in so many other places but this one is just not edible ! \nDo your stomach a favor don't make it suffer !
