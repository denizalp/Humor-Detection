Average\n\nWhile the menu offers a number of different offerings the food is kind of average. The prices are reasonable and will accommodate those on a budget. \n\nOn this visit I tried the meatball sandwich and chicken noddle soup. Both were okay, however, nothing special.\n\nTo end on a positive note the service was fast and friendly, and the restraunt is very clean.
