Had this review been written thirty years ago, the rating may have been better. Then again, it might have been impressive indeed, being the the interwebs themselves didn't really exist in any appreciable form.\n\nNonetheless, Outback isn't what it once was - but are any of us? The good news is that you generally don't find the lines that used to congregate outside of the Outback. The bad news is that the inside hasn't changed much. Probably because most people have moved on from the shrimp on the barbie to the casual steakhouse concept (there are so many, I have to assume that is the problem).\n\nOn the plus side, the Outback isn't bad - it just isn't what it was. The setting is nice enough, and the food is nice enough. Service is even solid. But there are so many better choices that it isn't really worth the effort on most nights. Now Outback seems to realize this that you might be able to score a gift card or other coupon, and in that case, it might be worthwhile.\n\nThe bad part is that, as has been mentioned elsewhere, their portions are going down, while their competitors are increasing their portion sizes. that isn't good. Also the blooming onion has lost it's luster. It's oily and nasty. Maybe it always has been, but now we have moved on as well. The Outback needs to be out back. Near the dumpster.
