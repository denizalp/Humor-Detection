Hoh. My. Goodness. How I have missed you Indian Food. A trip to India Oven should be on everyone's \"Must Do List\". Buffet style (unless you wish to order an entree) has hidden dangers. You might eat too much.  \n\nThe food is clearly labeled into groups. (Non-Vegetarian, Vegetarian, Salads and Dessert). I recommend diving in unless you feel strongly about eating a particular type of meat. I sampled (like a pack of starving dogs) every item and enjoyed every bite. My pants may not fit, but that has nothing to do with my ability to write. \n\n(Full Disclosure: I have eaten tons of Indian food in my hey day.) As the restaurant serves Northern Indian cuisine spice is not a concern. Food items were moderately (to mildly) spiced and the majority were cream based. Dishes were well balanced with ghee (or whatever oil is used). \n\nNaan is delivered to the table as is tandoori chicken. (Just try it kids! You'll like it.) Rice is available at the buffet. I was surprised to find mango lassi (a yogurt drink) and chai tea as part of the buffet price. ($12 total during dinner.)\n\nIndia Oven prefers to have groups pay on one check. However have no fear! Our large party was individually able to pay directly at the cashier. However, that might have been possible as we all ordered the same thing. (Buffet!)\n\nThank you India Oven for hosting our very large group. Yelp International Supper Club UYE rocked!
