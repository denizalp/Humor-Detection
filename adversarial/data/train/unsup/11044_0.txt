I am shocked to see such great reviews. We have had the worst experience with them on so many levels. Customer service, quality, payment process, threats to file a lien before they even finished the job. I really hopped we didn't go with this company (which we chose based on the reviews). They charged way more than other companies have estimated and for that price our experience was less than sub par.
