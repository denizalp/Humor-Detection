Shaanxi Legend is a very cool looking place located on the Scarborough\/Markham border just north of Finch. It was a tad difficult to find as the GPS doesnt take you to the plaza just north of Finch but to the plaza right at Finch. However once I found this place it was a real treat. \n\nExpertly decorated insider with a large story telling mural on one of the walls. A fake \"upstairs\" area makes this place look big enough to be a 2 story restaurant. \n\nThis review is a few weeks late to be relevant, but given the amount of food we consumed here this evening a few weeks ago, it's likely taken me about this long to digest and comprehend everything we ate here. We were here for some sort of Mid Autum feast (similar to Thankgiving as I understand) but we ate something I believe was called a Wedding Feast which was comprised of 8...EIGHT....ya 8 courses! Non of which were small and each one was more filling than the next. \n\nRather than write a novel as is my norm I'm going to run through the courses and give some details and my thoughts on each one, In no particular order:\n\n1. Steam Deep Fried Chicken - Really enjoyed this dish, I called this Chinese KFC Chicken bites as it was a large plate of bite sized deep fried chicken that came with some great sauces to dip in. BEWARE OF TINY BONES!\n\n2. Fried Sliver of Pork - This was served as an appetizer and was the first course we received. I really enjoyed the cured pork (similar to a ham or porsciutto) with all the fixings it came with. Presentation of this was amazing too came on a mini table sized rack where all the pork was hung from the main bar.\n\n3. Fermented Glutinous Rice with Fried Pork - I have trouble remembering this dish, I seem to recall a Rice dish with some pork infused into it that was no bad. Didn't stand out in my mind to be honest but I know my dinner mates enjoyed it.\n\n4. Dates Pork with Rice - Eww...did not like this one bit. The name says it all, dates and pork with rice served almost like a sushi roll. I actually gagged a little when having this. I hate dates.....*shudders*\n\n5. Sweet Rice Cake - these were pretty good  - forgettable.\n\n6. Crab and Pork Big Ball - Loved this dish, it was a large container of what essentially was giant meat balls. I would have eaten just this for dinner. ABout the size of softballs!!\n\n7. Hometown Fish - One of the first dishes we got, I was kinda skeptical about this as there was a FULL FISH floating essentially in our stewlike bowl. I know it was for eating but sometimes when my food is starring at me in the eye it \"fishes\" me out! The stew itself was really tasty and I loved the noodles and seaweed! BEWARE OF FISH BONES!!\n\n8. Steamed Pork Elbow - My second favorite meal of the night, tender pork elbow served with bok choi, tear as much or as little as you want....beautifully seasoned. YUM!!!\n\nOverall a really fun experience, I had never had Northern Chinese cuisine and I really enjoyed the overall infusion of spice into many of their dishes\n\n16\/30
