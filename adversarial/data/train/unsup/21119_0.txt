Why oh why Suncoast....did you take my beloved caf√© from me and replace it with this 'world famous' diner??  Bad form, guys.\n\nI heard about Du-par's before and it being an institution of sorts in California since 1938.  Well I think something was lost in translation when you folks moved here to Las Vegas!  Needs work!\n\nThe wifey and I were on a late date night and kept hearing about Du-par's just opening on our side of town.  We figure we'd go in for dinner.  But a big red flag awaited us - a brand new restaurant, barely a month old...with no line, and more than 90% of the tables EMPTY??  That should have been our cue to move along and eat somewhere else.  But we thought to just give it a chance, how bad can it be?  Ugh..wish we just turned around and left.\n\nService was slow.  Even with no one in line, and only 3-4 tables being taken, it still took us 10 minutes to get a booth.  Not cool!  Thankfully our server was pleasant, although looking a bit bored.\n\nWe got the menu.  First thing that caught our eye.  The prices.  The friggin' prices!  Not kidding here, their prices are easily $2-4 more on entrees than your average diner like Denny's or IHOP.  Really, your food Du-par's..is that special?  I felt like I might as well have gone to a place like Cheesecake Factory right across the street because yes, the prices on Du-par's food is near the same.  Wow!  This better be some great food with huge portions!\n\nMaybe it was what we ordered.  But I refuse to pay that much for a cheeseburger, let alone how much I paid for my damn sandwich.  But no, the food really did not impress us, especially for the price point.  Famous or not, I don't care, I will gladly take my @$$ to TGI Friday's to save $10 on my check.  Jesus.\n\nWe didn't even order 2 full entrees because the prices are so whack!  So we ended up ordering to share:\n\n-Du-par's 'Legendary' Buttermilk Hot Cakes (short stack) with melted butter & maple syrup\n-Classic Triple Decker Club - Roasted turkey, bacon, avocado, mayo, lettuce, tomato on your choice of bread & served with fries\n\nFood didn't take long to come to the table - but was our experience so so so AVERAGE.  The club sandwich was just not one of my favorites, it was really just OK.  Dry, not enough mayo, and the bread wasn't toasted enough.  Lettuce and tomato were soggy in parts too.\n\nNeedless to say the standout were the hot cakes.  The were tasty - buttery, light but at the same time rich, and had great flavor and texture.  But honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to come back to Du-par's again for these hot cakes.  Nor do I wanna deal with the prices.  Do you guys know I can go to Denny's and get a huge Grand Slam that comes with coffee & juice...for only $8?  Now that's a lot of food.  These 2 hot cakes barely fed the wifey & I...and they cost the same.\n\nOur bill after tax for just our two plates of food came out to $27 and change!  Without tip added! OMG!  So expensive!!  I'm a value guy (OK maybe bordering cheap) and for me this is low in my book.  Not enough food for the money.  In a place like Las Vegas I can go to another 5 dozen places easy at this time of night and still get great food for way less money.\n\nAnd sorry Du-par's, that's exactly what I did.  Haven't been back to you since.  You got an extra star for the standout hot cakes, but it will be a while before you get my business again.  Famous doesn't always mean good.  Infamous is what I'm thinking now.  \n\nDu-par's...sorry, not on par.
