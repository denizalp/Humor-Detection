I give this place a solid 5 stars not only. Because the food but because the ambiance and atmosphere.  As I walked up to the door I took a wiff of a foul smell. I was like it smells like a barn. Sure enough they had a long horn outside. This place had live music and a good single mault selection.  The server was a cute blode in a white had with jeand and smoking lol. The chicken wings were goodd and all your drinks come like in jars.\nI had the prime rib and It was Devine.  It was cooked properly and almost moving. The place had lots of things to look at and a slide ftom upstairs to down stairs.  The view is amazing and at nightu can see the city and all the lights from a distance.
