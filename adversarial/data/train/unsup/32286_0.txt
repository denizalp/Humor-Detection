It was completely dead at 11:45pm. I was told that the new Wal-Mart is the cause of the empty parking and no lines. I bought what I needed with no wait. There's a Little Ceasers located on the inside. It had the interior appearance of a Big Lots.  The back seemed to have no organization where the mattress and produce met. I found this to be strange.
