This is a great place for trendy designer clothing. Nice selection of designer purses at great prices. It's a very west coast laid back place. Definitely not a cookie cutter store-- it's one of a kind. Owners are great young entrepreneurs you should support. They are hard working people who've put a lot into this business for their customers. They'd love your feedback on how to grow.
