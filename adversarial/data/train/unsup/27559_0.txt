Great Barbershop all around, I come here every other week to get my haircut and I am never upset with the outcome and also bring my son and he loves his haircuts they're very attentive and pay attention to every detail. The atmosphere is very welcoming if you are a new comer to the shop , no cons about this place at all. I enjoy the classic look and feel of this shop as well as location. The barbers here are very experienced and well mannered and willing to provide the best customer service as possible. They're far more experienced then most shops I've been too with great pricing to accommodate a wide range of customers. I would highly recommend Marcus he is the islander w\/ long hair he has been my barber for 9 years, but also every barber in the shop are masters at their craft. This barbershop should be rated 5 stars no doubt. Keep up the great work guys!
