They do Not let you seat during lunch time for coffee and desserts. So DON't go during lunch time. My family went there in this cold weather but the staff did not even say \"sorry\" but \"are you gonna have desserts? Then all seats are reserved and you gotta leave\". HOWEVER ONLY 2 out of 20 tables are filled with single individual. Never want to go back!!
