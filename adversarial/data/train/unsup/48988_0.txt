Annoyed that a fan motor costed $651 in order to fix our ac unit but what can you do. Downstairs ac unit stopped working suddenly so we called this company. They came out later and found that the fan motor stopped working. Had to replace it. Due to my lack of knowledge of ac units, & desperation to get the air kicked back on, I agreed and paid. It sucks that I can't figure out if that's a fair price or not so hopefully I wasn't ripped off. Ac works fine and haven't had any issues. Reason for the 5 stars. They gave us a 90 day warranty on the part and labor too. FYI.
