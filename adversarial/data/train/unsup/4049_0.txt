Came here last Sunday night.  Oh my god Becky look at her butt.  This was one of the best atmospheres I've ever been in.  A bunch of half naked girls running around, vodka flowing like the Nile River, and a cabana at our disposal.  I couldn't ask for more.\n\nCame here with friends on the last night of our bachelors party weekend.  It took a while to get in, seemed like there were 18 checkpoints, but once we got in, it was well worth the wait.  We were taken to our cabana upstairs where we had a shitload of vodka waiting for us along with OJ, cranberry juice, and pineapple, my faves.  \n\nIt was hot that night, so I really wish I hadn't worn jeans, a long sleeve, and dress shoes, you know typical club ware.  My bad, next time I will be in trunks and a t so I can play in the water and be more comfy.  I'm also going to work out a little more so I'm not so fat.\n\nEverybody seemed to just be having a good time.  No tough guys.  Girls weren't stuck up.  All in all, a great time.  I will make it a point to come back.
