House of Garden took over which is use to be Full House Chinese Cuisine (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/full-house-chinese-cuisine-markham-2). \n\nThe layout of the restaurant remain pretty similar but a minor makeover was done with new light fixtures, new flooring inside of those sticky old carpeting and new tables and chairs. \n\nThe menu has similar offerings as a lot of Cantonese Congee\/Noodle restaurants but with additional of Cantonese entree dishes. \n\nChiu Chow Congee with shredded chicken and oyster clams ($5.25) \n- We were pleasantly surprised with how good this Chiu Chow Congee is \n- only place I been to add so much different garnishes \n- really strong and intense flavour \n\nVermicelli with Preserved Sour Vegetables and Beef ($7.95) \n- Did not look too promising when it was presented to us steamy hot \n- But it tasted much much better than it looks! \n- the beef was quite tender and the vermicelli soaked up all the sauce make it so tasty! \n\nChinese Broccoli ($4.25) \n- I don't understand why they can mess up this simple dish... Veggie was so overcooked it tasted mushy... \n- I just want my veggie to be cooked... not turn into baby food! \n\nSince the restaurant is quite new, the wait staffs here are not really attentive and they kept messing up our orders... \n\nThere is lunch specials (11:00 to 3:00 PM) for $5.99 that comes a drink.. and for afternoon Tea is from 2:30 to 5:30 PM.. \n\nThey accepts Cash only!
