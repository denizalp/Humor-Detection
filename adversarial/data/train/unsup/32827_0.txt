I ordered a package from Amazon Prime which had same day delivery.  Ontrac was the shipping company.  The package was for my son and on Amazon's web sight it said they would be delivering it by 8:00pm. My son waited by the front door from around 7:45 to 9:00pm.  No truck or delivery.  At 9:15pm I checked the status and Ontrac had marked it as delivered at 8:45pm.  The only reason I ordered this item was so it could be delivered the same day as we were leaving the next day.  Amazon, (who is and always is great) refunded my money and said to call them if the package arrives before I depart.  I think Ontrac has made service commitments to Amazon and when they don't deliver, they fake their deliveries.  I am going to email Amazon Customer Service and point them to look at the Yelp reviews on here.  I love Amazon but at, I believe, $150.00 per year they may have just lost me as a prime customer.  Amazon dump Ontrac, they are killing your awesome reputation!
