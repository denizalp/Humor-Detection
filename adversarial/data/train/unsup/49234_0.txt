My son and I went to see Rogue one a Star Wars story and we chose this theater specifically for the recliner Lounge seats. I chose to purchase my tickets online and they always charge you a convenience fee which is kind of a hard pill to swallow because you're trying to avoid the box office but you're paying extra to avoid the box office so I got that Goin for me which is nice. It was really cool when we went to get our popcorn as they offered us free popcorn because of some promotion I've never heard of but free popcorn free popcorn LOL. With our popcorn and drinks in hand when I went to our nearly empty theater and got to sit in our side two seats of which I chose on the internet just like you would choose for a concert or baseball game. That in and of itself is really pretty cool especially when you have a movie that should be in high demand and you don't want to fight for a seat or arrive an hour early just to secure the seat that he want. My only real gripe is that this place along with every other movie theater at never been in it is pretty disgusting floor was especially around the bathrooms it was sticky and slippery which is a weird combination to have
