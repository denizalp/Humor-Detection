Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant, ever. \n\nI ordered the Pho like noodle bowl off of their new menu and so did the person I was with. I ordered the version with scallops and prawns. We both ordered it \"mild.\" I normally eat everything spicy, from my sushi to my mexican food, I eat anything as hot as can be. However, this was the spiciest thing I ever ate.  The other person I was with felt the same way about theirs. It was too spicy to swallow, let alone enjoy. This shouldn't have been a problem as I requested some more broth to water it down. It was still too spicy, so I requested to return it and order something else instead. This is when I realized I would never be returning to this establishment...\n \nI was told that it was because I \"CANNOT HANDLE SPICE\" and that they would \"NOT ACCEPT IT BACK.\" I was shocked. I have never heard of this happening at a restaurant. Isn't the customer always right? I asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager doesn't speak English and I could not be helped further. I asked the waitress to speak with the manager in Thai. She said the manager would not take it back for something else after speaking with her. I said to return it anyhow then - I couldn't eat it. \n\nTHEN, the waitress brought it to the back and came back to tell me that the manager had said I was trying to take advantage of them since I had eaten 2 of 5 scallops placed in the bowl. This is A) the craziest thing I have ever been accused of B) who cares since they wouldn't take it back anyhow C) the pettiest thing you could ever say to someone at a restaurant (I cannot believe she actually counted them) and D) a bold faced lie as she actually exaggerated the number of scallops included (there were only 4). \n\nI don't care if this place had the best food in the world (it doesn't), I WILL NEVER RETURN!
