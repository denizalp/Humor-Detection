When was my last review of this place? 3\/7\/2008?!?! uh...wow...\n\nDespite the long...LONG delay in returning there's one thing about hot and juicy i will never forget since the first time my brother took me there. START WITH MILD!!! I still remember the flash genocide of thousands of my taste buds when i took that first bite.\n\nService was great. Our server started off by informing us that because it's near the end of the mud bug's cycle the average size of the crawfish were smaller then usual. This saved a lot of grief and looks of WTH?! when the bags came. A majority of us where fine with the shrimp.\n\nAll and all an excellent night filled with laughter being exchanged between friends, shrimp and crawfish shells all over the table and everyone's garlic breath in the air.\n\nUnless Hot N Juicy finds a way to breed and farm crawfish to provide large mud bugs year long there's no way this place can improve on what it's already got going.\n\nAdditional note it's every entertaining seeing female diners wearing stylish 'going out' clothes and that plastic bib with large lobster squeezing a lemon trying to save them a dry cleaning bill.
