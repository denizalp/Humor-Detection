Who doesn't like to save money purchasing items at 99 cents (or cheaper)? That is the best draw this 99 cent store has and it's why I come here when I need to do my errands. It does have drawbacks, however, in both products and location. This intersection, even the parking lot, is very busy and there have been moments when people have almost crashed their cars into each other just trying to get out of a parking space. This can be somewhat mitigated if you park further away from the store instead of the parking spaces right in front of the store.\n\nAnother drawback is that there have been plenty of times when the product is expired and\/or heading towards rotten if you are looking at vegetables. Definitely check the expiration dates because I remember seeing frozen items that were 6 months expired but were still sitting in their freezer. As long as you are aware of it, the prices can't be beat and we all want to save money.
