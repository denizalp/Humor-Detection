I have not been to this business for over two years the girls last night apparently stated that the business sold within the last two years.. They have better looking girls but these girls are young and do not know how to work the room they are lazy!\n\nI hardly go to these facilities but last night I wanted to spend money and be entertained instead of spending three to $400 on this facility I spent $120.  \n\nFirst of all they need to quit playing hard rock acid rock all night long.. \n\nUnless you know a couple a particular girls you'll go there and half the girls want you to do table dances and everyone of them charge different prices.. Only one or two girls might come up and talk to you\n\nThen they advertise if you go to yelp you'll get five dollars off your bill woo hoo!!!!\n\nI would rather have good entertainment and good music then five dollars off my bill!!!!\n\nEither educate the girls or get better\n\nIf this facility which operated correctly it would be packed every weekend on a Saturday night only having 15 customers is pathetic
