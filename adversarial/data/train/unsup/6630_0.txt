Wow!  What a diamond in a heystack!  \nYou wouldn't know it by its nondescript, bland exterior.  They are in a strip mall next to a Subway at corner of Herlong and Ebenezer.\nThe Noodle Bar has some of the tastiest, fresh Thai food you'll find.\nWe had the Pad Thai and red curry chicken.  They also provide with each meal a cute little pot sticker.  I also had some of their coconut soup.  The presentation of the plating was inviting, \nThis, however, is kind of boring looking.  We thought it was one of those numerous Chinese take-out places where you sit and wait for your order.  It's not that at all.  It is a sit-down Thai restaurant with some of the best Thai I've had in a while.\nWe highly recommend this little gem.
