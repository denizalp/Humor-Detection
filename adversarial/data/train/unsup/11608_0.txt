I'm giving one star because it is impossible to give negative stars. The people who work here are incredibly, rude, and have the worst energy. We came and were told upon picking up a stone that it was expensive in a derisive manner. We couldn't getbanyone to help us and when we finally did he said he was going on break in the middle of the transaction. We asked about a strand in the case and were told hatefully it was $3000. When we asked if the loose stones next to the strand were sold independently we were again hatefully told \"three grand.\" When one of us had the nerve to say, \"there is no need to be rude; I'm only asking.\" The cashier got very aggressive and told is, \"I'm not rude. We are short handed what do you want?\" \n\nWe were the only customers in the store. After telling us we were short handed the guy just walked away yelling in Spanish. He left us alone in the middle of our check-out. We were attempting to purchase approximately $200 worth of merchandise. We just walked out of the store. We practically ran down the block because the guy had such bad energy I was worried he might follow and hurt us. \n\nThis place and the people are so creepy and uninterested in helping. Definitely don't go here.
