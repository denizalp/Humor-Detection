We recently moved to Arizona from Illinois, I found Tom by searching through reviews and I'm so glad I found him! He went above and beyond to help us find the perfect home! He has the patience of a saint putting up with us from miles away and going from house to house that we were finding online! He even Skyped with us as he was walking though the homes day after day!!! Non of the houses we found online worked for us and when my dad flew out to see a few in person Tom had a surprise up his sleeve and took my dad to a new build home in Queen Creek......needless to say he was spot on and we ended up purchasing the house and have lived here for 5 months now! We love the town, we love the neighborhood and we love our house! Thank you Tom for going above and beyond and thank you for all the hard work you did to find us our home! You are amazing and if I could give you a million stars I would!!!
