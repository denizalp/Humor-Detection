Seriously in the top 20% of pizza places I have been to in Las Vegas in the 10+ years I've lived here. The previous 2 reviewers nailed it, so I'll keep my review somewhat short. Nothing fancy with the interior, there are indeed 3 tables inside to eat there if you wish, but clearly more of a carry out joint. In a town where so many pizza places taste similar, Sicili's is a real stand out. A must try for the true pizza enthusiast. I have to say I was a little set back when I first walked in. I went to the counter, and the 1st words out of the guy's mouth was \"Wadda ya want\" I thought I mis-heard him and said \"Pardon?\".  Again, he goes \"Wadda ya want\" So with that, I just had to kind of smiled to myself and figured that's how they roll there. BTW, 50 cent upcharge if you use a debit card. I would have never, in a million years, thought to have stopped in here, but thanks to a yelp talk thread, I found out about this place, and I'm so glad I did.
