The pho was tasty and soup was flavorful, their subs are delicious. The only negative comment i have is that the pho has lack of meat. I ordered their beef pho special and their were hardly any meat. For about $9.25 regular size, i expected a little more. The rare beef was not rare at all. The beef was cut to thick. But the broth made it worth while on a cold snowy day.
