Local Las Vegas resident. My gal and I thought we'd stop by and see what this place was like. Upon entering it looks and feels like a Subway or cafeteria, but without the clarity. you order a base pizza, which I got the Verde (pesto). Dough looked good and ingredients looks fresh. Staff was ok, but not inviting or helpful. You have to remember that EVERYTHING you put on this pizza will cost you 1.50 each, which adds up quick. I don't mean just meats or cheeses, but even veggies of any sort. Puts them below Subway in my eyes at this point.\nAnyways, it was expensive. They put the pizza in the oven and you wait. Took a while, but not agonizingly long. Pizza was oily, greasy, paper thin crust, which I like, but only if it can hold itself up. It's limp and everything just slips right off and your left with a limp piece of dough and eating your toppings with a fork. Pizza wasn't cut thoroughly either. My gal's pizza was given to someone else and had to wait to get another, and it was even worse than mine.\nAnyways, 2 stars for having good ingredients, but everything pretty well is below standard.
