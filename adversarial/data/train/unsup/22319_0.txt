So this may be my fave new place in Gordon Square. Delicious drinks that we tried include 1) soda bird which included rum and pineapples, 2) orange blossom soda, 3) boozy hot cocoa and 4) ginger beer. All were great. Bc of our Yelp check-in, we got free pretzel bites too.\n\nThe vibe is cool. Interior is cozy. There are several board games around too. Service was good.
