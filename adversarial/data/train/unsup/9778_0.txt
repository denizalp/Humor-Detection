Come to Tessy's for:\n\n- Watered down alcohol! Stay away from anything that is not in a can.\n- Roofies and coke!\n- Nightly fights on the patio!\n- Generic made from frozen food!\n- Padded bills and stolen wallets!\n\nThere is nothing, and I mean nothing, positive about this place or my experience here. \nBetter off going to 6th street or The Gate.\n\nLooking for a dive? Try Fox and Fiddle down the street.
