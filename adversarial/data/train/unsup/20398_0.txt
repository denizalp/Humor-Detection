My review is for the casino only, after reading many reviews and trusting my instincts, I've determined that this is not Lizzie's kind of lodging.  All that aside, this is one of my favorite casinos to hang out and gamble in.  I'll admit that I had a great hit about 5 minutes after sitting down the first time I was here, which may just play into my sentiments a bit, but seriously, the real reason I love this casino is because I feel like any minute I'm going to see Frank or Sammy sitting at a poker table, tux tie loose, cigar in hand.  I just FEEL this place, you know?  Its inherent seediness is part of its charm in my opinion.  I know it won't be around forever, and it shouldn't, at least in its present state, but I for one will be sad when it finally gets its long-past-due renovation or ends up a victim of the wrecking ball because I will feel the loss of a casino where I can see the ghosts.
