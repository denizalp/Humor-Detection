I have now found a new spot for my occasional \"Cheat days\" at Babycakes Cafe. If it wasn't for Yelp I wouldn't have ever known this place existed. Obviously, by the look of everyone's review its screaming out RED VELVET PANCAKES!!! Once I saw those three words, I immediately bookmarked it! I was sooo stoked when my girlfriends and I went on Sunday morning. There were groups of people standing outside and my first thought was \"this place is serious.\" It was a bit of a drag with the wait time taking more than 30 mins since we were starving. So definitely must come early on weekends. \n\nI ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes of course. You have a choice of ordering the short stack (3 pancakes) or the big stack (6 pancakes). It was absolutely amazing. So fluffy. So velvety. And the cream cheese syrup adds the cherry on top. It was pure heaven in my mouth. I had one of those silent moments to myself for a good 3 mins (: I've gotten to try the Smores pancakes as well from my cousin's order. It was also good but it did not compare to the red velvet. \n\nI've also tried some of the Kalua Pig Benedict from one of my girlfriends, which has the toasted English muffin topped with Hawaiian-style slow cooked shredded pork, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. That was a good choice! The meat was tender and juicy. Plus adding ketchup and hot sauce to it made it more flavorful! I love spice. \n\nI was completely satisfied with my whole experience. The staff, the service, the quality of the food, and the atmosphere of Babycakes Cafe were fantastic! Spread the word... this place is phenomenal.
