The service at this store is outstanding! \n\nI read the Yelp reviews when looking for where to buy eyeglasses in the city, which is how I found Sol Optix. As soon as I walked in the front door, the owner greeted me and asked if I wanted help looking for some new glasses. His many years of experience showed, as he pulled a number of different styles and brands for me to try, most of which really suited my face shape and style taste. \n\nI hadn't yet purchased the Groupon for the store, as I had wanted to be sure I would find something I liked. The owner offered me an even better deal, which really made me feel valued as a customer.\n\nWould recommend to anyone looking for eyeglasses or sunglasses in Calgary, in any range of brands or prices.
