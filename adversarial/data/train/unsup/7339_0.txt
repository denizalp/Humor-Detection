I've been spoiled by the Brooklyn location. About a year ago, we made the walk across the Bridge from Manhattan over to Brooklyn and found ourselves waiting in line at Grimaldi's. When we finally started eating, the pizza was properly seasoned, and the crust actually had that charred and burnt flavor that made the place so famous.\n\nWhen I heard that there were Grimaldi \"chains\" all over the place, I was immediately intrigued. The closest one was in Las Vegas. So on the next trip, we decided to check it out for lunch. It was about a 10 minute drive from the Strip, closer to Henderson. We found ourselves at some strip mall, which reminded me of Irvine.\n\nWhen we settled in and stopped looking at all the black & white \"faux\" Brooklyn framed photos all over the walls, we decided on sharing a large pizza, half with sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, and the other half with pepperoni. We also shared an antipasto salad, which was pretty good. Fresh slices of mozzarella, salami, salted olives, along with some toasted bread. It was nice way to start off the meal.\n\nUnfortunately, the pizza was a bit of disappointment. Naturally, I had high expectations, having been to the Brooklyn location. The pizza overall tasted a bit bland, like it needed more seasoning in the crust. The crust didn't have that burnt-coal flavor either. But if you think about it, how could it? I was comparing it to the Brooklyn location, which the ovens have been burning since 1905. It makes a huge difference.\n\nI even asked our waitress if it was true that they ship in water from NY. She flat out said no, but they do have a water filtration system using \"osmosis\" which replicates the NY water. Interesting, to say the least. I wouldn't say it made much of a difference anyway. Overall, it's still good pizza that I would rather have than something from Costco or Dominos or Pizza Hut. Prices are pretty high, however, but good for the occasional splurge. 3.5 stars.
