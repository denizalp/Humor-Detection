This location is much smaller compared to the one on 10th.\n\nThey have a great beer selection. This is a great place to start the night off. It's not so great if you feel like dancing or hanging out for a while since there's not much sitting space, and not much else to do other than watching a game on TV.\n\nThe servers were pretty good considering how busy the place is.\n\nOverall, a decent bar.
