When we moved to Las Vegas from California, we didn't know who we should get to handle a renovation on a condo unit as there seem to be fewer and fewer trustworthy contractors these days.  A neighbor that we had met who lives in our building, mentioned in passing that he had a great contractor who was trustworthy and professional and was just finishing up their condo.  So with the recommendation, we called Eddie.  \n\nEddie from Aria Remodeling was quick to stop by for a quote - and our reno job was going to be quite an undertaking!  We explained that we like things the way we like them and have already designed the work that we wanted done.  He made a reasonable bid on the job (in the middle of the other contractors we interviewed).  From the moment we agreed to the contract, he was BY FAR the MOST PROFESSIONAL, MOST CONSIDERATE, MOST TRUSTWORTHY, MOST POLITE, MOST PLEASANT, MOST RELIABLE, MOST HONEST, IMMACULATELY CLEAN, ARRIVED ON TIME ALWAYS, VERY THOUGHTFUL in actions - MOST OF ALL - he's a man that lives by the motto I was taught when growing up ..... \"Don't do anything unless you're going to do it right!\"\n\nThe employees and subcontractors that Eddie knows are held by him to very high standards, and I've seen that over and over again in all of the projects that Eddie carefully oversaw and even the parts of the project that he himself handled!  UNBELIEVABLE!  I often say he should be the \"Contractor to the Stars!\" This man and his team are just the best!  I have never posted any review anywhere in my life with this much excitement and confidence!\n\nIf you are looking in the Vegas Valley for a contractor - BE SURE TO CONTACT EDDIE OF ARIA REMODELING!  You won't regret it and soon you'll be singing the wonderful praises of Eddie and his crew!  I can tell you, now that the project has been completed, I had to write this type of POSITIVE REVIEW!  It was completely earned and I'm a tough one when it comes to project renos!  We completely trust Eddie in our home with keys when we are away - his entire team is also completely trustworthy!  Do yourself a favor, contact Aria for your next reno job!!!\n\nEddie is the ABSOLUTE BEST there is! PERIOD! END SENTENCE!
