I've had take out once and dined-in once.  Nothing special here.  Menu seems a somewhat limited.  Not a whole lot to choose from.  The atmosphere was not very inviting.  There were 2 other couples inside when I went in for dinner, and it was so quiet that even whispering felt too loud, and seemed like I was at a library or something.  No music playing, no one talking, somewhat uncomfortable feeling.  \n\nFood is just ordinary.  Beans and rice are ok.  Chips and salsa are ok.  Nothing worth making a trip for.  But I live on the same block as this place so I will probably be back at least for take out.
