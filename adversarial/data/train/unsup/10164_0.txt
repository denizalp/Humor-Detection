I hope it was an exceptionally terrible day for Griffintown Cafe, as the experience we had here was definitely exceptionally terrible. I usually get very excited for brunch, so I'm much more forgiving of mishaps. The cafe is cute enough for a brunch place with a kind of rustic, bright ambiance with an open kitchen, high ceilings and a back porch. \n\nThe service was satisfactory to begin with; orders given, they ran out of some dishes.    A pregnant member of our party requested her eggs be 'well done'. \n\nTwo hours later, we received our orders. 1-2 requests for water went unfulfilled. My eggs benedict was terrible. The hollandaise sauce tasted of mayonnaise. The toast was burned and the request for 'well done' eggs came back over easy. \n\nHow do you mess up eggs? Griffintown knows the answer. No apologies were given for our LOTR-esque epic-length wait and moreover the service was brusque.
