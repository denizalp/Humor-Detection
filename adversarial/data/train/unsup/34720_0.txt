Make sure you call your reservations 24hrs in advance because this is definitely NOT your typical Pittsburgh dining experience! \n\nThe food is excellent (mind you the portions and prices are on par with any other fine restaurant in the area.  If you're looking for massive portions at a cheap price go to Olive Garden or something), the staff is absolutely delightful- both helpful and friendly,  the chef comes out several times to check on your meal (hats off to you for that), the atmosphere is delightful filled with WELL dressed people who are happy to be out and enjoying the night.  There is free valet (a plus as I am used to paying for parking). \n\nDefinitely a place to spend an entire evening- from the restaurant downstairs to the lounge and outdoor patio upstairs.  Great food, great people, and superb staff, what more can I ask for??? I HIGHLY recommend\n\n*PS- The crab cakes are incredible!
