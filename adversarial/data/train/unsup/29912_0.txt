Deviled eggs, chicken on biscuits with jelly on the side, brisket biscuits and Mac and cheese. The biscuits are to die for! My favorite was the brisket and my husbands was the chicken. I'm not a fan of dark meat chicken but the meat had amazing flavor. The hospitality was beyond amazing. My water cup was never less than half full. We will be back!
