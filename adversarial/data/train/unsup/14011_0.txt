It is tough for me to believe, well not really tough, to find any decent Thai food around the Pittsburgh area.  You would think that famous known spots like Nicky's Thai Kitchen or Smiling Banana Leaf or a place called Thai Cuisine could serve decent Pad Thai or Pad See Ew, curries, etc.  I have struck out everywhere I went of course except for Thai Foon.\n\nThai Foon is located in Robinson Township not too far from the airport.  Though on a couple of visits they had a few \"off days\", overall their dishes were flavorful and reasonably priced.  I typically like to order:\n\nCrab Rangoons- light crunch and not too thick or oily\n\nDrunken Noodles - I always ask them to substitute the thick rice noodle they ise for Pad Se Ew since that is the CORRECT noodle to use for this entree.  \n\nFried rice - most times good but a few times too much salt or soy sauce added\n\nPanang or Red Curry - rich and great over rice.\n\nJap Chap - delicious glass noodles that really is a Korean favorite called Jap Chae.\n\nKeep Thai Foon in mind for your Thai craving.
