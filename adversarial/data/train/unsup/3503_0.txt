Having a baby or need to buy a baby gift? Want the same things that you can get at Buy Buy Baby at a discount? COME HERE! I had no idea that Burlington Coat Factory carried bottles, various bottle nipple sizes (for Avent & Dr. Brown's), pacifiers, Skip Hop bath toys, and SO many name brand things at a lower cost. I popped in to take a look at their clothes and walked out with SO MANY OTHER THINGS. \n\nI spent $40 and walked out with 2 packages of bottle nipples, a Skip Hop knee mat for baths, squishy bath toy letters and numbers, an adorable Carter's outfit, 2 Avent pacifiers for 0-3 months, a Dr. Brown's bottle cleaning brush, and I feel like i'm missing some things. SCORE! These are all items that were on my shopping list and it felt so nice to get it out of the way. \n\nThe line to the register was a tad long but extra team members stepped in and made it flow nicely. People LOAD UP on goods here because you can find such great prices so checking out just takes a while. I will absolutely pop back in here when needing more baby supplies because I love a good deal! :) They literally have everything that you could need.
