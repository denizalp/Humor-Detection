It's no secret that I am vain.\n\nIn fact, vanity is my favorite sin. And now that I am regularly in Sin City, I make sure that my teeth are maintained.\n\nI came into Floss to get my teeth cleaned. It had been a while since my last cleaning, and the last time I was due, I ended having some work done by the fantastic Dr. Tran at Image Dental.\n\nThis time around, I needed to come in to Floss because it was more convenient for me. Of course, I was able to visit Dr. Tran, as well as Dr. Tounian.\n\nThese really are the two best in Las Vegas. Yes, I drove all the way from Scottsdale, just to get my teeth cleaned and cared for.\n\nThe office is solid, and brand spanking new. You totally get to watch movies while you are getting worked on, or if you are waiting. \n\nGrowing up, I've been to many dentists. Typically, I would go wherever my parents took me, or wherever my insurance was accepted.\n\nLuckily, today, I have the choice, and there is NO BETTER DENTISTS than Dr. Tran and Dr. Tounian.\n\nIf your teeth are rank, make it happen. They won't make you feel bad for not flossing, they will make you feel good about yourself and help your pearly whites stay as amazing as mine.
