For a mere $2 admission some of the things I saw:\nSheep and goats dressed in Halloween costumes\n4H kids showing the calves they raised themselves\nSome beautiful quilts\nMore tattoos than I have collectively seen in one place, including 2 full head tattoos!\nThe pages of \"People of Walmart\" come to life.\nGuys hawking luchador masks, engraved wooden signs and other crappity crap. \nDeep fried everything and anything.\n\nThe games, rides and food are very expensive but my bag was not checked when i came in so I imagine you can bring your own much more palatable food or drink if you so desired.\n\nFor those expecting Disneyland you will be sorely disappointed but for those with reasonable expectations it is a fantastic way to spend a few hours.
