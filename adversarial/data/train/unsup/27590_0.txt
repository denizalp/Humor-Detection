This was my fifth or sixth time here and to be honest it was hit or miss.  But today everything was spectacular.  It is honestly the first time I haven't seen a line or had to wait. One thing thats for sure is that the service is always great.  Our server was fast to greet us,  very friendly,  and very efficient.  My girlfriend and I shared a bowl of new England chowder and it was bomb diggity! Not too salty,  plenty of ths, and the texture was absolutely perfect.  My girlfriend had the steamed clams and I was really jealous because that white wine and garlic sauce is a 10 out of 10. I went for the pound and a half of King crab legs and it was good.  Not the best but not bad.  Steamed crab is Steamed crab right?  I will definitely be back and definitely point other r people in this direction.  5 stars!
