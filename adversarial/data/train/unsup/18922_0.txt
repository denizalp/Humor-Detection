\"Building better racers, one go-kart at a time\" should be the motto of this place, but it isn't...if it becomes the motto, my attorney will be in touch with them:)\nNo, they don't build better racers at F1...they don't build racers...they don't build anything except, at about $2 per lap, your VISA bill:)\nYou should know going in that you will want a bunch of laps:) It's just that fun:)\nThis isn't really racing, despite what they tell you at F1\nDespite the fact that they give you your \"lap times\" and your \"averages\" and post \"record laps\", you shouldn't try to do anything but have fun:)\nThe \"racing\" is against everybody from 16 year olds that think this is their ticket to NASCAR (good luck with that...yes, I know there are a bunch of racers that started out in karts...fast, expensive, tricked out, high performance karts...not these karts) to grandma, out there with the grandkids, trying desperately not wet herself as you turn 4 laps to her 1:)\nThese karts have a lawn tractor motor and shiftless clutch\/transmission...right foot=go...left foot =stop...they go about 25 mph and accelerate like my bicycle...you wear a helmet...you have to sit through a 10 minute safety and etiquette video presentation before you climb in a kart...you would have to really work at it to hurt yourself:)\nBut, it is fun! \nMy handsome son Zachary was in town to celebrate my birthday and wanted to take me to do something fun! \nHe's a thoughtful and loving son:)\nOven mitt golf was quickly rejected by Zach, as were a couple of other outdoor activities.\nBut I used to race formula cars (open wheel road racing), so he thought this would be an entertaining way to spend an afternoon.\nHe was so right!\nWe checked in at 2:00 pm, when they opened and Zach and I were in the first group of the day...in fact we were the only ones on the track for the first race of the day (it was the best \"race\" of the day for me...just Zach and I, no rolling road blocks to contend with...BTW, the old man only won by 1\/2 a lap...I'm still quick, even in these karts:)\nThe rest of the races were almost as much fun...lots of people to pass, lots of spinouts to watch and lots of people to get a little pissed off at (they probably didn't really pay attention during the \"etiquette\" portion of the presentation)...but no harm done and nothing to race for except pride:)...no trophies presented at the end...no trophy girls to kiss and no winners check to cash...just another ding to VISA for more laps!\nReally a lot of fun! \nUntil the VISA bill comes next month:)
