For my review of the IP, I'm going with \"The good, the bad, and the ugly\" \n\nLocation. \nG: Like other reviewers have said it is centrally located. Right on the strip, right by the a lot of action. \nB: Check location of your room within hotel when you're booking, you may get shoved in the back and either shack up with the \"pet place\" and tip toe through dog crap or feel like you're in a sketchy part of town and should have LVPD on speed dial. \nU: Hotel looks ugly compared to those located around it. Take out O'Sheas and IP is the ugly kid in your 2nd grade school head shot class line up pictures. \n\nPrice: \nG: Great price for being on the strip, found it to be the cheapest for right on the strip. \nB: The price. You're paying a cheaper price for a cheaper outdated, getting run down hotel. \nU: I don't think even if you wanted to, you could upgrade. Unless you did the love tub room which apparently is awesome. \n\nHotel: \nG: You're paying for what you get. If you're looking for cheap and place just to sleep after you were out all night or cheap gambling stay here. I would suggest if you're traveling solo to at least travel with Jack D, Jim B or Jose C when staying at this hotel to make it seem better \nB: The hotel doesn't seem to be getting any improvements or is a priority for anyone. No tv remotes in two rooms I stayed in, ice machines broken, outdated furniture, worn carpet, crappy entertainment lineup, mediocre food (Hash House is good, however) \nU: The hotel literally smells like everyone in Vegas, both locals and travelers took a crap underneath the hotel about 2 years ago and its just been rotting away. Seriously, some parts of the hotel are unbearable. Also, the elevators are extremely slow. You may as well go check out Mystere or Phantom then come back and catch your elevator. Try it. Its a joke.
