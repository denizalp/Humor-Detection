This is the absolute worst, most disorganized company I've have ever had to deal with. Twice now I have rented my subdivision's clubhouse from ICM.\n\nThe first time I did, the form I downloaded and printed to secure the rental said nothing at all about when or how I was supposed to be let into the clubhouse. I called the day before the event to clarify and was told very rudely that I was supposed to pick up the key that day, and that \"all that information is on the form you filled out.\" I checked a copy of the form, which I had in my hands, and there was no such information. So I had to completely rearrange my schedule that day and hurry all the way to their office to get the key before they closed. Then on the day of the event, I unlocked the clubhouse and the alarms went off. They continued to go off for at least a half an hour while I contacted the police and ADT (because of course there's not way to contact ICM outside of regular business hours) so that I wouldn't be arrested. Finally, through ADT, I was able to get the number of the HOA person on location in my housing development. Thankfully he was home and able to come over and turn off the alarm. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to use the clubhouse at all.\n\nThis coming weekend I'm renting the clubhouse again for a charity Thanksgiving event. Today, less than THREE days before this big event starts, I was contacted by ICM saying that we can't use the clubhouse if we plan to charge any money. And again I've been told, \"Oh, it's all on the form you filled out,\" like I'm in idiot or something. I don't have the form in front of me right now, and conveniently their website is down so I can't even double-check that. So now I either have to rent another location or pay for all the costs of the event out-of-pocket and be unable to donate to the charity we were planning to sponsor.\n\nI will never be relying on Ideal Community Management again. They are irresponsible, rude, and inconsiderate.
