Went to a wine tasting event organized by a friend. It was a ladies event and it was fantastic. It was held in their event center and wow is this place ever gorgeous. Dim and cozy. We tasted, sipped and some even guzzled the 8 wine's they were show casing for the event. Don't worry we were all smart enough to take cabs or have someone pick us up after the event.\n\nLearned allot and tasted wine I would not normally order or buy. After the event, I ended up buying a few bottles (okay 4 bottles - that's a few) of wine I had that evening to take home. The liquor store is attached to the event center and wow do they ever have a fabulous selection. It was like being a kid in a candy store - But better!!!!!!\n\nWill defiantly be back to try some more (they do have options in the event center to try before you buy) and will be bringing some more home in the near future. \n\nA really great place to buy wine (lots of it), beer and every other beverage under the sun. They also carry gifts, alcohol related accessories and gift baskets as well. Great big location and lots of parking too!!!
