Not a great experience at all here. Sorry, it's long but worth the read!\n\nI specifically came here because of the ads on TV that talk about the great savings and how their furniture is quality but affordable. My daughter is looking for a new bedroom set. We searched through the main area and then made our way to the \"Clearance\" area. She found a bed she was extremely interested in but no price on it. We did find someone (Brian) to help us - nice enough guy. While we were waiting for the price, my daughter looked up the bed on Ashley Furniture with a price of $298.00. Wow, I thought we would get a great deal on this since the listed price on the Ashley furniture (who is the maker of the bed) had it listed for that price. \n\nI was wrong! Brian came back and said - \"Oh, we can give that to you for $299.00.\" Wait a minute - what? I told him I just looked on the Ashley website and it's $298.00 there and you are telling me you can give it to me for $299.00???? I stated  it was in the clearance section, all by itself (not being sold as a set) and you want me to pay more than what the actual manufacturer charges?  Then I was told - \" Well, everything in that area is not actually on Clearance.\"  and then \"And that's a really popular bed right now.\" What?? Then he said they could \"match\" the advertised price of $298.00. Really?? You are saving me a whole dollar??\n\nBrian - again, a nice enough guy - said he would go talk to a manager but on his way he stopped to help some other people instead of staying on track with us. After about 10 minutes I just told him to forget it and thanks.\n\nOn our way out the door, another floor person (who greeted us on the way in), Tom, asked if we had any questions. I told him what just happened and he brought us over to the front desk area to look up the bed. After about five minutes, he stated he could drop the price to $269.00. I mentioned that that wasn't much of a \"clearance\" price and he then said - \"Well, not everything in that area is on clearance.\" What? I said it's in the middle of all the other beds \"on clearance\" but that one is the only one not on clearance? Then he said that \"Brian\" is not a \"sales guy\"and really couldn't help us anyway. So why is he talking to customers on the floor? And to mention that Tom looked like a hobo - ripped jeans, flip flops, baseball cap for a guy way past the age of pulling that look off. Just because you are in a warehouse, you don't have to look like you sleep there.\n\nPlease note I was also looking for a \"Clearance\" dresser (said that 2 were on hand) that I saw on their website the night before we went in and they said \"oh, they were both sold just last night\" and not available. Really??\n\nDon't bother going here if you don't want the \"bait and switch\" or being treated like an idiot. I always try to support local businesses because I know how hard it is but the owner needs a wake-up call - Don't waste your time.\n\nBTW - we ended up at Value City Furniture and were treated like royalty! Great staff, educated and \"dressed to conduct real business\"and I ended up buying additional items. \n\n$2000.00 loss to Northeast Factory Direct.
