Love going to this Vape shop! Love the friendly and helpful people here. Prices are good! I really love the taste Bar. And how stocked they are with some juices. Yes they do run out of stock with certain juices but you can try many other flavors. There is a $1. Fee for the taste bar but that's just for the tip. And that's good I believe for one year. \n\nThe employees here are great and so friendly. They will go out of their way to help you. Which of course I took forever but they were very patient with me. \n\nSo if you are looking for a vape shop look no further and just come here. Parking is shared with the other stores next to it. And it's located in a plaza.
