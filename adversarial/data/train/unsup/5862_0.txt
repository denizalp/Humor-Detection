It didn't take us long to return for happy hour again AND dinner.  With another couple we came back for a drink pre-dinner.  I had the key lime martini and pretzel bread once again.  At dinner, we had a great waiter Claudio.\n\nEric R. and I decided to share a steak.  We started off with the hearts of palm salad (hearts of palm, avocado, tomato, micro greens, pear vinaigrette) and our friends shared beef carpaccio with us.  For the meal, we split the 24 oz bone in ribeye (with plenty of leftovers!!), creamed corn (mmmm) and the foie gras, but instead of just foie gras by itself, it came with berries, fresh figs, and balsamic glaze.  Even Eric R. who first announced at Vegas Uncorked 2 years ago, \"WHAT'S FOY GRASS?!\" enjoyed the foie and all of the berries with it!\n\nWe were all too full for dessert, but the food was tasty, the service great, and the ambience very nice.  We were under a stunning chandelier.  Claudio even joked with us when he asked what type of water we wanted, Eric R. and I both exclaimed, \"LAKE MEAD!\" and Claudio told us, \"It isn't Lake Mead...at Hank's we serve Chateau Lake Mead water!\"\n\nA steakhouse meal cannot be a regular occasion for us, but this was a nice treat and we will definitely be back for more happy hour martinis!!!
