Don't ever get your face waxed here. I've gotten my face waxed at a nail salon and they do a much better job. I've even done it myself with store bought wax. I don't know what's wrong with there wax here but my face broke out with disgusting pimples everywhere absolutely horrific. And I know it's there wax because even the cheap wax at hair salons have never caused me to break out. It must be contaminated. I called to let them know and the lady told me it was normal and to go in and buy some lotion they have there for 25$ are you kidding? How is this normal these people have no shame.
