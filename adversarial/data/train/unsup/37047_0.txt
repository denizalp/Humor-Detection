Took about 4-5min to initially be welcomed at our table, but once we did Mysty was super friendly and attentive. Our food was pretty good & brought out relatively quick! They had sports playing in the bar area. We got smoked wings (way better than expected) and the buffalo chicken sandwich. Both choices were really good. I got a MichIltra on tap and it tasted a tad flat, so I switched to the trusty bottle! Overall, I wouldn't travel to come back, but a great choice since we stayed in the hotel.
