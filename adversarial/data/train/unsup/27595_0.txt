Came to this place and I have no idea what everyone else is thinking with any review worth more than 1 star, except they MUST be crazy.  Please reconsider going here!  I'm serious!  I'm from Miami and we went to Vegas for a bachelorette.  I've been to Vegas plenty of times but never done a strip club.  We went on a Thursday and arrived close to 10 p.m.  The place was pretty much dead.  There might have been 6 other women there.  The lights weren't really dimmed and the DJ was just plain bad.  Paying $30 regardless of how they want to market it by including \"free\" things is terrible.  I wouldn't have paid $5 for this place.  The guys come up to you and talk but they don't really do anything sexy to make you want to get a lap dance or pay for anything.  Normally, strip clubs have male dancers.  This is what a strip club does...they get guys that are hot to dance and then women want to give them their money.  It's a simple rule to follow.  We stayed for 20 minutes before we decided to make a run for the elevator.  Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied.  Don't make the same mistake we did by letting the other reviews influence you into going.  They must have never seen a man before or know what a strip club is.  TERRIBLE!
