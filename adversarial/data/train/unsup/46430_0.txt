Coming to this restaurant is normally a highlight of the summer for me.   Unfortunately I don't know if I'll be able to say the same going forward\n\nI had made a reservation to bring my friend and we were seated promptly (tip: always try to get a reservation)\n\nWe sat down and ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell to eat while we decided on the rest of the menu\n\nThis being a fish restaurant I had expected a larger selection of fish on the menu, and I was hoping to see some grilled.   Both my friend and I ended up getting the baked rainbow trout (me due to a sodium issue, her due to allergies)\n\nThe portion was generous, but rather tasteless.   I had asked for steamed vegetables, but I am pretty sure they had butter on them.  I got an extra side of rice and a salad and both were delicious\n\nMy friend being lactose intolerant had no dessert options which was kind of disappointing \n\nOur server Jessica was fantastic, but there was only so much she could do in the situation \n\nIf the fried grouper sandwich returns to the menu, I would recommend getting that
