When I lived in Los Angeles I lived in the S'Barrio. But let's go back about 5 years before that.\n\nThe first meal I ever had on the first night I ever spent in the United States was at Sbarro of Times Square. As a 16 year old, who had run away from home in England (basically), I thought it was the sh**. Of course it wasn't the sh** but that's how it felt at the time.\n\nSince then, Sbarro's will always have a place in my heart. Some of their products are awful and reheated and congealed, but then others actually taste pretty decent. Not too shabby. Depends on the location. This one was pretty good. We got a bit of everything (between 4 of us) and it was a hell of a lot better than the Subway sh** we ate the previous time we were here. The only reason it gets 3 and not 4 is that it's too pricy, and it's a national chain and I don't much like those.
