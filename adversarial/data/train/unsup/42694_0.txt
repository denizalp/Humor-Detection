Wow i can not believe the bad reviews!!! Dr. Islam Abujubara was very professional, listened to all concerns, was very concerned about the memory problems I was having. Scheduled tests right away. If You make an effort to read Dr Islam Abujubara credentials you will see he is a true professional in every since of the word! Highly recommended! Charles Alan Webb patient!
