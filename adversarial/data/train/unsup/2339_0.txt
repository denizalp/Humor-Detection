Thank you Tony F for reminding me to review this shite hole.\n\nI know a dirty little secret about Hanoi 3 Seasons - they named it after the average wait time for a customer to receive their food.\n\nThat's right. Go here, wait approx. THREE SEASONS and then your food will arrive to the table. \n\nWhen the food finally did arrive it was only OK. Yeah sure, this place seems to be the only place that serves the grouper dish in Toronto. But maybe that is because none of the other vietnamese places think it's even worth the bother of having on the menu. I found it a bit bland. Nothing special.
