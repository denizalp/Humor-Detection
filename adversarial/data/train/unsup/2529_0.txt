Merchant is one of my top 3 places to go to. All the bartenders make me feel welcomed. Two weeks ago was the first time I actually sat at a table ever. I always sit at the bar by myself or come dancing on the weekend to get loose. Haha. Serves was great but was longing to sit at the bar. Every time I go Something about the place makes me feel like I can wear my black beanie and \"run this world\".
