A great little hidden gem for lunch. The pulled-pork sandwich is awesome - I will be going back just for that.\n\nThe place isn't much to look at from outside, but the owner Neville is a cool and friendly guy. The home-made pulled-pork is amazing, and you can get it with a trio (soup & drink) for less than $10.\n\nDid I mention the pulled-pork is really good?
