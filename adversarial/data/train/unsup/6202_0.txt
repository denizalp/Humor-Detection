Giving Studio Wish Salon five stars because I believe in giving credit where credit is due. \n\nHaving moved to Twinsburg not too long ago I felt I needed a change.  So I decided to do something that makes me happy.  Raising a baby and having zero motivation on some days took a toll on the appearance of my hair. It was in DIRE need of an upkeep.  I called Studio Wish and they accommodated me quickly. \n\nMy first time I got a haircut.  I felt good about it.  The second time I decided to be more daring and get color AND cut.  I felt pretty great afterwards.  Then the third time I said, \"heck, why not! just go ombre!\" in my mind of course.  So I did.  I felt like a new person.  My regular stylist, Mahlaina is a pleasure to work with.  She listens to my wants and likes and she's super easy to talk to.  I would recommend giving her a try if you are interested in visiting this salon.  \n\nSome of the services they offer while you get your hair did include: hand, neck and scalp massages.  I highly recommend the latter.  They offer me as much coffee and tea as I want.  All the girls are down to earth and welcoming.  I dislike places that are pretentious and this is the total opposite.  \n\nSo if you feel like you're in need for a change or just want fabulous hair give this place a try.
