I love this place. I like to go whenever I'm in town. Last time I visited, I got all decked out in an evening gown, just to go have dinner here and go to Fremont afterwards. Because Vegas.\n\nIt's tacky-in-a-fun-way, gaudy-glam, neon, old-style Vegas and I love it. Lots of purples, pinks and turquoise. There can be a wait, depending on when you go, but it's worth it, in my opinion. Quick note-- if you are a person of larger proportion, the booths can be a bit of a squeeze. My ex-husband did NOT care for that when we went. \n\nThe food runs pretty much the lines of good diner food, and the portions are HUGE. \n\nThere's also a large bar menu, and the Scorpion is a fun fishbowl-sized drink to share. We also had another drink that tasted fantastic-- I swear it was called \"Bathtub\" or \"Bathtime\" something, but I have to apologize-- after that Scorpion, my notes got a liiiiiittle fuzzy.\n\nI CAN, however, tell you the Nachos, Nachos, Nachos were MOUNTAINOUS and very tasty. We opted to add the ground beef and it actually came on top (not on the side as the menu stated) but we didn't care (see aforementioned Scorpion) and enjoyed them immensely. \n\nOh, and at some point, someone will come and take your picture and then offer to sell you a package, but they always give you a cute little print for free, so that's a nice souvenir. I highly recommend you check this place out. Great place to grab a bite to eat, any time of day.
