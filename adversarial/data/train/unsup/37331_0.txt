I have been here several times for breakfast and lunch.  Each time I have been very happy and content with my food and service.\n\nIt is a friendly and open atmosphere.  There is plenty of room and seating.  The booths are comfy and restaurant is clean.  \n\nThe service has always been great.  The servers treat you like family.  The are attentive to your needs and quick with orders and food. \n\nEach dish is served with A LOT of food.  The portions are huge and most dinners come with TWO sides and a complementary soup.  My type of deal!!  I love the spaghetti sauce because it's slightly sweet and that's how I make my own.  It is a meat sauce, which I tend to stay away from-but trust me this one is perfect!!  The breakfasts are large and satisfying.  Again--huge portions for the price.
