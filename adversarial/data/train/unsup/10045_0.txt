3 star + 0.5 star for opening 24\/7\n\nI have only been to Honey B Hives Restaurant for Breakfast so my review is based on my breakfast experiences.\n\nGood Value: $2.99 for a simple breakfast is definitely an excellent value. My sunny side up eggs were cooked perfectly. Home fries though was hard and dry. \n\nWell Prepared: $5.99 for Western Omelette was really fluffy! Hardly recommended!\n\nLack of Consistency: Egg Benedict ($6.99) with Spinach. Hollandaise was really good as it was made fresh when ordered (20 minute wait if kitchen is busy). Love the nice bite of the spinach. But one of the poached eggs was perfectly runny while the other was well done? \n\nService was OK both time but I don't know why the waitress would go around asking other tables for coffee refills while never bother with my table?\n\nI will come back to try out their lunch\/dinner offering and maybe even their funnel cake!
