Dawson's was busy but I don't know why. \n\nThe owner (I assume) was not warm or friendly at all. He was pretty surly as he pointed us at the free tables and told us to pick one. \n\nOur servers seemed to be playing musical chairs. One to take our drink order. And then we waited. One to give us our drink order. And then we waited. One to take our food order. And then we waited. One to serve us the food. \n\nThe food wasn't much better. Pancakes were heavy. The bacon was soft (ick). The eggs were super greasy. The potatoes were mushy. Everything just tasted MEH and BLAH and OILY. \n\nSurly, scatterbrained and meh does not equate to a winning equation. I'm not coming back.
