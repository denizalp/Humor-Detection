DO NOT use this company, I moved recently and used them - horrible service and huge damage to my belongings!!  I have moved several times in the past 10 years and have never experienced such negligence in the handling of my belongings.  A very expensive piece of original art on canvas, which I have moved 6 times without a scratch was destroyed by Jay's moving - not one dent - that would be an accident, but 6 severe dents, total disregard for any care in handling this expensive piece of art. Movers were cranky and obviously were not happy to do their job, complaining it was more work than they expected, one of the movers was very ill with food poisoning, vomiting throughout the day, why didn't they send him home and get a replacement.  In the end, not only was my art destroyed, they also destroyed a crystal lamp and two lamp shades.  Just a joke.  The company takes no responsibility for this damage as they site I did not have them pack everything - ridiculous, I have never had the moving company pack everything!! I wish I could give them negative stars but this site makes me rate at least one star.
