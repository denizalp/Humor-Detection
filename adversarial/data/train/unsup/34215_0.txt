Southern kitchen meets fancy urban industrial loft. Cozy, yet loud and lively. Can't really find better words to describe the decor, but somehow it all works. We ordered the chicken, watermelon, and waffles, the shrimp grits, and the fried Oreos for dessert. To drink I got the bourbon lemonade and the boyfriend got an old-fashioned. He's a bit of a snob when it comes to old-fashioneds, and this place not only met, but exceeded his standards. Everything was delicious. The chicken, the waffles, the watermelon, the shrimp and grits. All delicious. We cleaned off our plates. My least favorite thing was the fried Oreos, but they still weren't bad at all. It just means I'll have to try another dessert the next time I'm here. As good as the food was, the service was even better. From the hostess, the waitress, the manager, and the bus boy, the service here was absolutely on point. This place has easily become a favorite and I'll certainly be back the next time I come to Vegas.
