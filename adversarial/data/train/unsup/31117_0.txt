I went into The Barbershop with long hair and only a minimal idea of what I wanted. I was looking for a classic man's cut that would keep a little length on top. Bong exceeded my expectations and gave me a classic style with a killer fade. He is a top notch barber and a fun conversationalist! Give The Barbershop at Gold Coast a shot for a well priced, well done hair cut. However, call ahead and schedule an appointment to make sure you don't risk a long wait.
