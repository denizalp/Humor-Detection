Blizz Frozen Yogurt, located inside the Luxor Hotel and Casino, serves Frozen Yogurt, Sweet and Savory Crepes, Smoothies, Açaí Bowl, Belgian Waffles, Shakes, Frappes, and Fountain Drinks. \n\nFrozen Yogurt was $0.65 per ounce. They featured eight flavors: Raspberry, Mango, Coffee, Pumpkin Pie, Strawberry, Tart, Chocolate, And Vanilla. \n\nThey had a nice variety of toppings including mochi, coconut, nuts, cookies, cookie crumbles, chocolate candies, sprinkles, gummy worms, sour worms, nerds, yogurt raisins, chocolate covered pretzels, rainbow snow caps, marshmallows, chocolate chips, brownies, popping boba, maraschino cherries, and fresh fruit.\n\nI got a Raspberry Frozen Yogurt topped with Strawberry and Mango Popping Boba.\n\nI liked how they had a no sugar added one (Raspberry) and a sorbet one (Mango). However, it was thicker and more dense than other frozen yogurts I've had.
