Although I just ordered water and an appetizer, I can't say much about this place food wise. Our server was very nice and fast too. We came in for lunch and was about in about 30 minutes. The hostess greeted us at the door with a smiling face. The appetizer that we ordered were pretzels and it was pretty good. Came with 4 long sticks and there were 2 dipping sauce which was honey mustard and their beer cheese. My favorite was the honey mustard. The beer cheese was alright, a bit on the salty side. Will come back again whenever we need a fast lunch.
