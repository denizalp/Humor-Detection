I LOVE this place so much. The ice cream flavors are so unique and culturally diverse. For example, I just had a combination of Matcha Oreo and Halva ice creams! They also have other fun flavors like: Vietnamese Coffee, Hojicha, and Marzipan. Each ice cream definitely tastes like what they claim to be- definitely not something to take for granted. Each flavor has a unique consistency to is as well. The best part of this establishment is the service from the people who work there. They are so patient while customers try all the flavors and love input for what their new flavors should be. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for locally sourced quality ice cream in Cleveland!
