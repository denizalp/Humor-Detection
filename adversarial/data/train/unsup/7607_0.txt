Based on my one visit, I cant say I'm a fan of this place. The Kuroi tonkotsu ($8.95) was an odd mix of tonkotsu ramen and black garlic with flavors fighting each other for your attention. The thin noodles were dense and somewhat gummy. It's a place to try for the shear novelty factor of the unique types of ramen served, but I think I prefer a more traditional type of ramen. If you sit at the counter prepare to bang your knees into the ledge beneath the counter. If you try to scoot in -- and those seat are heavy and hard to move -- there's a high chance of you hitting your knees more than once.
