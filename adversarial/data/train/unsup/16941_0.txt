Top notch detox or place for those who have a significant mental health issues. \n\nI've been around a country block when it comes to places like this, ranging from the absolute worst (\"no beds 'till tomorrow so just stick it out. We'll call 911 if you have a seizure while waiting\") to above average to the best. Copper Springs was my best experience. \n\nI received appropriate meds to help with my major depression\/anxiety issues and detoxed from alcohol with a very professional staff. The staff were almost excessively cautious, to a point where I requested they stop waking me up in the middle of the night to check my vitals. \n\nI was only boozed for two days, and I've learned to come to these places with the expectation of a long wait without triage or medical support. I actually recommend this (going in fucked up if your DOC is the drink), as I did have to wait about 5 hours to get in. \n\nAfter admission, paperwork, blood work, etc., I was medicated and given a quick walk through of the place. Each morning I would wake up with a sheet of paper outlining the day's activities. Expect to be busy after your detox is manageable. Examples: wake up, \"Outdoor Time (smoke break),\" goal setting, counseling, doctor appointments, med management with an actual psychiatrist board-certified as an addictionologist. And the food... which was buffet-style, leaving you with plenty of healthy and unhealthy but tasty choices. \n\nIf you've been to a place like this before, expect a humane and safe environment. If this is your first go through detox\/crisis medical issues, you may be apt to whine about some things, such as the beds that are stiffer than Trump's wingwang at a beauty pageant, or the complimentary deodorant roller that rips hair out of your pits. \n\nIf you're serious about getting well, you may well find yourself leaving with a hopeful aftercare plan and a lucid mind. \n\nGood luck fellow addicts\/drunks\/mentally disturbed people.
