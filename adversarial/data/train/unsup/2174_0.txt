The spa\/salon is stunning. It has beautiful new decor, a great waiting area, and upscale finishes. When you check in using the iPad at the front desk, it creates a profile for you. I just wish they would correct my name from \"Tia\" to \"Ria\" :)\n\nAs this is in the same shopping center as our office, it's very convenient for me! I can walk over, get my manicure, and get back to work! I've met the business owner and he's very sweet and friendly.\n\nPricing : When I moved from the Bay Area (CA) to AZ, I was expecting everything to be cheaper. To my surprise, nail salons are an exception. I've paid between $40.00-$50.00 for a full set at any decent place I've gone to, including this one. \n\nService \/ quality: As far as customer service go, they cannot be beat! The owners are so sweet, they remember their clients, and even offer wine! What a way to win a girl's heart! For the nail service, I did not like the second tech I had. Although she was a sweet woman, she did not listen to me so I had to re-do my own nails when I got home.\n\nOverall: A great place, convenient location, awesome customer service + discounts when you check in with yelp. Just be careful with the tech you choose. If you happen to receive bad service, just ask for another tech. I wouldn't judge this place based on one bad experience as they're great overall.
