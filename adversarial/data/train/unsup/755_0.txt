This is a really great vape shop. As soon as you walk in the door you're greeted and helped. They are really good with people who are new to vaping too; they sit down with you and go step by step so there is no confusion. They are very helpful and have a huge list of flavors. My personal favorite is Tidal Wave. They have a juice bar where you can sit and taste flavors. They have new products all the time. Great place!
