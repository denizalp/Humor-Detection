What is this place doing all the way out in Robinson Town Center? We stumbled upon this place after an airport pickup and were super excited to find a vegan restaurant tucked away from all the fast food places.\n\nWe were there for lunch on a Friday and were 1 of 3 tables.  We started off with the jumbo drumsticks which were just okay, as there was lots of breading.  I had the coco tofu, which was amazing.  The portion was huge with tons of tofu, which made me super happy.  The fiancee got the pad thai special, which was also packed with tofu.  Yum.\n\nThey have tons of cakes and pies at the counter, and I got a piece of vegan cheesecake to go.  The cheesecake crust was nothing special, but somehow they managed to get the texture right, and it tasted great.  I wish they were located closer to the city...I know we'd go there all the time!
