Screw this place I went there to get pain killers for a skin infection that has been KILLING me and all she did was prescribe me ibuprofen and a 150$ anti biotic when she knows I gave no insurance. My cousin had already called in 2 anti biotics for the same thing that came out to about 30$ but I went in to be seen bc I was in excruciating pain and needed a pain killer. Now I have to go back and get a refund on my 60$ she wasted
