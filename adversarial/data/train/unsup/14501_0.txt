This Chipotle just opened in February 2014 and is a nice addition to the new developments in the East Liberty neighborhood. \n\nBurritos and Tacos. Does one need to say more? The menu is simple - tasty lime or brown rice, beans, freshly grilled meat (chicken, steak, barbacoa, carnitas), mild\/medium\/hot salsa, sour cream and cheese, lettuce, and guacamole. My burrito was great and actually better (not overloaded, right size) than in other Pittsburgh Chipotle locations.\n\nIf you decide to eat in you'll find yourself on long tables (perfect for groups) or elevated bar tables and chairs. Nice but simple interior, with lots of natural light coming in. I like this store and will be back!
