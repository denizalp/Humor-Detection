To sum it up, even though service was friendly and attentive, food was bland and this restaurant is only hyped up because of his name.\n\nBoyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night around 6:45pm. We arrived to a pretty long line and the hostess quoted us 40 minutes. It only looked long because there were a lot of large parties but in reality, we waited less than 30 minutes. \n\nSo of course we ordered the trashcan nachos that was so highly talked about. It was actually the main reason why my boyfriend wanted to try this place. Presentation was pretty cool but personally, those nachos were unforgettable. Sure there were all the fixins with cheese, black beans, chili beef (?), jalapenos and pico de gallo.....but it just tasted dried and lacklustered to me. Boyfriend loved it....he said he would actually eat this as an entrée. These nachos were big enough for 4-5 adults to brush off. (I feel like this would taste better with fries instead of nacho chips?) \n\nOn the side, I ordered a street-style carne asada taco. Nope. I had better elsewhere. It tasted generic and Amercanized. No way this was street-style, it was more Tex-Mex, if anything. Boyfriend had the enchilada combo platter. It was edible but once again it was bland and flavorless. No way in hell we would come back here again. Side note: you cannot order the tacos a la carte. You can only order it if your party orders an entrée. \n\nDefinitely a \"I came, I tried\" kinda place. And I'm not coming back. If I was ever at the Rio again, I rather go to the buffet instead.
