While in Phoenix during thanksgiving, my friends and I decided to try this place for lunch. This places is in a cute neighborhood in Scottsdale just overlooking the water. Also, there's a lot of free parking in the garage next to it.\n\nAs we were on vacation, I decided to go with a pretty strong drink (whiskey sour smash) during lunch. My friend got the red wine sangria but sadly it did not taste fresh and she switched it with the strawberry and thyme cocktail and that was pretty good. We got the hummus to share and it was very tasty and I got the sweet potato cannelloni for my mains. The pasta was very thin and cooked perfectly and the sweet potato stuffing complimented the buttery sauce extremely well.\n\nI think this place is definitely worth checking out if you like an extensive menu which is diverse and a great place that overlooks the water!!
