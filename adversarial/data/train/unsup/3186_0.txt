Well... From 5 stars down to one star !! How does this happen?? When you drop off your Hoover shampooer for repairs and don't get a single phone call in the two months that it's there.  Every time I called they had a different story.  Then I went to pick it up.  They said they had done the warranty repair but it needed other things that were not covered. I would've been happy to pay for those items if they had called me and let me know that they needed to be repaired. Then I get the machine home and it still has the exact same problem that I took it in for two months ago. So I call the store to resolve the issue  and sit on hold for 10 minutes only to be hung up on. This is how you go from five stars to one star. Not sure if this is a chain or a single owner but this is how you put small businesses out of business. You crap on your customers and don't do the work you say you're going to do.then hang up on them. Seems like a great business model to me!
