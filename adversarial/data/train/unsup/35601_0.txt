We walked there last night for the second time and met the owner.  Very friendly staff and atmosphere.  Love the variety of healthy dishes, especially after a good walk!  Had the rice bowl last night with tofu - amazing!  My husband had the hamburger, which he loved.  Last time I had the tabuleh, which was the most unusual and enjoyable I've ever had.
