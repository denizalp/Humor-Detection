I'm so sorry the east valley location closed.  It was close and, while the location was nothing fancy as well as being a little hard to find, the food was uniquely amazing.   The staff was pretty awesome too...They always  seemed happy to answer any questions you had and would usually offer info before you asked.\n\nUnfortunately, the remaining location is over 50 miles round trip which makes it tough for me to visit even occasionally.  Worth a try when I can, especially the rare time when I am in the area.
