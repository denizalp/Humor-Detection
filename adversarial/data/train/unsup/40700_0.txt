Right on the river near the fashion district in Scottsdale. The outdoor seating is pleasant but the river view is block by a wall and vegetation. Midday they give you a limited menu then tell you no meat or fish is being severed. We got an appetizer plater it was OK but a lot of bread and nothing was special. There is a lot of unique dining options in this area, I don't see any reason to return.
