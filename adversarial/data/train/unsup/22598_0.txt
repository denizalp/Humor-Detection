This airline is just a hoot!  Here are my top 5 reasons:\n\n1.  The accents!!! OMG.  The flight attendant accents made me melt :)\n2.  The staff was very polite and accommodating.  The ticket agent kindly moved two of us to an empty row for free out of the kindness of his heart.  It was sincerely appreciated.  \n3.  Free booze!\n4.  Decent food\/snacks\n5.  There is a daily shuttle to\/from London Heathrow and Phoenix Sky Harbor.  It lands in PHX around 5pm and takes off to London around 9pm\n\nRemember to sign up for American Airlines AAdvantage points!
