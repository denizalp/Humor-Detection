Review update - I left my first review on yelp for this location after I had Danielle as my therapist, who was very good.  But I must update my review because I just went back to this location, Danielle was all booked up so I decided to try Brittney - even better!  She was very, very good.  This was a 90 minute massage.  She listened, created a 90 min massage based on my needs and comments and everything I said she did.  Good communicator - not too much, but asks questions throughout in regards to pressure, location, etc.  Go see Brittney it's worth it.
