Very small and cute little place tucked between a Great Clips and a Papa John's. Easy to miss if you're driving by. At first, the name of \"J.K. Sushi\" makes you think it means \"Just Kidding Sushi\" but after entering the restaurant...(pun intended), this place is no joke. It made sense to me that it most likely means \"Japanese Korean Sushi\" given that it serves both Japanese and Korean dishes.\n\nThe food here is great for the value! We ordered the Phoenix Roll and Dragon Roll as well as a spicy pork plate. All three dishes were very delicious and the food came quick. The service was wonderful and the staff were very friendly. Also, they have a neat wall where all pictures of their sushi plates are shown for customers to see what they are ordering. Would definitely visit again!
