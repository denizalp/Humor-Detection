My kids used to see a pediatrician at the UW East Clinic, but the wait times were unacceptable. We'd wait 20 minutes (one time it was 30) in the exam room for the doctor to show up after the nurses had finished with taking vitals. This, combined with the uncaring reception staff in urgent care and ridiculously long wait times in urgent care, made me switch the kids to a family practice doctor in our suburban community. It's such a relief not to have to deal with the UW Health East clinic anymore. Of course, we still have no close alternative for urgent care and we use it MAYBE once a year. Every time it's a horrible experience (illness aside). \n\nThat said, I liked our doctor there. I believe he's retired now. Despite the fact I liked him, I didn't like him enough to put up with the overall stressful, time-sucking experience of visiting the UW Health East clinic. The nurses were generally good, although I encountered a bitchy one after we'd been waiting 30 minutes in the exam room and I poked my head out to NICELY inquire whether we'd be waiting much longer. \n\nUrgent care reception staff could use a morale boost. I realize they encounter all sorts of people and temperaments in their job as the \"gatekeepers\" between the medical staff and a bunch of frustrated sick people ... and I'm sure they get tired of us. But they don't hide it well at all.
