Stopped here 3 times during our recent trip to Las Vegas.  Had several dishes between the two of us.  Hangover Slopper was great, street tacos(sticky belly, butter poached shrimp\/lobster and mahi mahi) were amazing and the Bacon Bourbon Bloody Mary was a great way to start the day.   Staff was very attentive and helpful.  Prices were very fair considering the quality and portions.  This will definitely be a stop during our next trip.
