So far, so great! I could be cheesy here and say \"Te Aro has \"Crafted\" a beautiful new coffee shop in the West End.\" OK, I did it. Cheese factor overload!\n\nBut seriously, I am so happy to have a new coffee place on Ossington, because Ideal was getting way too popular and way too short staffed. This is an outpost of a coffee shop in Leslieville that I had heard great things about, so even more happiness!\n\nEverything is new and fresh and clean in this cute little coffee shop, and the garage doors in the front and patio in the back make it a lovely spot in the summer.\n\nThe selection of coffees is genius here! They have this mad scientist contraption for making cold-brewed iced coffee and it is the best, smoothest iced coffee I have ever had. Serious fan. I have also tried a latte and an iced latte, and was just as impressed.\n\nThey offer yummy cupcakes too, and some vegan treats for those who are inclined.\n\nStaff is super nice and knowledgeable about their product.\n\nAnother PLUS! is the frequent buyer coffee card. Ideal doesn't have that! It's just another little extra that is already turning me into a regular at this place. I'll see you there!
