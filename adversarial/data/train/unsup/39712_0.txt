New restaurant on Fremont St next to El Cortez. Fun, friendly and cool. I love the food and service. All the beer, wine and liquor made in USA. Love the True Myth Chard.\nMy favorite dinner is the salmon. Friends with us loved the turkey burger, chicken tacos and steak sandwich dip. Truffle cheese fries rocked. Cannot find a bad here and the drinks are terrific.
