As I walked into this airport restaurant trailing my suitcase, the hostess (who also turned out to be my waitress) asked how long until my flight, and responded to my answer by assuring me \"plenty of time,\" but in fact I actually missed my flight by about ten minutes due to eating here plus the long holiday lines at US Customs, so I'm not too happy about this dining experience.  Waitress suited action to words by being comfortably leisurely about the speed of service, nothing that would have been out of place in a restaurant that wasn't in an airport, but this one is.\n\nI came here because I was hoping to have one more Alberta steak before leaving the province, but this was the least good one I had.  It was rather dry and slightly overcooked, and the toppings, which were a huge hunk of fried onion rings and jalapenos dumped on top, were ridiculous and hard to eat with the steak.  The waitress warned me it was a huge meal, and when I queried this, because the menu said the steak was only 6 oz., she said it was because of the two sides.  Well, no, they were ordinary-sized side dishes, and actually pretty good.  The corn was OK and tastier than the corn I had in much better places.\n\nNevertheless, this meal wasn't worth the price I paid for it, which turned out to be sitting around for five hours in the gate area waiting for the next flight after the one I missed.  I only give it two stars because the food was pretty good.
