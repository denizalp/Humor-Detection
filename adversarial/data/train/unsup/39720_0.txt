My wife, son and I were really amazed by this show. Very imaginative, creative and inspired. The setting for each song was spot-on and it captured the energy and vibe of the Beatles songs perfectly. For a die-hard Beatles fan like myself, I worried about a \"cheese factor\" - not there. Even if you only like a few Beatles tunes, you'll enjoy this presentation (sonic mash-ups of their recorded catalog). It's a psychedelic circus for the eyes and packs an emotional wallop too. Really great. \n\nHighlights - Something, A Day in the Life, Eleanor Rigby, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
