I had my appendix removed earlier this year by this doctor.  It was the worst experience of my life.  Not that a surgery should be a good experience at all but this doctor did a Frankenstein job stitching me up.  The staples were the route he decided to go even though I had a big stomach and could definitely shed a few pounds for a healthier life style.   But regardless this doctor used staples that as you can see by the pictures didn't even cover the entire wound.  As a matter of fact I have a later photo that shows the staples had indeed torn through my skin and were now in the middle of my wound.  So the pictures you see that I have posted here are the aftermath of this doctors job.  I was going to let this go and just move on with life regardless of several lawyers urging me to file a medical malpractice law suite against this doctor.  But then I received a bill in the mail for $2,640.00 from this doctor.  So I called and left a voicemail informing the doctor how disgusted I was with the job he did and that there was no way I was paying him anymore money for doing it.  I informed him that if he indeed sent me another bill that I would be filing a complaint with the Arizona Medical Board and then also pursing a medical malpractice law suite against him. Well guess what... He didn't care.  He instructed his billing department to move forward with billing me.  So now I will be creating a website online to inform the public more about this doctor and my progress with my complaint and my law suite.  Please email me privately for that website address.  Do yourself a favor and run from this doctor.  Do not let him operate on you.  Or you only have yourself to blame if you do.  As for myself... I now have a scar on my stomach the size of a silver dollar.  This should not be the case... I will need plastic surgery to reduce the scarring.
