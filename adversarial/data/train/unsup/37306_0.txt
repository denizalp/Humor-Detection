Our first time going even though I pass it everyday! We definitely have to add to our list of favorites! The MOUND OF FRIES was to die for! Fries, cheese, bacon, Mac n cheese piled high! It was amazing and my 3 Hungry girls loved it too! I had a Chicago dog and it was Really good to. Love the taste of the celery salt, but I tend to favor it on anything. Kids had Mac n cheese w a hot dog it was cut up in it. They loved it. Super cheesy! My husband had a bacon cheese stuffed deep fried hot dog and he loved it to. So go try the Mac n Cheese and Mound of fries!
