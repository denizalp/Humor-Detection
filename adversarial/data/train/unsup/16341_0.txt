Stopped for a late lunch following the Pride parade and got an outdoor table to watch the parade aftermath. It was a fun scene. The duck confit club sandwich I ordered was very good and the bread was incredibly fresh. My partner's grilled salmon sandwich was very well spiced with good flavor though it could have been cooked a bit less. The server was friendly and attentive. We liked this place!\n\nAugust 2014
