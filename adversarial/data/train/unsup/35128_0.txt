Since we have moved neighbourhoods we of course had to find our nearest Home Depot, because what move doesn't require tools and replacement parts. \nWe have already been here several times and like it much more than the old one we visited. It's slightly bigger, always seems to have what we need and the staff is super helpful! Not like some HDs where you can't even locate staff, let alone find one who actually works in the department you need. \nI went at a pretty \"busy\" time of day and they had enough registers to help people cash out as well as the self serve ones (my favourite!) \nWe are definitely happy with our new close Home Depot :)
