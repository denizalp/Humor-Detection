This company provided us with 600sf of sod and installed it.  The sod was to be fertilized during installation but was not.  Moreover, the guy they sent out to verify it had not been fertilized argued with me that it was fertilized as the installer was installing it (don't know how since I watched the whole installation and the installer never put down fertilizer).  Additionally the reason I called the company back about the fertilizer was because a large part of the 600sf was looking pretty unhealthy.  Again after much arguing I was told the sod was overseeded and the winter grass would continue to \"come in\" in spite of the fact that the growing season for winter grass in Arizona was long over.  I called the week before Thanksgiving to have someone come and look and it and I was put off.  I have waited two weeks (no return call) until I called them today some guy named Reese (again after arguing) basically implied after all this time I must have done something to the grass.  I will be waiting to hear from Reese regarding the outcome of our shoddy looking winter grass but in the meantime it may be better to shop around before you buy your sod from this company.\n\nI received a response today from the company via BBB.  I am shocked at the lies the owner (Reese?) responded with.  Very disappointed and surprised --one would think in this economy businesses would be bending over backwards to make up for poor service or product instead it is the opposite.
