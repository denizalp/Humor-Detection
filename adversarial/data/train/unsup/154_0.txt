This place has the cutest and quirkest little items for sale, a great place to shop for a gift for a mom, sister, or friend! I always love the selection of cards they have too.\n\nOn top of that, their bakery case is AMAZING. I'm not a huge fan of their cookies (I like mine to be more moist and chewy, theirs tend to be drier and crumblier), but I like their tres leches cake and the old-timer cupcake (the one that looks like a big Hostess cupcake). Their gelato is really good too and made in-house with no preservatives or anything weird like that. My favorite flavor is the peach, although the mint is also interesting. Just be forewarned that it's REALLY minty, like really really really minty with actual chunks of mint leaves in it. might be good to eat on a date so you can have super fresh breath for that goodnight smooch! haha!\n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the parking situation is ridiculous. I know they have a valet who will park your car for you and they validate the valet ticket so you don't have to pay the $3, but it's still an inconvenience! last time I came I had to wait almost 15 min in a long line of cars, boo.
