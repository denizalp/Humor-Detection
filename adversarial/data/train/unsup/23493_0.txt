Let's face it, dealing with insurance companies is probably about as pleasant as rolling around a mound of fire ants in your birthday suit. Well, typically it is anyway. Ashlee Candelaria and her staff are an exception to that rule of thumb. She has been my agent for about 2 years now and I can't imagine dealing with anyone else. If I have a question regarding my coverage or changing my policy, she gets back to me faster than Honey Boo-Boo can finish a giant bowl of 'sketti'. All jokes aside, if the last thing you want to have to worry about is how your insurance (and the headaches that can come along with it) is handled, then look no further than Ashlee and her staff. I promise you won't bother going anywhere else. They make everything painfully easy. And that rules. \n\nP.S. Make sure you check out their life insurance policies. I wouldn't be caught dead without it.
