Zoe's Kitchen has become my number 1 post workout go to spot. If it weren't a bit pricey I would have it every time I work out! But unfortunately I've got to be more cautious with my spending so I find myself here on the harder workout days where I know I'm getting the best post workout meal to help replenish my body. \nI love their steak and salmon kabobs. They have so much flavor and are so juicy. And the vegetables are grilled to perfection. They will allow you to substitute the sides which is great for someone looking to watch their carb intake. I always end up substituting their potatoes out for a Greek salad (comes with the steak entree)\nTheir salad dressing is also a reason to head here. Even if it's just to buy a bottle to go. \nThey always have a clean atmosphere and very welcoming employees. Even after I come in all sweaty and gross, I don't feel like they're judging me.
