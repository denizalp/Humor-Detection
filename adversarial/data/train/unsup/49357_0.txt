While on my recent visit to Arizona, I had dinner at this cute little Thai restaurant. My family who lives in the area tell me this is their go-to place when they are in the mood for Thai food, and after eating here I could see why. The restaurant is family owned, and they are warm and pleasant. They give you a good amount of food and it's all so delicious! I ordered myself some yellow curry with seafood, tom yum with shrimp, and pineapple fried rice. All this food was more than enough to fill my hunger. Thumbs up to Tum Nak Thai!
