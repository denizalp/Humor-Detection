This place is a hidden gem located in the backroom at commonwealth. It was like the book from \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,\" and BAM you are in a a different place. The room itself is really small, but that is what makes it so personal. The atmosphere and the live piano music was amazing! A bunch of our friends came here for a birthday and had a blast. Thanks to my friend who showed us this place. \n\nFirst, the popcorn is amazing!!! The popcorn is so delicious, even Jesus himself can't resist the temptation. hahaha. The drinks are about $15, but they are strong and meant to sip as you sing the night away with the piano man and converse with close friends or the people next to you! I loved how there aren't a bunch of drunk d-bags around you yelling in your ear and spilling drinks all over the place.\n\nWhat more can you say about a place? Its classy, fun, and entertaining.
