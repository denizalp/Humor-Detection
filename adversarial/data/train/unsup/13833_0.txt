After months of ignoring the obvious, I realized the remnants of red and multi layers of shit brown in my hair were no longer cute. I came to the conclusion that my hair needed to be dyed... one colour! \n\nI recently ran into an acquaintance from college who I found out is a part owner of a salon in the Danforth. Since I have no loyalty to hair salons and wanted try a new place I booked an appointment t see her that week.\n\nEven though this location is super far from my place, it is conveniently located next to Chester station. I went up to the second floor and was greeted by the friendliest assistant I had even encountered. She brought me tea and showed me to my seat.\n\nMandye (the hair dresser) went over colour options with me and suggested a couple different things she thought would work well. Their selection of trashy tabloid magazines was impressive and faster than I could say \"what other ho did Jesse James sleep with?!\" I was done and ready for my bang trim.\n\nIn the end the service was good, my colour is great and as a bonus there is an AMAZING shoe shop (Balisi) a few doors down.
