This great new restaurant is right at the corner of Clifton and 117th where the old Clifton Diner was. The food is fresh and pretty and it's a great place to pop in for a quick meal. You order at the counter and they bring you your food, so if you feel pressure when ordering, take a look at it before you go in, but their menu is pretty small, so it shouldn't be too hard. We went with a group of 7 and got a table together easily. Everyone was happy with their meals. I definitely recommend the burger, the fried chicken and the bowls. And the goat cheese ball salad. Ok, I recommend everything. If you eat with your eyes like I do, follow them on Instagram for a comprehensive look at all their menu items: Landmark_Cleveland
