My husband and I came to this plaza for the movie and diner, we stumble up this secret spot for art lovers. The paint workshop has everything I need to paint a picture of my choice, great place to spend some time, for yourself\/with friends or they host parties too. Good for all ages, you will get all the help and advise or just do your thing. Will definitely be back.
