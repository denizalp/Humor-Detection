I've been looking for a great sports bar, and this place fits the bill to a T. Too bad its on the other side of town. Lots of TV's, at least 4 per viewing side, plus a big screen. Dedicated steel tip dart area, plus a couple video games. Several gaming spots along the bar for plenty of gambling. \n\nService behind the bar was very good. Beers filled when empty without asking. As for food, the menu looks great but my friend wanted chicken wings so that's what we ordered, and they were nothing special at all, slightly overcooked, and not much flavor. Said $10.99 on the menu, but must have been on special because it was only a $6 and change charge. Either way, probably not worth it. Will have to try other things on the menu. \n\nI will stop in again, because its a great place to watch multiple games at the same time. Staff was friendly. 3.5 stars
