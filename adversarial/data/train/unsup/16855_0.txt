if you don't love this place i don't want to know you... seriously. happy hour has half off glasses of wine, $1 off beers, $5 specialty martinis (the espresso martini is a good post-work pick me up) and half off apps. \n\ntry these on your first visit: caprese (tomatoes, basil mozerella and mix of olive oil and balsamic vinegar), the shrimp that comes in the most deilcious sauce you have ever tasted- you only get 5 scrimps, but after you've gobbled em up, use the complimentary bread for dipping, the artichoke.\n\nfor dinner: i love the tortellini brigantino, cheese filled torts in a white cream sauce. the voodoo penne is prob one of their most popular and pretty good. polo polo is cheese filled torts in both red and white sauce. if you can spring the bucks, get Luca's Meatballs - so damn a good i can't stand it ($15).\n\nfor lunch: i've never had their sandwiches but they sound good. the salads are amazing, like the SoCal Love (it sounds lame i hate saying the words to order it, but it's yummy with avocado and almonds and chicken if you want).\n\nthe crowd: all ages, ASU profs side by side with intellectual hipster artist types. no sorority sisters or frat guys here, although it's on the mill strip (thankfully). the staff is all super nice, their all pierced or tattooed and obviously free to show that, so this upscale restaurant gets a bit of an edge, which is nice to see.\n\ni rarely come if it's not happy hour, cause it can get pricey, but the food and atmosphere is dang good. there is live music on weekends and HH is only in the small, quick to get packed bar area.
