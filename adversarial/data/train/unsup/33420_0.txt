Wow !!! First really bad experience at a Target- asked an employee where something was he told me - no it wasn't  there went and asked again he said he didn't know that wasn't his section I would have to check with someone else and walked away went up to the front desk woman behind the counter said I will be right back went in back came out with another employee they were trying to solve an issue I was the only one standing there - they completely ignored me I walked away - going somewhere else
