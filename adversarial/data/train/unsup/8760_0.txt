Hey.  You.  Owen's is terrible.  Don't go there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot buying it, huh?  Well... I guess we couldn't keep it a secret forever. Owen's is hands down the best specialty bagel sandwich shop in Charlotte.  Listen, that's a big statement from me.  My family has been in the bagel business for over 50 years.  We owned one of the first bagel shops in New York and LA before Brueggar's and Einstein's came in and demolished everyone.  You want a good bagel in Charlotte?  Owen's or Poppy's.  That's it.\n\nAll you need to know is if you can dream it, Owen's can do it.\n\nFan Favorites:\n* Grubby Bubby\n* Booty Bagel on Blueberry\n\nPersonal Favorite:\n* Bagel, Egg and Chive Cream Cheese (add salt and pepper) on Everything.\n\nOther Important Notes:\nDogs are welcome, but not preferred inside the actual bagel shop.  You can write on the walls.  If you're going with two people, best to each get your own sandwhich and then share a Booty Bagel for dessert (Yes, I most certainly believe in breakfast dessert).\n\nMy only wish is that they had better coffee.  But for how good the bagels are, I'll drink it.\n\nCheers to the fat kids!
