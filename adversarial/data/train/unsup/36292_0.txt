Came here not knowing what I should try. The gentleman was nice enough to take the initiative to walk me through the menu. He gave me a few suggestions for customers favourite. \n\nI went with the cheese steak poutine $10.99, thinking I can try both (cheese steak and fries) in one. I did notice everyone else ordered their special which is 6\" cheese stake sandwich, Phil size fries and a pop for $9.99. \n\nI was offered extra cheese sauce on top and onions without extra charge. The meat was tender, however it was a bit salty for my liking. It could be because of the cheese sauce added on top as well. I think it will be better when pair with the sandwich instead. The fries are thick cut and fresh, the saltiness of the gravy is on point. I think it's best if I get the original poutine and cheese steak sandwich instead.
