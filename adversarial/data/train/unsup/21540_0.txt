This place is precious. I'm glad I came in, I was planning on going to Chop Shop but walked past Farm & Craft on my way in. The decor is clean and simple. I ordered the Cali Bowl {quinoa | kale | cherry heirloom tomato | edamame | asparagus | yellow endive | pepper jack cheese | avocado}. Presentation was on point and it was almost too pretty to eat! The tomato added a great acidic boost to the dish. I liked it so much I recreated it at home (results may vary). I also got one of their fresh pressed juices- which honestly next time I'll skip. It was pretty expensive at $7. And I just can't justify spending $7 on a drink that doesn't have any alcohol lol! Which brings me to my next point, their bar set up is really cute and I wish I would've sat there so I could see what type of selection they offered. I will make it a point to come back here for some Bloody Mary's and brunch!
