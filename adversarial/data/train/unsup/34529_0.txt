To start off with one of the most authentic Korean food I have ever had in my life. The Kim chi was excellent and the tofu soup was so filling and really hot I could tell it was fresh they had 30 mins left to close they still had excellent customer service. The price was excellent. The dumpling appetizers was excellent and they had a unique dish just purple rice with water I think it is a traditional  in Korea I could tell this is a Korean restaurant just by walking in any restaurnat kain thing attracts me is customer service and this place exceeded my expectations I am definitely coming back
