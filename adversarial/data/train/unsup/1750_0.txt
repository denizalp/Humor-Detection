This is the best Greek restaurant in town!\n\nI have been ordering the #5 lamb and beef gyro plate since 2003. It comes with mounds of succulent gyro meat, an Israeli salad, pita bread, and hummus. all for about 11$. \n\nAlso, Bacchus would be envious of the beer selection! There are over thirty beers including many Greek ones. You can also order ouzo to drink with your Greek beer. \n\nI had a crisp Hillas for 3$ which is reasonably priced for an import. \n\nDon't forget to check into yelp for a free baklava!
