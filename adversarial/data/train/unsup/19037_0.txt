Pretty good \"dirty\" pizza, if you don't know what dirty pizza is it's basically just good old fashion greasy pizza normally from places that just make old fashion pizza none of that pizza with chicken and artichoke crap... This place is just plan old fashion pizza which is becoming more and more rare in Toronto's downtown core as hipsters take over. \nThis place is certainly family run, the 90 year old man who makes the pizzas went outside to shovel snow in just a tee shirt and said he didn't realize he wasn't wearing a coat, the girl who worked there was sharing stories this place is 100% family run and it's awesome.\nObviously it isn't the best pizza, but it's cheap and good if your looking for some classic pizza that's nothing fancy just pepperoni and cheese pizza.
