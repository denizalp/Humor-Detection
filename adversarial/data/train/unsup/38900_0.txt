I've got nothing but great things to say about Dr. Newman, the staff, and the offices at PV OB GYN. Dr. Newman was my physician from my 32nd week of pregnancy on, & I'm so happy that I happened to find him. I had a relatively difficult 21 hours of labor that ended in an emergency cesarean, & I now have a healthy 3 week old baby boy to show for it. I haven't had reason to doubt Dr. Newman's knowledge & professionalism for even a moment, and there are no words to describe my gratitude to him for helping bring my son into the world safely. \n\nOne word of note: Dr. Newman has a very dry sense of humor. I personally love it & it jives with my personality perfectly, but hey - that's not everyone's cuppa tea.
