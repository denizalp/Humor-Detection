FLY IN SOY \n\nWhat is the first thing you do before the sushi gets to your table? You pour soy on that little plate, but the last thing you expect is a dead fly to come out of there! \n\nNow the fly is not the big problem, the problem was the waitress, instead of apologizing for the mishap she immediately started making excuses of how the fly's get into the restaurant ... I had to interrupt her by telling her to just change the set up. \n\nWhen the bill came, no attempt to apologize for that nasty surprise was made nether verbally or physically on the bill. \n\nTheir food is decent but not great, I will never go there again nor tell others to go... too bad because its in my neighborhood .
