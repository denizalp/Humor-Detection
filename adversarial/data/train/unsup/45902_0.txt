I can't believe I missed this place when I lived closer to it.  \n\nExceptionally good food (pork and steak fajitas on my first trip),  a great happy hour, a fantastic house margarita, and some of the best service I have ever had in town.  WOW WOW WOW.  Definitely my new first and last stop for Mexican meals.  Prices were more than reasonable.  I look forward to becoming a regular here.
