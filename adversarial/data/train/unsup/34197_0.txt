CIBO on 17th Ave has an extraordinary pizza bar and uber friendly attentive staff that makes you feel like you just stepped into a backyard party with unbelievably casual yet chic gourmet food. Always consistently top quality pizza with a heavenly crust that easily becomes my top addiction when dipped into that top secret caper garlic sauce dip that is Screaming MORE! MORE! And the staff to boot is incredibly customer service oriented, going out of their way to indulge any sweet\/salty cravings you may have - and also treat you to tastings of the next up and coming experimental pizza in the works. How much do I simply LOVE CIBO? Well, dear, let me count the many pizza creations I've enjoyed and come back for over and over again...Just ask for the pizza maestros behind the bar --Kevin, Chance, Damien and Paul!!!
