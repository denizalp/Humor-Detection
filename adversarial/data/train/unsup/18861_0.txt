This Winners location still consistently stocks the most recent Matt + Nat models and has them in every colour, finish and size. You need to seriously dig because deals lurk in EVERY CORNER. The shoe department is also pretty decent but it's the bags that I lust after.\n\nThe makeup and hair stuff is usually too picked over to be of any use, but the duvet\/bedding selection is great and I love how spacious it is in this store. There's also a washroom in case you find yourself here for three hours midday on a Tuesday and need to take a pee break whilst browsing denim in the Junior Trendsetters section (not that this has ever happened to me).
