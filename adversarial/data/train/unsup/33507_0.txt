I mentioned that I went here to some folks in the neighbourhood and they were very excited to hear my opinion...unfortunately though, I didn't have anything good to say. The person who served me (possibly the owner) pretty much mumbled the whole time. I had a half chicken and declined the hot sauce. I do notice all the mentions about the hot sauce and maybe I regret not going for that, but what I really could have used was chalet sauce. The white meat was super-dry...really not what I was expecting from a \"specialty\" chicken place that looks like it's been around for a while. Have to say this was super disappointing.\n\nThe potatoes were good though.
