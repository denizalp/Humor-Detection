Omg please hire more workers during peak hours. I have spent nearly TWO HOURS waiting in line. Ironically their sign says \" standing in line belongs in the past \".  There was 1 person helping roughly 50 or more customers. This is a holiday weekend.  It doesn't take much brains to figure out you need to have more staff to meet the demand. \nalso, after 12:am you cannot use the preferred service, you have to stand in line. \nAvoid at all cost.  \nWill this bad review and the others even matter to AVIS?? Most likely not. Since they are a corporation and we look for cheaper options every day. So nothing will change ( except for the car rental price going higher) and i just spent 3 minutes writhing this review. You get what you pay for.
