Meat floss and corn egg crepe ($4.20)\nThis was really tasty. The egg crepe was nice and crispy, fully stuffed with ingredients to the point where it was hard to eat it in its form without anything falling out.\n\nHouse special sandwich ($5.99)\nPork loin marinated with house special sauce, tomato, fried egg, cabbage and peanut butter. I asked for no peanut butter since I am allergic, but even without the peanut butter the sandwich was really tasty already. The pork loin was charcoal grilled which made it really good. \n\nMalaysian street style sandwich ($5.99)\n4oz ground beef with a taste of Malaysian spice, tomato, fried egg, lettuce, and sweet and spicy sauce. The meat essentially tastes like a sausage, with spice. I liked the house special sandwich more. The sweet and spicy sauce didn't go too well with the sandwich in my opinion. \n\nI really liked the food here! Service was good, food was good and cheap! Perfect lunch spot. I'll definitely come back for lunch if i'm in the area.
