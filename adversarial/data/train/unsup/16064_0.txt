I have always loved Postino's great food and atmosphere. However the last few times have been less than desirable. The last time I was in was seated but had to wait to sit for a few minutes so the young man could take the 2 extra plates, why not take them after we have sat instead of us standing awkwardly in the way of others. Service to get our drinks was slow, mind you there were only a few other tables sat as we were there pretty early. The food came wrong requested chips as side was given salad when asked to get chips they came with attitude again 5 minutes later. Asked for a refill on Diet came back 10 minutes later with regular. Had to hunt down the waiter for the check only to have to hunt him back down to get the $3 charge for chips to be taken off. Even after all this I decided to do a to go order today. Was on hold for 10 minutes before hanging up and taking my business elsewhere. Will not be back and this was a place I regularly got lunch from twice a week. Do not know if new management but extremely disappointing.
