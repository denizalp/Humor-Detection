Bobby Flay seems to be everywhere these days. Unaffected by his recent tabloid exposure, his empire of restaurants, TV shows, signature sauces and spices, cookbooks, and kitchenware are ubiquitous.\n\nI even dreamt that Bobby came over to barbecue with us the other night (note to self: cut down on late-night Food Network binges). I am a fan of his big bold flavors and southwestern-style food.\n\nWe look forward to discovering a life-changing restaurant or meal each time we visit Las Vegas. This trip, we made reservations at Giada's. Our second choice: Bobby's Michelin-starred Mesa Grill @Caesars. The main reason we chose Giada's was convenience, as it's is a short walk from our City Center hotel. Bobby's Burger Palace (BBP) was not even on our radar.\n\nBut as we walked out of our hotel in the middle of this hot, drought-stricken desert city carved by time, tradition, and the mob -- right there in front of us -- a mirage? NO. Psychosis? NO. Standing tall: a BBP!!! The skies parted. A bolt of lightning struck the side of the building. An angel that looked a bit like Cat Cora chanted...\"hallelujah\".\n\nI got on my OpenTable app and dropped Giada faster than NBC dropped Bill Cosby's fall sitcom, choosing BBP instead (sorry Giada D!). Note to Giada: Since you and Bobby are such good \"friends\", you should be okay with this.\n\nWhat I knew about BBP is that it was created to serve food that Bobby himself likes to eat when he's done working in his kitchens. Simple burgers, fries and shakes with his signature gourmet touches. Until recently -- the locations were all on the east coast. But now open for your west side Flay-fix, the largest Burger Palace ever -- at City Center in Las Vegas.\n\nDesigned more like a hip lounge or bar, the place has brightly colored lime and brown furnishings, sweeping curved counters and walls, ample window seating, long communal tables, whimsical light fixtures, and striking neon signage. Bold design to prepare you for some bold flavors ahead.\n\nI ordered the Bobby Blue Burger. 6 full ounces of 80\/20 Certified Angus Beef with perfectly melted blue cheese. Bacon, lettuce and tomato on a soft sesame seed bun. \"Crunchified\" of course - topped with crispy thin potato chips. Took a bite... OMG... the skies parted. A bolt of lightning struck the side of the building. An angel that looked like Cat Cora chanted...\"hallelujah\".\n\nCombined with the transcendental golden-brown Vidalia onion rings that taste as good as they look, and the LIFE-CHANGING cream-a-licious \"mocha caramel\" shake, this was a meal that sang together in beautiful, perfect food harmony. The burgers, rings, and shakes I've been eating my entire life are now totally meaningless. \n\nI would gladly eat at Bobby's Burger Palace regularly -- but as of now there are no California locations. So I guess its back to the Food Network and Cooking Channel we go....\n\nProtip: If you can't get a regular Flay-fix because you aren't on the east coast (or Vegas), you can take any of the house-made sauces home for $6-$10. BBP Fry Sauce (tangy mayo, roasted red and adobo peppers), Burger Sauce (think steakhouse sauce, thick and rich), Chipotle Ketchup (smoky and fiery) or the Jalape√±o Hot Sauce (green chilies for heat). \n\n#FearTheCosby\n#GetCrunchified\n#FoodNetworkBinge\n#LifeChangingShakes
