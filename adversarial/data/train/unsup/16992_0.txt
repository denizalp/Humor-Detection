3 stars for taste, 0 for quantity, 4 for the ambiance (we were lucky enough to get a table overlooking the Bellagio), 1.5 for service.\nThe food really was just OK, not terrible, but not great either.   However, the portions were horribly tiny at very high prices.  The wait person told us that Giada intended for the portions to be shared.  REALLY?  That would be very difficult to do with the amount of food in each order.  \nThe restaurant was nicely appointed, but there were a few too many reminders of who the owner is  - \"Giada\" stamped on the napkins and placements, pictures of her through-out copies of her cookbook strategically placed, a picture frame with her name in it, etc.  Kinda reminded me of Oprah and her magazine, if you know what I mean.\nOur waiter was friendly, polite and informative, but the meal was not well paced at all.  This could have been because the restaurant was thinning out (our reservation was for 10pm) and he didn't NEED to get us moving.  He initially warned us that we were not ordering a lot of food but we were OK with it because of the late hour.  It was still less than we expected.\nI don't know what Giada's claim to fame is, other than her last name.  Is she a chef or a TV personality?  I'll stick with the latter.
