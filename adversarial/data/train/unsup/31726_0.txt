This would be good if they at least spoke more English enabling them to speak to there non speaking chinese customers. I went there with a friend hoping to get a meal together as a family size portion. I went there of course to see how every customers had there dishes like and pretty much its a lunch size portion and of course when i got mine, it was small and the workers there was staring at us and probably talking about too. So i think this will be my first and last time coming to this place. This place only for people whp speaks chinese more. Cause they only know very basic English. Other than that i rather go else where.
