This is my third time a range, and my first time to\nGVR. We were greeted immediately and cheerfully. I'm still new to this, so I had questions, all of which were answered thoroughly. I tried my friend's 9mm, 40, and AR15 (for fun). The 22 is super easy but I'm afraid to rely on it for self protection. The 9mm and 40 are way too much for me. So Marcus suggested I try the new Smith and Wesson 380 M&P. Wow! What an excellent choice. Marcus was right there with me to give me tips. I am definitely comfortable and confident with that pistol, and very grateful to Marcus. The store has a great selection of accessories- including a gorgeous purse to conceal. Prices are very reasonable. This is exactly the type of business that will keep me a loyal customer. Whether you are an expert or a beginner, they've got you well covered!
