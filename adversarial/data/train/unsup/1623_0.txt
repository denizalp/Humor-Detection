WORST. HOTEL. EVER.    I don't know if the tower rooms are any better than the courtyard (where we stayed), but the whole experience we had here was awful, from beginning to end:\n1)  The \"resort fee\" literally cost us more than the room itself\n2)  They sell you non-refundable breakfast buffet coupons then don't tell you all the terms and restrictions so you end up wasting your money\n3)  Their \"complimentary internet\" is sporatic and unstable\n4)  The rooms are cramped and there are no bed options bigger than double\n5)  If you are over 5' 5\", you will have to crouch or sit down on the floor of the shower fit to under it....or you will only get clean from the waist down.\n6)  The management and staff are the smarmiest, nastiest samples of humanity you'll ever find.  Watch out for the tall blond manager.  I swear he was one of those creepy evil smiley guys that eat your soul (while grinning from ear to hear with pure hatred) from that episode of \"Buffy.\"
