I came for brunch with my girlfriend and was incredibly surprised. Bree recommended that we try the Carnitas hash and it was amazing I ate the entire thing in one sitting and could not be happier. I pretty much had to be rolled out. I mean look at this picture. Phenomenal right?! The Bloody Mary bar was insane. Some lady even got a cheese stick on hers  I'll be making this a go to spot for me and my friends!
