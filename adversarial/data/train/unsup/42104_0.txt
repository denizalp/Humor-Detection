Woke up Thursday morning to a swampy garage and a wet floor. Our old Rheem finally said goodbye after many years of great service. We called Water Heaters Only since they installed the original unit. Gave a great quote over the phone, Don showed up first thing the next morning and went right to work. Clean, efficient and left no trace. No surprise on the quote either. No complaints here. Thanks Don and Water Heaters Only!
