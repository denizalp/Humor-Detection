When I booked our room at Mandalay Bay, it came with a deal for two complimentary tickets to a list of shows. We decided to see Zumanity since neither my cousin or I had seen a Cirque du Soleil show and we were so so so excited!\n\nZumanity is located inside New York New York towards the back of the casino. The theater itself was comfortable, intimate, and all the plush, red colors gave off a very sexy vibe. We sat in the balcony (row EE) and we could see everything! Pretty good for free tickets ;)\n\nThe show itself is more on the burlesque side and not only features acrobats and dancers, but also some fun crude humor. The show is very sensual, sexy, and fun. The live band was awesome! It's definitely not for anyone who is prude or easily offended and not appropriate for kids. In fact, they advertise their show as 21+. Some of my favorite acts were the acrobats and tissue dancers! So beautiful! However, the highlight of the show was the middle-aged lady who pretty much mounted one of the dancers and made out with his body...hilarious! \n\nI honestly wasn't sure what to expect out of Zumanity but I must say I was pleasantly surprised! It was so much fun and definitely a highlight of our Vegas trip. Keep an open mind and don't hesitate to see this show ;)
