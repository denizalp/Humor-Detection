I had never been here before, but it sounded like a cool place to check out and walk. The parking lot on a beautiful Saturday morning was virtually empty. \n\nAfter a quick check of the map, I decided to walk the outer perimeter trail. Its not a very big park, and this walk totalled about 1.7 miles I think. There are plenty of interior trails so if you veer off the cement path you can extend the walk. There's a couple of places near the stream where you can sit and enjoy the sound of running water. There's also plenty of trees so this could offer shade during the hot summer months. Its kind of nice to walk around and feel like you are not in a desert. There is a bike trail that you can take all the way to Lake Las Vegas.\n\nThe pictures give you an idea whats here. There is a Nature Center but I didn't go in. Good place to take the family for some nature learning.
