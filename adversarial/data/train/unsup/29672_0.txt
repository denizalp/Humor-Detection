Excellent place for a wedding or any reception! Food, service, location, relationship with the team, everything was perfect! \n\nWe liked the opportunity to do have our photoshoot in the apple tree field next to the sugar shack, the outdoor installation for the ceremony, and the wonderful style of the room for the dinner. We didn't have to add any decoration inside! They were also really understanding of our needs as a multicultural group and arrange different menus to accommodate us.\n\nIf you are looking for a place that with an experienced team that you can trust, I invite you to go there!!! 5 stars!
