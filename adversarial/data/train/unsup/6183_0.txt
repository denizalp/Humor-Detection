Shiny new hospital that you couldn't miss if you tried. It's the biggest building in the Seton\/Auburn Bay\/Cranston area! How do you get to said area? Drive all the way down Deerfoot South and follow the giant \"H\" and \"HOSPITAL IS HERE\" signs.\n\nSo fresh, the clipboards are still covered in plastic packaging and the stoplights leading the way aren't in working order yet. The staff here is extremely helpful, the nurses are friendly and happy to assist you in finding which floor you need to be on, and there's no weird hospital-y smell just yet. \n\nParking is roughly $2 every half hour, but I just received amazing news at this hospital, so IDGAF. I'm glad the South Health Campus exists.\n\nPro-tip: If you're not having an emergency and are here for an appointment, don't go to the front. You will block ambulances and people trying to get to the emergency room. Drive around to the back of the hospital and follow the signs for the public parking.
