I normally don't do buffets but this one is fantastic! For around $25 at dinner, you have items to chose from like, king crab, prime rib, pesto mashed potatoes and sushi! There is a salad bar, soups, various fish entrees, Asian, Indian, Italian and American foods. Plus everything is good! I think I tried a little of everything! :( The dessert bar has a good selection of yummies like tirimisu,cheesecake and tarts. They are all presented really nice with chocolate \"B's\", for Bellagio of course. Not all buffets are good on the strip so BUYER BEWARE. Spend the extra $5 per person to go to the Bellagio, it is WELL worth the extra cash.
