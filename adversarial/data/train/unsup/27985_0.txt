Such a reliable spot for lunch or dinner, and very friendly staff. They have the best and most interesting wraps I've tried, and friends say the soups are to die for. Can't believe I haven't had one yet! The chicken salad was full of fresh ingredients, just enough to really fill you up. I love the steak wrap, with the mix of spinach and sweet potato, all the flavours blend seamlessly. Looking forward to my next visit.
