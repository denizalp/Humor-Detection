Living in the suburbs, can be a disadvantage when needing comfort food at super cheap prices during late night hours. It was a long day for my family and we had one of those moments when your too tired to cook and then worry about cleaning up afterwards. So we ended up trying this place out with the help of my Yelp app. What drew us to this place was the prices but was quite pleased that they had a good variety of graveyard specials to choose from. \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive, he made sure everything was okay with us. The portions are quite large and it was a bit overwhelming especially the order of pancakes. However, everything we had was satisfying and nothing was mind blowing just more of an afterthought. The great thing about this place is that the crowd is more smaller than other places and the service moves pretty quickly. A good option if your looking for cheap comfort food!\n\n2017 Yelp Review #37
