You cannot ask for more than a mountain in the city of Montreal. Mind you the summit is just under 800 ft of elevation which is easily a quarter of what a real hike on a mountain would be, BUT.... the mountain is simply beautiful and well maintained for a nice stroll throughout the year. It has three main points: Chalet du Mont Royal, Mount Royal Cross and Belvédère Camillien-Houde. The mountain offers different trails to accommodate bikers, runners or walkers. I live about a block from the first trailhead and it takes me no more than 30 minutes to reach the cottage or 40 to reach the cross from home.
