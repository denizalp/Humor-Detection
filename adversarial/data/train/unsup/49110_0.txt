My dishwasher hasn't been draining for months. I finally had enough money to get a new one. I decided to buy a dishwasher from my friend, as her mother had just passed and they were selling all the belongings in the house. I called Colburn to have them do the install. I originally set up my appointment for a Monday evening after I got off of work. A couple days later I realized that I had made a critical error! I had set up an appointment for install but not one for dismantling from my friends Moms place. So I then did when any tech savvy person does and youtubed how to uninstall a dishwasher. Within 30 to 60 seconds I realized that there was no way I would be able to uninstall the new dishwasher. I called up Colburn and explained what had happened and they were super nice. I rescheduled for a Sunday uninstall, install. They were so nice and on time, clean and efficient. They guy who came out even unclogged my sink for free. They are great! I will use they again and have already referred my friend to them. I recommend everyone to use these guys. In total for it cost me $230. There was no headache, the whole process went smoothly.
