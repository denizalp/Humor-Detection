Literally every time I go here I just see how incompetent the workers can be. I ask for no cheese on a burger.. and every single time I check. There's fuckin cheese on there. Like every single time, I have a dairy allergy and it's so hard to not fuck this up but EVERY SINGLE TIME. The ticket on the burger says \"no cheese\" and that hoe is covered in your melted plastic bullshit. HOW
