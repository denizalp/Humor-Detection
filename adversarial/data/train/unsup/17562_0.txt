You've replaced Walmart as my go to.  You are simply more convenient, more friendly, and although you force me to use a friggin' loyalty card - equally well priced.  Plenty of lanes.  A friendly young woman to bag my groceries.  You even carry Vegas Seven on occasion.  Sure I'd be happy if you would stock more than 20lbs of frozen broccoli at once, but we'll work on that.
