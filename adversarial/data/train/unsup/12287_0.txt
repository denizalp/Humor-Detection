Hawaiian Barbecue Beef. My daughter and I drove through and picked up the Hawaiian BBQ Beef plate. I considered getting the chicken katsu, but they only use dark meat for their chicken dishes except the grilled chicken breast. So, I passed.\n\nThe beef was tender and well marinated. My daughter greedily ate all the meat and rice after my taster. So, she definitely approved of it. The steamed or boiled cabbage below gave the illusion that there was more meat than was there, but I enjoyed the meat juice on top of the cabbage. The broccoli was on the crunchy side.\n\nThe macaroni salad was okay, but it could possibly have been more flavorful because I was recovering from a cold and might not have been able to fully taste it.\n\nI also purchased the spam musubi which looked rather large and clunky. My son said that he had little or no teriyaki or saucing on the spam and was slightly disappointing. I guess I still owe him some homemade musubi.
