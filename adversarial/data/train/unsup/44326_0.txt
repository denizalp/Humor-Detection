The way to this girls heart is thru a juicy, flavorful steak... preferably a Ribeye! \n\nWell that's just what I got at Hanks.. went in with my husband & shared the 28 oz Ribeye.. huuuuge I know.. lol! That's why we shared it.. And all their sides are served family style.. 2-4 people serving.. we got augratin potatoes & asparagus.. Both were phenomenal.\n\nI ordered french onion soup for app & thought it was waaaay tooo salty. My husband got a wedge salad.. can't go wrong! \n\nOpted out for dessert.. we were way too full..lol
