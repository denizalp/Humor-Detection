Had a wonderful dining experience! I'm a big original pancake house fanatic, and thanks to groupon now I can have some breakfast variety! I had corned beef hash and eggs ( they have both homemade or canned!) and the best banana nut muffin ever! My friend had NY strip and eggs. That steak was incredible, tender and really delish. Our server Cherie was a delight. Groupon or not.... Can't wait to go back
