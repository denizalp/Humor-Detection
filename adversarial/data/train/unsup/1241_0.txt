It's unfortunate to see so many negative reviews on here. I love Dr. Tabossi. She is very sweet and understanding. Her office is cute and the spa in the back is very relaxing as well. It is true there is some waiting time with her but if you want the best you have to wait sometimes. She is in high demand. She took care of me during my pregnancy and made me feel comfortable during my C section. The scar was low and the recovery is going good. I recommend Dr. T :)
