The early bird catches the worm.  For real.\n\nI arrived at the Aviary with my 8 yr old cousin as soon as it opened, and bc we were there so early we got to help them feed the birds in the Wetlands exhibit.\n\nLittle dude got to hold up dead fish and meal worms and have the birds swoop and take them out of his hands.  The entire time this was going on, I was sitting with my jacket pulled over my head praying i didn't get shat on, but I didn't so that was cool.\n\nDead fish?  Dead worms?  Getting them yanked out of your hand by a bird?  Lets just say, my cousin thought I was FREAKING AWESOME.\n\nThe Aviary is beautiful.  I come here as often as I can.  Do stay for the shows, they are worthwhile.
