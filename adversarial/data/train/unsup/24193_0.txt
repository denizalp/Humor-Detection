Lee's is kind of like the McDonald's of Vietnamese sandwiches.  Popular, cheap, widespread (they even have a location in Oklahoma City!), but the sandwiches here are made in a more mass-produced, fast-food standard rather than with the passion and knowledge of a mom-and-pop operation.  \n\nI ate here back when Lee's first opened, and I was a neophyte to Vietnamese sandwiches.  I thought, wow!  What a great deal!  And so tasty!  Years passed, and after eating Vietnamese sandwiches in various big cities (San Francisco, Chicago, NYC) in different states, even compared to a Cleveland Vietnamese sandwich, it isn't the best out there.  Eating again here after all these years, yeah, some of the magic has gone.   The bread is still great, crusty\/crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, but they put on a skimpy amount of veggies and meat compared to what you will usually get at a real Vietnamese restaurant.  It's kind of like when you first eat at McDonald's as a kid- wow!  Hamburgers and fries in a cool box with toys!  And then years later, sure you still eat there occasionally, but you have to admit it's really not the best burger you've had.\n\nI also had some Thai iced tea, and it was really the worst Thai tea I've had.  It was really medicine-tasting, and I could only drink a few sips before throwing it away in disgust.\n\nWould I still eat here?  Well, yes if I am in the area, but I probably won't go out of my way to head to Lee's for my banh mi fix.
