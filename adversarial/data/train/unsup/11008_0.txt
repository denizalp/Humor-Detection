Just went there for drinks and appetizers! Truly unimpressed! The food was imaginative but not tasty! Had the Kimchi tacos, the calamari and mini burgers. Had five drinks and the bill was $130. Walked away hungry and didn't feel like the drinks measured up! Hank's at Green Valley Ranch - much better good  happy hour and better quality drinks!  The best thing about this place is the valet parking and very attentive staff! Need a better bartender. Don't waste your time or money!
