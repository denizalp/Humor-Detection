Update:  I love this place.  It's five stars all the way for me.  The corn butter miso ramen is the best.  I'm no ramen expert, but I've learned what I like and it's Ramen Sora.  The best time to come here is when they open in the morning so you don't have to wait long.  I usually have edamame first and then the big steaming bowl follows not long after.  Ramen always tastes better when it's cold outside, too.  I need to get my fix soon.  Ramen is also better with friends along, but I've also come here by myself because when you have a ramen jones, you need to feed that monster.  If you need to get your slurp on, this is the place.
