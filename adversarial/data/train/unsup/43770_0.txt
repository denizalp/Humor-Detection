I've eaten here a few times and I must say that the customer service and food are inconsistent.  One time I had the pad-se-eew and panang, which was good.  The service was great.  Then there was another time I came and the service was lacking.  We weren't even acknowledged for quite some time.  I ordered the pad-se-eew and all I can taste is crunchy garlic bits.  It was horrible.  I took it back and they replaced it.  I also strongly advise to not order the thai iced tea.
