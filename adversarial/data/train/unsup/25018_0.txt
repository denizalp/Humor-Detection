I love korean food so it's no surprise that I like this supermarket. I like how you can get meats for kbbq. It's your typical asian supermarket. I also like how within the supermarket there's a food court, small shops, and a bakery. The bakery inside has great desserts all for under $5! \n\nThe only reason I give this place 4 stars is because of their kimchi. I'm not a huge stock person, and they happen to fill their kimchi containers with mostly stock rather than the leaves. It also didn't taste as great to me until I fried it. \n\nOverall, good place!
