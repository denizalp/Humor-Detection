Went with friends to Carly's Sunday evening, have to say I have walked by Carly's many of times during 1st Fridays but have never stopped by, and seems like a nice lil local bar. Nothing fancy, but not really a dive either. Our server was nice and friendly. \n\nI ordered the anti-pasta plate because I wanted something to nosh on, it was alright, it didn't wow me thought. I also ordered the Chocolate Espresso Martini and let me tell you , that was a great lil drink! Loved it!  My friend ordered the Cuban sandwich and he enjoyed it.   \n\nGlad to have given Carly's a try!
