I was sooooooo mistaken when I wrote my original review!!! Watch out! Buyer beware! Actually, buyer go elsewhere!!! Unless you want to be taken advantage of, don't make the same mistake I did by giving these people your credit card number!!!\n\nAside from overcharging me hundreds of dollars and then telling me (after months of fighting over it) that they would give me $169.00 back because \"Bram is very old\" and made a mistake in calculations, as if they are doing me a favour or something, they basically called me a liar and the carpet that was laid is absolute crap to top it all off! It's lifting, the seams show, and it looks like it's 10 years old in parts. Unbelievable! They never came out to see what was done or anything. Just stood by saying that the job was done, more carpet was laid than really was, and that it's perfect. They might as well have just said \"sod-off!\".\n\nI chose this company since they are well established and seemed price competitive but it's all a mask. They wound up charging me much more than the competition and don't have any degree of customer service. They are shady as shit and it's looking like I am going to have to have the carpeting that I had done through them just four months ago redone through another company. Entrusting my business to this company was like throwing my money onto an open flame, but not nearly as fun. HUGE MISTAKE!\n\nPLEASE do NOT shop here!!! Don't make the same mistake that I did and hire a professional, respectable company. End of the Roll is a rip-off and robber!
