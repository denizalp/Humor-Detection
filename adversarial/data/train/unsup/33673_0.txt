The food is ok but much of it is quite greasy. The service is either deaf or apathetic. Even if I tell them \"give me a minute\" they'll still keep asking \"u ready to order or do u need a minute?\" One time she even kept saying \"hello, hello\" like she couldn't hear anything I said. Been going here for 4 years but at first when this started I thought she must have bad earphones or something but now every time I go back, I'm in the drive they for 10 seconds before she keeps asking again! \nShe acts like she hears NOTHING! Even after I order-shel say! \" u ready to order now! I know she can hear me bc she only starts talking when I'm NOT! The previous times since this started my order has been wrong EVERY TIME! Today she won't even acknowledge anything I say, even after I ordered and said that's all I wanted, she kept asking rudely if I needed a minute and \"are u ready to order!\" So I just drove thru and went somewhere else to eat!\nThey never tell u what ur total is until after u get to the window either! \nThey really don't give a crap!
