We came here on a Saturday night, around 9ish, and ordered 2 AYCE for $68ish (dinner buffet is 28)\n\n- Next to starbucks. Near Eastside Cannery Casino.\n- Easy parking. Great timing. No wait. Seated right away. \n- Sit at bar for faster sushi service. \n- For appetizers, order from waitress. \n- Friendly waitress. She actually told us she doesn't mind if you don't eat all your rice. Just try your best. haha! \n- Amazing sushi chef! We had the legit old Japanese guy. \n- My method of attack:\n1. Get all the items with a happy face on it. That means that they are expensive and limit one per person.\n2. Get the items with the moon icon for dinner only. \n3. Look for the most expensive rolls. \n4. Save room for the mochi. \n- My recommendations unique to Twister \n1. Island tuna poki: good side with sushi\n2. Screaming orgasm: great appetizer\n3. Salmon loves lemon: for salmon sashimi lovers\n4. Spider-Man: for soft shell crab lovers\n5. Rum jungle: Great japanese salsa taste\n- Only AYCE that I've been to where you can get 1\/2 a roll! Great for selection. \n- Compared to Goyemon, you can't get grilled fishes here. \n- Come for the unique sushi selection.
