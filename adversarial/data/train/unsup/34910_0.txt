This location is awesome! Very neat and organized and great! I love how it's one floor and customer service is right at the door so when I have to return something it's right there so I don't have to go all the upstairs. Also for any kohls, their return policy is great! You can return something without a receipt and without a tag even, and get a store credit!!!!!!
