I came here for happy hour, then dinner.  I was very pleased with everything, overall, especially since I didn't like an item: Say what?  If you want to know more, you're gonna have to read more...\n\nI came in on a Tuesday night (dead night for most restaurants).  I was meeting someone a little later for dinner but wanted to see what Happy Hour was like.  First, Happy Hour is only available in the bar area (not sure about patio).  The happy hour menu is all 5 bucks, several apps, well drinks, & draft beer.  In keeping with an Asian theme, I had a pint of Asahi and the Pork Dumplings.  The dumplings were served like fried won ton triangles (with plenty of tasty pork filling) & sitting in a sweet\/sour\/spicy sauce. If I was rating on happy hour alone, this woulda been a 4 star review.  Dinner & extraordinary customer service got the coveted 5th star.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered the Sweet Pea Soup, Caprese, and the Poppy Burger w\/  Poppy Fries..\n\n- Sweet Pea Soup: Like Klingon revenge, it is served cold.  It is sweet & gingery.  Neither I nor my friend cared much for it.  More on how we got satisfaction at the end.\n- Caprese: Served with large heirloom tomatoes.  This dish was classically flavorful; big slices of tomato & mozzarella, chopped basil, & a great aged balsamic reduction.  I forgot to ask for ground pepper, but truthfully, it didn't need it.\n- Poppy Burger: A great burger with kimchi pickles, fired egg, & magic.  This was served with Poppy Fries (kimchi cheese fries).  The kimchi cheese sauce was so good; sweet, cheesy, spicy.  I will probably order this every time I come here.  WOWZERS!\n\nFinally, the service.  It was good service & friendly, but here is what amazed me.  As my friend ate a spoonful of the Sweet Pea Soup, she made a sour face to me to show her displeasure.  This was seen by our server, who was at another table, who immediately said, \"I assume you didn't like the soup, I'll take that away for you.\"  Obviously, it was also removed from our bill.  Maybe she got lucky, maybe she was just good. \n\nWill I go back, YES!  I wish they were open late at night, but no matter, bring on the Quinoa Fried Rice!
