I have very light blonde hair. I went for a root touch up and left with hair that was gray\/silver. No joke, no exaggeration (see in pictures). Owner Todd refused to give me a refund. I was told I could go back to have the color fixed but I was too afraid that their harsh products, overprocessing and incompetent colorists would destroy my hair even more. Steer clear of this place for sure.
