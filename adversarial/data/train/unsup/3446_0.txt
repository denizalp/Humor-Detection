3.5 Stars\n\nTasty House should be call the \"New\" Tasty House.\n\nA brand new menu, A complete makeover, A new Chinese name...\n\nTasty House is not a Hong Kong Style Cafe anymore but more of a Congee\/Noodle\/Rice Roll restaurant.\n\nThere are quite a few new Chinese restaurants in the area specialized in this house made steamed rice roll and Tasty House is one of the better ones! I love how the texture of the rice roll has a little more chewy texture.\n\nPlain Rice Roll ($1.99)\nFisherman Congee ($4.99)\nSpicy Ox Tail ($3.99)\n\nThe food we ordered were all quite good. Come before 11 am and you can pick any congee with any rice roll for $4.99 as breakfast special! This is a good deal!\n\nMost of the other noodles dishes are around $5 or so and comes with a soy milk drink.\n\nTasty House is a good place to come for some congee and rice roll and even some soup noodle. at a good price!\n\nCash Only!
