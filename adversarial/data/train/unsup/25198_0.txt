Let me just say, Waverly I don't get on Yelp a lot but I noticed you added me as a friend so I must accept. I know I'm years late lol! Now, I met Waverly when I first went into Shine Salon, where she worked. I had just recently gotten a bad hair job somewhehre else and the Shine salon had booked me with her and I couldn't be happier. She was attentive, talkative, educational, honest, creative.. omg you named it. She loved Guy Tang and I was so happy. As an Asian girl friend it's hard to find someone to have the patience to color our natural dark roots. So when I found Waverly all my asian sisters were praising my hair. It faded quick, but what can I say? Pastel colors always wash out fast. But I DREAM of having that hair again. I want to find you and never let you go! For right now, I'm letting my hair rest because I think I went too far with bleaching haha But I can say is that Waverly seems to really enjoy what she does. We need more people-- hair stylist like that. I can't wait to visit you in the future.\n-Der Y.
