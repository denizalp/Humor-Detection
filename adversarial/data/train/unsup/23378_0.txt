One day you will realize that your hair looks like crap and you will want it fixed. On that day you should call Curl Up n' Dye and make an appointment with Justine. I would be beside myself with grief if she ever goes anywhere and I can't at least stalk her. She is probably a color genius.\n\nNo, really. I got my hair did yesterday and got nothing but compliments from other chicks asking me how I can pull off platinum blonde without the yellow. The answer is, I can't. Justine does it. I just sit in the chair and make unreasonable demands. \n\nIf you are a chick you know that other chicks don't just run around giving hair compliments to girls they don't know all the time just to be nice. Girls are just not nice people like that.\n\nAnother thing, the price is right. How can I afford to abuse my hair with wonderful results? Justine. Seriously, this chick is amazing. \n\nYou know what else? If I sat in Justine's chair and told her I wanted my hair to look like Farrah Fawcett she wouldn't try to talk me out of it even though it is the worst idea I've ever thought of.\n\nLike most of the places I like, Curl Up n' Dye is not for everyone. Some people like pretentious hair salons. If you are not the kind of chick who can handle some profanity  then do yourself a favor and make your hair reservations wherever all the other flight attendants get their hair trimmed. There are plenty of places made for girls who only wear white cotton panties. For the rest of us, there is Curl Up n' Dye.
