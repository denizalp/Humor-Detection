I really liked this place! The expediter (Kui) was awesome! He checked on our table and got our food out extremely fast! Everything was cooked perfectly, the chicken was crispy, juice and very plump. They are definitely using high quality meats! The decor is very nice and the restaurant is clean. Prices were great and it was an awesome selection for our office lunch meeting. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place to others and I will certainly be back...\n\nI'm looking forward to trying their fried turkey breast sandwich.
