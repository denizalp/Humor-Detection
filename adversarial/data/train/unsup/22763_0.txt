I can now \"officially\" write this review without the Yelp OG'z taking it down for false flagging. \n\nE-40 & the Click - \"Hurricane\", off of the 1995 album Game Related. \n\nI got the Hurricane here and now know the feeling, although its not the same drink, I was quite inebriated after it was all gone.\n\nAwesome atmosphere at this place, tons of cool glasses to get drinks in. Tiki atmosphere I guess you could say. The bartender was cool, very knowledgable about his concoctions. Decor throughout is quite nice. I cant wait until its Winter being in there. Its such a cozy feel, it will only add to the experience of the place.
