BUYER BEWARE!! This company is a sham!! It also operates under different names, Silverstate Carpet Cleaning - Stainmasters Carpet Cleaning, The Original Stainmasters, etc. Also has different phone numbers. Worst carpet cleaning company and even worse customer service. They are incapable of cleaning a carpet. One word of advice, DO SOMETHING!!! File a report with the Better Business Bureau and if you paid by credit card, dispute the charges with your credit card company. Call channel 13 investigates, Fox 5, The Rant, post it on facebook. Get the word out. They cannot treat customers this way and stay in business. How are they even allowed to keep a license?? Our first and only mistake was not making him leave our home immediately!! I wish I had checked YELP before having them. I did check website testimonials which were all positive of course, I wonder who writes them? Anyway, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! ZERO STARS
