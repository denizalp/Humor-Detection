We came at 10pm to get some desserts on my birthday. It's supposed to close at 11pm but we were told it's closing in 30 minutes.\n\nWe ordered each of the following:\n\nMango Parfait\nPassion Fruit Parfait\nHazelnut chocolate cake\nMango cheesecake\n\nAll of the desserts looked awesome on the display. We were impressed by it. They all look so delicious. When the server brought the desserts to our table, we were visually shell shocked by the disappointing presentation. The dessert is beautifully made but it was totally destructed by the horribly noisy plate. In my untrained eyes, it killed my appetite for dessert right away. You know... A simple white dish would have sufficed to bring out the beauty of the dessert. The sauce and whip scream were also haphazardly put on the plate.  They look so out of place with the beautifully crafted dessert.\n\nThe taste of the dessert is ok. The parfaits are a bit too sweet and the cheesecake is too dense. If I want a New York style cheese cake, I wouldn't come to a French restaurant. The hazelnut cake tastes ok but my friends said it's just like Nutella. Nothing special. Overall I think the taste is just ok.\n\nWhen you come to a French restaurant for a dessert, a good cup of coffee or tea is expected. I ordered a cup of cappuccino because there is no French press on the menu. What came to my table is not a cappuccino. I think it's worse than Tim Horton. No milk froth. It's like a water down cheap coffee with teeny tiny bit of froth. Who in the world makes a cup of cappuccino in a small expresso cup!!!!???\n\nFinally the totally bill is about $50 for 4 pieces of dessert, one lousy cappuccino and one cup of tea. It's way way way too expensive for what it is. No wonder they were closing early. The owner told the servers to close the shop early because business was slow that night.
