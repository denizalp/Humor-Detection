I always want to order off the extensive sandwich menu, and love the reuben, whether with pastrami, corned beef or better yet a combination of the two (for slightly extra) but I inevitably fall on my favorite: the Matzoh Ball Soup. It is literally (not figuratively but in the very real sence) the best Matzoh Ball Soup I have ever tasted. They use both white and dark meat chicken (dark meat being where the flavor comes from) and are sparing in their use of white onions. Most soups with onions taste like onion soup with carrots and a tiny bit of chicken stock thrown in. Chicken is both the predominate flavor and ingredient. Spooning through it is like wading though a lake of chicken and flavor. It is divine.\nI always order the bowel sized, it is good for two meals and comes with a bagel and the topping of your choice.  The spinach and feta bagel with the garlic-cheddar cream cheese is my favorite, but the jalapeno cheddar bagel\/schmere is a close second.\nAnd the pastry case! Cheesecake is the light and fluffy variety, I suspect they use mascarpone, and the fruit toppings are divine, rugelach, cookies, they even have \"spinach pie\" which I suspect is spanikopita but have yet to try because I always order the additively wonderful Matzoh Ball Soup.\nCannot recommend enough, but I have never eaten in, as the space is always oppressively hot, being a bakery and all, and I prefer to take the magic home and eat it in air conditioned luxury.
