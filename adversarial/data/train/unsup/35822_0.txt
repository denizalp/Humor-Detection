2nd time coming to Q Bistro and they never disappoint. The food was amazing, everything was super flavorful. We ordered calamari, bulgogi fries, bulgogi fried rice, the LA kalbi and the Whole fried chicken. Everything was amazing. The music was also awesome, all of our favorite groups were playing and added to the vibe and aesthetic of the restaurant! Definitely recommend to come!  The service was great and our server was really nice.
