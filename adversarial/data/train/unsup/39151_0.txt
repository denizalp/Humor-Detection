Came here for dinner when I stayed at Mandalay Bay. While the restaurant's name suggests its a great seafood restaurant, I went ahead and ordered the ribeye. It was surprisingly VERY good. Very juicy, tender and cooked perfectly to order. Would definitely recommend this dish.\n\nThe service is pretty good, though the waiters can seem a bit overly positive about each menu item (I think I heard \"best in Nevada,\" \"amazing,\" etc. multiple times). \n\nOther things that were good here were the capoianni (sp?), mashed potatoes and the biscuits\/corn bread. The calamari is standard - don't believe the waters' hype.
