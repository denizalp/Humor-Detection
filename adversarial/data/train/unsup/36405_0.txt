Valentines Day 2017. No whipped cream, No cookie dough, no napkins . The 2 ladies working behind the counter were polite and professional. The owner\/manager should have stocked his inventory. Really, no whipped cream? At an Ice cream spot!?! \n\nMy family and I started going to Coldstone Creamery back in 2000 when living in El Segundo, CA. During the weekend the line would be out the door. When you left a tip the workers would say a little cheer. Here in LV Coldstone Creamery is just another ice cream place
