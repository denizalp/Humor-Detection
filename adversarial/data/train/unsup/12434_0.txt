When I first went to see the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, I was blown away. It's quite the magical evening. I'm not a huge fan of classical music, in the sense that I may have trouble differentiating a Gerswhin from a Strauss, but I always love hearing it done live.\n\nFirst of all, you have to dress up. Well you don't HAVE to, wear whatever you want really, but how often do you get dressed up? That's what I thought. So pull out the old plaid sports coat and pop on your burgundy bow tie and you're ready to go. Wait, you don't have a bow tie? Alright, you can wear a regular tie but you're losing points.\n\nSecondly, you really need to be on time, actually scratch that, be early. I know you're not used to that and it's going to be tough, but they seriously won't let you in if you're too late. Trick yourself into thinking its 30mins earlier.\n\nLastly, don't bother buying a drink or a snack at intermission. Unless you have a ton of money you're looking to throw away, in which case message me directly and I can help with that. Their prices are way too expensive. And if you really need a coffee to stay awake, be aware that they somehow manage to fit about 4 times the amount of caffeine into their coffee. Oh sure that sounds like a good thing, but trust me, when you're strung out on caffeine while trying to sit still and enjoy the show you'll know what I mean.\n\nI had always thought it was a little out of my price range until I learned about tsoundcheck (http:\/\/www.tsoundcheck.com\/). It's been mentioned here a few times already, but it really makes going to the symphony much more reasonable for us youngins. I've never had a horrible seat using tsoundcheck either, so don't think you're losing out on anything. You no longer have a reason not to go.
