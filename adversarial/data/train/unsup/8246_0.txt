Honestly, this place is pretty amazing. We came on a Monday evening and there were still a good amount of people there. We were immediately greeted by the girls working and they were super nice. When we said it was our first time, they let us know what they had and that we could have as many samples as we wanted. \n\nI tried the salted caramel and the toasted marshmallow and wow.. they were incredible. The toasted marshmallow literally tasted exactly like a marshmallow that was just held over the fire. I don't know how they did it, but it's awesome. The salted caramel was really tasty as well. \n\nI ended up going with a small espresso bean because I am quite predictable and am in a coffee ice cream\/gelato phase of my life. It was so so soooo good. Probably honestly the best I've had. \n\nMy girlfriend got a small raspberry sorbet and she loved it. The girl who served us also added some cute garnishes. \n\nIt was worth every penny. While we were sitting down enjoying our treats one of the girls also came around to everyone offering water cups on a tray. Great service, modern and clean shop, and tasty treats. I highly recommend and will be back.
