Huge greek food fan here.  The Pita jungle is awesome!  However, it's not the best place to get your typical greek fare from.  \n\nFOOD: Their wraps and pitas (of course) are great.  For lunch, try the Schwarma Wrap and for dinner, get the Medchillada...it's huge!!!  The great thing about Pita Jungle is that it's extremely healthy for a restaurant.  Their food isn't greasy and they have whole wheat pitas and brown rice.   The hummus is always good as well.  They're not skimpy either...when you get chicken in a wrap, they stuff it with huge chunks of chicken breasts.\n\nSERVICE - They have an opportunity here, but I won't complain too much.  This location seems to be better than others.  The wait staff is average, however extremely fast.  The kitchen can really get things out quickly which is great for lunch.\n\nVALUE - Awesome value.  Just about everything is under $10 and you can get some pitas and wraps for around $6. \n\nIf you're in to greek and\/or healthy food, give it a try!
