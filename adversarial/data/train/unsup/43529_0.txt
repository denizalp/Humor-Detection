Beautiful hotel, the rooms are probably the best on the strip, you get a bedroom area and a separate sitting area, which is lovely so you don't have to sit all over your bed to watch the TV.  The only down side is there aren't any umbrellas around the pool and there is hardly any shade, so we bought a cabana every day for the 4 days we were there, at a cost of $300 per day but when the temperature is 106f outside its well worth it!  I've stayed at many hotels on the strip and this is still one of the nicest there.
