We usually patronize Island Style on Sahara for their Jajangmyeon (Korean style black bean noodle) and thought #2 would serve the same and they don't.  Since we are already there we might as well eat.  My companion ordered a bowl of Saimin and I ordered Loco Moco from the counter.  A short while after we sat down, a very polite gentleman brought us 3 good size dishes of kim chees and Korean white seaweed salad along with 2 cups of hot tea.   He even came back with another dish of kim chee when he noticed we finished the first one.  My companion told me the Saimin's broth tasted like their kitchen actually prepared a real broth and not out of a can of Swanson chicken broth.  I know there's not much to a plate of Loco Moco but I felt satisfy with what this joint served.  The macaroni salad was light and tasty.  Most Island food joints tend to serve heavier version.  We really enjoyed the kim chee they serve here.  I wish they would sell a jar of that stuff to go. Now that we experienced great service and good food here, we will have to split our visits between this place and the one at Sahara.
