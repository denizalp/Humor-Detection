It's my second review of another cool place @ Cosmopolitan_LV\ntoday (see my review of The Boulevard Pool below ;). The Chandelier lives up to it's name because it is essentially THE Chandelier. It's a lounge inside a giant chandelier.\n\nA three story lounge with a bar at the bottom all enclosed in glittery and sparkling crystals. Plenty of seating from top to bottom and I think it's really cool that folks get to sit in cushy bright seating and be surrounded by all these cool crystal decor. It is quite a sight to see. There are stairs from the first floor to the top floor as well as elevator and it's just amazing to see the long chandelier draped down. I saw all of these folks stop and take pictures with the chandelier crystals.\n\nI had dinner plans later that night so I did not get to try any food or drinks & just stopped by quickly to see what this pretty place  was and so this review is primarily off the cool decor and feel of the place. I was amazed by the amazing architecture of this place. I feel like this place is what Vegas is all about - glitz, glamour and bling bling.
