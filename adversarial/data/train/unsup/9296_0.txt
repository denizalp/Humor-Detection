This review is in regard to the leasing process, and visiting the property while apartment hunting. My husband and I have NOT lived at this property... Yet. \nNever have I had a more positive experience apartment hunting in my life. The leasing associate Matt was kind, approachable and very professional. He dressed smart, but was still wearing sneakers which gave us a sense of comfort. He was accommodating and answered all of our questions. He took us on a property tour, all while helping other tenants, and giving other tours. \nThe property is in the middle of a large renovation. They recently changed management companies, and names. However, that being said, the grounds were still decent enough. The model was gorgeous and smartly decorated. \nThe prices were very comfortable, and slightly lower than we expected. \nWe ended up visiting Matt THREE times in one day. We were originally holding out for a first floor, but felt so good about the property, that we came back and said we would mind a second floor.  Though the website was down, he gave us hard copies of everything to get in the apartment as soon as possible. \nBy the end of our experience, Matt felt like an old friend. I am so looking forward to moving to Eden, and look forward to making it our home. \nI promise to update my review after we've lived here several months, with a review on \"living\" in Eden. \n\nI would give Matt 10 stars if I could!
