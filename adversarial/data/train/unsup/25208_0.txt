We have a friend that works downtown so we were recommended this place by him.. we were not disappointed! It started off with the owner\/manager present at the host stand and made sure we had a table for 5 of us. From there, our server Tyler was extremely helpful with suggestions and anticipated our every need, without being suffocating. And the food!!! It was so good! We had the Mac and cheese bites, corn dog lollipops, steak French dip, and the fried chicken sliders... cannot recommend all of them enough. All around an incredible dinner!
