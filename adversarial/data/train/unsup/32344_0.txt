Everyone thinks I'm weird because I actually enjoy going to the dentist. It's because I've gone to Dr. J. since I was 5! (I'm 25!) He is amazing and his staff is incredible too.  They are always so friendly and welcoming! They do excellent work and dont do unnecessary things.  \n\nI'm always nervous about x-rays and they also ease my worries.  They also have new hi-tech x-rays that are so quick and painless.  \n\nThe first person you'll meet is Liz, she runs the front office.  She is such a good example of what's to come.  Very friendly and welcoming and always professional.\n\nI've always used insurance but I've sent a few people to him that don't have insurance and they've said it was affordable.  I happily refer friends to Dr. J. all the time and each and every one of them has thanked me.  \n\nIf you're looking for a dentist, this is the one!! I don't even live in AZ anymore but my family does and since I'm there twice a year, I go when I'm in town.
