The boy and I went to Vegas for his birthday.  Not to gamble, not to drink.  To go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.  We spent the whole weekend there.  It was pretty fun, I have to admit.  They have row after row of *playable* pinball machines.  \n\nSurprisingly, I really enjoyed playing the older machines where it's more about chance and less about skill.  The games where you get see the electric jolts and hear the little metal bells.  I also really liked playing \"Pinball Circus,\" a prototype machine that never got made and of which there are only two in existence.  That particular machine did cost $1.00 per game, but you get 5 balls and I scored a few replays.  The newer machines are either $0.50-$0.75 per game, and the older machines are just $0.25 per game.  \n\nWe brought my 9-year-old niece along for a few hours and she really liked playing on the \"ping pong\" machines too.\n\nMy only suggestion would be a snack bar with chairs.  I mean, when you're playing pinball for several hours straight, it would be nice to sit and relax for a few minutes with a sody pop.
