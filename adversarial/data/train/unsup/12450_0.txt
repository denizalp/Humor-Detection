Liked the place.  Walked in, looked at the clientele, and went \"oh oh.\"  I've walked backwards out of more bars than I'd like to remember.  There was this one place outside of Fayetteville, Arkansas...I almost had a Ned Beatty flashback...but I digress.  Everyone was cool here, and we had a great time.\n\nOne of my fellow NoDaks recommended the place.  It's a nice change from the casinos if you're (a) traveling to LV and (b) like live music, esp blues.\n\nThe band was great and the beer was cold and cheap - the bar's nothing flashy but it might be worth the trip for you.
