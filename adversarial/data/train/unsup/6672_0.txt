This particular Starbucks has some very friendly barista's however you're positive experience at getting a tasty cup of you're favorite caffeinated beverage and doing some light reading or surfing Yelp stops there unfortunately.  \n\nThey are very inconsistent at making their drinks.  They seem to have different people working each time I visit.  Their is nothing worse than spending TOO MUCH money for a cup of coffee already, let alone have it made wrong with either too much ice, not enough coffee or too much water...  Argue...\n\nAnother note, they need to focus more on cleaning their table\/chair area for their customers. It was so dirty I could not stay and enjoy my watered down, over iced, not tasty beverage...
