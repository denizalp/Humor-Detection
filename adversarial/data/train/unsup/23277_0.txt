This little cafe seems slightly out of place; just down the street from large chains such as Chipotle and Jersey Mike's. I just love the historic house the has been repurposed into the cafe. Complete with local art displayed on the walls, this cafe has a quant little charm. \n\nI have ordered the chai latte both times I have been here and it leaves much to be desired but the atmosphere makes up for the generic drink. Today I ordered the tomato basil soup and the plantation chicken salad. The soup was good but thinner than I had expected. The chicken salad was good, complete with walnuts and a mustard based dressing. I enjoyed my second experience and would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a relaxing meal or cup of coffee.
