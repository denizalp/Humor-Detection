our FAVORITE place until this last time.. made reservations for our 30th anniversary.. stuck in a corner looking at the back of the next tall chair.. couldn't get thru the seats to go to the bathroom.. LOUD not the nice quiet place we were accustomed to.. food was AWFUL 38.oo for a ribeye.. sinew all thru it.. chewy and gross.. didn't know because we took it home and they were closed the next day... .. has so much salad and potato I couldn't even eat it.. .. called the mgr no reparation to be made but come in and have a drink on us.. whatever.. the waitress couldn't hear our order because of the table placement.. had to pull the table OUT to get in my seat..  asked if we wanted our cheesecake we were SHARING boxed up.. we said no. its dried out and lumpy.. she didn't take it off of our bill, call the m\nanager or anything.. We WERE going to take our son when he visits.. no way.. wont be back..  find a new favorite..
