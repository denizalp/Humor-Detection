My prescription was not called into the pharmacy by the end of the day and I had to call the office to remind them. Also, I left a message for a medical assistant when I was experiencing some side effects and never received call back. This practice was very good when it was smaller and now that it has grown so quickly, it appears that there are some inter office communication problems. I am not sure that I will be returning.
