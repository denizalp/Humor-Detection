I put my friends and I on their guestlist for a Friday night. We got there before 11 pm. The bouncer checked the guestlist and couldn't find my name, so I had to show him the confirmation email. And this is when it gets ridiculous: He took my phone, flicked on the screen back and forth, took out his glasses and looked at the email for a solid few minutes, although the contend is quite simple.. Eventually he let my friends in, but gave us a bad attitude and said we weren't on the guestlist however. So that's quite a mood-killer. \n\nAlso the crown is YOUNG. Like high-school, first year college young. And definitely some weird people too, I'm talking about the mid- age males who just stood there and film girls dancing.. There was quite a few who did that. \n\nAnd if you hate TOP 40 bullsheetz like me. Please steer clear of this place. At one point they played Gucci Gang- to give you an idea the music selection here.. (SMH)\n\nFun Fact: $4 gets you watered down liquor. \n\nYOU'RE WELCOME.
