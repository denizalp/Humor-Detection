I will start by stating what I hope is obvious : I'm a man.  Now deeper into my stereotypical psyche....I'm visual and am just like what women think every man is like.  That's why the first thing I noticed was how incredibly cute the woman taking orders was.  Take that pansy sensitive men!\n\nI went for the 'Whole truck' $9 for double-pattied beef burger sweetness.  I got it with cheese and bacon ($1 each) and the lettuce, tomato, pickle etc that any great burger needs.  I was scared when it was ready.  This thing was huge! I wasn't able to finish it.  I bet Michael Moore could eat 14 as an appetizer, but such an appetite isn't in my power.  The burger was awesome.  It was so awesome that when the Earth inevitably is attacked by those damned Klingons, it would be a great peace offering to make them go away.  \n\nSo full.  Cannot walk.  Please....somebody....come get me.....
