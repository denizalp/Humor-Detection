Pretty big disappointment. Came on a Thursday evening around 8 PM and there was no wait (that probably should've been our sign that it's not that great).\n\nTo start we had salads and meats and cheeses. Hard to mess those up so no complaints there -- enjoyed the Cajun cheese. It all goes downhill from there. I've been to Bacchanal and Aria Buffets and this variety is definitely lacking next to those two. Also none of the entrees were very flavorful, so many didn't even have salt. The only two that I mildly enjoyed were the Italian Sausage and the Rosemary & Garlic Lamb. Yup that's it. Don't get me started on desserts. Chocolate desserts were lacking and when it came to gelato they had sugar free chocolate gelato but not regular chocolate gelato! Seriously?! My guess is if you're coming to a buffet you're not exactly concerned with your sugar intake. The Chocolate Covered Strawberries were awful because they covered them with candied nuts which made it overly sweet, pretty sure one bite and you'll end up with diabetes.\n\nDefinitely never coming back!
