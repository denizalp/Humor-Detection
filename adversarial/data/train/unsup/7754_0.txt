TLDR: Bland food. Slow service.\n\nI came with a friend to sit down and eat about a few weeks ago. The tables were dirty and sticky. The decor and theme is interesting, I mean I sat down at a table with He-man on it, which impressed me. But the music was so loud that everyone was screaming at each other and still can't hear each other talk. \n\nThe food is bland. Had the silken chicken roll and the street special rice platter. The chicken said it's marinated in almond and cashew, but it tasted nothing of those nuts. The chicken was juicy and moist, but bland. To sum up the rice platter: dry and bland. The only tasty items were the chutney and the cucumber raita. Also it had the slowest service ever. It took an hour to get anything out and there were only 2 other couples in the sit in area. And one of them were just getting a pitcher to share. \n\nThe waitress said the owner love feed back, so we tried to get his attention, but he ends up talking to someone poor couple who weren't interested in his concept of this restaurant. We waited for 11 mins, and in the end we left without letting him know our suggestions, but the waitress said she'll let him know what we told her. People go for the food, the concept comes after. Stop exerting so much on the talks and keep better quality control on the food.
