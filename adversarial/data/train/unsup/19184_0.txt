The boyfriend and I went to meet a large group of friends here to celebrate one of the birthdays in the group. I wondered what made them choose The Gold Spike, I had been there in the past and it was a decent enough bar, casino lobby but nothing to brag about. Ha! They are bragging now! This place rocks! Finally a place in town that's not a loud techno dropping, smokey, crowded, expensive hot mess! LOVED it! \n\nMy BF said got your ID ready and I'm thinking why they heck to they need that at the door. I imagine my eyes where wide open in shock as we stepped through the door. It's wide open with the bar and the little deli still in tacked but they have removed the slot machines and added random lounge spots with couches, bean bags, large comfy chairs and tall tables as well. They've added pool tables and over sized games, giant corn hole, yard jenga, giant beer pong, giant connect four and much more! Outside is an even awesomer, yea I went there, lounge area with more seats and a band and another bar. I'm sure I missed some of the other features but it was love at first sight. I love that it was big and there were a lot of people but you wouldn't know, unless you were waiting on drinks at the bar, because you were not bumping into people. Speaking of the bar, which was busy and pretty slow to get served, I'm not sure pricing, I didn't pay but you could get a pitcher of PBR for $12, not terrible. There is no smoking inside so you don't go home smelling like an ash tray and have to wash your hair again after you already washed it to go out.  Did I tell you I love this place! We'll definitely be back soon.
