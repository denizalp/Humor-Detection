La Main is across the street from Montr√©al's more famous smoked meat delicatessen, and for that reason I overlooked it for a long time. Little did I know that I was missing out, not getting the amazing assortment of Hebraic delights when I waited in line for a sandwich. Oh, the pickles! The matzoh ball soup!\n\nWe need to have a separate discussion about the latkes. Now, I've never had a bad latke. I can't imagine there are many bad latkes in this world. But I've never had a latke like this. These latkes don't mess around. They're huge and perfectly crispy. They come with sour cream but you should get applesauce on the side because there is a lot of latke to love.\n\nNext time you have guests from out of town and they want smoked meat, bring them to La Main and skip the line-up, get some latkes instead.
