Honestly, I would highly recommend getting their magonada from here, it's truly delicious. As for the food, the hot Cheetos fries are great but not the best. Same goes for their popcorn chicken, they leave a weird after taste. And their service is all over the place. Orders are forgotten sometimes. But I recommend going to try the drinks.
