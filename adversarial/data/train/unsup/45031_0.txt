Mutiny Shop. \n\nI had done approximately 0% research on this company before ordering. Man I wish I had. \n\nWebsite says up to 15 business days for manufacturing.  My order was placed 2apr. On 28apr, I tried contacting them via phone, email, Facebook,  and text, all multiple times. No response. 29apr, I filed a paypal dispute. After that (30apr) I received a response via Facebook saying my order was partially completed, but would be completed that day and shipped the next. \n4 may comes with no tracking info or shipping confirmation.  \n5 may, escalated to paypal claim. Then I received contact via Facebook on 7 may saying my order had shipped and provided a tracking number and was informed I was upgraded to 2 day shipping. \n9 may comes and goes with no update on tracking and I go back to their Facebook and call them out. I was given a story about how it hadn't made it out on friday, but they thought it shipped already. I ask what happened to it shipping the previous week like they said it would and BOOM radio silence.  6 hours later, tracking info updates with an initial scan at the post office. Conveniently,  it's the same scan that happens when you drop it off at the post office. \n\nPatches are due to me tomorrow by tracking info. \n\nAnd to top it all off, I've been blocked from posting on their page. \n\n0\/0 for customer service. Won't do business with them again.
