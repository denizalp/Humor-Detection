Though I have not eaten at a Sonic in awhile, their beverages drive me crazy!  I recent found out that you can get a delicious drink from half off during their happy hours from 2-5pm.\n\nThis particular Sonic is located off Lake Mead Pkwy just a hop, skip and a jump from the entrance to Lake Mead National Recreation Area.\n\nWhen in need of a high calorie, high sugar liquid cup of goodness ( I love the Ocean Water) after a hard day of playing or exploring the lake area, give this location a go. \n\nThey have a drive-thru so you can get it to go and bounce.
