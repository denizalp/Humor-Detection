I took my truck here after it was rear ended. Bud and Larry are great guys. Very professional, courteous, and generous. All of the staff was pleasant. They not only did a fantastic job repairing my truck (about $6k in damages) but also went over and beyond by fixing items that weren't even part of the accident - fixed my dome lights and replaced the grip pads on my running boards. They washed my truck and completed the job right on time. I will, without a doubt, always take my vehicles to Bud and Larry at Select. Thanks gentlemen!
