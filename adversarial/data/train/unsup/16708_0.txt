The food here is good. Ignore the haters. Most of their complaints are about service at midnight. What do you expect at late night eat in Vegas?? Seriously, beggars cannot be choosers. \n\nFirst off, I came here with my family at normal dining hours. The food is legit. It's high quality Szechwan style cuisine with hand cut noodles. For my Asian food lovers, you will not be disappointed. They use real Szechwan spices. If you traveled to Beijing and Shanghai, you could appreciate these flavors. \n\nYes, it is a little pricey... but what do you expect when you come to Caesar and order Chinese food. Imagine what their rent is!! \n\nGet the dan dan noodles, Zha Jang noodles, eggplant w\/ green beans, shrimp dumplings, and salt and pepper shrimp. \n\nEnjoy!
