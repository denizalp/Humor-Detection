Beso is beautiful just like Eve the Nightclub but I felt like the menu prices are highly inflated for what you get.  Shared the crab cake appetizer, ordered the Beso burger for my entree and had the Smores dessert.  The Smores dessert was a little too sweet for my liking and I like sweet.  We didn't have reservations so we had to sit at one of the tiny entry tables by the bar where you enter so maybe I would have had a better experience paying inflated prices at an actual table.  Our server was extremely friendly and a manager did check in on us but I  would say there are better options on Strip for what you will spend here on a meal.
