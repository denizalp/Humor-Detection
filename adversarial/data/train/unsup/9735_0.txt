I have to go into a little rant before I actually write a review for this.  Speedway has so many similarities to another gas station chain in Pennsylvania that I really feel like I need to address that first.  Sheetz, some could say is one of, if not the, most dominant chains in the state.  The similarities that are visible are kind of too much to be a coincidence.  From the ordering system to the font that is used in their media, to the items offered in their 'Speedy Caf√©.'  It makes one wonder whether or not this is either an offshoot of Sheetz or Sheetz has a controlling interest in the company.\n\nNow that that is out of the way, on with the review for this location.  As most of you can tell, I frequent this location often.  One of the major selling points for here is that they offer E85 gasoline.  Having a FlexFuel car, not only is it cheaper, but it is harder to find.  More stations are starting to offer, but it's not anywhere near where it needs to be.\n\nLike most gas stations now this company offers a reward card.  Dependent upon whether the location is a newer one or not allots the amount off per gallon.  If it is a new store, for the first month or so it is $.10 off a gallon, after that it drops significantly.  The reward card works inside the store as well where you collect points for purchases.  I have no clue as to what those points earn you just yet as I don't have many.\n\nThe inside of the store is set up to make it an easy flow into the store.  Aisles are set up in a diagonal pattern from the door leading back to the coolers and Soda Den.  The food you can order here is very similar to other gas station convenience stores.  Items differ little, but nonetheless you have the staples, subs, pizza, hot dogs and burgers.\n\nCustomer service here still needs some work as it is new.  I'm sure once they get the swing of things here this place will run rather smoothly afterwards.
