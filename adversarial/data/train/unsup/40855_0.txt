This place has unanimously won the best hookah place in Vegas in my book.\nI've visited almost ALL local hookah lounges\/restaurants in the valley and I've come to the easy conclusion that Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe is the best there is.\n\nHere is why:\n\n1) HOOKAH: Everything they do leading up to making a good hookah bowl is pretty standard and similar to most places, however, the ice-filled bases are a HUGE plus in terms of smoothness. The employee knowledge on the different types of hookah smoking is impressive and informative. They are excellent with their ability to match\/mix flavors to your liking. They are understanding when you're not satisfied and will not hesitate to please your hookah taste buds (at least in many of my experiences). SEVERAL of the bowls I've had there last long (beyond two hours). Of course that can change with the frequency of your smoking. The hookahs and hoses are all a high quality and clean (fancy too).\n\n2) FOOD\/DRINKS: The food is excellent. All organic and fresh. You can't find another hookah lounge with food at these prices that taste like this. The drinks are eclectic (non-alcoholic). None of them disappoint. Anything from hot tea to iced juices are awesome.\n\n3) EMPLOYEES: The employees are respectful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I treat the employees with respect and they return with respect as well. They handle any issue you have with food or hookah willingly, respectfully, and swiftly. It can get busy at times and service can take longer at times, but that's how it gets sometimes. They know the menu and are excellent with recommendations. They have uniforms that allow customers to distinct who is an employee and who isn't (some places don't do that).\n\n4) AMBIANCE: Good clean space. It's a lounge so when I see people complain about \"table space\" I would suggest going to a restaurant. I make due with the space at hand. The music ranges from electric, dub-step, hip hop, and reggae. They mix it up often. I LOVE when they play reggae there. The music isn't played at an ear-piercing volume consistently (like other hookah places). \n\n5) PRICE: Reasonable & fair. The regular price for hookah is the similar to all the hookah places in the Valley but there is a happy hour for hookah from 5-8PM. I go there during that time often. The food is worth the money and so are the drinks.\n\nI have my own hookahs at home (several of them) but when I want to wind down from a hard day work, I choose no other place than Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe. It's an awesome hookah place with culture, good food, good drinks, and friendly employees. I follow then on twitter and facebook for any specials they may have.\n\nThank you Azuza.
