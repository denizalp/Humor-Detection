Friendly staff, movie selection is mediocre. No doors on viewing booths, and the video arcade is okay. The movie selections in the theater are boring and some of the men are hot. Others are frequent visitors, one of whom is a well-known former Phoenix dentist named Ron, who I have had the (dis)pleasure of knowing outside of the boutique. Others are just horny old men who are desperate. The poor fellas.
