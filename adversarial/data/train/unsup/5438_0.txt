Went with some girlfriends to try Happy Hour, our server was Nico, and ladies he was good eye candy!   My friend treated us to some drinks and appetizers, I never really know what to order when it comes to well drinks, so I just got a vodka and cranberry, that my dears was a strong drink, told my friend that, she told Nico, and he laughed and said oh most complain it's too weak not too strong  it was funny, he fixed my drink and then it was perfect!\n\nThe appetizers ordered where Flaming Saganaki, Hummus Trio, Greek Sliders & some Greek Nachos\n\nThe hummus trio had traditional hummus; garlic hummus & smoked chipotle hummus, all of them where good & the pitas served with it were so dang fresh! I love hummus, I really liked the garlic hummus, it was a perfect blend of garlic, not to overwhelming, the smoked chipotle tasted like bacon to me and that threw me off, but I think it was me not the hummus, little bit of allergies making my taste buds wacky.\n\nThe Greek Sliders where on a roll that had onion rings on the bottom, gyro meat and a melted cheese, ok these were delish! And disappeared pretty fast!\n\nThe Greek Nachos was tortilla chips covered in a melted cheese, but not like a nacho cheese, it was lighter, and had like a chopped Greek salad on top of the chips with fresh sliced jalapenos, This was heaven, who would have thought, the fresh greens with the chips, omg delish!!! \n\nThe Flaming Saganaki was the most impressive on presentation wise, it was a slice of cheese set on fire, pretty darn cool for a Wednesday night I say! It also was served with some fresh pita breads as well.  The cheese seemed to have a little coat of flour on it and it was a salty cheese but went well with the bread, never had the cheese before and though it to be maybe goat cheese but found out the name of the cheese is kefalograviera cheese (damn I'm in trouble if I ever go to a cheese shop to get me some, my theory if I can't pronounce it, I shouldn't be eating it haha) and it's a sheep cheese, well I can honestly say it was my 1st sheep cheese! \n\nService was great, company was awesome, and I could see me coming back!
