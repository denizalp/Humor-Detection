1. I'm a Pho & Bun Fiend.\n2. I have practically had a bowl of Pho in every city I've been to across North America & parts of the UK.\n3. I love Pho, BUT I only categorize Pho in 3 categories.  Awesome, Okay, Bleh.\n4. I only have the fully loaded special.\n\nSo to qualify for the Awesome Category, the special really has to be FULLY loaded.  Tendons, tripe, the works!  Next is the broth.  You've got to taste the meaty marrowy goodness in the Broth.  3rd is the Noodles.  I'm not so picky, it just has to be the thick kind and not the thin round ones.  Lastly, the service has to be okay.  You don't have to treat me like a prince, but you do have to come serve me in a reasonable amount of time, and be reasonably clean.  Reasonably.  This is Pho after all.  I expect a certain level of dive in my Pho.  \n\nService levels at the Gerrard location is night and day vs the Spadina Locale.  The Gerrard one feels like a family run business, and the service has always been spectacular.  Meanwhile the ultra busy Spadina one generally treats me like a McDonalds drive by.  \n\nWhat makes Xe Lua work is the fresh noodles that you can't get everywhere.  I think the broth is good enough (not the best), and most importantly, I get the good yummy bits, as in the tendon and the tripe.\n\nThey've also got the best Spring Rolls this side of Toronto, and I usually wash it all down with a Red Bean Shake.\n\nNot the perfect date place as there's a nice dive factor, but I'd only want to marry a girl who can appreciate a classic Pho Restaurant.
