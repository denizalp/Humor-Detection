We liked Noodle Asia because of the food, price, and atmosphere.  We found the restaurant after walking around for a long time just to find a restaurant for dinner.  This is a pain when you are hungry.  We went there on a weekday night and it was completely full. Meals at many restaurants were over-priced in LV, so Noodle Asia is my new favorite.  I liked my fried noodle with pork and vegetables.  Their service was fast and we were happy.
