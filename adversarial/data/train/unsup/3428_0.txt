Bikinis bikinis oh wait where my drinky!?\n\nDon't expect to see any bikinis at the Bikini Lounge anytime soon.  This place is a total dive close to the heart of downtown.  \n\nOverall, drinks are dirt cheap from what I'm used to and the AA (Affordable Alcohol)  club loves it here! 3 drinks for $10 total...wow I feel like we're back in the 90's again with these prices!  The place itself is full of tackiness, but not the cheap look.  \"Bikini\" clad girls and some naked on the walls.  Only cash accepted and a juke box.  Now that's your dive! - Enjoy
