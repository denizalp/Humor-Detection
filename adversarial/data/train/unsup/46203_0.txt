TLDR: busy parking lot; plentiful sample stands; excellent food counter; good customer service\n\nSam's Club provides a unique membership experience, unless you purchased that plus package that allows you exclusive shopping times and coupons galore. If you were a business owner, I would recommend purchasing he upgrade; otherwise, stick to the standard membership level. \n\nThe parking lot is always busy. I recommend parking away from the cart corrals. If you go inside, there'll be enough samples for the family. And if you want a bite to eat, there may be a wait, but it'll be worth it. Who doesn't want a piece of pizza that's actually comprised of 2 slices. The employees are very friendly and provide excellent customer service and know what they're doing when they touch food, unlike some places. But most of the employees, excluding the receipt highlighter lady, are very friendly. I'm not sure what it is, but these people never smile. Maybe they have a heart condition so I'll forgive them :)
