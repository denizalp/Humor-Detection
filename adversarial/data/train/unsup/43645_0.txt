I feel it's a little generous to give even two stars (it's cute and clean inside, I'll give it that). I booked a bachelorette party for my bride-to-be sister and 7 other girls on a Saturday morning. When arranging everything, I was given the impression from phone discussions, emails, and their web site that as we had a large party, we would be the only ones in the salon (it says on their web site a minimum of 6 required to close salon to other guests, we were 8). It's why I assumed we paid a premium for our manicures and pedicures. We were asked to pay the \"party\" prices of $65 plus tax and mandatory 20% tip per person for a simple mani\/pedi package. It's the same package as their $49 combo pack. But I thought, ok it'll just be us and we can bring food and hang out for a bit and it'll be fun! Nope. Not so much. When we arrived with food we were looked at like crazy people and one of the techs said, \"I guess I could clean off this counter back here.\" They did not close the salon down, which would have been fine, except we PAID a PREMIUM for this specific service (or so I thought). Please, ladies, reconsider scheduling a party here. Or just get everyone in your group to make an advanced reservation for the $49 mani\/pedi service and save yourself some $$$.
