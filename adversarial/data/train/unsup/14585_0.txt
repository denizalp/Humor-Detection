This was my first time trying sushi. The reviews seemed pretty good and my friend wanted to go back because she has enjoyed it in the past.\n\nOnly one other table of diners, we were seated quickly. We had some questions about the menu and the all you can eat option.\n\nFriend ordered some sashimi while we decided.\n\nDecided to go for the all you can eat $26.95.\n\nWe were told she couldn't because the sashimi she ordered wasn't part of the deal.\n\nExpressed my frustration because we TOLD him we were thinking of that option.\n\nThe manager gave her approval though we had to pay $9 for the appetizer.\n\nThings were going well. The food was quite slow coming out of the kitchen and we were not getting plates at the same time.  It was throwing off the tempo of the meal. \n\nWe were talking and then the waiter decides to tell us that we will be charged for any food left on the plate.\n\n We did NOT over order. It was that he brought 2 plates out at the same time.\n\nThen after we expressed our irritation with him. The manager came over again and said, \"I see you are really trying.\"\n\nGee thanks, so you won't charge me MORE money.\n\nLeft there spending $80.00. \n\nDon't think I'll be back anytime soon.
