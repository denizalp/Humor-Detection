Excited to try out this popular LA chain that's finally migrated to my home in Las Vegas, the impressive interior attempts to portray a higher quality establishment but fails with mediocre quality of meat. \n\nCame here with a friend on a decently busy Wednesday night and was impressed with the decor of the restaurant. Typically kbbq places are pretty plain with poor ventilation and leaves one suffocating in smoke, and clothes soaked in kbbq sweat; however, gen knows this and did a great job at it. \n\nService: Friendly greeting by the hostess, attentive staff, and overall a pretty pleasant experience with the employees. Meat came out quicker than expected.\n\nApps: I wanted to save my room for the meat and only got the K.F.C. which are boneless yangyum style chicken thats marinated in a more tangy\/sweet than spicy sauce. Like a much crispier orange chicken that was very good\n\nMeat: We got the sirloin, brisket, tongue, pork belly, pork belly garilc, and galbi. All of which was pretty disappointing. The brisket lacked a good amount of fat that resulted in dry meat within 20 seconds of grilling, the galbi's marinade was a bit weak and didn't have the sweet goodness i'm used to enjoying. The pork belly garlic was very salty....\n\nBill: They do the tablet checkout method when it came to paying with a card (no discover accepted) but what i didn't like was the manager holding the tablet and watching me leave a tip which made me uncomfortable. I felt an unnecessary pressure for something I should be comfortable about doing.\n\nOverall: Las Vegas lacks good kbbq and this one is no exception. I'd come back if i'm deeply craving it but otherwise wouldn't recommend it
