Springs broke, guy comes out, tells my wife we need new springs, ball bearing rings and rebuild will cost $550.  Two other companies quote $180.  The guy at A A gets angry and says that they aren't using warranted parts and he'll file complaints against them.  The other companies do use warranted parts and I'm not sure how he'd file a complaint without knowing who the other companies are anyway.  These guys oversell what is needed and charge double for the same service.  We paid the $65 svc fee and asked them to leave. Avoid this company.
