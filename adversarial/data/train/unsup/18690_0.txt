Alright, if you look at my review history, I am a highly selective review writer. It's either good news or bad news for the business. Anything in the middle is left where it should be - unmentioned. In the case of A-One Autoworks......it is AWESOME. \n\nI've been there twice now. But before i go on, I have to say. DON'T let the location or appearance of the place throw you off. This is a place where I've taken a Porsche and Audi to get worked done and the quality of the workmanship is impeccable (If only the swankier body shops had service as good as they looked from the outside) Price wise, I would say that you get way more than you pay for. \n\nBill (the owner) is an unassuming bespectacled guy who you will often find with a beer in hand. He is the nicest, most honest and sincere auto body workshop owner I have ever met. Which is why I go straight to him even though it is out of the way for me and I have to cab back from the middle of nowhere(Figure of speech) He will tell you honestly what really needs to get done and how he can help you out based on your budget. I highly recommend! \n\nP.s Bring him a 6 pack of beer when you bring the car in to get work done and you'll have a friend for life! (I can't substantiate that claim but you'll know what i'm talking about when you get to it)\n\n1 star - GREAT SERVICE\n1 star - GREAT Workmanship\n1 star - AWESOME Value\n1 star - HONEST ADVICE (even if it means less money for him)\n1 star - FEEL GOOD FEELING (after paying knowing that you didn't get taken for a \n              ride and because you know you most probably saved at least a few \n             hundred bucks from anywhere else\n\nTHEREFORE 5 STARS*****!!
