There were 5 of us at Wine Styles at Park West for our  \"girls getaway birthday\/wine tasting\"  last weekend.  Since none of us had ever been there, we didn't know what to expect.   Not only is this little wine bar cozy and welcoming, but the service was great and they carry the coolest gifts for the wine or beer aficionado.   You can schedule a wine tasting ahead of time.  I think it's $8 per person and you get to taste 5 different wines. They also have beer tasting available as well, though I'm not sure on the price for that.  They do run $5 wine tasting events throughout the month.\n\nWe've been to tastings at vineyards, wineries, and other wine bars, and this one had a great selection. Not a dud in the bunch. We all ended up buying several of the wines we had sampled.  They also have a cheese plate you can order.  It's very small, but the cheeses they served were delicious and they sell them as well.  Overall it was a great gift!
