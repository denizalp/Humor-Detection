Finally made it in to Desyree's new spot.  I had tried before, but I am usually on this side of town in the mornings and she isn't open until the afternoon so it hadn't worked out.  It is pretty much Art of Flavors 2.0.  Which is a good thing.  Still sweet Desyree smiling and offering sample after sample of her delicious flavors.  Each one more amazing than the last.  I had thai tea and black sesame.  The kiddos got cookies and cream and coconut and pandan kit kat.  Everything was perfect as always.  I'm so happy Desyree is back doing her thing.
