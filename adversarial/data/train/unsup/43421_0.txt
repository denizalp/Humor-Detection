The baked goods here are some of the best gluten free treats I've had!  I wish there was a location in Los Angeles!  They lost a star because I have a nut allergy, and neither of the guys behind the counter knew what was in what I was trying to order.  They went and checked only after I made a clear point that I couldn't order or eat until I knew that the food was safe.  I ended up getting a breaded chicken sandwich that was fantastic and their fries were great too! Excellent food! I plan to go back anytime I'm in town.
