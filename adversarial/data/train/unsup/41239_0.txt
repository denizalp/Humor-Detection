Absolutely will never go here again, not only is it crowded to the point that people are shoulder to shoulder, but all the staff at the desk are rude and their manger was a complete dick head. I came in when they first opened and was interested for my parents and I. Guy came out gave me a tour and then want to star the paper work. I told him that I gotta talk to my parents first and he made a comment saying;\"your how old and you need to ask mommy and daddy!\" Well let's see my parents WOULD HAVE PAYED, and get the memberships but they where at a dr.appt and asked me to go and see if it's worth it. My parents went a head and got theirs because it was cheap and close to the house. As for me I'll prefer to go to 24 hour where weights can be dropped and I don't need to worry about some roided guy staring at me.
