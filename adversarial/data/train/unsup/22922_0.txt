Have not been to Outback in years. Let me say I was pleasantly surprised.  The Ribeye Steak was perfection and the warm molasses bread yummo. The best part was the service now I know they aren't your top of the line steak house, but they act like it with decent prices. You must get their chicken wings they are crispy to perfection and just a tad spicy. I will try it back in CA hopefully it's not just the Nevada hospitality.
