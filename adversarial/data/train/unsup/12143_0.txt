We picked this little dumpling shop for a quick dinner on a cold evening and are we ever glad we did!  We were pretty early and the service was ultra fast.  The dumplings were delicious, and we tucked into them so quickly we both burned our mouths . . . and then went back for more.  These are not mass produced dumplings, but handmade with love.
