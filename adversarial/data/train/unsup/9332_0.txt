While there are many locations in Vegas and around the country, the newest one is in Centennial Hills at the newly opened Smith's Marketplace.\n\nWhile the brick and mortar location inside isn't quite ready, the truck is parked outside from 11am-8pm daily. The entire menu revolves around lobster, the two most popular items are their lobster rolls. Priced at $17 a pop, you get to choose either the Maine Lobster Roll(CHILLED maine lobster and mayo on toasted New England style roll) or Connecticut Lobster Roll(WARM maine lobster and drawn butter on a New England style roll. \n\nIf rolls aren't your thing, there's soups, tater tots,  tacos, and quesadillas too. Great spot to grab a bite after you get your shopping done. Try Cousin's Maine Lobster out if you haven't already. ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/     5
