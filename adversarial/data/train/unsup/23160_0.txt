I love Chipotle. I can eat it everyday if I could. I've been going to this location pretty much since I moved into my house and their service and quality of food have gotten worse. \n\nLast time I was here I wanted guacamole in my bowl. They were out of it. I simply asked if they meant for now or they're going to make more for the entire evening. The girl looked at me like I was crazy and didn't understand what I meant because I had to repeat myself three times. I came back today to get a bowl for myself and a steak burrito for boyfriend. After they did the burrito, as they came to my bowl, they were out of both steak and white rice. I told them I don't even want it then. \n\nNote to chipotle, order\/ make enough food to last you the entire day. Half the line behind me walked out. Distance doesn't matter at this point because I won't be back to waste my time if they don't even have half the items I want in my bowl.
