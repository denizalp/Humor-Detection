Authentic, tasty and hearty Italian cookin that even my wonderful, Italian grandma wouldn't mind diving into - and that's saying a lot. Yes, my grandmother is one of the best cooks in the world (major bias, I'm sure) but Portofino's throws down some damn tasty eats.\n\nI stopped by Portofino's to catch up with a friend over a casual lunch. While their menu looked pretty enticing I went with their lunch special \"bake\": two jumbo stuffed shells, one manicotti, baked and covered in meat sauce. While I can't get grandma's cookin' in Charlotte, this was a very solid substitute! The shells and manicotti were perfectly cooked (not overly so) and stuffed with delicious ricotta. And the sauce - purty tasty too - although I would have been delighted with another manicotti and less sauce. But that's just personal preference!\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive and I never went without at least a half-full beverage. Plus, the prices are pretty affordable - my bake was $7.95. Not bad! I absolutely want to come back and try their 'za and maybe a whole tray of desserts. Nom!
