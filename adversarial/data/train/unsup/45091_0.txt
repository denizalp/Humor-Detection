Went to Barrio after the Cavs- Knicks game around midnight and I'm so glad i did! What a hip and colorful spot this is for Cleveland night owls! You walk in and you immediately peep the Dia de Los Muertos decor with the large paintings of skulls and Mariachi band skeletons. I knew it was going to be packed due to the game but we were quickly seated in a spacious but quaint corner table. You are immediately given bottomless chips and salsa.  Diners are asked to order via pencil and paper. The menu is very customizable.  Try the frozen mango Margarita! It was perfect. All drinks are served in cute mason jars. I had the El Puerco tacos. $4 each. Really good and semi sweet and filling. All in all, The Barrio is a really cool concept and the food is really worth a try. I want to try their brunch next time.
