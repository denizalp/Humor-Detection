BELIEVE THE HYPE!\n\nThe fabled line is totally worth it. My guy and I will spend 12 bucks splitting a whole chicken (spicy, duh) for dinner and I'm seriously knawing the marrow out of the bones and eating the spinal cord at the end of the meal, it's soooo good.\n\n\nWARNING: If I eat the potatoes and the bird at once I go into a serious chicken coma so I advise only a side of salad if you actually want to do something with your day.
