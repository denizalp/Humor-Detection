Dan and his crew from Junk King came to my house to retrieve a sofa and loveseat that an evil cat had decided to use as his litter box.  His rates were competitive ($138 but with a $30 discount for booking online for a total of $108).  Other bids I received from other companies ranged from $125 to $169.  Dan and his crew were on time, polite and professional and carefully removed my furniture.  I would highly recommend them.
