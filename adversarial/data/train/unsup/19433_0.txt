So here are the highlights:\n- this place is open 24\/7\n- they have an expansive and interesting cocktail menu inspired by your most favorite sweet candies\n- the terrace seating has a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip for people watching\n\nWe had a late dinner here after watching a show and the huzbeau and I shared a french dip sammy which our server kindly split into separate plates.  It came with fries that were nice and crispy and the sammy was not bad.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=dTGLNYS7_gZszDoRvzSW-Q\n\nAlso shared the french onion soup - more notable than the sandwich, I remember the crouton and broth tasting pretty good.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=QRBqJAV-0AN9Ke9SWAcQBw\n\nThe couple that was with us shared their banana split waffle which they enjoyed.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?select=P5br39xhOBQfhQCoNLYF3g  \n\nI had a bubble gum cocktail which was pretty to look at but not as strong as it was pricey. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw?userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg\n\nNice, dark decor and fitting to be part of the beautiful Paris hotel.  But you know what?  I dont' know what it is but I'm not exactly pining to come back.  Just A-ok for me.
