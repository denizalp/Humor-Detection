I would give this place zero stars if I could, for the headache that this place has caused me and my husband. \n\nSR Windows and Glass has given me the absolute worst customer service experience that I have ever received.\n\nI have had a technician come to my home once, to measure the window. I was told that I would have a quote within 24 hours. I hear nothing from the technician or the company. I call them after a few days and am told that the technician is \"off right now,\" and that I would have to wait even longer just for a quote. \"Instant.\" What a lie.\n\nThen, I waited two weeks for the repair to actually occur.\n\nThis company then took my money as a \"deposit\" and promised a repair person today. \n\nI arrive home and my window is still broken (this place took our money AND failed to do the job that we paid them for), and the company has informed my husband that we should take our business elsewhere. All after we had waited two weeks for them to follow up with us. \n\nCommunications with staff (when they actually picked up the phone) at this company were unprofessional and rude. I was told by a staff member that \"I do not know what I'm talking about\" when describing the tedious process of trying to reach these people. \n\n\nI am disgusted at the lack of respect and customer service offered by this business. \n\nSave yourself a headache and some money, and go elsewhere.
