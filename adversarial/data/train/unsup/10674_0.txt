This is the best game store in Toronto when it comes to current generation releases for cheap, below MSRP prices. Their service is friendly, they'll special order, and they occasional have extremely rare items.\n\nThey do lack a little in the import department, or early 90s\/80s\/early systems compared to A&C Games. But when they do receive one of these items, their prices are cheaper than anywhere else; including online.\n\nWith only a few worthy game shops in the entire city, this is definitely a downtown gem.
