I'm a fan of the dive bar that serves potent drinks for cheap. There weren't many people in here, but that's kind of charming. The people I met were all conversational and worth spending a few hours of bar time with. Definitely not for those looking for a hopping hot spot, but for those looking for a place to have a relaxing drink with strangers that aren't creepy or rude. There is a jukebox. The only downside is that the jukebox only plays if you put money in it - meaning with only a few people in the bar, it can get quiet in there, which is a little strange!
