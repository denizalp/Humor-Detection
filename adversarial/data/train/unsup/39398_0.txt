The service was excellent, and the sausage gravy w\/ 2 eggs and hash browns were delicious. It was a little warm in the restaurant today, but at the same time I can't blame them for having the heat on during an abnormally hot February day. The restaurant was clean and the coffee was good!! I will be back!
