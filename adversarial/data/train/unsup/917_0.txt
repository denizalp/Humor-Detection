Our wait to be seated was the ONLY good thing about our visit on May 5.  The utter chaos of all staff was immediately apparent.  The waitress took over 10 minutes to greet us at our table and to get our drink orders.  Everything was SSSSSSLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW.   Our order was incorrect.   The food was cold.   The rice was over cooked and lacking flavor.   We had to add salt to our salsa.   Will NEVER go back.
