Came here for my Birthday dinner. They do have the greatest Birthday deal in town for sure. \nIf you sign up on their website, they will send you a certificate for $25.00 off one of the best dinners you will ever have.\nSo we got the full works, starters, dinners, a bottle of wine and dessert.\nFrench onion soup to start. Fantastic, we have been here a few times before and knew this was a winner.\nNext I had the steak and Crab legs, and T the Filet mingon and lobster. Also wonderful. The bread was even good at this place.\nAfter a wonderful dinner,we thought we would have dessert. Major dissapointment!\nI got the chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. It was a cheap Ice Cream, almost like an Ice milk, and the Brownie had no flavor. T got the Key lime pie. \nShe said it tasted like she made it herself from a keebler pie crust.\n\nShe gave me a taste and it was awfully sweet,Both came with canned whipped cream.\nIt was a wonderful dinner just spoiled by the dessert.\nNext time eat everything just not the dessert portion of it. Just skip it.\nOur experiance was good other wise. Our server was a little pre occupied with the table next to us. She knew them( one of them worked there or used to). So she was busy talking to them. luckily we were not in a hurry. \nStill a good place, been here a few times and will come back for sure.
