So I've been dragged here several times by new coworkers since my last review and as a result, I have an updated review. The service is definitely hit and miss, more often miss. But the food is actually pretty good, especially the lunch specials! It's a lot of food for a good price and a good alternative on those days when you don't feel like squeezing into the shoebox that is Japango. They get pretty busy at lunch so the earlier you go, and the smaller your party, the faster and better your experience is likely to be!
