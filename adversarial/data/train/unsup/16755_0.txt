There is no front hostesses. There is a random desk in the middle of the restaurant. Made walking in the door a little weird.\n\nThe service was great, and our waitress was fantastic. We sat on the patio and loved it, very cute set up. \n\nThe food was ok, nothing amazing. My sides were like warm. Our chicken was ok, a little weird. Chewy and fatty parts. \n\nGlad I tried it, but wouldn't go back.
