This is a movie theater like any other movie theater, nothing special. I didn't have a great experience the last two times I went there. You know in the summer it's always cold a little in movie theaters, but I was near to get a cold each time I went there, and trust me, I'm not the kind of person who feel it's cold all the time.\n\nAs like any other cinema, it cost a lot to eat something here. I had to take a lunch before the movie, but I found that the tables (and the floor) where we can eat were really disgusting.\n\nThere are some good points of going there: they have one AVX theater so, for an extra, have more comfortable seats, and make reservation online (for the ticket, and your seat). Also there are near a subway station.\n\nGood to go, but there are better movie theaters than this one.
