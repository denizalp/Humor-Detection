We found the Village Pub and Grill due to it's close proximity to our gate. Before a flight who doesn't love a great bar. This one will not disappoint as we were warmly greeted when we entered and took seats at the counter. We assumed it would be quicker and it was.  I ordered a local beer made in Las Vegas and it was fantastic. My husband got his usual. \n\nThe manager was really friendly and we were talking to him the whole time. Now for the amazing service the Manager himself walked to our gate and checked the status of our flight. I mean who does that!  Amazing that is customer service above and beyond. \n\nSorry we don't come here regularly or this would be our place! We can\"t thank you enough for your great drinks your friendliness and great service!!!!
