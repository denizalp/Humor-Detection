Came in today for my Prius's 70K oil change (filter and synthetic oil fill every 10K miles).  I've only approved of the service supervisor's  extra \"suggestions\" once, when I thought I was going on a road trip.   So BM, the guy who regularly supervises the work done on my car,  tells me that the cabin filter needs to be changed ($60) and (elsewhere) that there's \"condensation\" forming that may \"create mildew\" ($90).  I went with the cabin filter change.  I unsuccessfully tried to find my car to have a look at the actual filter, but someone in the garage must've noticed me looking, because BM found me back inside the waiting room and asked me if I needed him.  I said I wanted to see the filter, and he brought back a used filter and a brand new one.  I thought to myself how may I be assured it's the actual filter from my car he's going to show me, since I didn't see it coming out of my car?  When he brought it back, together with a new filter for comparison, I didn't think a change was necessary, and none of the male clients who were eavesdropping said anything either (and really, why would they?  They don't know me, so what do they care, AND their cars are also being serviced here.  However, if I knew that someone else was being ripped off and I could help, I'd step in, but that's just me...)  I should've said no, but I said go ahead.  You've got my $50**, BM, but I'm just going to stick to the oil changes and 5K maintenance services from here on out.  I'll need proof I may trust your word again!\n\nDo YOU think the filter needed to be changed? https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=Uo2_tQV84jlDYfh_SsSxfQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  The feedback I've received from friends have been 50\/50, so far.\n\n**I now know it only costs $10 to buy the filter from Amazon!\n\nHow to change the cabin filter of a Prius:  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M3KBG0NABjM&feature=share
