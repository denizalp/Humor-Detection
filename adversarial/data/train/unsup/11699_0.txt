I experienced bad service today. Came in for my usual rib dinners but unfortunately, they ran out. No problem, I ended up ordering 2 rib tip dinners and a brisket dinner. \n\n1. The skinny black server was wearing shorts hanging halfway down his butt. Not very appetizing while dishing out food. \n\n2. He took my order slip and after helping out the 2 ladies in front of me he then proceeded to fill the orders of 2 ladies that were behind me in line. \n\n3. Then he had the nerve to tell me to move because I was holding up the line. \n\n4. As the empty pans are being changed out, they are dripping pan condensation water all over the other food. \n\n\nThe food is still good but their employees need to be monitored because their attire, service and food handling need upgrading.
