so have you ever had a last minute decision to create this awesome photo present to your amazing friend who just has to have this mug with the shot of his\/her friends' silly faces?...\n\nI had that happened to me at least few times. and it always was max one week prior to the bday\/farewell\/wedding\/whatever party that it had to be ready for. \n\nthen of course you always go to these big name photo stores that have all these online store features. and after you're about to submit the order the note tells you that it will take up to 10 business days for your order to arrive. well thank you very much. that's too late. \n\nbut Rapid Photo does these things in a day! and most of the times cheaper and the staff is super friendly!
