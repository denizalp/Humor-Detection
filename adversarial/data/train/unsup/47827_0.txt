This is my 3rd cirque du soleil. Wholesome, enjoyable show especially if you are a big fan of the beatles. Very good presentation and sequencing of the production but lesser laugh and acrobatics than mystere. My seat was close to the stage  cause i got a discounted deal online but i believe every seat is a good seat so dont spend too much on the tickets.
