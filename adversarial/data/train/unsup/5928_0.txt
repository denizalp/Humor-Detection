It seems as though the culture of Vegas has overtaken the grace that is supposed to be the Mandarin Oriental.\n\nLet me start off by going through my stay, (I am currently approximately 5 hours into my reservation check in, the current time is 5:11 P.M. and my check in was around noon if I recall)\n\nPr-Check In AND Check In Problems: I had booked a reservation the day before, as I was staying at the SKY-LOFTS @ MGM GRAND and they had no more availability for an extension, so I took a friend's recommendation and decided to book your Strip View Suite and order flowers through the online reservation system as well, because my Wife and I had just gotten married and I wanted to surprise her when I entered the room.\nI called the front desk and was informed that I could fill out a CC Authorization form and show a picture of my Credit Card and Photo ID matching the Credit card, in order to successfully charge the room to my DISCOVER Card ending in 24 made to book my reservation.\n\nI was blatantly lied to and upon checking in, was told that I would need to provide the physical card (which was located in southern California)\n\nI asked for a Manager's assistance due to extenuating circumstances and the fact that I am a first time guest as well as one of your suite guests and someone who spends a lot of money on property and is loyal to chains he has had great experiences with.\n\nThe Woman at the front desk by the name of Michelle [-] then lied to me and stated that she was in fact one of the Front Desk Managers, when she was in fact only a Front Office Supervisor or (Team Lead).\n\nJackie [-] confirmed this when she called me to apologize about the flowers not being delivered on time, to which I thought she was in fact Michelle [-] who had lied to me and stated that SHE was the manager, when in fact Jackie [-] was the manager!\n\nLuckily for me my Credit Card Company increased my Credit Line on a Sunday and allowed your hotel chain's charges to authorize.\n\nOtherwise I would be without a room tonight due to misguidance provided by the staff at this location.\n\n\n\nAFTER CHECK IN PROBLEMS:\nAfter My Wife and I checked into the room, we shortly ordered room service there after. The Tikka Chicken Wrap on the menu came out soggy and uneatable, as well as the fries.\nThe Side Salad? Dry as crisp, no dressing.\nCream I asked for? Non-existent.\n\nWhen I ask for the dishes to be picked up by an attendant, I was serviced, and then interrupted SIX more times by a combination of panic inducing phone calls and invasive knocking, door bell rings, and awful teamwork display.\n\nAfter my dishes were picked up by the first service member, I was checked up on FOUR more times (two of these times staff members attempted to WALK INTO MY DO NOT DISTURB SIGN WHILE MY WIFE WAS NAKED!) \n\nThey barely or did not knock whatsoever, and ignored my Do not disturb, and tried to walk into the room and ask for the room service dishes, AFTER they had already been picked up.\n\nAfter four heart attacks, I received a phone call asking me if someone had picked up the dishes, which awoke me from a nap with a panic attack.\n\nAn hour later I was awoken by another phone call from Jackie [-] to apologize about the flowers I had problems with multiple hours ago! Talk about delayed!\n\nSo, in the 4-5 Hours I've been on the property so far, I haven't been able to even gather my belongings or thoughts without so much as being interrupted, invaded upon, walked in on, and given extreme agony to.
