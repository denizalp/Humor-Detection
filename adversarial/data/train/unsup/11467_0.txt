Decorated in the popular gay\/Kubrickian motif, Blushberry is bringing the trendy SoCalFroYo fad downtown.  The innovative flavours and toppings are delightful; the servers even let us try samples.  Being boring, I stuck with plain yogurt and almonds.  I wish, I wish, I wish they had shaved or ground almonds, but it was still delicious.\n\nObligatory Title Pun:  This BERRY'll make you BLUSH.\n\nMenu Readability:  Look for it in the least logical place to put a menu.  Oh, there it is!\n\nNeed to mention:  Astroturf lawn graces the patio out front.  Nice touch.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself:  I prefer my nuts ground or chopped.  (Maybe that's a bit personal.)
