WTH???\n\nI usually like The Yard. They HAD favorite beer, Blue Paddle.  Not everyone likes every beer on draught to be an IPA....so I picked another lager.  But then the cheese plate came out. My friend asked if half of it fell off? We asked if bread was coming out. Nope, would like to order a side of bread too.\n\nI posted a picture of my cheese plate.
