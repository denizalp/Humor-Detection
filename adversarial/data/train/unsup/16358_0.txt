Iron Chef is a Chinese and Japanese restaurant. Really. That doesn't make sense. Never heard of this combination. Ok so I was a little skeptical. Small little place. When we walked in I was looking for a hostess but to my surprise nothing. Someone just told us to take a seat. So we find our own table. Waitress is very good and tells us all the Chef's Special rolls are 50% off all the time. Very cool. \n\nWe ordered the Dragon roll, Caterpillar roll, and Crunchy Shrimp roll. The rolls were really good. Very fresh. We really enjoyed them. Not bad for a Chinese\/Japanese place. \n\nI also ordered the House Special Chow Mein which had a nice mix of veggies, BBQ portk, and shrimp. Noodles cooked very good. Overall, it tasted okay. Not great and also not the worst I had before so it was good. \n\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Yaki Udon noodles. So I guess when you order one of their Japanese  dishes they give you a bowl of miso soup. Soup was really good. Have to say it was outstanding. My daughter and wife shared the udon noodles. They both loved it. The chicken was very moist and tender. My wife enjoyed he noodles said it was cooked right and wasn't overpowering. They gobbled it up. So I would have to say they enjoyed it. \n\nService we really good. They had three waitresses running around helping out their tables. All were Asian women and were very helpful. Cup were filled in a timely manner and they were really kind and smiling. That's they type of service I'm looking for. Also, the food came out really quickly. They also have a nice little area outside that looked nice to sit at especially with this great weather right now. \n\nSo we had a great time, good food, good sushi and good service. If you can handle a little self service to find your own table then this is the place for you. Choice of Japanese or Chinese food. Really. Iron Chef somehow makes this works. I'm not complaining and I'll be back. Enjoy.
