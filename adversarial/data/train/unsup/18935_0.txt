One of my favorite quick taco\/burrito spots!\n\nI've eaten at Mr. Mesquite a handful of times now and their food has consistently been great. The way they prepare the chicken and steak makes it really tasty! I've had both the tacos and burritos. The burritos are my favorite as it is a generous portion of food. Both take-out and dine-in are great options here.\n\nMy last visit the restaurant was really clean, which is not always the case. If it was as clean as my last visit every time I've been, Mr. Mesquite would have gotten 5 stars.
