My cousin was really craving for some thai food, and mostly the mango and sweet rice dessert that you can get here, so she dragged me out here with her. \n\nWe ordered duck curry, crab fried rice, and the pad thai. All of these dishes were pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere. They were all fairly spicy, and I absolutely loved it! \n\nI'd give this place another half a star for their dessert because it was absolutely delicious! Fresh fruit, perfect amount of coconut, and the sticky rice was cooked to perfection.
