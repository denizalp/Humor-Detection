Costco gas is super rad. Very clean, smoking good prices, and they have very friendly employees there. There is a man I always see who is very kind, and always checks in on all the customers, saying hi to everyone.  I really like Costco gas, the quality is super great, and the prices are always lowest in town. Just a reminder, you have to have a Costco card to purchase gas there.
