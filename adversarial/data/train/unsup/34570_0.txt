There's been some rave reviews. Korean restaurants are very limited in vegas, and I was on a mission to get myself a stone-pot bibimpab. I was so shocked to pull up to a mom-and-pop fast-food type of place. I guess I was expecting a dine-in, non-food court vibe restaurant. \n\nThe food was meh. Bibimpab was nothing to write home about. \nTheir teriyaki chicken dish was okay.
