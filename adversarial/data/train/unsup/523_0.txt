Honestly, I am not a coffee snob. Though I can surely appreciate a good cup of coffee. Not Just Coffee is my go-to whenever I'm at 7th street market, from pour-overs coffees, lattes, chai, cold brew and more. After all, it's not just coffee. Sometimes the line at the counter can get long if you go at  peak hours, but the line will move fast. Also, if you keep your eyes open, you can snug a seat at the bar.\n\n\nP.S: try their winter signature drink: The Holy Mole. \nCome try the Holy Mole! Espresso, steamed milk (of your choice), mole bitters dashes and Carolina reaper infused honey syrup garnished with black Onyx chocolate sugar powder and smoked paprika dusts!\n\n\nFour and Three Quarters Yelps.
