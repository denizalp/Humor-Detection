Hurry! You only have a few weeks left to spend an awesome afternoon on the water via kayak or SUP.\n\nThe staff here is sooo nice.  Really enjoyed just talking to the interesting people who work there. If you stay out for a little over an hour most places would charge you for two but Brittingham let's you get off the hook with one.\n\nYou can play it safe and drift around in Monona Bay or you can go into the actual lake. Stand up paddle boarding or kayaking (tandem or single) are perfect ways to enjoy the lake without having to splurge on an expensive motor boat rental. you'll also get a bit of a workout without overly extend in yourself!\n\n\n\nThey also apparently have SUP yoga which I really, really want to try. $30 seems a little much but I guess you are paying for the rental and the yoga instruction. Will definitely have to try next summer!
