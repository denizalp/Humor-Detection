When I first heard about this place from a friend, I was like \"What?! Crazy Chinese people cooking up Mexican food?\". Let me tell you, it's AWESOME!!!\n\nI'm a fan of all types of cuisines, but if I could, I would put guacamole in EVERYTHING... well maybe with a few exceptions. Boy was I happy somebody came up with guacamole + Chinese food *drool*\n\nIt's cheap, portions are huge (I eat a lot by the way)!\n\nI went to the location near Queen St. East, so the only place to sit was at the back, outside by the parking lot. It looks like a whole in the wall (literally), but boy do they have awesome selection of dishes and beverages.\n\nI can't wait to go back!!!
