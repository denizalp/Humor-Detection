Great coffee shop located in the Skywater Apartments!  The staff was extremely friendly, the selection of coffee and tea was extensive and the space was very comfortable - great for studying or a meeting.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ginger ginseng tea and the blueberry oatmeal - great way to kickstart the day!
