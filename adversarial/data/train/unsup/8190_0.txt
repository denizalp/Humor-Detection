Master Mu Chang is one of the most interesting teachers of martial arts in my traveled and inconsistent career.\n\nThe quality of instruction here is very deep and very old school.  Mu Chang is from Korea and his training was the old way of stomping around in the dirt without pads or mats.  Sometimes he has a bit of a laugh at the soft lifestyles we have here, which is his right in my opinion.  I have been told tales of MMA beefcakes visiting and wanting Mu Chang to sell him his best techniques and saying that he said that he would if they could manage to pin him.  They could not.  Master Mu Chang is made of wood and pictures of him winning amateur wrestling tournaments internationally can be seen if you look at the pictures hanging on the walls.\n\nA couple of things to watch out for are some of the dangerous exercises that are performed in class.  For example, I am a large whiteboy and was unsure of my ability to do a front handspring.  I was singled out in the class and so I made an attempt.  I enjoy my herniated disk that was its result.  I suggest that you not make the same mistake if you don't think you can do something and think you may get hurt.\n\nThere is also a steady diet of Christianity and prayer here, but it was not oppressive in my view.  I feel it is worth mentioning though so that prospective students are aware of it.
