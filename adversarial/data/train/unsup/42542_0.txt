Fairfax.  Just order it.  Don't forget to add bacon to it.  Sooooooooooo good.  Fresh squeezed orange juice and a killer, killer cold brew coffee.  Yeah, I will take a continuous IV of that coffee all day long, baby.  The wait was a bit long so that is the only ding I give this place but jeeeezzzzus that breakfast sammy was on point.
