I honestly believe a majority of this was total BS.\nI'm not trying to be a downer and I'm not a skeptic; I just honestly think everything was so over dramatized and theatrical that it took away the authenticity of whatever may be \"real\". \nWhen we were in Peggy the dolls room, I could tell right away that the EVP was pre-recorded to try to scare everyone; don't get me wrong, I think we had fun by getting scared and scaring each other.  I honestly do believe in the paranormal but something about this experience just ruins all of it.\nThey were also so strict on taking pictures that when I pulled my phone out to check the time, I immediately got called out by the tour guide to put my phone away.  Definitely not worth the money and I'm a local and got a discount but still not worth it.
