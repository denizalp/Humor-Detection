Thought I wrote a review before but maybe not. Anyways probably would have given a 4 two years ago but today wanted to update my review (if I had one). The last two times the quality of the food was slipping and also on top f the still very slow cooks waiting for 30+ minutes for food after ordering, this has to go down to a 2 \/ 3.\n\nThey do have Groupon specials which gives it a more reasonable price. Still have special selection for vegetarian compared to other veggie places. However today they served some pretty poor quality food and the floor manager wanted to give us a 10% off the next time. The veggies were rotting and black and served to us. In the end they gave in another order of the same thing and in the end after 30 min it ended up being the same. \n\nMaybe this is just 1 bad experience as I have been here probably 15 plus times but from when I first came here the food quality is just not cutting it for the price you pay.\n\nThis was for their dinner service. Usually the dim sum is not bad and haven't had a bad experience yet for dim sum. But their dinner service is slow and now quality is just Meh. \n\nIf you are a vegetarian I would still give this place a try but I'll be out looking for alternatives now.
