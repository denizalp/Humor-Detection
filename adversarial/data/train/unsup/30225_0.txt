today was the 3rd time i've been to 71, and just haven't had time to write a review.  Today we had the Easter Brunch, the food was amazing, and was definitely plenty of it.  the Custom Omelet bar was a bit weak on add-ons, but what they had tasted amazing!  \n\nThe other 2 times i went i had Queso Dip (really flavorful and good), Sliders w\/avacado (can be a meal), Green Chilli Melt Burger & Grilled cheese with a twist.  Everything i've eaten was really good and definitely worth the price.\n\nThe inside is nicely laid out and wasn't too loud.  We sat outside 2 weeks ago and enjoyed it (although now with it being an open patio it will be a bit hot).\n\nOverall i'm fan and will definitely be going back, a few more things on the menu i can't wait to try!
