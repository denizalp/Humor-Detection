So I was a bit skeptical about this place right up until our server came to take our order. But all of my negative expectations were quickly assuaged and I now have nothing but high praises for this hidden and understated gem. They have an incredible selection of beers (which is what brought me there in the first place) with staff that are very knowledgable and can point you in the right direction even with the vaguest description of \"what you're looking for tonight.\"\n\nThe food was also a pleasant surprise, my friend and I both had the pork pizza which was different in the best way possible and we opted for the duck fat fries which it seemed everyone gets. For good reason, they're delicious.\n\nWe opted for dessert after a second round of beers and I was, again, pleasantly surprised by both the house made \"stout\" ice cream and the cinnamon mini donuts. The waitress seemed to be unmoved by our surprise at the quality of the food as if she hears it on the regular and credited the in-house made everything.\n\nWhatever the reason, both my friend and I left very full, not so sober, and very happy for under 50 bucks each. Not bad for the financial district at all.
