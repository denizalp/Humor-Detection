have you ever walked something like half a mile along the side of a highway - possibly causing traffic violations in the process - in order to get to food?\n\nno? why the hell not?\n\nit is probably always packed (there were at least 50 people on line when we got there), but fear not, Brave Traveler, your order will be taken surprisingly quickly (within ten minutes), and you shall receive unto thee a most sacred meal prepared by the high priests in their red-and-white uniforms (also within ten minutes).\n\nmy choice picks (off the secret menu):\n1) mustard-grilled Double Double\n2) Animal Style fries (shared these with my friend Keith)\n3) Neapolitan shake (all three shake flavors mixed together)\n\nit is not that expensive - the above order costs something like 8 bucks.\n\noh yeah, cabs will pull in to the parking lot to cart your bloated ass back to the Strip.\n\nand the peasants rejoiced!
