This review is actually for The Flame restaurant, inside the El Cortez.\n\nI ordered the fish of the day, which was the halibut. It was a good-sized piece of fish, but it was not terribly flavorful. The waitstaff was friendly, but they forgot our side order of mushrooms (everything is ordered a la carte), and did not bring them out until we were almost done with our meal.\n\nAt the prices they charge, I would expect more flavorful food and better service.
