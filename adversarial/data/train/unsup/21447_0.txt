I had a negative experience here. This is one of those places that deludes you into believing that they are high quality *because* they have high prices. Look a little closer at the things in this shop that seem so fancy and attractive for your precious little girls, \"made by hand in America\" according to the owner - and you will see, as I did on my second trip, that the tags in the back from the legitimate manufacturer have been clipped out (pretty hilarious in retrospect). The frocks are just polyester, not silk, satin or real lace. In fact, they are probably mass-produced and available online for a fraction of the price. And they DON'T ACCEPT RETURNS even on unworn merchandise. If it wasn't in Hilldale chances are good that people would never pay the price here. It's a bunch of fluffy, frilly pink junk.
