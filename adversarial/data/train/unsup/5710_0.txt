A great hot pot experience! Tons of selection, and some great soup selections. We had the satay and mala spicy soup, both were delicious and the mala soup was very very spicy, as were any of the veggies that we cooked in them. \n\nEverything was delicious... the beef, the lamb, the pork were very good. The dumplings were frozen, and so-so. The only thing I didn't enjoy were the leafy veggies, which seemed to have not been washed very well. I could swear that they were gritty, but it could have been the whole peppercorns that were in the mala sauce.\n\nThe service was pretty quick, except when we tried to get our bill, but the restaurant had filled up considerably from the time we got there (a little before 7pm). \n\nI will definitely be returning again!
