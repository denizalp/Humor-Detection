wow super late.. so late that this should've been one of my first reviews when i started an acct..\n\nmy first vegas hotel since being of age and loved it! my friend booked the room for wed-fri and got some stuff through the promo we used.. the rooms were spacious and all suites..we had people over in our room before heading out for the night and couldn't believe we were able to fit about 15 people in there and still had room to move around.. \n\noh, can't forget about bouchon! the bakery is next to the elevators and was my first time tasting their yummy goodies..\n\nenjoyed my stay and wouldn't mind staying here again.. although, i'd want to check out palazzo too.. heard those were a lil bit nicer..
