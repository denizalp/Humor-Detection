I've tried this Fatburger location twice now. Both times just a 3 star. While they do have HUGH burgers, they also have little burgers for the kids & the lil eaters. Burgers have all sorts of items you can put on. I have felt both time that their burgers are a little bland and very greasy, and their chili cheese fries are about par. 24 hr DT.
