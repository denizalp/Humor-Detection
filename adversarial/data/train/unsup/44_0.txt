We had carry out for our family last night.  We have been eating Indian food for 20 years, including multiple trips to India.    We were very disappointed from three perspectives.   Price, portions, and quality.  Quality is subjective, but I can say that several of the dishes were definitely sub-par (Chicken Tikka was dry, Lamb Kabab was dry, etc).    \n\nThe real kicker is for $19 to $20 per dish (which is at least 30% higher than any other Indian Restaurants in the area), the portions were significantly smaller than any we have EVER seen.   We had a group of 6 and our $150 carry out was not enough to feed the entire group.    I believe given the quality, portions, and price they will not be in business much longer.    I recommend before going you yelp other Indian Restaurants in the area and head there before you pay too much, and get too little!
