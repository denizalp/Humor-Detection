This is a Lindt Boutique that is not located in any mall, but a store front of it's own. Inside the store, I'd say the ceilings are pretty high and feels very comfortable to be in. It has adequate parking space, even on super busy nights such as midnight madness.\n\nMy favourite part about going to any chocolate store is their free sample in the front. Lindt chocolate is super smooth and velvety to the taste. i'd recommend coming here around Christmas or Easter, especially when you see the specials that are online - e.g. teambuy, etc. for $15 for $30 worth of chocolate. \n\nThere are assorted chocolates, boxed chocolates in multiple sizes and their seasonal chocolates - Christmas, Halloween and Easter being their top three biggest annual sales.
