We LOVE Lovebug baby! There is such a shortage of baby boutiques in Las Vegas.  Crystal, the owner, seriously stocks the cutest stuff! They have the biggest selection of BabyBling bows (we're still anxiously awaiting my 10 month old's hair to come in), Tula carriers and blankets, kickee, nununu, mini Melissa, natives and so much more cute stuff!! They also have tons of jujube diaper bags as well as a small selection of car seats and strollers.  Lovebug also stocks plenty of stuff for mom like breastfeeding supplies, belly lotions and way awesome tops that say \"breastfeeding is my cardio\".  I also really appreciate how active they are on social media... I always know when they get new stuff in and when they do collaborations like with tiny impressions (a company that does clay hand impressions) doulas of Lass Vegas and photographers.  We only discovered them a few months ago but I wish I'd known about them when I was pregnant!\nThis shop is a real winner! We drive out from Summerlin all the time to their Eastern location because they're just that great!
