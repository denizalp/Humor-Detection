In a sea of chain restaurants on McNight, Stokes is a good pick. They always have 5-6 soups from scratch, and a ton of great sandwich options. I love the veggie pesto sandwich which is on pressed hoagie bread. The mac n cheese is great, especially on these cold winter days. Lots of beers on tap too. Check it out.
