Im not really sure how this place got 4 stars on yelp.  Anyway, I was convinced to take me and my girl out there and yes I will grant the service was friendly but the place smelled funny and the food tasted even funnier...almost as though it was cooked in contaminated water.  \n\nBottom line:  I would rather take a look at the dollar menu at McDonald's than come here.  My food would have come faster, cheaper, and tasted better.  It makes Chili's look like the Ritz Carlton and I know I can have dinner for 2 for $20 there easily.  I know this sounds harsh but I do eat a lot around Vegas and don't want others to have this experience.
