Wow, Magal actually made me feel I was back in Ktown in LA! Most of everyone that dined there was also Korean. So good sign. \n\nThe lights around the area kinda bothered me but I guess it made up for a good Instagram shot.\n\nI went with the beef combo with pork belly. All the meats tasted great and I had no complaints. I kinda did expect the beef brisket to not be hard frozen when they served it to us since we're paying a higher price. The beef sushi was only okay. The bachan was kinda non existent. Only kimchi, pickled celery, and some salad with bland corn dressing. \n\nI had one huge disappointment.... They're corn isnt cheese corn!!! It was corn with cream or mayonnaise. \n\nThe soup they give with their meal was delicious and spicy! I really enjoyed that after my meal. \n\nAlso, \n\nI'll maybe return if they change their speakers. The music sounds horrid with the speakers they're using. Felt like my ears were bleeding eating next to one.
