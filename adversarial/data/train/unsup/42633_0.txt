Awesome service. We came in at 11:30 pm on a Monday night. The staff was extremely attentive. Never felt rushed. Most restaurants focus on closing when it is slow. These guys rocked. Very attentive. We never felt rushed. Our server\/barkeep (I regret I didn't write her name down for this review) was outstanding...AND Food was great!!!
