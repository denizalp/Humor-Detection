This was the first and ABSOLUTELY the LAST time I will ever go to this place. My friend and I walk in and the bartender never greets us in fact the first thing she said to me was \"what are you having?\" So I told her then after I got some money to play I asked her what machine she recommended for keno and she said\"I don't give recommendations every machine has keno\" all as she was walking away from me. She never came by to introduce herself never asked if we were hungry or anything at all in all honesty, the only reason I even know her name is because it's on the receipt. She didn't speak to anyone the entire time we were there except to get a drink refilled but that's literally it.\n\nKeoki  is by far one of the absolute worst \"bartenders\" I've ever seen. I've been a bartender for 20 years and if I treated ppl like she does I wouldn't have lasted a week.\n\nShe should just sit in a cubicle in a basement somewhere so nobody has to deal with her.\n\nAs I said before I won't be going back there again and I'll make sure I tell everyone I know to do the same.
