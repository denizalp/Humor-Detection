I used to be a big fan of this particular Fatburger, I have eaten many a burger here at 4am to soak up the Crown Royal.   Always enjoyed the burger and the atmosphere such as it were.    My last trip to Vegas was last October, after not having been for 10 years.  My old stand by has priced itself right out of my life.    I paid nearly $13 for a burger and a coke, no fries.    The burger is small, they always were.  The value just isn't there for me, For $13 I should get fries and\/or a significantly bigger burger.   Guess they have to pay for that \"fancy\" storefront and Patio they set up.       My fast food burger go to in Vegas now is In and Out.
