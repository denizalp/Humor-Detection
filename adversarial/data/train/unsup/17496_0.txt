I realize I need to preface this review with a little insight into my obsession with crawfish, as they represent the single greatest food pursuit of my life - no kidding. I have been lucky enough in life to have joined some of the country's greatest crawfish festivals and eaten at some of the most renowned crawfish joints.\n\nWhen the sign first appeared above the doors of this traditional Asian section of town, I got so excited I nearly got t-boned by an SUV trying to cross the road. Of course, it wasn't open yet, so I shed a small tear and considered heading over to H&J's to satisfy this sudden crawfish craze that came over me - of course, that's when I remembered I aint a big fan of H&J's.\n\nWeeks later, I saw people scurrying about around the place and, once again, I broke several traffic laws trying to get turned around. Apparently, this time they were having a little job fair, looking for a staff I guess (don't think I didn't consider a sudden career change).\n\nThen, life got busy, they opened and I didn't even notice. It was several weeks before I happened to catch that distinguishable sign again, so of course I dropped everything I was doing just to get some of those delicious bugs that make my life happy.\n\nOkay - that's the end of my happy.\n\nNow for the review. \n\nCravin' Cajun is just another H&J - with a little bit different sauce. \n\nThe problem, as is the problem with H&J's, is that, apparently, crawfish in Vegas means 2 things. \n\n* Tiny, little, midget crawfish.\n* Impossibly overwhelming sauce.\n\nThe crawfish were almost too small to eat, I should have probably just ate them whole - it would have been better. Where do they get these things? \n\nAnd the sauce (while honestly quite delicious) so overpower the crawfish, you can't even taste those wonderful juices that come from sucking the head. People, crawfish have a delicious flavor, and it's completely lost in the sauce.\n\nSo in conclusion, Vegas still doesn't have a decent crawfish joint. \n\nCan't a guy catch a break?
