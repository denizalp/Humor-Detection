The server was excellent . We got there at 5 and it was quiet and empty. They sat us in the back by the kitchen,because I didn't have a reservation I assume. Waiter customized my meal which was lemon picatta and that was nice. More lemon zest needed but I was happy. On entering a couple were trying to get seated but he only had a tank top so was refused service.  Hostess\/owner was coughing, blowing nose and seen eating at the bar and making wise jokes of ex patrons. They sat two women at the front of the restaurant and let their conversations be yelled during the entire meal. \n\n  Glad it was a groupon because I was disturbed by their behaviour.  In my opinion tank top man should be allowed in because you should feel grateful to have any customers.
