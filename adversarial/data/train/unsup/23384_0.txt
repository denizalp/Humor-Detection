I'm on a mission to try all of the Koren BBQ restaurants in Vegas and today was Gen.  Let me start by saying that I read a negative review from a few days ago about the floors being sticky as if some one had spilled a drink.  Well, they are still sticky today.  Perhaps mopping isn't on their list of priorities.  Also, I did notice posted at the front by the hostess station that their rating by the Heath Department had been downgraded to a B but we decided to stick around and try it any way. Most of the meat is mediocre at best.  The only thing we would give a good rating is the smoked pork belly.  Additionally, the kitchen manager was unaccomodating.  We noticed there was a chicken dish with a cheese fondue.  We asked if we could have the cheese fondue with a different item but the manager said no.  Again later in our visit we requested only a half order of meat and were again told no that they we could only get a full order.  Honestly, those two reasons along with the mediocre meat quality marks this KBB off my list of any I would ever recommend or return to.
