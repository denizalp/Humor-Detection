This is a solid Marriott in the Waterfront's shopping center. My brief cross-state trip to Pittsburgh was taken on a whim. I received some not-so-hot news earlier this week, so I responded by immediately packing a bag and hopping on the turnpike to put some actual distance between myself and the meh situation.\n\nWhen I was two hours away, I finally pulled into a rest stop and surveyed my Pittsburgh lodging options. I never book Airbnbs that late and I'm a terrible driver so I knew I wanted to be fairly close to the city but on the eastern side. Hence, West Homestead. It fits both criteria and has ample free parking. It's not hard to find off 376, even in the dark.\n\nUpon arrival, Patrick at the front desk could not have been more welcoming. He asked why I was traveling and, since the event was so fresh in my mind, I gave the long story. He was so empathetic and optimistic -- it instantly made me feel a bit better!\n\nMy river-facing room was on the second floor next to an electrical closet. Fortunately in my haste I did pack ear plugs, but otherwise it could have been a bit noisy. My neighbors on the other side the second night were also rather loud but eventually settled down. Plus that's a risk in any hotel so I'd never fault the accommodation for that. I'm just glad I got to wake up and see the river and hills! Very relaxing.\n\nThe hotel room was clean and stocked with fresh towels and toiletries. I didn't find any evidence of bed bugs, and the mattress was comfy and on the softer side. The complimentary wi-fi worked well throughout my stay also.\n\nI felt safe and happy for the duration of my short stay. It costs less than $15 to Uber downtown as well, which is awesome in a new, unfamiliar city. Squirrel Hill is across the bridge too, and is a really gorgeous part of the city. At a room rate of less than $100\/night, I'd totally return if I find myself in Pittsburgh again one day.
