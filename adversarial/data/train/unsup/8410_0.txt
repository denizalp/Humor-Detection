No, just no. I should've checked the Yelp reviews but it was 1 am after a long night of walking around for Nuit Blanche. My mistake. Part bar, part cafe, part pool hall? What? Service was strange from the manager - he was trying to be nice but that sort of nice where you've had too much coffee. He kept forgetting things, didn't take my fiance's order and offered strange commentary.\n\nI ordered the Especial hot chocolate and damn was it an overpour. He noticed I wasn't interested in it and said something along the lines of \"other places underpour but we overpour.\" I was thinking...why not just pour it right? He did offer to top it up with some more hot chocolate but I was feeling pretty sick so I declined. My guy played it safe and just got a beer. We shared the Chocolate Pecan...pie. The manager took the time to show me I was wrong for calling it a cake and how the menu said in big, bold letters (not really) it was a pie. And how everyone makes the mistake. It was stale and overly sweet. I mentioned it being overly sweet and he said \"I could've told you that\". We asked several times for glasses of water and when I asked again he only brought one.\n\nUsually I am more than happy to let the management know if I'm having a poor experience but I really didn't want to receive a lecture from him and just let it go. I tipped the waitress 15% though she didn't deal with our table because she looked so overwhelmed. I hope it went to her.\n\nI also overheard the manager tell some people that they were the only bar open until 4 am. No, they weren't. It's an exemption for most bars during Nuit Blanche.\n\nI'd never, ever come back. The whole experience left me feeling ill and I got on the subway ready to puke. My guy and I joked that we expect to see Gordon Ramsey there hosting a Kitchen Nightmares episode.
