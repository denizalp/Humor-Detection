Wow! Major disappointment. I wish that I could review The Chef Upstairs properly but we didn't even get to have the experience. My fiance gave me cooking classes at the Chef Upstairs for my 30th birthday. Of course I was ecstatic, thinking about this super fun evening we were going to have. Think again. We booked in December for Valentine's Day with the forethought that it would be busy. The owner confirmed and noted there would be a premium for V Day since it's a popular night (no problem I'm ok with that). So we show up 3 months later only to discover that there is no room for us. And of course there we are standing there awkwardly while everyone else who apparently got the memo to show up early is gawking at us like who are these party crashers. It was beyond embarrassing. The hostess (after taking her sweet time taking the other guests' drink orders) finally came over to address us and, clearly flustered, offered us a seat in the corner, to which we said no thanks. No apology, no offer to fix the situation, nothing. \nSo off we sulked on Valentine's Day to find (somehow) another restaurant to have dinner at.\nUpon contacting the owner, who was very apologetic, we were offered a full refund and vouchers to come back and try again. Needless to say the vouchers never arrived (now three months later) and frankly, I don't think I would bother trying to go again given the customer service at this point.
