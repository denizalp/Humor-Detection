Great food and nice setting.  From the moment we walked in, the service was  not great. Took almost 10 minutes for a hostess to come address us and find us a seat. Nobody in front of us and we just stood at the front of a restaurant that wasn't even  at 25% capacity.  Service was marginal at best.  Waitress displayed very little effort with checking on us, refilling drinks, etc.  Not sure if we will be back.
