Located in the mall at the Stratosphere, as we were walking around we came across this very cool store. Elegant, organized store that was eye catching. As we walked in they had hundreds of anklets to choose from in ever size imaginable. Both silver, gold and multi colored beads. \n\nThe couple that owns the store were originally from Chicago and they were very pleasant. All of a sudden as I am checking everything out I see my sister sitting with the owner and a huge roll out cabinet and she is trying toe ring's on my sister. \n\nToe ring's that are custom fit for your cute little toesies. How cool is that? I have never seen them before. Every size, every design that you can imagine. Sterling silver or real gold and even diamond toe rings that were gorgeous! We both just had to get some. The cool thing is they are individual rings and they price them out based on usually three rings and you wear them together. Rope designs, diamond cut, smooth, etc... so much of a selection to choose from. \n\nMy sister purchased a set and so did I. They are very comfortable, will not slide off, you can not even feel them, including when your toes are mashed in your high heels. Then I liked them so much I bought the matching thumb rings. I adore thumb rings but they are never comfortable. \n\nMy sister said they were a bit high on prices, especially for the diamonds but I am happy with my purchase. They write down your size and can order on line and they will ship to you if you want to add more bands. \n\nNice store, friendly service. Keep in mind they will not work with you on price. My sister inquired about purchasing two sets and getting a discount but they would not take anything off. They basically lost a sale for like $5, so to each their own. \n\nCheck this place out for some cool toe rings, thumb ring's or anklets.
