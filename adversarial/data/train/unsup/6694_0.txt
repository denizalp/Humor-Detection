This place would make me want to do grocery shopping everyday! There's just so much in here from cooked good to just produce. The best part is that most vendors let you try the produce before you buy. I guess this is what adulting feels like because I was so happy looking at all the fresh fruit and vegetables. After walking around we decided to go to the crepe store at the corner and regain the calories we lost walking around. A place you must visit when going to Montreal, it's very visually appealing.
