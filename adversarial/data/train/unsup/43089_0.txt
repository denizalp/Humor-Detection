In may of 2015 my diabetic cat was refused EMERGENCY treatment! I rushed home from work and called them for help at 4:00pm. they advised they were all booked and couldn't see him! The receptionist explained the problem to the two vets that were there. The doctors advised that i should take him to an emergency clinic in maple hts.! What!? My cat was under treatment there for two years!  I was shocked by their response! Pathetic!
