I saw good reviews so I've tried this place a couple times now. First off they don't offer dip nails. Second I went today to have a gel pedicure and I wanted a design with rhinestones. The lady didn't know how to do the rhinestones so she just kept asking me if I really wanted It so I just said no It was fine. To top it off my big toe has an indent and a black speck in It.
