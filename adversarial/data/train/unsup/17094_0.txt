I didn't think the line was going to be worth it, but after I took a bite of the adobada taco....that one hour wait was gone from my memory. You would think that the location off the strip wouldn't be as crowded, but nope. always crowded. There was line the whole time we were there. Be ready to wait for a table. Lots of people save tables while others in their group wait in the hour line.. so they are actually on the table for like 2 hours. \n\nOther than the crowd and small space, the food is delicious here. Definitely recommend getting something with the adobada. They have campechana fries which is half adobada and half carne asada which is always AMAZING.\n\n- long lines\n- very little tables\n+ delicious food
