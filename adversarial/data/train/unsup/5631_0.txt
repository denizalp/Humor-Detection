HORRIBLE and SHADY are words that come to mind. We had a group of 17 guys, and was offered free ride, free coverage with a purchase of two drinks. Cool. Big party so it was going to take a little while for the bus to come get us. Cool. We get in, they charge $45 each for the two drinks. Cool. We took 10 steps in and the host tells us for a party this big, we need to buy bottle service. He said the price was a $1000 plus gratuity for two bottles and we get a booth. Ok cool but what about the $765 we just paid. He said It'll go towards the bottles. Cool. \nBut they were only going to credit us $340 so we gotta pay $660 for the two bottles and not $235 additional. Not cool. We weren't down for that so he said u can sit at the bar or whatever seats are open. \nIt was a Monday so half the club was closed down. Half the club that was open, had reserved signs on there so we couldn't sit down. Reserved for who at 2am? So the whole time we were there. We all stood except when a spot opened up right by the main stage. $11 for a small bottle water.
