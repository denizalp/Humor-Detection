The Gabardine is a hep lil' spot that seems more befitting of West Queen West than Financial District. Its washwashed brick walls covered with mismatched frames and old newspapers, white tin-ceiling, old-timey lightbulbs, newspaper clippings and well-bearded staff scream hipster more than pinstripes. It's like they took a well-heeled core cafe and \"put a bird on it.\" Metaphorically speaking.\n\nTheir kitchen closes at 10pm, which only is a few minutes after I get up, so after a few false starts, I finally managed to grab a seat here. Their mostly-local menu features \"snacks\" (a collection of under $10 nibbles), salads, sandwiches, and their large plates (which range from $14 - 23). You can grab the Ploughman's Lunch which fancy-talk for a sharing platter. They also have a respectable array of desserts and old fashioned cocktails.\n\nI picked the rabbit rillette with brioche. It was nice, not too salty, and a fair-sized portion for $9. I also snagged an Old Fashioned and a Negroni. The old fashioned was a bit sweet for my liking, but that's not really much of a complaint. Drinks are $7-10, and a premium martini will set you back $13, and they have a pretty long wine list too.\n\nDefinitely a welcome addition to the core. I'd like to come back and try more drinks and maybe a few more drinks after that. Closed on weekends.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: The gift of GABardine.\n\nMenu Readability: Centred aligned and beautiful.\n\nNeed to mention: Closed on weekends.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I need to get up earlier in the day.
