We've established that I love burgers.  Therefore, it is to be expected that the Liberty, which routinely claims to have the best burger in Charlotte award (from whom, I don't quite know), has been on my to-try list for quite a while.  We were in the area for dinner last night, and so we popped in.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is a relatively cool space.  There's a spacious bar room, which would be a good place to have a few drinks without feeling packed in.  The dining room is comfortable as well, and is decorated with beer kegs, beer quotes, etc.\n\nHowever neat the decor was, we came for the food.  And we weren't disappointed.  I was excited to see poutine on the appetizer menu, since I've wanted to try this Canadian specialty from the moment I first became aware of its existence.  I wasn't disappointed.  The porcini gravy on the fries was especially delicious.\n\nThe burger was pretty dang good, too.  Was in the best in Charlotte?  Well, maybe.  I reserve my full commitment because, while the meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the toppings were thoughtfully selected, the bun was a little on the minimalistic side.  I actually had to finish it with a knife and fork.  Now, a burger with too much bread is a sad thing, but the Liberty has gone too far in the other direction.  Mind you, this is a minor quibble.  iIf you go here, get the burger.  It's dang tasty.  Just be prepared for messiness.\n\nI see some people have complained about the service, but our waitress was fine.  She wasn't super bubbly, but she was polite and kept our drinks filled.  What else can you ask for?
