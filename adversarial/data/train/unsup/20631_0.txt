Every Sunday, from 9:30am until 2:30pm, Bally's Steakhouse takes on a new persona, that of a restaurant serving the most phenomenal brunch on the Strip, one worthy of royalty if kings and queens were into lining up for an all-you-can-eat experience. While Vegas buffets tend to be carbon copies of each other, Sterling offers an abundance of dishes you'll find nowhere else in town. Ostrich tenderloin, Maine lobster, braised rabbit with buttered linguine, stone crab, striped sea bass and capers, freshly-prepared sushi, caviar and foie gras, peppercorn-encrusted rack of lamb, Sturgeon caviar, and lobster mingle with more traditional - and, in comparison, very mundane - breakfast fare like omelets and waffles on tables laden with enough food to feed a small Third World nation. Footmen in formal dress keep Perrier Jouet champagne flowing, and the desserts rival those to be found in the finest Parisian patisseries. Damn the expense . . . with any luck, you can always win it back - and then some - at the tables later on. Reservations are essential.
