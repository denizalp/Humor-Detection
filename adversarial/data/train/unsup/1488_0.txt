District One is an upscale sports bar styled Vietnamese fusion restaurant, nestled in Chinatown amongst a number of other Asian restaurants in a strip mall. I was definitely not expecting a modern atmosphere, and was happy not to have to wait in line at around 11:45am for lunch before my flight out. Highly recommend making the trek from the strip for some good Vietnamese eats here!\n\n* Ox Tail Fried Rice - 5 stars: The oxtail fried rice was chock full of delicious ox tail, a little oily as expected but so tasty. I liked that it was not overly fatty \n* Pork Belly Buns - 5 stars: Recently went to a food event, Cochon 5050 in Napa which featured  restaurants serving all types of pork. This dish could stand head to head against those dishes. So tender, so flavorful, meaty, delicious! Next time, would order the buns unfried.\n* Ox tail pho - 4 stars: Decent pho, have had better noodles. Broth was quite good and there was a lot of tender nonfatty oxtail meat - came with 2 large pieces. I think next time I will opt for the lobster pho.\n\nThe service was awesome, the food was great - can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu! Come early, the restaurant was full with a line at 1230pm on a Saturday!
