Was visiting a friend and we ordered pizza delivery from here last night. Let me start by saying, I was so close to giving them 5 stars, so lets go with 4 and a half for now. \n\nThe guy who answered the phone was a real Italian, great sign. 'How you doin' with the finest New York accent I heard since my last family reunion. So I replied like any other good (half) Italian would... 'how you doin' in my fake Italian accent voice. He was so helpful, told me about all my salad options and their ingredients. He took his time with me, just great customer service all in all. \n\nThe pie and salad arrived in exactly 45 minutes. I might pick up next time since my friends apt is so close. That chicken salad with Italian dressing looked so big, but we smashed every delicious morsel. Nice leafy greens and quality ingredients, I will order a salad every time. \n\nThe cheese pie (medium) was the best. I can't explain it, just trust me and try it for yourself. It's not a thin crust, but definitely a thinner crust. My only complaint, too small. Two girls could have totally shared a large with no leftovers (we had the munchies). \n\nAnyhoo, great experience all in all, delicious!
