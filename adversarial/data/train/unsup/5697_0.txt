Back in the 90's to mid 00's, this was my favorite hotel with the lights chasing around the fake boat and the lights on the water wheel was just fun to watch as if it were moving. It was total a dive just like it's sister hotel across the 15, Gold Strike but it was nice pit stop and some cheap eats.\n\nThe casino and hotel staff would be in cruise uniforms and the casino was always packed and full of action. Sadly this demolished in 2007 to make way for a modern and hip resort by MGM but the economy had axed out that plan.
