I found Orchid on accident. My usual spot were understaffed and told me they had no time. So I googled what was close to me and Orchid came up. I'm so glad I did. I needed a pedi and a fill. Doan greeted me and showed me to the pedi chair. I was offered water and green tea. My pedi was so relaxing and gorgeous. Trina did my nails and they are gorgeous. This place is a hidden gem. I felt like family!
