Anyone that goes to or works at Carnegie Mellon knows that we have the WORST food options ever on campus.  They taste ok, but they're expensive as can be.  One day I forgot to pack my lunch so I wandered down to Craig and Forbes.  I wait for the bus by Eat Unique so I figured I would test it out.\n\nI ordered a spicy grilled cheese ($5.99 w tax).  I think it had pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, and banana peppers.  There was supposed to be bacon, but it was either a negligible amount or they forgot it.  Maybe I was starving, but this sandwich was great.  I really loved the combination and the price is so fair.  Panera charges twice that for some of their sandwiches.\n\nThis place gets crazy at lunch time.  I think I waited about ten minutes, which is ok.  If I ever forget my lunch again, I'll be back!
