After years of my elderly mother going to this Dr. Lagstein I finally had to step in and put a stop to it.  Several times he over billed her and she paid, trusting that he would never take advantage of her.  The final straw was when he performed labs, in his office, and sent the blood work to a Lab that was not in her insurance network.  Obviously, the claim was denied as out of network.  When  I called to question as to why they sent it to the wrong place they said \"our girl screwed up and we fired her'.  I then asked how they were going to remedy the $1000.00 bill my mother received to which they replied \"that's not our problem and when this has happened in the past, Dr. Lagstein chooses to not get involved'. My mother was never even given the option to go to a lab on her own, ensuring that it would be covered.  VERY frustrating.  I immediately told her that she would no longer be seeing this doctor anymore.  She is now with an incredible doctor who really cares about her and not just working her through the system to get as much money as possible out of her.\nDo not go to this doctor, if you must, watch his billing closely and question every test and how it will be billed and sent out.
