with airlines, always hit or miss. delta by far my worst experience on one flight, excellent on the next. american airlines....for our most recent vacation, just run of the mill. \n\nwe were boarded quickly and efficiently. in the turks and caicos, our flight was cancelled due to a mechanical issue, but then we got to spend an extra night at the Beaches resort (free food and alcohol anyone). although it did take them 5 hours in the crappy providenciales airport to let us know the flight was cancelled, but 30 minutes later, i was happy as a pig in slop with 2 mixed drinks in my hand and 3rd on the way, with 4 or 5 more to go. \n\nairlines...unless you're in first class, you're nobody.
