Our Sunset shipping team was perfect. Quite the service they offer. I had a very pleasant conversation on the phone with them prior to having them actually come out to survey our move. They us gave a free estimate with a not to exceed total. Moving to another country can be pretty scary and stressful but my Mom and Dad said using Sunset for the transition was quite a relief!
