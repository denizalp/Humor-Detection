Read in Leafly that this was a new place located in the north part of town.  I am always anxious to try something closer to home.  I was familiar with their line of edible products but after reading the menu I realized they had their own vape juice.  It boasted of being made in house with natural ingredients.  I like the vapes that don't taste like BHO so I went ancld checked it out.  First thing you notice is the glass and the light which sets it apart from others and makes the process seem much more nefarious than most.  It brings it into the open which is a good thing.  The first part of the store has accessories.  Past the glass door is where the medicine is.  A great cooler full of teas, juices, cookies, frozen noveltys and the obligatory brownie.  The gentleman behind the counter helped me with my vape cartridges and gave me my new patient edible.  Got a blueberry oatmeal cookie that was terrific.  The vape is nice, effective medicine and tastea natural too.  A fun find for sure.
