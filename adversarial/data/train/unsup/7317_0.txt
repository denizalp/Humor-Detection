I had Patati Patata on my list of \"must try\" places in Montreal and I STILL managed to walk right past it earlier in the day without noticing it.  Patati Patata is super small (I can't imagine it seating more than 15 people) and unobtrusive, but it is fantastic.  You can opt to sit at the counter or one of three or four tables.  I wouldn't recommend this place for parties of more than two - you're going to have a very  hard time finding some configuration so you can sit together.  I saw lots of people getting takeout from the counter (fill your order in on little slips of paper, hand it over, wait briefly, receive cheap delicious food, hand over coins rather than bills (oh, Canada!), and go).\n\nPatati Patata served up the best poutine I had in Montreal (though granted, I only had it twice) with onions and green peppers for $4.  Amazing.  Even MORE amazing, 10 oz. beers were $2.50.  Even with the waning exchange rate advantage, that's awesome!  The staff is a little brusque (they're super busy) but also nice.  One of the counter guys offered the girls behind me free beer because he had to change the taps.  They were drinking the red, and I had the blonde so I got no free beer.  Drat.\n\nI will say Patati Patata is not a place to linger.  There was a line out the door on the Thursday evening I went (it seemed to be mostly university students) so I finished as quickly as I could. Before I was even to the register, my seat had been snatched, but I think that's more a testament to how good this place is than anything else.
