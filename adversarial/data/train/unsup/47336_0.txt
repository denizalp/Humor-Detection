Maybe it's because I've heard so many grand things about this hotel, that my expectations were raised a tad bit too high.   I would say it's above average 3 and 1\/2 stars, but not blow your socks off fantastic.  The exterior looks like a big grey block, not too exciting.  When you walk in, the hotel lobby is fairly modest, once again, nice...but nothing to rave about.   When we checked into the room, it's a nicely done average room.  The bathroom was pretty small, but then again very clean, so no complaints there.   Indoor pool was pretty small as well, but sufficient.  All in all, hotel and it's amenities were pleasant but blah.   Now the one thing that makes this hotel all worth it?  Location, location, location.  It's right above the train station, with easy access to the Metro down below, as well as straight access to the Underground City.   If you want to ride topside, there's a bus stop right at the corner of the church outside the hotel.   You could go anywhere you want, the public transportation is very very good.  It's also walkable distance to Old Montreal, it's a bit far but not too bad either.  If you get a good rate, I would recommend staying here.   Hotel personnel were also very attentive.  All in all - a pretty solid experience, but definitely NOT a top of the line luxury hotel.
