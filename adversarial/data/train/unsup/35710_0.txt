Had a great time staying here on a business trip. The accommodations were pretty nice. We had meals catered by the hotel for most of our lunches and dinners and I was very impressed! Not your typical hotel food by any means - it could rival most fancy high end catering\/restaurants. The staff was wonderful and assisted with all our needs. We were especially fortunate to have a wonderful shuttle driver (Brett) who was also a student and provided us with tidbits of information as he drove us around - such a great, personalized touch. Hope to be able to come back again for a personal visit, but we would definitely make this our hotel of choice when we come again for business.
