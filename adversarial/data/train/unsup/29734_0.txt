I stop here every time on my way back to Prescott. I had the blended Mocha and a Peach Blueberry Scone. Both were terrific! The espresso is really good and I've tried almost all of the scones wth the Berry Scone being my favorite, but all of them are wonderful. The two employees were very pleasant and wished me safe travels, super sweet.
