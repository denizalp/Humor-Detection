This is my Fav pizza to order. Sadly, very very very sadly, I can no longer order from them as I now reside in  Fabreville. \n\nI almost want to ask them to open near my house and make me partner. \n\nI'm picky when it comes to pizza because there are so many pizza joints out there. At mammas the pizza is outstanding, juicy, yes juicy and loaded with toppings that do not overwhelm you but blend in beautifully together to give you one of the top best pizza's out there. They are not shy with toppings and cheese and the sauce is just right and light , not tomato pastish ( yup, I invent words )\n\nThe service is quick and you really get what you pay for. I've tried the sub once and loved it. \n\nPlease !!!!!! Open in laval !!!!!!
