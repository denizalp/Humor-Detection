I just f-ing love this bar. The owners, the staff, the lack of judgement when I've had too many cocktails- it's one of my favorite spots in uptown. \n\nThere are drink specials every day. Music bingo on Tuesdays, Whiskey Wednesdays and karaoke, Thursday is mug night. Every month they do $4 you call it's on the 4th. \n\nTilt has both a front and back patio. The back area makes a great place for an event or to host a party. Electronic dart boards and golden tee in the main bar. There's also a dance floor type area. For the smoking crowd, there's a cigarette vending machine (you won't find a lot places uptown that sell cigarettes). An ATM is located conveniently next door. \n\nA lot of longtime staff members here. You'll find a wide mix of people drinking at the bar (hotel guests from across the street, service industry folks, suits grabbing after work drinks, celebrating, boozing). It's always a good time.
