Last minute to the airport and found this hole in the wall.   It is eye rolling good!!!  I am extremely impress with the Miso Pork Belly Burger and the truffle nuggets.  The location and deco isn't the best, however we are here for the taste and they well deserve 5 stars!   \n\nThe patty, pork belly, sauce are well balanced!  Along with the truffle nuggets.  Yum yum!   If you are in Vegas.  Must try!  :)
