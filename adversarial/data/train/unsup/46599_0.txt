I don't come here too often but each time I do I leave here happy. I've come a few times for birthdays and I enjoy the atmosphere and service. I can't remember exactly what I had the last time I went, but not only is their sushi delicious, soft, fresh and all of that good stuff but I had a meat plate that was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I would not only go back for sushi for that steak as well! (If i rememeber what it was)
