I was 7 and you were in your prime Circles. It was magical. I was just starting to appreciate jazz around that age. And I would get lost in your plentiful rows, filled with the latest and greatest. Back in the day, you were the music business in the Phx, in my opinion.\n\nUnfortunately, time has been very rough on the both of us. You don't look as good as you use to. Have the stock that you use to, You're just barely keeping a float, like just about everyone else in this economy. \n\nNo its not Rasputin-sque anymore, but thats where you people get it all wrong, judging and comparing stuff. I will admit I have done the same, but remember to  let things speak for themselves and not be compared 90% of the time! I think Circles may be ready for a comeback. Just you wait and see.
