Really did not enjoy this. Terrifying!\n\nThe owner was nice , hence the two stars, but I just really didn't like this at all. Definitely not light hearted fun in any way. Also it's reeeeeeaaaaallllyyy long. Like 90 mins long. \n\nI thought this was going to be more paintball focused, shooting some moving targets. In actuality it's more of a haunted house.  I Scraped both knees, an elbow, broke my sunglasses while my hat, shoes and shorts are covered in dirt. We spent long periods of time Locked in small spaces with zombies growling and banging the walls. Definitely wouldn't suggest for children unless they are completely desensitized to things of this nature. I'd never return and would never suggest this to anyone unless I really didn't like them very much.
