Okay, upon my return to Calgary (and Yelp) I actually moved within spitting distance of this diner and so despite my dislike of it have been coerced into going on a few occasions but not again. The food has gone downhill even in recent months with eggshell being found in breakfast burritos, hair in huevos, and to add insult to injury they make you wait an appalling amount of time for this awful food. \n\nSkip Nellie's and go to Galaxy just a few blocks away, trust me you won't regret it.
