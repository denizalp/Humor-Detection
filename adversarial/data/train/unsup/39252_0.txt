I was always a best buy customer... until I found this store!\n\nThis place is much larger than a Best Buy and puts their name to the test... Fry's has the better buys.  They have everything from PCs\/Macs, televisions, video games, books, movies, games, washers, refrigerators, home\/car audio etc.\n\nThere are insane weakly deals and if you are looking to build a computer this is the spot!  There are a million employees here (mostly Asian, not that I care - maybe it's because I'm always in the computer section lol)  that will gladly help you find what you are looking for and usually are very knowledgeable in their respected departments.  \n\nThere are a ton of check out lines, and also a place to purchase food\/coffee and rest and eat in the middle of the store.  You can get lost in here for hours and save a lot of money if you are a bargain shopper!\n\nTown Square\/Las Vegas strip is also right next door!\n\n4\/5 stars for being the Wal-Mart of Best Buy and maintaining MOST it's quality!
