So I was around the Henderson area and I was starving! So I fired up my yelp and searched up food. It says lee sandwich was around the block and I said why not. So I got there. Place looks good. It's a mini version of the lees sandwich on spring mountain. I ordered no. 1 combination (my usual order) and large thai tea. I didn't like the drink. The texture was very thick and wasn't even cold enough. All that ice didn't do any good. As for my sandwich I thought yes! My sandwich. I'm hungry!!! I took a bite into it and it smelled and tasted expired. There was a certain meat in the sandwich that was expired. I gagged... Gross! Sucks I had to experience this. I like the one at spring mountain. I've never had an issue there. I'll just stick to that restaurant. Knock on wood!! That I don't ever experience this at the spring mountain location.
