great cocktails (cosmo martini) . great prices. ordered full rack ribs. loved it! wings are good too. everything we ordered as a group was not a disappointment . \nloranzo was our server and was excellent except for the fact he had TOO many tables by himself in the middle of the night but had a positive and fun attitude all night. \n\nwill have to say one of the best tasting margaritas i had. will def come back \n\n.
