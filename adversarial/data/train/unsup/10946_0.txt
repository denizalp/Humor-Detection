This isn't my kind of scene.  Super loud.  Lots of glitz and glamor.  Bling bling all over the place.  Not my style.\n\nBut I was there for a family birthday party.  This meant tasting menu for everyone.  Last minute they found out I was a pescetariann and made accommodation.  They were super knowledgeable about foods that contained meat and were awfully sweet.  The fish dishes were perfectly cooked.  Loads of flavor.\n\nGet take out from Tao.  Or go deaf and blind while dining.  (Re-reading my review I feel as if I'm clearly getting old or too mommy-ish).
