When finding myself in Happy Valley - Phoenix, AZ for business, I ended up staying at this Courtyard due to a recommendation from a colleague who lives in Phoenix.  I was pleasantly surprised that my room was updated, new and super clean.  As a Platinum Elite, I was awarded points as well as a gift from the front desk sundry area and service at check in was excellent.  But the most awesome experience was when I got down to the lobby bistro the next morning for breakfast right when they were closing.  Despite that, the lady working behind the counter was extremely understanding, took my order for a full breakfast, served it with a smile and assured me to take my time and to call her if anything else was needed.  Now that is superb service!  This Marriott Courtyard is also conveniently located near the new shopping complex in Happy Valley and extremely easy to get in and out of.  Parking is free and abundant which always adds to an easy stay.  Thank you Marriott Happy Valley for a lovely experience and raising the bar and level of the Courtyard hotels.
