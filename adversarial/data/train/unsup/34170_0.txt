Pricey, always paying extra for a drink, a lady informs me today it comes with a drink???? I inform her I always have to pay extra, \"$9.86 something should be added for that price\". I hand her my debit to pay, she puts it on the counter, numbers up. Respect that someone just handed you a card, so hand it back and place in their hands. So I then sign my copy and place it on the counter. Overall the service is long with people in line or no one at all in line, you get people behind the counter drinking drinks, on their cell phones, looking bored. Service needs to improve to balance out the pricess.....
