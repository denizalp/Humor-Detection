I was blown away by Cured & Whey!\n\nThe other reviews are on point.  One taste of the Truffle Honey Grilled Cheese will bring you back again.  The perfect balance of ingredients sent my taste buds soaring.  I really can't describe it so you'll just have to try it for yourself!  Aside from the sandwich, I was also sharing a personalized charcuterie board for 2 people.   The ability to choose which meats and cheeses you would like on your board was great.   The lady gave me great recommendations and samples of MY personal taste.  They slice it all fresh and tell you about each meat and cheese.  It was a breath of fresh air.  \n\nEvery single person here really goes above and beyond of what you'd normally come in contact with.  The owner came out to talk with us and tell us about his shop.  They have a passion for their food and it shines through with intensity.  I can't over indulge here all the time but I certainly look forward to visiting again soon!
