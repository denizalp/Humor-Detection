Date Night good eats! We found this gem researching Indian cuisine on Yelp and with a 4.5 star rating after 416 reviews we had to see if it lived up to the Yelpers' Hype!\n\nOnce you enter it is liked you are transported from the west side of Las Vegas to Mumbai. Lots of interesting decor and a full bar once you enter the restaurant. As I noticed on the wall from the Las Vegas Review Journal \"Curry Leaf's colorful atmosphere shows attention to detail...\" I truly concur.\n\nWe were quickly seated by a window and if the weather permitted, they have patio seating available. We looked over the drink menu and decided on the Mojito Mumtaj 4\/5, dangerous as it tastes mostly like fruit juice and The Himalayan 5\/5, very strong and served in a goblet. we started with some garlic naan bread and dipped in the sauces. For entree's we shared the madras paneer with veggies 4\/5, would get more spicy than medium next time and the vindaloo chicken spicy 5\/5, nice flavor and even better to clean up the last bit of sauce with another garlic naan bread ;-)\n\nFor dessert they had a Yelp check in offer for a free rice pudding dessert! Served nice and warm, you can't beat F-R-E-E! Overall a great date night meal and under $60 without gratuity. We will definitely be back to try other menu items. ~NAMASTE~
