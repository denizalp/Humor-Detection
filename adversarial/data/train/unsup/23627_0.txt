I got up and walked out.  Went to get a haircut on a Monday, EJ was not there.  The other two barbers must have dropped 5 F bombs while I was waiting for 10 minutes.  They also dropped many other profanities while they were discussing some stupid movie that they watched.  Also the move that was playing on the TV was crude and vulgar.  I have been a customer for over two years.  I will not go back.  The atmosphere has become disgusting and crude and vulgar.  Back to Cercones in Bloomfield, a real gentleman's barbershop.
