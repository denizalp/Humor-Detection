Welcome back FIasco!  You were definately missed every since the disaster with the fire and everything.  And congrats on the Best of Calgary award, it was well earned.\n\nAt their BoC party, I was introduced to their staff one on one, and how awesome was that?  You get to ask exactly what was their duties, but more importantly get to try out the fruits of their labour as it was literally made fresh sometime in the last 2-3 days (and sometimes the same day!).  The S'mores was sublime, the Pomegranite was great and I there were so many really wicked flavours that I just can't get enough of.\n\nAlso having met their creative lunatic in charge of new flavours (honestly, who thinks of Fried Chicken and Waffle gelato???), I got to be introduced to the methods and was amazed by the balance of actual fruit that's used in their many fruit flavoured gelatos and sorbettos.  Add the high fat content and how little air, and you have a high quality product that I'm absolutely enamored of.  \n\nNow, my only problem is to figure out how to eat the stuff regularly without going into a diabetic coma.  Something to work on!
