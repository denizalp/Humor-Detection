I'll start off with the good because there is only 1 bad thing about this place so I gave it a 4\/5. The food is always fresh and the quality is amazing especially for Mississauga. It's authentic and just delicious. Price is fair and understandable which makes it worth it. Location is convenient and the interior is like any Chinese restaurant. \n\nThe bad: we always go during dim sum and the people who push the carts especially the young men that work there are SO nice and patient and always provide really good service. Especially for a Chinese restaurant where service is shotty these young men really were good at costumer service. HOWEVER the women who take the orders for the table like drinks and stuff from the menu are actually terrible. There was this one with red lipstick she had the worst attitude I've ever had and threw around our food on the plates like they weren't even flat on the table because she would throw it and when we asked for water and hot sauce politely she was like can you be patient? She said that word for word. I can't even imagine why she would want to be a server with an attitude like that. We only gave a 7% tip because of this and she complained loudly to the cashier lady in front of us. Honestly disgusting. The boss of this place is always nice and professional but this lady turned us off the whole experience.
