The cupcakes are good, but not the best.. I might have some high standard because I've tried Molly's in Chicago, and Sprinkles in Dallas.. But Cream and Flutter definitely has good cup cakes along with GREAT coffee. \n\nThe pour over coffee it what will Brian me back to this place, it perfectly compliments the sweet cupcakes.
