LOVE LOVE LOVE!! The managers\/owners here are literally the sweetest people ever! I remember when they first open I would see them behind the counters a lot, but not much since then this place got pretty popular(I mean how could it not). They would always greet you with a smile every time you walk in & greet you when you walk out! I would literally come here every weekend for their refreshing drinks or boba, but they added A LOTTA things to their menu since. I always have such a struggle choosing what I want from their menu because there's too much!! (Annnd all they're missing is a rose milk tea *hint *hint (; LOL) I recommend trying their passion fruit tea, omg it's literally so friggin refreshing and good. & ITS SO PRETTY! The decor is also so lovely, it's a really cute hangout spot so bring your friends!!
