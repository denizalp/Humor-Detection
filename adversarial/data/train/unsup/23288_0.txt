RPP is small has everything you could want in a park. There is the playground, a large field, a small water park and a fitness area.\nLocated around park are three covered picnic tables with BBQ grills. As I type this (on my phone) the park is fairly quiet with only one family playing but the sounds of automobiles on nearby streets is plentiful. The F-22 Raptor monument hence the park's name sake I take it, is a great addition.
