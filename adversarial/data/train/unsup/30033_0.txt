We were really hungry, so that might have added to the stars as well; but honestly speaking, a truly Somalian restaurant that reminded me of my childhood Somalian friend's mother's cooking. The staff was really courteous, I might add that one of the cleaning boys was clicking the plate a bit too much while cleaning, but he did apologize for it, and I think the overall ambiance of the restaurant overcame it. We ordered the family platter with goat, beef kebabs and rice and spaghetti. The food really was to die for.
