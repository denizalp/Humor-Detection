As can be expected with this chain, the portions are out of control, just plate fully of food. I tried the new salted caramel and banana cream pancakes. Fluffy and huge, also comes with bacon or sausage, eggs, and hash potatoes. I shared the eggs with my wife and could not even come close to finishing the potatoes. \n\nThe service was pretty quick, coffee cups were constantly being refilled, very friendly wait staff. Plus we had the added bonus of waking up early enough to beat the Saturday morning crowd. As we were leaving the place was packed. \n\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but I wish they would make the portions a little smaller, with a price to reflect that of course. If I can't empty this plate, I can't imagine too many people could either. \n\nWe were pleased, and will be back again, should we be up early to beat the crowds again. I wouldn't want to wait in a line up here as it's not one of their bigger locations, and can fill up pretty quick.
