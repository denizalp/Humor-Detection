I know JUST what you're thinking!\n\nYou: \"Is this not Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise Casino and Hotel from the alternate 1985 timeline featured in the hit film Back to the Future 2?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes! Good eye!\"\n\nThis once classy, then shabby, then decently renovated hotel served as the exterior for that wonderful movie, which makes it the perfect destination for both film fanatics AND fans of hypothetical alternate-dystopian-timelines set in the 1980's.\n\nThey say that some nights, when the wind blows just the right way, you can almost hear the actor who played Biff asking you for change from the shadows. That's no illusion! Actor Tom Wilson can often be found lurking just outside the casino.
