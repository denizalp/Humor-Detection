This place is your standard American diner with decent food at a decent price. It has the feel of a nursing-home cafeteria, just because of the majority of the clientele in that area. My biggest downside as a vegetarian is that I have literally two menu options: spaghetti (not the meat sauce please, and no meatballs), or standard breakfast-fare (eggs, pancakes, can I switch the bacon for a different side). My fiance enjoys their burgers and other meat-dishes. Overall, we come here if we're too lazy to cook and the pizza shops aren't open yet. Note that they close ridiculously early (like 6 or 7pm), so even though they \"serve dinner,\" it's more intended for your grandparents who dine at 4pm so they can hit the hay by 7.
