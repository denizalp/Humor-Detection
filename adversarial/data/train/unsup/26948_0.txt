I will defiantly be going back to watch more performances by the orchestra. I went to Ultimate Country legends a week ago and it was fantastic. The orchestra was excellent, back up singers were great and an outstanding job by the guest singers Patrick and Rachel. (Sorry if i misspelled your names!) Best thing I have been out to do in a long time. Excellent, five stars everyone!
