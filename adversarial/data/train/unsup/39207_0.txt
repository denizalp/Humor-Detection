I saw some frames I liked online but they were only available in store and I wanted to try them on. I went into the store and I was helped by a wonderful sales associate who picked out a bunch of glasses for me to try. In the end I still liked the original frames I came in for but I wasn't completely sure. The sales associate told me that I could take some pictures of them on me and she even offered to take the pictures for me. Then she told me I should go home and think about it because I should be sure before spending that amount of money on them. She never once pressured me into buying anything which was great! I went home and thought about it and decided to get the frames.
