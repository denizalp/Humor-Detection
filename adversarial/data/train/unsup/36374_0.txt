Spicy beef was great.  True Szechuan peppers make it a mouth tingling sensation.  Beef pies were really good.  As everyone else says, soup dumpling arent as good as \"the place whose name can't be said\"  but I don't love soup dumplings so it not a real issue.  My better half lives soup dumplings and these are good on days we don't want to drive back to SoCal.
