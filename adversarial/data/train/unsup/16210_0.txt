Ordered some food tonight for pick up and was not impressed. I decided to call my order in so it would be ready when i got there. Although the guy who took my order was nice, I had to repeat my order twice and had to correct him when he read it back to me and was missing an item. Of course when I got there it was still wrong. I ordered 3 gyro sandwiches, 1 gyro platter, large order of platos potatoes (seasoned fries)  and some cheesecake. I received only 3 gyros so I was missing one. This was what I kept telling the guy over the phone that I wanted 3 gyros PLUS the platter but he still didn't get it. Oh well he didn't charge me for it and I didn't want to wait longer for them to make it so I just left with what I had.\n\nThe gyro was gross the meat was cold, very dry and flavorless. We asked for the cucumber sauce on the side and it came in 1oz cups. Same with the hummus that comes w\/ the platter and the sauce that comes with the large order of fries. Reallly 1oz??? It makes me angry to pay 8.00 for a sandwich and get a little cup of sauce. Gyro time is way better for gyros if that's what your looking for do not waste your time here! I did enjoy the aphrodite cheesecake which is why the 1 star but everything else from the food to the service was crappy.
