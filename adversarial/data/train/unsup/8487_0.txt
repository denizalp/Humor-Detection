OK I'm updating this review because we recently did a fantasy football draft here in the upstairs room (didn't know it existed...great for large groups) and everything was excellent. \n\nThe service was great, they had about 4 pitchers of ice cold water and glasses set up, and drink orders were taken quickly and returned quickly. Drinks were nice and strong too! Food was delicious, everyone enjoyed their meal. I had a pulled pork sandwich and a green side salad. Really good! Lots of positives from our group on their meals.\n\nDownstairs the bartenders were very welcoming and always asked how you were doing. This is a great sports bar with lots of tv's for viewing. You could even watch a few tv's from upstairs. Wifi was fast and free. Not much else to say other than its clean, its comfortable, and service and food were outstanding. I just wish it wasn't so far from my house.\n\nThanks everyone...will be back as often as I can!
