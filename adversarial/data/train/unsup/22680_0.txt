I waited out all the hype surrounding the grand opening and finally checked it out some ten months late. It was still open at 11 p.m. which is rare for anything popular in this sleepy town. It was pretty busy and people were eating at the benches in the front. We ordered two grilled cheese, fries, mozz sticks and a plain and cherry limeade(which i guess is their signature drink). The menu is different from traditional fast food and is more like Steak n Shake. They have dogs, chili fries, and frozen drinks to add to the usual burgers, etc.\n\nThe grilled cheese was fluffy, not flat or greasy like Denny's makes it. I like flat and greasy, just look at my old girlfriends. The fries were bland but limp. I like limp, which McDonald's seems to have forgotten how to make. The mozz sticks were tasty and at $3 an order, about half what they would cost at a bar. The limeades were refreshing, but not something i would call my signature drink. Admittedly, i couldn't appreciate the whole experience without getting a dog or a burger, so some might like the food more than i.\n\nService was fast and on roller skates(in case you really need that kind of pitiful novelty during your meal). The location at Snow and Broadview is central to a lot of suburbia, but there is nothing else to do around there.\nSo for a summer treat, crank 96.5 in your car while you eat some fries and consult the GPS on how to get the hell out of Parma.
