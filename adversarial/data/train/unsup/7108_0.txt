I've been to Aldi's all over the world.  I lived on Aldi in college, visited them in Austria, and still go weekly.  This is the Aldi closest to me at this point.  This one is smaller than most and more crowded.  They run out of things all of the time, and the selection is much more limited.  As much as it annoys me, you just can't beat the prices!\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n-The fruit and vegetables here get beaten up a lot.  Blueberries that get opened and are smothered in mold?  Grapes that are wrinkly?  Yeah.  Not good.  But more resilient fruits usually work out!\n\n-Bring a quarter and your own grocery bags!  You'll need a quarter for your cart, and you don't want to have to pay for bags!  If you do forget bags, just grab empty boxes that are in the store.  You can fill them and take them to the car.\n\n-The frozen food is priced really well and is good!\n\n-There is a lot of product turnover.  They don't always carry the same things.  Plus, sometimes products will be labeled the same but suddenly change.  Like, the green beans look the same but don't taste the same.\n\n-They have the cheapest eggs always.  It's between $.50 and $1.00 for eggs usually. SCORE.
