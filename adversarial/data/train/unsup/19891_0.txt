I really wanted Gordon to be here, yelling in some corner about how the Beef Wellington was way overcooked. Or undercooked. There was, however, no Beef Wellington on the menu and no Gordon Ramsay to be found.\n\nSpeaking of Hell's Kitchen themes that carry on from season to season without fair, there was definitely a direct, not so subtle \"fire theme\" a la HK that I thought was really cool. This made the \"must\" list that we made before coming to Vegas, half for the food, half solely because I'm a GR and a HK fan.\n\nAs expected, the food was great. We came in for a late lunch, and even around 3pm, the place was pretty crowded. We both ordered burgers (of course) on the recommendation of the waiter. Both were good, but the Hell's Kitchen burger was definitely the favorite. Tip: Get pickles, then get extra pickles. They are amazing.\n\nWe also split a caesar salad, which was inordinately fantastic. Maybe we were hungry, but it takes a pretty nice seat in my top 10 caesar salad list.\n\nSpeaking of seats - the chairs. Chairs are chairs, but the specific ergonomics of the chairs here sat us up just straight enough to not have to lean to eat, but left us just relaxed enough to be comfortable. Chairs aren't usually part of a food review for me...but these were so noticeably perfect that they get their own paragraph.\n\nBurgers. Salad. Fire. Drinks. Chairs. Burgers.
