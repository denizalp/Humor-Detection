Gummies with alcohol. Cookies and cream chocolate covered caramel balls. Yeah!\n\nBut really expensive. Comparable in price to the new Sugarfina that opened up at the Nordstrom inside Eaton Centre. The small bag of caramels costs almost $9 after tax.\n\nIt makes a wonderful gift though. Also whenever you pass by the Bay, they usually have sample gummies out front (often their alcohol infused Rose or the sour Heart) so you can taste it. Great service because they will let you try all the ones they have available (except for the chocolate caramels which is a shame) when deciding which ones to buy.\n\nWouldn't buy it for myself often. I eat an insanely amount of sweets, both low and high end, for the price to be justified for a small bag. Good for occasions when you want to buy someone a nice pick-me-up.\n\nThey had some interesting cakes made with gummies on display and I always wonder how they taste while walking past drooling uncontrollably.
