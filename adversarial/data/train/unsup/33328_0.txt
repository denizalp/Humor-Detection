Amazing service, polite and very customer oriented. I was blown away at how I was taken care of from the moment I walked up to the counter. Be patient, they get busy with online and phone orders but they will tell you this upfront. Ben (the owner) has great character and will make sure your time and money are well spent. The California burrito Al pastor was delicious. I cant wait to try the rest of the menu.
