If you want really good breakfast or brunch food this is definitely a hidden gem. You would never tell driving up to the front, but this place does it right. I believe Yoli does all of the cooking so when it gets busy, be prepared to be patient. They share an awesome courtyard with another new place called the Perch Brewery and they have a bunch of rescued exotic birds. Our daughters love to come to this place just to see the birds, but the real reason we keep going back is the food. The service is good as well, but don't forget you may have to wait for a table and then be patient for your food...it is well worth the wait!
