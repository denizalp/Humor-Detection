'Twas the night after Christmas and all through the joint,\nthe bartenders were shaking.  They did not dissappoint.\nFrom my shoes to the couture to the bling in my hair,\nyou could tell that St. Nicholas bestowed with some flair.\nCool cats and their kitties, their glasses did clink,\nas they tippled and toppled each fabulous drink.\nAnd baby in his zoot suit and I in my furs\nperused the drinks menu and started to purr.\nWhen we ordered the bartenders orchestrated clatter\nattending and perfecting each little matter.\nThe foam on the top of my Pisco Sour\ngave a luster and glow that lasted me hours.\nAnd what to his wondering eyes should appear?\nAn Aviation cocktail that was without peer.\nAnd that handsome ol' rascal, the savior of all of us--\nI knew in a minute -- that cat was Paulius.\nMore perfect than diamonds, the drinks, how they came.\nThe crowd was enraptured, and called them by name:\nBourbon Daisy, a Boxcar, a Lady in Red,\nAviation, Pisco Sour.  Daddy, it goes to your head.\nWe spoke not a word but went straight to our drinks,\nand sipped on perfection 'til it was time for our winks.\nSo slapping a tip on the side of the bar,\nwe hopped in our Duesenberg and drove pretty far.\nAnd we heard Paulius say as we drove out of sight,\n\"Come again, my friends.\" And we will-- tomorrow night!
