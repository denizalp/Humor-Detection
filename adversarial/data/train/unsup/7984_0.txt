I'm beginning to wonder if having meals delivered makes the food's quality degrade, particularly if the restaurant is more than a mile away from the customer's home, office, etc. This past Saturday, I awoke to find a flyer on our door for Southside's relatively new IVP Bar & Grill. IVP stands for Italian Village Pizza and is part of the ever-present local chain (there are 18 locations in the Pittsburgh area alone). Considering that we were feeling lethargic after a trying week and that the IVP in Pleasant Hills was where we lunched on our first date almost 3 years ago, Kay and I decided roll the 20 sided die anticipating a surefire nostalgia-tinted hit. \n\nA coupon in said pamphlet on a payday weekend caused us to over-order. We \"treated\" ourselves to a Bacon Cheeseburger with Onion Rings and French Fries, A medium pizza featuring the Kay Kombo, a dozen wings, and a whole Steak & Bacon Pizza. \n\nI enjoyed IVP's pie when I dined in one with Kay, but something was definitely lost in transit. The pizza itself was  gummy, plaster-flavored, and laden with a catsup-ish sauce that might as well have been invisible. \n\nThe burger was cooked into pure jejuneness. I suppose a \"nothing less than well-done\" policy must be enforced by IVP's headquarters. The french fries tasted like mashed potatoes encased in gelatin. \n\nThe wings were halfway acceptable as was the Zeppoli (fried dough). The hoagie smacked of Steakumms and frozen bacon strips, however. \n\nDelivery took close to an hour. Just as I was about to make a phone call to the parlor, a miniature beater pulled up onto our sidewalk. \n\nMethinks there's a few too many IVP's around. Bump this one off so that the others can breathe a bit easier. With so many other pizza purveyors dishing out superior pies in the neighborhood, it's not as if South Side needs IVP anyway. \n\nP.S. Hey, I still have about 4 cuts of pizza left if anyone wants to come over.\n\nI kid the freeloaders.
