So tonight was the first time trying to eat here. Trying being the key word. Got in line. Ordered 1 beef taco and one beef enchilada and sat down with our party. The guys in our party that came after us and ordered some time after us got their food before me. I saw at least 15 people get their food before my friend and myself (we ordered at the same time 2 different orders). So I went up and asked for a refund.  They looked at my recipe and said oh yours is coming up soon. So I said soon was 20 people ago. I want a refund.  well my friend was still waiting on his food, his order was before mine.... He waited another 3-4 minutes before his food came.
