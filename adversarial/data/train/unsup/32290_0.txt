Was not impressed with Integrative. Have been using a holistic vet in Prescott for acupuncture and I thought this might be an alternative. Love my regular vet but they don't do acupuncure. I called and made an appointment for an office visit. Just wanted him to check my dog and tell me their protocol. To me it looked like what every other veterinarian I had been to does...check body, joints, talk about arthritis.  Surprise...this ended up being a \"consultation\" and it cost $159!! Did not find him near as informed about foods and supplements as my previous veterinarians had been. Vet techs do teeth cleaning. Also not something I was thrilled with.  I have always worked with doctors who did this themselves.  Since he specializes in chiropractic, it seemed that's what he talked about.  He should be a chiropractor in another veterinary office and not present Integrative as a full service integrative clinic.
