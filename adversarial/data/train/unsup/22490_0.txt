I found a ROACH in the bathroom during my stay here for business. I could've called house keeping dept directly but wanted to let the front desk reps know about it. The girl who picked up my call and heard what I found said \"I will send someone over to your room, okay?\" I totally understand that it's not front desk reps' fault but the front desk is face of hotel and they should have a lot better attitude towards their guests especially when their guest found a dead COCKROACH. I used to live in Vegas and work in hospitality industry as well and this makes me more upset about the hotel and the front desk team. Not a single expression of apology wasn't shown to me about it. When I checked out, I got their supervisor's contact info, Dwight McIntyre, and email this person about my experience. Guess what? NO RESPONSE BACK. The supervisor should be the same type of person to the front desk rep I met. This clearly shows how low the quality of the hotel is and also the employees of this property. There is always a reason when it's cheaper. This 1 star is too much for them. Avoid from this hotel.
