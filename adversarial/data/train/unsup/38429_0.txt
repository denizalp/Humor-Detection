Melt, you were exciting and new.  I always made the drive to Lakewood for the great, big, messy sandwiches, fun and lively atmosphere, and RC Cola in glass bottles, which brought back happy memories of my grandparents house, where there was always a cold stash in the fridge.  I loved that this was the one and only location, which made the concept and experience feel unique.  I told all my friends and family Melt was worth the drive no matter where they lived.  Melt has gone from a lone, special place in the burbs, to a Cleveland version of every place that is not satisfied enough to stand on it's own.  When you keep expanding and can't be everywhere as your empire grows, the quality, experience, and food suffer.  The sandwiches seem smaller than I remember, the fries are just a mushy, clump of starch, and the slaw which I loved (I know some people hate the stuff, but each his own), and to my dismay, no more RC Cola!  Ah, I yearn for the good, old days...
