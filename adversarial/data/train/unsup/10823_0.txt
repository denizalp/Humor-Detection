This two star rating is based on the premise that this is a fried chicken joint, which despite the signage may not actually be the intent (details to follow). Off the bat, the half chicken (~$11) seemed pretty small...I polished it off and was still looking around for something to eat. \n\nThe chicken itself seemed not to be marinated in any noticeable way. The coating was very crunchy, but not seasoned at all. Unlike at Olive Chicken (another Korean fried chicken spot in town), a sprinkling of salt did not bring it to life.  Another subtle distinction is that the skin at Olive is crispy (a satisfyingly delicate hardness that yields once bitten), whereas at Wow it's just thoroughly crunchy (hard after each chew).  \n\nI had to douse the Wow chicken with Frank's Red Hot to make it becoming, and noticed that it remained pretty crunchy.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt here and assume the lack of seasoning and the crunchy coating are designed to accommodate pungent sauce (like chicken wings, or the elusive Nashville hot fried chicken). The chicken can be ordered tossed with a sweet, hot, or garlic ginger sauce, and I'm suggesting this is the way to go. Maybe they were inspired by Anju's much fÃªted gojuchang wings? As I mentioned at the start, this is a two-star fried chicken place, but may be a higher starred place if you go in expecting and ordering wing style chicken.
