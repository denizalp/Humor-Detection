I've known about this place for a while (thanks to Yelp) but was apprehensive about going because of all the horrible haircuts I've had in the past. I'll usually get my mom to just trim my ends every once in a while to keep on top of the split ends but this time she went a little scissor-happy and I was left with a blunt cut that I wasn't happy with. (I know, I know, that's what I get for getting my mom to cut my hair...) \n\nI called Maya on a Monday afternoon and was able to book for a few hours later after I got off work. Didn't have to wait more than 2 minutes before I was whisked away to a chair and given a juice box. Too cute! (even though I didn't have enough time to drink it!) I showed my stylist (I have her name on a business card) a few pictures on my phone and she seemed to understand exactly what I wanted. My sense is that most of the stylists here are speaking english as their second language so I would totally recommend just showing them a few pictures. My stylist cut my hair DRY and did it in about 15 minutes... And you know what? It's probably the best haircut I've ever had. It's exactly what I wanted. \n\nThe only thing is that the place is a bit crammed; hair from the person beside me was blowing onto my face and onto my purse and jacket that was on the table in front of me...but at $30 I honestly don't care. This is officially my go-to hair cutting place from now on.
