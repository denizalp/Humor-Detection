Babbo's has turned into my wife's favorite local restaurant. She even has them cater in food at her place of business. The first time we went there we couldn't believe the buzz of activity near this restaurant on a Monday night. I said to myself, I didn't realize how many snowbirds live in the area. Then as we entered the restaurant it was packed and there was a twenty minute wait, WHAT? Are they giving stuff away? Our waiter clued us in that it's $5.99 pasta night. Okay, so they almost are giving away stuff for free.\n\nEverybody in the family loves the Spaghetti and Meatballs. Me, I have tried the Spaghetti and Meatballs, Chicken Parmesan and the Calzone. I thought the Spaghetti and Chicken Parmesan were good but the Calzone has excellent after I made some modifications to it.\n\nI order the create your own Calzone with three ingredients and ask for no ricotta cheese. This has turned an okay Calzone into a superstar. So this place is easy on the wallet and the service is usually fabulous.
