Went in at 11:15 on a Saturday morning  with the family after being turned away at Shuck's and Timbers because they are 21 and over. There were very few cars in the lot so we anticipated at least a quick seating. OG opens at 11:00, but we were told we would have to wait for a table to be set up. After an extended wait and watching several employees milling around with no sense of urgency and acknowledgement we were still waiting. We opted to dine elsewhere and walked out. In my book, it starts with the service. We got none.
