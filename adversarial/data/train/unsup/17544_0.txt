We searched long time for somebody who is Real Tax Pro. After first consultation, we knew Lizeth is the one and we stayed with her for years. She had to fix errors from previous tax accountant who did not do good job. She also helped us with complicated stock market taxes, corporate taxes etc. Lizeth saved us thousands of dollars. She has knownlegde that very few tax accountants have. Even dough we recently moved to California, we are definitely staying with her.
