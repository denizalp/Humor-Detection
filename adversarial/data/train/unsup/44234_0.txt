Recently visited this salon to get my nails done due to not being satisfied at my prior nail salon.\nI was greeted here in a very friendly manner and assisted right away!\nEveryone in the salon was very friendly, and I was in and out with getting my acrylic nails with gel done! They looked fantastic, and lasted a good two weeks before I needed them re-done!\nI highly recommend this place, and be sure to bring cash with you to tip the nail technician!
