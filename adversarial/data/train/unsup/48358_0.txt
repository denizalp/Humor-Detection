I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed both visits.  The staff has always been friendly, the food is really good with a decent variety of options.  Good drink selections and the prices are definitely fair.\n\nOur last visit one of my friends had the cheese cook out of her \"inside out\" burger.  She would have been happy with just a side of crumbles, but they quickly refired the whole patty.  They can be a tricky thing to pull off and my southwest burger had plenty of cheese to it, but it was nice they were able to correct a cooking mistake without any hassle.
