When I moved to Phoenix, I received a welcome package with various coupons and freebies and among them was a coupon for a free medium 1 topping pizza to this location. I finally got around to getting to this part of time and decided to give this spot a try. Not a big pizza fan, but who doesn't like free?\n\nLocated at the corner of 43rd and Cactus in a shopping center next to Fry's grocery store. This spot is a small location. So wouldn't recommend coming with a large group of people as they only have about 15 tables and booths.\n\nWhen you first come in, you put in your order and pay at the front before they bring out your food. Since I had the coupon for a free pizza, I let my guest get what they wanted, which was pepperoni. I'm not a fan of pepperoni so I just got me a single plain cheese slice along with a drink. \n\nFood came out within about 15 minutes and looked and smelled delicious!! The cheese pizza was amazing tasting. The cheese was fresh and they put plenty of cheese on their pizza. Even though I didn't have any of the pepperoni pizza, I was told that it was also very good. Crust is just the perfect thickness for me. Not too thin and not too thick. \n\nThe restaurant itself looked pretty clean. Tables that weren't being used, were wiped down and chairs put in place. Floor did need to be swept and the drink station filled. \n\nWould come back again, but probably not any time soon as they seemed a bit high in price for the quality of food that I got. \n\n4 star for food flavor, freshness and the speed of which it came out.\n4 star for customer service \n3 star for price of their food\n3 star for cleanliness
