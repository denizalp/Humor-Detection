It's fun, but it's a rip off. They nickel and dime it. The buffet is pretty good and there's a bar - YAY!- sign up for their e club and get some pretty good coupons. Be warned - you can't combine them!\n\nMy daughter always has fun here, so we will be back. There are tons of games, a few rides, bumper cars, mini golf and a tot lot that's gated. I like that she doesn't have to lug around tokens and can just swipe a card. So easy!
