I wanna live in this place that's how much I love it.  Best pho I've had...hands down.  If you've never tried Pho and you want to...then look no further, you've found the best pho in the Valley!  \nP2 and P3 are my favorite and their egg rolls are so fresh.  Please make sure you ask the server how to eat them...there's a trick and they'll show you!\nI love this place...I really do.  I eat here as often as possible.  I've been to 4 other pho places around the valley and none of them can even compare to Noodles Ranch.  Just wish you were open on Sundays. :(
