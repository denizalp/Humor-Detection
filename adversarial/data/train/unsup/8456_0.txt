Hopdoddys is by far my favorite place to get a burger. Although I live far from both locations, it's definitely worth a trip to get some great food. This location in particular has great interior and also located in an awesome location in Biltmore. I tried the Impossible Burger here and it was a surprise to find that it was nicely prepared. Everytime I've taken a new friend here, they are impressed! It never fails! I recommend getting parmesan garlic fries with a side of chili to dip. Overall, I've been to Hopdoddy countless times and I get the same excitement  ready to eat.
