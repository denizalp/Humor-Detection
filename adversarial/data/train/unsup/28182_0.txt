I really love this place! The restaurant is an old salt cellar hence the name and underground. It's a great date night or celebratory place to dine. Staff is always friendly and most importantly the seafood is always fresh! I have to admit I am a creature of habit at this place and always order the king crab legs-they crack them for you!!! It's the simple things in life:) Cell phones don't usually work either so it's a nice escape from listening to people have loud conversations while trying to eat a nice meal.
