I\"m giving this place 3 stars becasue my party should've been thrown out and the cops should've been called but no one seemed to care that there was a wrestling match going on in front of the bar. The shots were pricey and so were the beers, but I will say that the shots were NOT watered down.  If you are planning a night out where debauchery is bound to be found then is one of the places to head....
