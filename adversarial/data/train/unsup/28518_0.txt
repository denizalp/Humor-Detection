We ducked into Neo Coffee Bar by chance on a rainy Saturday morning when we needed a pit stop for the family after visiting the St. Lawrence Market, and we're so glad we did. The friendliness of the staff is backed up by the best London Fog we've had anywhere, and absolutely delicious Japanese roll cakes, which were so delicious: the polar opposite of the bland, forgettable versions too often found in Toronto. Good cookies, plenty of seating, clean and spacious washroom (behind a hidden door in the back wall) and a modern yet comfortable decor round out this great spot. We'll be back for sure!
