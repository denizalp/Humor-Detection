Updated review: We finally got our golf on last nite. The bay experience, golfing, having an area to yourself with music, TV and a server was very nice. Our server was tremendous...very efficient and tentative. The grilled wings were delicious! Definitely a must try menu item. We had a good time. It's a pricey place after golfing, eating and drinking, but worth a visit. The restaurant inside still needs some work with the servers and their attentiveness, but we had a fun date nite! \n-------------------------------\nWe were excited to check out the newest craze in Pittsburgh. After both my BF and I read up on the website about Top Golf, we figured a rainy week night was a good time to go. We did not make an online reservation since the website says \"walk ins are welcome.\" We proceeded to get there about 8pm on a Wednesday night. The wait to golf was 3 hours; that just seemed ridiculous. I thought they had a large number of bays to accommodate people. We decided to stay and check out the bar\/restaurant since we were already there. It's a seat yourself restaurant which was fine. However, it took us having to grab a waitress' attention (there were many of them around and not a lot of tables full in the restaurant mind you) to finally get one to come over. She was nice but was uneducated about the menu, how to work their handheld computers and distracted us from ordering and adding onto our orders. Our drinks took an incredibly long time and again, it wasn't crowded. The food was good, but nothing spectacular and the portions are incredibly tiny and pricey. The side salad was literally 4 bites and an up-charge. Wow. We decided to give it another try next week and made an online reservation to actually golf. I'll update my review to see if the experience improves with the wait staff and golfing.
