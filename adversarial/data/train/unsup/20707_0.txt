I wanted to check out the place. Nethless to say I am not from Guam, but I lived there so I thought I see how the food at this place will be in comparison to what I ate on the island. Well, first time I went there the people who serve us were not very friendly but the food was cool. I decided to give it another try since I wanted to try other stuff. I figure I am bringing business to them so they should try to appreciate it. Well, this will by my second visit and will be my LAST one,too. Again the service sucks. People are not friendly  .The food was too salty. I ordered the whole main entr√©e that was like $13.00+. I threw the food away because it taste horrible. I only enjoyed the extra side dish of cucumber and daigo  pickles that was $2.50 extra. That wasn't salty. It was not a good experience again. I will NEVER recommend this place to any friends or family.
