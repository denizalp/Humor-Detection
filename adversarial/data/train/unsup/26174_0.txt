If it's one thing that I miss most about Hawaii, it's their food, anyone from Hawaii would know exactly what I'm talking about. Island Style brings a piece of home to you through their food and ambiance.  I ordered their spicy pork & squid mix which was full of flavor and and cooked perfectly, served on a sizzling platter. I love their banchan as well, it's simple but a perfect pair to go with your meal. We had great service from Russel, and we'll definitely be back to try other items on their menu.
