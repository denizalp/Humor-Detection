Things I love:\n\nClose to my house.\nNot at a mall.\nComfy seats.\n\nThings I don't love so much:\n\nI need a booster seat for most of the seats.  Seriously.  Even when no one is in front of me, the back of the seat is in my view.\n\nIt's sometimes difficult to see a movie that is NOT 3D, D-BOX, or Star Class.  I was forced to see Pirates (which I was not happy about seeing to begin with) in either 3D or Star Class...both with an upcharge.\n\nAnd the number one reason I can't give UltraStar the 4th star?\n\nSpecialty popcorns are available only in the 55-gallon drums.  Why?  They're not even made there, but scooped from a 110-gallon drum from underneath the counter.  So why can't they scoop it in a bag instead of the drum?  Am I complaining because of the cost?  No, at $7, it's only 50 cents more than their outrageous pricing of a smaller size anyway.  Is it because I can't eat the contents of the drum?  That's a stupid question.  The problem is I WILL eat the contents of the drum, which means I can't order it.  Fix that and I'll be a fan.
