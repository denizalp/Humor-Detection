Our room (suite) was AMAZING.  Bathtub AND shower.  Huge king size bed.  Blackout shades that open and close with the touch of a button.  Three flat screen TVs.  Nice couch.  Desk with fax\/workstation.  Great smelling bubble bath\/shower gel.  Made us feel like real ballers.\n\nTwo nice touches would be bottled free water (there wasn't any) and free internet.  i mean, the room was relatively expensive, for Vegas.
