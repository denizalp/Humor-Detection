Went here on a bachelor party and the staff were very accommodating for our large group of 11. We spent $340 on drinks which included a bottle of captain morgans for\n$175. The waitress told us that it was the most cost effective option and pushed us to do it instead of getting singular drinks. It was a good idea that.\nTHE BOTTLE WAS WATERED DOWN. A few of us were sober as we drove the group in and we all had a swig from the bottle. No way was it full strength. Drinking captain morgans straight is like a kick in the face. I could drink that whole bottle like it was flat coke.  For making another $10 profit they made sure that all 11 of us would never come back.\n\nThe girls are good and what you'd expect, but avoid the bottle service. Beer and drinks from the bar are fine.
