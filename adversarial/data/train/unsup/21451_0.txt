On the right track....\n\nAre you new to Charlotte? Maybe you are from the Buffalo, NY area or just a Michigan grad a little home sick for the M Go Blue. Well Tavern on the Tracks has got your back. This bar is kind of a home away from home for the aforementioned areas. I really dig the decor of this place. It really screams: Look at me I am a great old school bar. \n\nI stopped by to watch the NBA Finals game seven between the Lakers\/Celtics. Just moving from Boston, I was rooting for the old home team. It was not meant to be as Lakers lead by their lead punk Kobe took out the Celtics as payback. This was a great spot to catch the game. The beers where cold and the food was pretty good. I really wanted the wings, which looked awesome, but decided to try the Steak in the Grass sandwich, basically steak with melted cheese and spinach on top. It was might tasty. The staff was top notch.\n\nSo if you are in the mood to catch the big game or cold one jump on the train and check out TT!
