This is a tiny place that does an excellent job with Pizza.  The owner is friendly and involved with greeting and making sure that you are enjoying your meal and your time in the restaurant.  My wife split the roasted vegetables and a Caesar salad.  The vegetables were terrific, the salad was the only miss of the night.  We were expecting more and will skip it next time.  There will definitely be a next time as the pizza was terrific, great crust and flavorful.  Near Scottsdale Rd and Shea, find your way to this place.
