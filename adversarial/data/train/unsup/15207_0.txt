Food was great - service was thoughtful and prompt.  Probably won't get the pizza again but the mussel special was so very tasty.  The other dishes brought out to neighboring tables looked really good.  Don't hesitate to go...\n\nIt's just a shame that they had to resort to getting publicity through the fake 'reality' show called Undercover Diners.  So fake - it was horrible acting.  They are better than that....
