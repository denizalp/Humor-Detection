A good example of a restaurant that has so much potential, so many positives that it should have no problem sitting comfortably at 5 stars ...but, apparently the whole place, from management to staff, doesn't care one lick what you think about their place.\n\nThe food is great - five star for sure - but sloppily prepared, way overpriced and presented with an air of arrogance and intimidation.  As if the whole place was saying \" Don't you know who we are, were Capo's you ungrateful little punk. Now, sit down, shut up and eat your dinner or we're gonna come over here and make you.\"\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to get ready for some thick necked guys in really nice silk suits that are going to be paying me a visit real soon.
