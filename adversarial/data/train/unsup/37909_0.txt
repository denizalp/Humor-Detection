We were staying at the Riviera, so this place is basically the closest restaurant not in the Riviera food court. I had heard many things about the Peppermill - it was old, it was basically Denny's, you had to wait forever, etc. I still wanted to try it out, and I'm glad I did!\n\nIt is old. It's more of a relic of 80's Vegas. The Fireside Lounge is really cool, but very smoky. Not that great of ventilation. \n\nThe food was hit or miss, but the portions are so big you really don't care that much. Or you are probably drunk like most people in Vegas. Just make sure you get something you REALLY like because you are going to have a lot of it. Like, maybe the biggest portion of your life. Peppermill makes Chipotle look like a joke. \n\nI say come by if you are on that side of the strip. It's a fun place and your only meal of the day if you play it right! The only con is there is always a wait.
