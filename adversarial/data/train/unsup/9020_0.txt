This is a Sobeys \"Express\", which seems to mean that they threw the concept together really fast and hope you won't notice that it sucks. The location used to be an IGA, back when this small size was the norm for grocery stores. But those used to the selection at bigger Sobeys locations will be disappointed, although the prices are still inflated--especially considering the wealth of cheaper and more ethnically interesting groceries available all along this stretch of Roncesvalles.\n\nThe hours are also not as good as they could be. I don't understand why the huge Sobeys stores have to be open twenty-four hours out by the highway, but a neighbourhood branch isn't, because a place like this could compete successfully with the variety stores for the drunken, after-hours munchies crowd.
