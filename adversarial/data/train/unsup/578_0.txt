On 9\/16\/2014, a yelp user whose display name is \"Dennis T.\" commented on my reviews:\n\"Also, your claim that Allerton Charter Coach and Suburban Express are the same company has not basis in fact. Good work -- your entire review is entirely unsupported and incorrect.\"\nLet's see: http:\/\/www.allertoncharter.com\/\nUnsupported? Incorrect?\nAlso, on every Suburban Express coach or van, there are obvious letterings \"Operated by Allerton Charter Coach Inc Champaign IL 61825\", together with the vehicle's DOT number.\nI've never expect anyone to deny such an indisputable fact.\nWho is Dennis T.? I don't know. But I know Dennis Toeppen. Google him.\n\nAgain, whether you want to consider Suburban Express and Allerton Charter Coach to be one company or two, just like whether you want to consider SE Ltd. and SE Inc. to be one company or two, it won't change the fact that Suburban Express and Allerton Charter Coach have the same agent and the same president. Also, Suburban Express routes are ran with Allerton Charter Coach if not other chartered operators, and Allerton Charter Coach vehicles run Suburban Express's routes, when they are not chartered somewhere else.\n\nI totally agree with many others who think that Suburban Express's service itself may not be as bad, but how the company messes up with people is frustrating. Just like how the business owner argues with yelp reviewers is frustrating. Arguing with yelp reviewers simply can't raise your star. Instead, posting modest and sincere feedback just like the business owner of Peoria Charter Coach does keeps people happy and content. I can't understand why a successful entrepreneur with degrees from U of I, Northwestern and U of Chicago doesn't understand such a straightforward thing, just like I can't believe how can such an erudite person be arrested on counts of harassment. However it looks to me that he has never learned any lessons from all the drama, so I won't expect that my words make him change anyway.\n\nBack to topic, my experiences with Suburban Express in its (okay, Allerton Charter Coach's) vans and coaches are good, not decent but worth at least three or four stars. But every time when it came to Green River Lines the driver messed up with me for ridiculous reasons. Once the driver while driving commanded me impolitely to speak English because he \"thought\" I was cursing him in my native language. Is this Suburban Express's fault? Maybe not. I didn't expect to hear from Suburban Express's business owner, but if I have to, I hope it could be something like \"we will communicate with our partner and reassert our commitment to our passengers\", etc. Under no circumstance will I find a feedback full of aggressive and haughty remarks pleasing. Under no circumstance will I trust a company whose owner reacts to others' reviews in such an irrational manner.
