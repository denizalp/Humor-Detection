Stopped in Monday for dinner...read raves about the pizza...tried to order, but \"we're out of crust\" was the reply after hearing about what a slow day it's been...prep?\nOrdered Lobster Bisque...considering I like salty food...this was so over salted and broken to boot. Chef came by to see how things were, when told he replied \" it's the bottom of the batch and it concentrated being warmed all day\"...we'll that made me feel better.\nOffered special, sea bass. They didn't give me a price, but based on other menu items, figured it'd be reasonable, especially being a special.  Fish was good, not great. Best part was asparagus, but I only got 3 little stalks and one burnt little carrot...but a pile of greasy fettuccine.  Coffee sucked too.  Bottom line, $40 bill for a not good dinner...  Way overpriced for the quality, or lack there of.\nWas hoping for much better.
