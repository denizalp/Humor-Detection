It seems a little strange to review a pawn shop on Yelp but here you go.\n\nVegas Pawn is on the Tempe\/Scottsdale border right next door to Skin Cabaret. It's aptly named. Between the limos outside Skin and Vegas Pawn's sign it does look a little like Vegas.\n\nI went to Vegas Pawn for on other reason besides the fact that I had never visited a pawn shop before. And it was an interesting experience.\n\nHow do you judge one pawn shop from another? Inventory? Customer service? Good deals?\n\nMy first impression was security. These guys are serious! You have to be allowed to enter. The front door opens to a steel cage which the desk clerk has to buzz open before you enter the rest of the store.\n\nAnd this is understandable after seeing their inventory. This is a high-end pawn shop with a large selection of jewelry, watches (Rolex, Cartier), loose diamonds, gold, and more. They also buy and sell boats, ATVs, motorcycles...etc.\n\nI had no idea pawn shops kept that type of inventory. \n\nEveryone I met there was helpful and friendly. I don't necessarily see myself pawning anything in the near future but I'd go back to Vegas Pawn if I needed.
