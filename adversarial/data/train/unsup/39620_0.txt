They were contracted by my warranty company to repair my pool motor.\nPros- (only one) tech showed up on time Fri 9am\n\nCons- tech figured out the problem,  said he was going to the parts store to get a new motor, didn't hear from him  for 5 hours, so i called him at 3 to get an update on how he was doing,  he told me he had gone to another job and it took him longer than what he thought and now parts store was closed and he wouldn't be able to fix my motor until the following week? Wouldn't explain why he had gone to another job before completing mine.\nI called the office and try to get an explanation,  they finally said, they could get someone to stop by Saturday morning with a new motor and do the repair work.\nTech showed up Saturday morning,  and unloads the motor , it doesn't look brand new , i asked him , is it new and and he said no, it's rebuilt??? At this point, I just wanted to have my pool fixed as it was turning green, and said fine, let's just get it going, I called the office Tuesday morning.( Memorial Day) Some how they tried to make it as it was my fault that I got  rebuilt motor, not the new one that we agreed, \"I should have said something\",  i was told. I will forward my complaint to my warranty company not to ever send Aaron pools to do warranty work to my house
