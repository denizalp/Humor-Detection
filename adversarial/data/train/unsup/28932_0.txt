My good friends that live locally introduced me to Khoury's and I certainly wish there was one closer to my home.  This place is great.  You can take part of having beverages in the \"Bar\" section.  Brilliant!! They have an excellent selection of craft brew and a nice friendly staff.  There were groups enjoying drinks and playing games upon my visit.  Great place to shop, taste, and have a good time.  Check this place out if you are around- Cheers!
