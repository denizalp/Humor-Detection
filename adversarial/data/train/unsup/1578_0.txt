I really enjoy coming to LIGHT in Mandalay Bay! Everytime I come I can feel that AC! hahaha HATE when clubs are cheap and  do not turn the AC on. The stage where the Dj plays is awesome with the back drop of screens from the floor to the ceiling makes it a sight to see! They dont call this club LIGHT without the crazy light shows! haha \n\nIts two stories and the club is long (width) wise. The only thing I hate is that upon letting people in they will take you either upstairs or downstairs and block the opposite floor till it gets busier and than they will open all floors. So retarded! \n\nIts a fun club, a lot of good looking people and the long bars on both floors. One of my favorite clubs to go to in Vegas!
