Good lord this place is HUGE. It has so many of the Whole Foods staples along with some pretty rad fresh products around the store. Also... it has a bar and a few years back I did a yoga class in the back area. Yes, it's that big. Though Vegas has a few solid chains around the area (love me some Sprouts), this is the ultimate market for anything fresh or that falls in the latest health trend (turmeric everything). That being said, as we all know, you're paying a high price for all of the selection here, which sort of goes against what the locals love about Vegas. If you love the brand and have some cash to burn, get on over here and make sure you have the afternoon free bc you'll be spending a lot of time wandering the aisles. \n\nBonus: friendly employees!\nWarnings: the wait for a fresh juice\/smoothie is LONG (15 min for a smoothie)
