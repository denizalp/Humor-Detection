If you're coming here for customer service, you are in the wrong place, honey.  \n\nThat damn roast duck alone is worth my driving ...with a fever....in the rain....to get cash at the ATM (once I learned it was only cash only) 10 minutes down the road and back. \n\nI ordered the duck wonton soup to ease the fever I was hosting that day. And the BBQ pork and duck plate was for my boyfriend. \n\nThe soup was fairly salty, as all duck soups tend to be. Won ton was average. But, that crispy fatty duck was soooooooooooooo worth every every single non customer service stares I got that day. \n\nI absolutely loved it. \n\nThe BBQ pork was off the hook, too. \n\nMaybe it was the fact that I haven't had either dish since moving out of Hawaii but, boy oh boy...I'm glad I was sick and saw that on someone's IG feed. \n\nI went back the next day to have more duck. Did I mention I was eating alone? \nIt was that good, I couldn't wait till someone got off work to eat with me. SOLO-DOLO is fine with me when food is that yummy.
