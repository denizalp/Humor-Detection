I am a big noodle fan! As recommended, I ordered scallion pan cakes, Shang beef knife shaved noodles and pork belly knife shaved noodles from here!!! The taste absolutely blew my mind!!! The noodles were super flavorful! You could just taste the freshness and the quality!  This is going to be my go-to noodle place from now on!
