Right off the bat, their AYCE menu is lacking in variety. This is the first sushi restaurant I have been to that doesn't offer shrimp tempura or seaweed salad on their lunch AYCE menu. They also use way too much rice for their sushi rolls which creates an unpleasant, sticky and wet texture. Expect to be full after only 3 pieces.  The only thing I would recommend is the chicken udon noodles. It's a nice restaurant right on the danforth but as for the quality, I probably won't be coming back.
