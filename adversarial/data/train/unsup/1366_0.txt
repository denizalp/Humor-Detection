I find that shopping for furniture is almost like shopping for a car-look around, try it out, and purchase, maybe. Oh and don't forget the sales people! Sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. However, I have not experienced any of that here. \n\nI came here with my mom a few months back to look at furniture for my niece. While looking around we were approached one time bu Tony P. and he took us to the kiddie section,and said if we had any questions, to let him know. Ok. While looking, he come back to check on us and we said we were just looking, shopping around different options. He gave  us his business card, and we went about our way. \n\nFast forward to this weekend. We went back and couldn't remember his name, but had the business card! My mom asked one of the guys about him and out he came. Took down the information for the bed set, told us it's available and set up a delivery date. Tony was very helpful and knowledgeable. I can tell you while looking at different furniture stores, salespeople dismiss childrens bed thinking they don't need much, since they're only a child and grow out of it. The moment they say \"only for a child\" I dismiss them. Not the case here. Tony showed us the mattress that came with the set, but suggested an upgrade because she will want a more comfortable bed (plus it's a holiday weekend, so the mattresses were discounted). Boom! Yes, Tony! Yes, you're right and I'm listening. The whole process was so smooth. The manage that came out was very nice as well. And no pressure from either of them. \n\nThe furniture is of good quality. Which is why we returned. My niece will be getting a bed, vanity, dresser, stool, comforter, and a lamp all for less than 2k. Can't beat that! And we knew it was a sale and we weren't being cheated because we had been in before. Can't complain. Thanks, Tony!
