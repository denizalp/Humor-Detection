One of the best Chinese noodle houses I have found on the strip. I've been to Hong Kong and China over a dozen tines and I really think that Noodle Asia tastes very authentic. I love Chinese food.....real Chinese food...there is a big difference between Chinese food in China and what we get here unless you are Chinese and in the know of the secrect spots....which I am not. I love the noodle soup with bbq pork and duck! Service is not always prompt but the food makes up for it.  Whatever you do, do not eat at the Noodles in Mandalay.....that can scar you for life or at the least turn you off to chinese \/ Thai \/ east asian food.
