Went to check in at the reapid desk and Chris, an older woman, asked us, \"didn't you check the board\" and made it seem that we were bothering her... when I explained that one of the previous agents told us to come to the desk, she held up her hand and said ill wait till your done, go ahead and finish.  Customer service lacks!!!  She said they can't make mistakes that we did something to mess uo the past rentals.  ....  they have left off the insurance,  charged the wrong card and forgot the gps.  Its getting hard to like budget!
