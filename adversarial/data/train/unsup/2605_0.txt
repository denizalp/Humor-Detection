This place smells like homophobia and hot wings.  Within 5 minutes of entering the hardest rockin hotel in Vegas, I was mocked and called gay by a roving pack of meatheads.  Not sure if it was the pink shirt or my slim fit jeans that set them off, but I have to say it was a rough start to my stay here.  Other than that, things were awesome though!  I got checked into my room quickly, slammed a cold beer from the minifridge and ironed my shirt, eager for the night ahead.  My friends were playing a concert at the music venue inside the hotel, it's called the Joint.   The show went off without a hitch, everyone was in high spirits afterwards and we ended up taking a ton of shroom dust from some girls we met and hittin' the casino floor to try our chances with Lady Luck!  It was fun to see everyone's different gambling strategies.  Ryan fared the best with his \"max bet\" method, Psymun played slow and strategically, Jeremy had a a hunch about the Lil' Red Riding hood machine, while Justin donned his sunglasses and kept betting hard on his \"lucky number\" 22.   I think we all lost a ton of money except for Ryan that lucky bastard.  In any case, we eventually grew tired of losing, took some more shroom dust and went across the street to the stripclub Centerfolds , which at 5:30 am was blasting White Zombie and contained a sad and desperate lot of busted dancers. We didn't stay too long.   Sometimes you gotta know when to fold 'em lol.  As the sun came up and we shuffled back to our rooms at the Hard Rock I projectile vomited into the bushes in the front. \n\nAll in all, we had a rockin good time, and I would definitely pay this place another visit!  Just like Stevie Ray said \"When this house is a rockin, don't bother knockin, come on in!\"
