Spent a couple nights here and enjoyed my stay. Let me forewarn all you picky yelpers, THIS IS NOT THE ARIA OR BELLAGIO OR THE WYNN. With that being said, don't freak out about how \"outdated\" the rooms are or how some paint was peeling. You paid one of the lowest rates on the strip. That means you get what you pay for. And for that ~$27\/night, you got a great deal. Let's face it, nobody stays at hooters for the ambiance and decadence of the hotel. We stay so we can gamble what we saved on room rates, drink free drinks at the tables, and knock out a few wings. \n\nThe hotel is pretty centrally located. Simple walk to the MGM, Bellagio, Aria, and some other popular casino\/hotels. \n\nI must say, I expected for hooters girls to be around. There were only a handful of ladies in hooters attire working tables. Instead, there were uniformed men and women with 2...maybe 3 classic hooters girls dealing. With that being said, still a great place and if not, just take the short walk to another casino!
