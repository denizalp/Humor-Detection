Came here with my classmates during a break we had between our mental health meetings we had to attend. The place was pretty packed and if one of my friends weren't bossy or the other one didn't speak Chinese I feel like we would've been more ignored. But we were seated right away and at first the carts kept passing us by. We all were confused and kept saying hello we want some foods from there. Not until our friend spoke in Chinese did these ladies with the carts come by and were nice to us. \n\nThe food was good and cheaper than any other dim sum place I've ever been to in Vegas. We all paid $7 plus tip which wasn't too bad. \n\nWe were on a time crunch so we had to quickly get out of there but they didn't feel our urgency even as my friend got up several times to let them know we needed the check. \n\nI'm not sure I want to come here without someone who speaks Chinese in peak hour. Maybe one day I'll be brave and have my parents come try this place.
