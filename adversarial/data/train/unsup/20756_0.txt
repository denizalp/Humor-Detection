When I'm overwhelmed with goodness, I revert to making lists. As such, my list of the Cookbook Store, which I visited today to take part in their \"Haunted Happening\" Halloween party!\n\n- GIANT selection of cookbooks, literature on food, and wine & spirits\n- Wonderfully accommodating staff\n- Chairs to sit and read the plethora of books from which you have to choose\n- Awesome events (I just bought a ticket to the Thomas Keller event in November that comes with an autographed copy of his new book \"Ad Hoc at Home\")\n- They have a Facebook page, a blog that is kept current & a Twitter feed\n- Did I mention the huge selection of books? ;-)\n\nBottom line: if you ever need anything in the way of food\/cooking, go here.
