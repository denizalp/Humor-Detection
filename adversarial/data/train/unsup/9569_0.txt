Meh.\n\nI'm not a fan of BB&B in the first place but this one is the closest one to my house.\n\nI used to go to the Arroyo location and there was never customers in that store...this one...always packed.\n\nWhy do I go here?!?! Soda Stream tanks. Hubby likes to drink Pellegrino by the truck load so my friend posted on FB that she got a SS to make her fresh juice have a kick. Ok sold. \n\nLast year I bought the machine, four extra two Liter bottles, some Mango-Passion cane sugar syrup for fun and take the $200-300 purchase to the counter.\nFive!!!!! ladies behind the counter, nothing. No hello. They were talking about how nice the previous customer was blah blah about stocking etc.\n\nI go back today today...again four ladies behind the counter in the same discussion! Deja Vu. The cashier seriously tried to sell me back my three empty tanks. Duh. \n\nI will just have to put on my big girl panties and trade these three tank next time at freaking Walmart. Hopefully the three tanks will last me another year. Otherwise I will just start buying cases of Pelligrino again. Or maybe Amazon sells this crap. \n\nStop chatting and do your freaking job. Customers are the reason your standing there in the first place. Seems like 30-40 something women would get a clue.
