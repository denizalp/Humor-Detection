I am very skeptical person and kind of a parent that is overly concerned with my kids! When we first met with Sheri and Nikki I think i might have made them concerned that I was a helicopter parent! I really quizzed them and after the first month I have to be honest i was 100% happy with everything! My kids are the most important things in my life and I dont trust anyone. I am so thankful My wife found them!! My kids are so much more prepared for kindergarten because of line upon line!! I would recommend them to anyone!!
