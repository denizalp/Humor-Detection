This mall has had major renovations in the last few years, all kicked off with the new and improved food court.  Better lighting and food choices and seating.  It still gets packed but what can you do - it's a really popular mall.\n\nSlowly this mall is gaining more \"it\" stores - Sephora, David's Tea, Micheal Kors, Calvin Klein, Victoria's Secret (remember waaaay back in the day when you had to drive to Buffalo to get some VS stuff?!!), Vince Camuto....and the list goes on and on.  New sky lights let lots of light in so it doesn't feel dark and dingy as in the days gone by.  Plenty of parking and lots of restaurants border the mall (Jack Astors, Baton Rouge, Swiss Chalet, Moxies which is actually inside the mall).  There is also a Walmart here.  Pretty much a one stop shop.  Good selection of high and low end stores.  They just opened up an Apple accessories store (it's pretty big!).\n\nI always try to go on a weekday morning as it gets packed with teenagers once done school or early on the weekends.  The LRT runs right into the mall so it's TTC accessible.
