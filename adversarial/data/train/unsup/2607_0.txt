Try going for coffee downtown early on a Sunday morning.  Place after place is closed because downtown isn't actually the place to be in Calgary on a Sunday morning.  Except Caffe Artigiano.  Not only is it one of a few places to go, but it's also a good place to go. \n\nPlenty of seating, friendly staff, yummy lattes and tasty treats, Caffe Artigiano offered an excellent place to sit down and catch up with friends.  \n\nA thanks to Geoff B's note that the entrance faces onto 3rd Street.  I might've had a bit of trouble spotting it otherwise.
