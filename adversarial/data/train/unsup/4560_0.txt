True story: I took the incline every day for school downtown. One day I had my headphones on and was in my zone (probably Britney Spears The Zone) and some guy taped me on the shoulder. He asked me how much fare was. I asked him if he needed one way or a transfer back down. He seriously looked at me and said, \"Why would you need a one way ticket?\" I was dumbfounded by this question. I said, with a pause \"...because people live up here...\" I don't know if he thought maybe the houses were fake and just for fun or what. \n\nMoving on. The Mon Incline is probably the busiest of the two inclines in Mt. Washington. It's because it's right by the main part of Station Square, another very touristy destination. There's pro's and con's to taking this incline. I would definitely say more pro's because again, it's right next to Station Square, it's lets you off right by the main street, Shiloh Ave., in Mt. W. and of course has the fantastic views at the top! the con's are that it can get VERY busy and backed up during the summer nights or if there's a major event going on in the city (Fourth of July, Steelers Games, New Years Eve, etc.). \n\nAs I've stated before, it's also part of Pittsburgh's public transit system so if you're visiting from out of town, you may see some grumpy people heading home from work. I also had to point out to a confused tourist that a radio tower she had pointed out to her family was in fact NOT the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh. If you're a history buff or looking for more information on the inclines I would head to the Duquesne Incline, which is on the west side of the mountain. Overall this one is the most convenient!
