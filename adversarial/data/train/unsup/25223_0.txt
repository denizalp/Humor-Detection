I am still in shock at the gouging I received for an oil change and tire rotation. I was overdue for the oil and couldn't find anyone to take me for 2 more weeks so I went to the only place that was open on Sunday. $120 for this service? Thank God I had a $20 coupon! I have never been charged for a tire rotation with an oil change. And I have never paid over $50 for both oil change and tire rotation and this includes the oil filter. That is what I paid my previous change\/rotation, and yes, for synthetic oil. The tire rotation wasn't even done on a lift. I don't even know if they really rotated the tires because they pulled my car up the side of their building and I walked outside and saw my car on a car jack with one tire off. For all I know they just put that tire right back on cause I didn't hear the drill for that long. And the one guy brings my air filter in to show it to who I guess was the manager, to see if it needed to be changed. My husband just replaced it 2 weeks prior and it was brand new. Stevie Wonder could have seen it didn't need to be replaced. I guarantee you at this price and under knowledgeable staff I will never go to Jiffy Lube again! I have been totally ripped off!
