I booked my room through Orbitz a few weeks ago and got a killer deal for two weekend nights.  I've been here before and didn't expect royal treatment or perfumed hallways.\n\nThe customer service has dramatically improved since my visit last year.  The check in was smooth, fast, and hotel staff have been extremely courteous and swift in responding to my needs, whether it be requesting shampoo, towels, extra blankets, etc.\n\nMy room is old, reeking, has dirty carpets, but you get what you pay for, right?  No view, and I mean, no view.  My biggest complaint is a used soap left in the package that had a long strand of hair wrapped around it.  When I opened the package to wash myself, I freaked out.\n\nThree starts overall for good customer service.
