Is this the future of McDonald's?? I hope so. \n\nWhen you enter you will do a double take...  Tasteful seating in inviting colors (purple!!)?  Amazing decor in the dining area? An upscale lounge area with a chandelier?  Fresh (yes, fresh) flowers at every table? Elegant outdoor seating patio?  Yes, this is a McDonald's!  \n\nDid I mention the fresh flower bouquet at the drink station area as well?  \n\nThis location earns an extra star for the incredible quality of the interior. It's something I've never seen at any other McDonald's. The staff were also actually friendly and helpful as well and seemed to all have genuine smiles.  Maybe working it such a beautiful environment helps. \n\nThe food was standard McDonald's. It was served hot and tasted fairly fresh. The WiFi was free and was working.  The restrooms were not quite up to the standards of their dining room but were acceptable. \n\nWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but hopefully this design does not stay in Vegas and instead spreads rapidly!
