there are scarier circle k's, but this one is up there. the gas is usually more expensive than other places because it's right off the 10 (the parking is horrible, too), and the odds are 2:1 that you will be asked for money by a homeless dude or crack addict. i've also been offered a tv for $10 before. so that was pretty weird.\n\nalso there is a creepy dungeons-and-dragony\/world-of-warcraft type dude that always hangs out and sits on the counter late at night. it's pretty obvious that he thinks he is super cool because of it. he kind of reminds me of the comic book guy from the simpsons except like 10 times more douchey.\n\nthe short little security guy always talks really loud whenever people are inside so that they think he's cool and telling jokes (he's not, and he's not).
