I feel bad for the single employee I usually find there. They seem to be undertrained and ill-equipped to give good service. Wait times are painfully slow. I was recently turned away because the employee did not know how to sell me a gift card.  I complained to corporate recently. And did not get a response. I've decided that I won't be returning to any tropical smoothies. The other locations I've been to aren't much better. It's a shame. It's a great, convenient location, with a drive-through. The place could be packed.
