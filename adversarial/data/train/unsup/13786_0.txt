I always thought nice steakhouses were for rich people to blow money and that it was a ripoff. A way for the wealthy to puff out their chests and be seen. I did not think there could be much variance in cooking a piece of cow on a grill coated in salt and pepper. My feelings have changed since last night. I had the strip. I am used to getting a strip at a strip joint which makes it a double strip. Usually along the row of strip joints in the flats so it is a strip at a strip on a strip. A triple strip. The aged meat last night had the taste of good beef with a perfect crunchy crust that locked in all of the flavors. The meat did not come out leaking blood, juice and life force of the fallen cow. It was concealed inside this crust. Similar to my crusty self. I am actually a really good dude on the inside. I just look like a crusty schmuck. Now what's beef?
