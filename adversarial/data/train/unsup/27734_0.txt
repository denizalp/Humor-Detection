With all the great reviews we decided to try this place.   Wasn't happy, of course were used to Texas Mexican food.   The refried beans taste funny to us.  The tacos weren't anything to writ about.  I guess a lot of NC's love this place,  but we won't be back. \nWe r too spoiled with our Mexican restaurants in Texas.
