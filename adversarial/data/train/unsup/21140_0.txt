Food is basic canes always what you expect so it's good but the thing that got me is how shady the employees are at this location. They have promo tickets on the drink and the 2 drinks I ordered have already been peeled half way to see the prizes. I've never seen this level of scumbaggery from a fast food joint before. Tip to the management get it together! If something as simple as this goes bad I wonder what the hell else could be going on. Sadly I won't be returning to this location. Your staff is quite shady!
