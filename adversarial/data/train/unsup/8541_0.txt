Worst L & L experience ever!  I've been to numerous L & L's and generally the service is pretty good, just not at this location.  Ordered a bbq mix over the phone and when I went to pick up my order, found out that they had screwed up my order and made a bbq chicken plate instead.  No big deal, I figured they would make now make my correct order, WRONG.  Was told that they were closing and they couldn't prepare my order.  They close at 9 pm I was there at 8:38 pm! I then asked if they could comp me a beverage at least since they screwed up my order and was willing to pay for the bbq chicken anyways.  NOPE, cashier refused to comp me a drink even though he screwed up my order and refused to make it right.  Paid for the damn meal anyways because I was hungry :-(  Will not return to this location again!
