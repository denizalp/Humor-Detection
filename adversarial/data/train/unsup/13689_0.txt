We only went here because they have cheap tables and they're supposed to have food and drink specials.\n\nPro's\nCheap Tables roulette and craps\nThe bartenders and other staff were busting my balls, loved it\n\nCon's\nThe cocktail waitresses were pretty beat and not very nice.  \nBars that had the food and drink specials were too packed to get in\ndrinks weren't good\ndrinks were as expensive as on the strip\nIt is old and dingy\nI kept getting carded and when I asked for a wrist band security put it on so tight I lost circulation and had to take it off.
