Growing up in California I have a pretty high standard for Mexican food.  I have been holding off in writing a review for selfish reasons.  I LOVE this place and I don't want it to get crowded.  The staff is super.  We love the salsa (we do heat it up some habanero sauce, which you have to ask for) and chips of course.  I like the shrimp fajitas and fish tacos.  But I have never had a bad meal.
