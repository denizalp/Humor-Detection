If I had to condense my review to one word: LEGIT.\n\nI was a bit worried this joint would be some trendy hipster doofus joint.  You know who I'm taking about - they will take a very simple food item -- i.e. pizza, burgers, hot dogs, ice cream, donuts, sandwiches, etc... and repackage it by adding a few premium ingredients.  Open shop in a trendy area and create a fake buzz in the social media world.  Have some tongue-in-cheek logo.  Maybe hang up a \"Keep Calm and [insert appropriate ender]\" poster.  Name something on the menu after 'Chuck Norris' and something after another overplayed meme that really isn't funny anymore.  Have some 'secret menu' so early adopters feel special for knowing about it.  Start a Twitter account and start retweeting 'smart' things.  Play some edgy music in store and hire some young hip employees -- probably covered in trendy sleeve tattoos.  Hopefully, they will be 'cool' enough to work slow - so line-ups form outside the doors -- adding to the ever-growing buzz.\n\nAlright - I've given you the formula - now open a restaurant that'll be hot for a few months before people catch onto the fact you're just overcharging hipsters for pizza\/burgers\/hot dogs\/ice cream\/donuts\/sandwiches\/etc.  Make millions off the stupidity of the masses.\n\nBut - I was pretty surprised that Banh Mi Boys is legit.  Yes - they adding a new premium twist to the tried and true banh mi (which normally sells for $2 - $3 just up the street in Chinatown).  But I double dog dare you to have the duck confit banh mi and tell me it's not worth the $7.50.\n\nSure it's 2x - 4x the price of your standard banh mi, but it's a bargain compared to Subway or nearly every other premium sandwich joint I've been to.  And that duck confit is impossibly juicy, tender and sweet.  I'm seriously drooling and getting hard just thinking about it... too much information?\n\nI've had their beef cheek and pork belly banh mi as well - while good, it didn't blow me away.  Get the duck confit banh mi - you will not regret it.\n\nIt's busy, but the service is dope.  The person making your sandwich will always check with you before spicing your order.  And they play good old school hip hop too.\n\nSo in short, BMB is the truth.  It's not a fly-by-night food shack built off hype rather than quality.
