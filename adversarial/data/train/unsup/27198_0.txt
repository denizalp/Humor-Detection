This was my first time to eat at Fazoli's...ever. I've heard amazing things, so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the Lunch special with Fettuccini Alfredo & side salad. The noodles were a bit dried out but the sauce was super yummy. The side salad had quite a few issues; half of the lettuce was mushy\/wilted and the red onion pieces were slimy and inedible. The breadsticks were most definitely the best part (rivals Olive Garden)! I'll try again, but will more than likely dine-in and not drive-thru.
