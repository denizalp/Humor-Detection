Called and made appointment on a Thursday afternoon. I don't go to salons very often, but was treating myself.Arrived early and 2 customers were getting manicures. A third worker appeared to do my pedicure. I told her that I like my nails short and that I had 2 ingrown areas. The salon was quiet and peaceful. No music. TV on caption. The relaxing atmosphere was only affected by the 2 customers who were chatting on their phones.     The chair I sat in was new and fantastic. Took me awhile to figure out the buttons for the right massage.  My feet entered water that was too hot for me, but the worker quickly adjusted the temp. I was kind of disappointed that the jetting\/bubbling wasn't that intense. The soak and rose scent was very nice.  I received a great trim, like she had read my mind. The 2 ingrown corners were minimal in pain and I was relieved to get that safely done. My nails and cuticles were perfect for me.  The rest of the time was spent on different skin treatments and massages. I really enjoyed the hot towels.  My legs were softened, not just my calves. It was relaxing and enjoyable. Trim couldn't have been better and the skin treatment was such a pleasure.  ($25)
