Classy and exquisite hotel for those who want to splurge.  Although the casino stole my money on Blackjack, I'll give them extra stars for the rooms they have here.  I can't believe the room we stayed in was a suite, 2 extra big queen beds with a living room and sofas.  For $200 a night, I think this is a bargain since we're in this SO-CALL recession.  \n\nThe gambling here is often crowded, also when TAO opens up at night the place is filled with people.  I wouldn't mind staying here again and a friendly reminder to all, TIP THE VALET FIRST TO GET YOUR CAR ASAP.  Otherwise, you'll be waiting 40 mins on a Sunday afternoon queuing for your car to come out.
