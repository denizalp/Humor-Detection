***QUICK NOTE: This location has no drive through and limited indoor seating.***\n\nSmall yet mighty is my dear Mentor Starbucks location. But luckily the old adage of size not being an issue really does apply here. I can still enjoy the lovely aroma and taste of my one true love....coffee.\n\nLocated in a small plaza in a corner, this location was a bit of a challenge. Parking is at a premium and the lot is rather busy. But, did that stop this hardcore Starbucks guru? NO WAY JOSE! Who is Jose you ask? If I told you, I'd have to kill you. \n\nVery limited seating, a small retail area, no patio seating and no drive thru....that is what stopped this location from getting 5 stars from me. However, the store was clean (bathrooms too) and the staff was SUPER friendly. Service was lickity split too!
