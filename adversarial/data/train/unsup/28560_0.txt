Restaurant Review:\n\nOrdered a steak sandwich which was pretty bland; not a good follow-up to the also bland BBQ chicken pizza we ordered as an appetizer. This restaurant's saving grace was the nice atmosphere. Also enjoyed the random 80's and 90's songs instead of top 40 you expect to hear on the strip.\n\nAs a side note (this didn't affect my rating), our server was a snide little douche. Our party consisted of 19 people and this clown gave us crap for wanting the check split. But you're right dude, it totally makes sense for one of us to eat the $400 bill.
