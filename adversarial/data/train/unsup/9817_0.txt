Since watching the videos of the owner making the Eggslut sandwich maybe four years ago, I've always had this as one of my must-try. \n\nThe long lines every morning is evident of just how good this place is. We came at 9:10 in the morning and left an hour after that. I must give props to all the cooking staff at the back as the guy is managing maybe six different pans all at once cooking eggs. \n\nThe food is simply put, super simple but executed in the best way possible. I ordered the Fairfax with bacon which had the soft scrambled eggs with chives and a sriracha mayo. Eggs were delicious and texture was perfectly soft. I also ordered the Slut which is a jar with potato pur√©e with an egg on top. Stir the jar up and slap it on the toast for a good time. \n\nIf you don't want to wait, come back around lunch time to avoid the morning rush. So worth it and so glad I checked this one off the list.
