If your in Vegas you have to come to XS!! It's the best night club Vegas has to offer! The Club is super big but it can get packed, depending on how many people they let in.  Standard weekend when entree fee is $30-50 for guys and $20 for girls the place will be packed! When I went on a big weekend X S wasnt even that packed because they were charging 150-200 entree fee which is ridiculous! But I got in free cause im cool like that so no worries LoL.\n\nSo many people and damn soo many hot girls everywhere!! Seems to me its more asian then anything but im cool with that cause I love my asian girls! The music they play there is the shit!! House and hip hop!!! mainly hip-hop with electro beats! \n\nI dont care if its expensive because cmon people its Vegas! Don't be an adverage Joe and expect you can bargin with vegas! just a fair warning, regular beers $10, and grey goose anything is about $17. \n\nFellas enjoy the ladies and the ambiance !!
