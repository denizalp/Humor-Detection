I love coming here!\n\nIt comes with a free hot drink! Its $1 extra to change it to a small cold drink, or $2 extra to change it to a special large drink. A bonus is that they always give you the cold drinks in a plastic to-go bubble tea cup instead of a glass, so I always end up bringing the drink home since I can never finish it in the restaurant.\n\nIf you go during peak times, its always busy so expect to wait if you have more than 2 people.\n\nYou can also add side dishes for around $2 each if you're super hungry (maximum 2 per person)! However, I'm usually full and satisfied with just the bowl of noodles :)
