Decided to give this place a try for lunch the other day.  I went with the small bowl with rice (as opposed to salad), chose rice with lentils, gyro meat, yogurt\/tahini sauce (as opposed to the sour cream sauce) and topped with veggies.  The small was the perfect size for me but I could see how most folks were getting the large.  \n\nI was disappointed that with the small size you only get 1\/2 pita (2 pita quarters) as opposed to if you ordered the large size you get a full pita.  I think next time, I'll opt for the pita rather than the bowl.
