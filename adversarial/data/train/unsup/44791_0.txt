Had a tough time picking a star rating for his place.  Came here after work to grab a couple of drinks and dinner.  The beer selection is excellent.\n\nOrdered steak frites, mostly because I couldn't figure out what I wanted to order.\n\nWhen I ordered my second beer, the runner brought the wrong one.  When I told her, she walked it back to the bar.  My waitress picked it back up, put it in front of me and told me it was what I had ordered.  Didn't think much of it because it was still a nice beer and carried on with my evening.\n\nWhen the bill came I'd been charged for 4 beers, which they corrected easily, but when I looked at the bill I saw that the incorrect drink HAD been punched in (so... Didn't get the beer I ordered, still ended up with a good beer).\n\nMy main issue with this place is the service, but I think I would come back, but I'd sit at the bar to make sure I get the beer I actually want to try.
