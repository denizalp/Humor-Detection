I have mixed reviews of this place. It's a nice restaurant. Newly renovated and clean. The staff is always nice and friendly. The food is where it gets tricky. \n\nWe came for Chicken and Bacon Waffles. It was amazing! Fresh breaded and fried chicken breast over light and fluffy bacon waffles. It was so good in fact we came back a few days later so my husband could try the same dish. I decided to try a burger I saw on our earlier trip. \n\nLong story short, this time around they served two over cooked, dry, bone in chicken pieces. And the plate had a weird teriyaki sauce everywhere! Like they were trying to make it look fancy. But who wants teriyaki sauce on their waffles!!?? Not us. It was gross. When we asked the manager why it was so different he said that's the way it always comes even when I showed him the photo of the awesome meal earlier with the chicken breast he argued with me and said I missed the bone. What??? I think I know what a chicken breast is. Crazy. We didn't even get an apology or an offer to make it the other way that we enjoyed so much the first day and came back for! Also, I looked up the menu on line and posted a pic that it clearly says \"chicken breast\" on the menu. AND I JUST realized I was also supposed to get 2 eggs!! No eggs were offered either time. \n\nThe twisted burger I was so excited to try looks amazing but was also a disappointment. Again with the teriyaki sauce all over the plate and under my burger bun!!!??? Yuck. No. Not that it mattered the burger had SO MUCH SAGE that it tasted like sausage patties. \n\nI posted pics. I'm not sure if we'll go back and it's a shame we really enjoyed our meal the other day. Maybe if we are VERY SPECIFIC about what we order. I don't know, I give this place a maybe.
