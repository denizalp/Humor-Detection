My teenage dream came true - party in the museum! This has become another reason to love Toronto and I can't believe I've waited this long to discover something so fun. It's like a nightclub but with awesome artifacts, gourmet snacks, comfy chairs, extra bathrooms, and multiple floors to play hide and seek. The idea seems like a great way for the museum to increase revenues and there's something to be said for exploring dinosaur exhibits at 10 pm.
