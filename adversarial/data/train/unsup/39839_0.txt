I moved back to Arcadia 5yrs ago. Been searching for a caring, knowledgeable, organized, non-gouging single practice veterinary clinic ever since. Finally found one!  \nI recently got a 8 month old lady Doxishire to keep my 4yo Dorgie gent company. Our problem, she developed non stop diarrhea. Dr. Cruz worked us in the next day. Talked me through probable causes, eliminating most. Gave me the perfect plan.  Sheila is doing great now. Our visit bill included new dog history, exam, digestive repair foods, probiotics, medicine, puppy booster shots and testing for infections and parasites. Our exam room and the lobby were very clean and sanitary.  Everyone there made us feel welcome and safe. \nMary told me the test results the very next day. This clinics' detailed billing prices are reasonable and fair for services rendered. You do not have to buy what you do not want. I always pay cash for my animals' care. I consider pet health insurance a rip off.
