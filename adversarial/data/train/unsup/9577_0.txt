For my 200th review, Rocket fizz has earned the coveted spot.  This place is nostalgia and sweets rolled into one.  They have a huge selection of candies, chocolates, and sodas.  They also have a variety of knick knack items including metal signs with various pics such as Thor, and they have an assortment of lunch boxes, and toys.  It's just a lot of fun to look around and let your mouth salivate. If you're in Charlotte,  swing by epicentre and check it out.
