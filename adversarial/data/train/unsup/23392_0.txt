Going to the Post Office doesn't usually make one happy, but every time I visit this location- I remember that we have some amazing dedicated Postal Service employees that really work hard to get things where they need to be.\n\nI recently picked up a package there, and was helped by an amazing employee whose name tag reads \"Dude\". I told him I thought that was cool, and he told me some funny stories. \n\nAnyway, don't be lazy and group all postal employees into a negative group- these guys are gems. Well done Scottsdale & McDowell post office.
