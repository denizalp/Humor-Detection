USE THEIR COMPETITOR DOWN THE STREET SINALITE!!!\n\nThis is for all the frustrated 1 star customers who are not published and the fake 5 star reviews that I *assume* are Boss Logo related friends\/employees. \n\nI used this company once about 10 years ago when it was in a one room office. I was disgusted and pissed off about the quality and customer service. But was surprised how big it has grown so I gave it another chance. \n\nI've been using them many times in last several years and have been disappointing 4 out of every 5 times. I can go on for pages like other users have but I'll share my recent story. They said an order would be ready Dec 16th but my client did not get it a week later! And their notepad stationary came blank and some from another customer but 0 of actually for our client.\n\nFrom that day we decided to only deal with Sinalite who is much more professional and have not missed a single delivery date. I've probably placed almost 20 orders now in the last 6 months. Boss logo misses deadline on 9 out of 10 orders. This is our company's reputation.\n\nYou might ask why have we order so many times from Boss logo?\n1. We didn't find out about Sinalite till recently\n2. We thought Boss logo prices were lower because they constantly give discounts, which is not always true. Sinalite often have lower regular prices even with discounts from Boss Logo. Even if Boss Logo prices are slightly lower it's not worth the headache, risk, and reputation.\n3. Boss logo offers products that not available at Sinalite, such as finishes, thickness, or quantity.
