It took an hour and 20 minutes to get our food!  Enough said. I would give one star but the food was good, once we finally got it. Of course we were starving by then and had each had two drinks, so maybe it wasn't that good. We complained to the manager and he tried to blame it on us!  The server was friendly but never apologized for the situation either. There was no effort to retain us as customers, like a discount on the meal or a gift card. A simple apology and explanation about what happened would probably have even been enough for us to come back because we've always really liked this place. Oh well, time to find a new favorite place.
