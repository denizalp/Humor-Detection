I can't believe I've lived here 6 months and just discovered that I live this close to a Subway!\n\nI went and got a foot long cold cut combo today and was pretty impressed. The place is very clean. The girl who made my sub was friendly and put together one tasty sub. All in all, I don't know what else I could have asked for.\n\nThe only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because there are just too many places in the city that make better subs(Earl of Sandwich, Capriottis, Firehouse). As far as Subways go, this is one of the best Subways I've ever been to.\n\nI will most certainly be back..\n\n4 stars.
