The Good:\nOPEN 24 HOURS!\nDecent liquor selection\nSnacks\nSoft Drinks\nStaff is cool\n\nThe Not So Good:\nExpensive\nBeer selection is just \"okay\"\n\nThis is a fairly \"Vegas Strip close\" 24 hour liquor store with a bunch of snacks, drinks, hard liquor and little trinkets. The downside is that a lot of their liquor and beer is fairly pricey which is to be expected in Vegas. Also, their beer selection is a little limited with mainly just having some of the more popular beers and a lot of the better ones available in single bottles only.  Also if you're looking for large packs of cans, you're pretty much limited to Coors and Bud Light. \n\nAll in all, it's good to have a 24 hour liquor store, especially in Vegas.  It does beat buying alcohol in the casinos but their are cheaper alternatives if you are willing to travel a little away from the strip and stick to regular business hours.
