When you leave the dentist's office with a smile on your face, you know you've found the right one!\nI had a filling fall out, which took part of my tooth.  I was also due for a cleaning and X-rays.  \nThe appointment was set for 2 hours (first visit, always 2 hours) and I was out in just over that.\nThe hygienist, Carrie, was awesome!  She cracked a few jokes and didn't ask my too many questions while her fingers were in my mouth.\nThan came Rachel with my X-rays.  She warned me it might be painful, but it wasn't.  I can't believe the technology they have here!\nDr Schneider had an awesome sense of humor and handled mine really well.  He was upfront about what it would take to repair my tooth.  Crown or implant.  \nThey are going to send the diagnosis for pre-approval to my insurance company first.  I'll know in 2 to 3 weeks.  \nI actually enjoyed myself here.  Beat sitting at work!
