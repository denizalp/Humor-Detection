Food - good stuff, though the menu is pretty limited. Incidentally, we have a Johnny Garlic's near us in Dublin, CA, and the exact same macaroni and cheese burger is on their menu for $6 less. Since I know it's good though, I ordered that and was content. I liked the concept of the Quad fries, too. Really crunchy and good for those of us who like a little variety of all of the different kind of fries.\nService - slow as f. It was unclear who our server even was, since we had multiple people helping us, but whatever. Either way, they could step up their game in that arena.  And side note, I wish they served breakfast longer. I was dying to try the bacon biscuits (they have them advertised on their menu and I feel like I saw them somewhere else in some Vegas highlights magazine), so it was a bummer to not be able to try them. When I go back to Vegas in April, I hope to try them then. This is a good place to try if you want a burger and fries with a lot of flavor, and the back patio seems perfect for a group.
