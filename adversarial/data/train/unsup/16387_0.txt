If you are on a tight budget - the Monte Carlo is probably one of the better bargains on the strip. From our stay it seems to be popular with overweight middle-aged White people, and frugal Asians. And luckily for me at their gym - seems neither of those groups work out!\n\nGiven my recent experience though - I will probably spend a few more bucks next trip and stay at Vdara or similar (discount rates via Jetsetter\/Hotels etc). I knocked this from 3 to 2 stars for uncleanliness. Details follow....\n\nThe Dirty Discoveries:\n\n- Bathroom floor: dirty, especially under the sink. I mentioned once to room service, but it was never mopped. I rubbed around a towel to verify it was dirty, and not just the color of the floor\n- Dirty Washcloth: the second day I was delivered a washcloth with multiple large, bright red stains in it, that looked like fresh blood. Made me think they don't bleach their towels enough. Unfortunately it was right on top of other towels on the rack. Those all went on the floor, unused.\n- Found half a condom wrapper under the desk, in the far corner of the room, next to the wall (thankfully, no condom, and unfortunately too small sized for me anyway)\n- Found a pill on the floor, next to the bed, while checking around to see what other goodies we might find. Googled it and it was a birth control pill, and not one that any of my girlfriends' take. And, unfortunately, of no use to me (being male).\n\nPrevious guest - whoever you were - when you leave pills behind - please leave me some of The Good Shit. Thanks.\n\nWe ended up leaving the wrapper and pill on the floor, to see if it would get cleaned up. They were there our entire stay, until checkout. To be fair - we didn't call room service and tell them about it. But, I wanted to gauge how often\/well the floors were cleaned before I performed any calisthenics on the floor. Needless to say we decided it was better off to wear socks and avoid touching the floors.\n\nOverall I thought it was kind of funny, minus the bloody washcloth, but my girlfriends' were fairly unimpressed. I've stayed all over Vegas, and in this price range the MGM Grand was similar but cleaner. But that was 9 years ago.\n\nIn Summary -\n\nPros:\n+ cheap\n(I paid roughly $115\/night for 5 days = $585 total. I've read other folks found 5 night bargains for as low as $300. For $300 I'd give this place 3-4 stars)\n+ No taxi line, ever, even peak evening times.\n+ Beds were decent for a cheap stay.\n+ Great, free gym, very clean, new equipment, that nobody uses. Very friendly and helpful gym\/spa staff. The gym alone would be a deciding factor in staying here again, were the rooms clean.\n\nCons:\n- Hallways to room were worn down, dirty\n- Room was very dirty - see above.\n- Checkin lines looked insane most of the time I walked by. Luckily when I arrived (on a Tuesday) it was fairly dead. I waited maybe 15 minutes total. Later in the week looked light it might be painfully long in line.\n- Only tried eating at \"The Buffet\". Food was overall very low quality, in all of my guests opinions, for $25\/apiece. I'm more of a quality than quantity guy, but we wanted breakfast food.\n\nProTip: Didn't try their other restaurants, but we found out we could have eaten at The Buffet for roughly $10\/person by calling Tix4Tonight.
