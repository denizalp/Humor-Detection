I'm sure everyone has read all the previous reviews of WF so I won't rehash all the great things that have already been said! So here's  five reasons why WF gets my five stars.\n\n1. It's in my backyard and can walk over not having to deal with the parking and traffic.  \n\n2.  They have a cooking school.  I will be taking several of the classes so I can be on season six of Master Chef.  (LOL!)\n\n3.  They have good sales each week.  I picked up pineapple salsa and scored a lb of Salmon for free.  It was org priced $17....but I got it for gratis.\n\n4.  Wine bar with an upstairs tasting area.   You can purchase a tasting card, go up the stairs and try the wines that they have.  I think it was three different sizes that you could choose.  If you don't use the entire card, you can use it at another time.  It doesn't expire for an entire year and you can reload.  Hello.  \n\n5.  Prices are fairly decent surprisingly.  I buy my meats at another grocery store and WF prices were the same.  So I don't feel like they are trying to be over priced.\n\n6.  (sorry thought of one more)  It's staff and the people who shop here are really friendly.  I ran into 3 people that live in my complex and we all started chatting.  I felt like I was in a small town chatting with residents that I knew.  Loved it.  \n\nBe calm and be patient when going....it's a tad crazy but if you are chill (visit the wine bar) it is a pleasant shopping experience.  I think I will purposefully forget butter and milk tomorrow and go again.....and again.
