I needed to get a haircut on Saturday and used their online app to check in at 5:45. It let me know that I would need to arrive before 6 because the shop was closing. I arrived at 5:55 , the second I walked in the door the two people who were rapidly cleaning up immediately say, \"SORRY WERE CLOSED\" I told them I had checked in online. They told me that it was too late. \n\nTo me it seemed like they saw my check in and both decided that they didn't want to stay later than 6 (despite what the app says). I can understand that feeling but it was just as much inconvenience for me to drive all the way there as it would be for them to cut my hair. If the same said \"sorry were not taking anyone or even if I had arrived after the time it specified I would not be upset. But that is not what happened.
