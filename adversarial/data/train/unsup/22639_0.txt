Wow. \nNow, I will confess that my knowledge of liquor is very limited. But, since I enjoy cooking, I appreciate the time, energy and ability it takes to make a craft cocktail. \n\nDo not expect the normal here. Anthony is an amazing bartender. His knowledge of which spirit went with what to make a flavor was incredible. He used flavor profiles to build craft cocktails for me and my guy. Providing him with your favorite flavors, what tastes you appreciate, will likely yield the best cocktail you ever have had.\n\nThere are rules to follow when you are in this gem. And that's okay. You won't be disappointed in the rules because you will be enjoying your amazing drink, and experience!\n\nThe only downfall? I am now a drink snob (suddenly) so my peach mojito I just had was difficult to enjoy... because boxed peach juice is much different than the concoctions created at the Laundry Room.\n\nWe will be back.
