I truly love Viva nails\nAnd they have been my \"go to\" salon since they opened.    However recently they have become so busy it seems they simply cannot keep up with the supply and demand.   Last visit I signed in for mani\/pedi and was taken to the pedicure chair right away.    Where I sat.   For over an hour.     When I finally was able to flag someone down and ask how much longer it would be I was only told about the many others who were there and to be seen before me. I got up and left and have never been back.    Again.   They do a wonderful job.   Just either need more technicians.   Or don't be afraid to tell someone there is an hour wait and let the customer decide how to proceed.
