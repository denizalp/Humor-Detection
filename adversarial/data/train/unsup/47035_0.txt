We came here with Landry's rewards card.\nThe waiter is very nice and the store manager comes by twice (maybe it is before the busy dinner time so he can visit each table more often).\nThe Margarita with corona is really refreshing. :)\nWe ordered shrimp wrapped with bacon. It is quite rich with butter dressing on the top. But if you are the butter lover or a teenager, you might love it very much. :)\nWe each ordered the 4 courses for $19.99. What a bargain! It comes with salad, appetizer, one entree, and one dessert. Everything is great!......(banana ice cream is very sweet. :) )
