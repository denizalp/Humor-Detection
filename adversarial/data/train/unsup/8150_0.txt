It's Thursday and I'm starving at work so I decided to head across the street and take advantage of their ladies special where AYCE lunch is $19.95 instead of the $23.95. (and dinner is $23.95 instead of $26.95).\n\nFrom the apps I had the poke which was more like a tuna cucumber salad. Good, but not really Hawaiian poke.\n\nNigiri\nCajun Albacore was delicious. Fresh and had nice seasoning. Plain albacore was also very fresh\nYellowtail- good, but not great...texture slightly off.\nUnagi- pretty decent.\n\nNow I normally go very basic and don't like too many creamy sauces but that pepper tuna and pepper salmon nigiri with a creamy kinda garlicky sauce and onions was really good! I kept ordering it. It's kinda a cross  between nigiri and a roll due to the sauce.\n\nSalmon skin hand roll- very good, really crispy skin. I like that it wasnt drowned in any sauce since it takes away from the salmon skin taste. I like mine best traditional with just some sprouts, gobo, and cucumbers. No fancy frills.\n\nHalf rolls- moon roll and something else...it was a cajun albacore\/spicy tuna roll. They were okay, but I'm not a roll person. It's exactly the same as a Sushi Mon roll, but somehow it was better at Sushi Mon. \n\nThat's one thing I'm confused about- the menu is almost the same as Sushi Mon....is it owned by the same people? A copy?\n\n It's a small place and I dont mind hole in the wall, but it was a bit dirty in there.  Service though is attentive and the sushi chefs make sure to not keep people waiting too long for food. \n\nIt's alright for certain things. If I'm in the mood for more \"flavored\" nigiris then I'll come here since it's across from work and $19 isnt bad of a price. Otherwise, straight unadulterated nigiri I have other haunts.
