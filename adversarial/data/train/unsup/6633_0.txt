The food is huge here and absolutely delicious,the service fantastic, the hostess was very helpful with a bit of extra special attentive to us also with a tat of history about the place,I had 14in. flapjacks w\/ banana cook inside, with scramble eggs,one chicken sausage,the little lady had french toasts w\/ cook open face banana w\/ pecans on top.Parking can be a problem downtown,but if you park at the Plaza Hotel parking lot its $5.00 take your ticket give it to your hostess get validation then you have to take your ticket to the hotel cashier cage to get your money back........that's a lot of work we 're going to try one of the other two Hash House A Go Go where there is free parking.
