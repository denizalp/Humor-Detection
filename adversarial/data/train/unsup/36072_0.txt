This is by far one of the best Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to with my boyfriend. Great customer service, nice servers, good food, good portion, beautiful environment. We came from Houston, TX to try this well talked about place and we both LOVE it. It's unacceptable to not stop by here while in town! My boyfriend is a pho-natic and he says Jennipho has not only met his expectations but exceeded them!
