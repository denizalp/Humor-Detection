Great red curry here with the appropriate level of heat.\n\nOh a whim, I decided to order some red curry with tofu ($8.95) to go. I feel that a curry forms a good baseline judgement of an establishment, much as a simple hamburger does for most pubs.\"If you can't cook a simple burger...\" as the saying goes.\n\nWell, mine is if they can't make a flavorful curry with the right heat and consistency, then the other dishes are unlikely to perform any better.\n\nIt was a hit! Great, silky consistency, without being runny like soup. Each spoonful of this potent curry delivered bites of bamboo shoots, green or red peppers, and soft, fried tofu. I ordered level 4 out of 5 and enjoyed a good sweat, so they are not playing around with an ambiguous rating scale of 1 to 1000, be aware when you choose your spice level!\n\nI really liked that the tofu in the curry was firm yest still spongy, unlike some restaurants that prepare their fried tofu and end up with rough, tough edges. These morsels were lightly fried just enough to maintain their shape but still able to absorb some of the curry, giving it some flavor.\n\nThey don't offer papaya salad here, which is disappointing. The one pictured in my photo is leftover from another place, sorry to be a tease :oP\n\nIf you are in the mood for some piquant Thai food, stop here for some curry, they are open 7 days a week and have weekday lunch specials from 11 am until 2 pm!
