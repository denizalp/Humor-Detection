It feels like they brought in a Greek chef and a modern architect together and asked them to put something together and they came up with Milos. \n\nExcellent food and excellent atmosphere. Clean and upscale with great service. \n\nWe tried several of their appetizers and they were excellent. Including calamari and octopus.
