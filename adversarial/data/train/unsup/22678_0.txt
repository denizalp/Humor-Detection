Well on my day off, I decided to venture from Mississauga for a super early weekday brunch.  No idea why, but I guess I was bored and got there around 10:30 am.  You know, with this place looking like a lunch place, I thought they would only have a few things out by this time, but lo and behold, it was stocked to the max.  I walked in and the aroma hit me like \"wow, this smells soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good\".   The guy at the counter was amazingly friendly too.  There were a lot of choices and you can get a meal for $12, which included two entrees, some other things (I didn't pay attention) or you can get a Pong special for $16.  He showed me all the options and that didn't make my choice any easier because everything looked and smelt really good.  \n\nSo I just ended up getting the Pong's special.  It was a mix of lentil based food, soy based food with jerk and Caribbean flavours (I don't even know how to describe it). With regards to the taste, the food was definitely fresh and not greasy or overly salty (which is most Caribbean food IMO).  \n\nVerdict: Friendly service, fresh food, vegan and vegetarian, and decent pricing. Will be back if I'm in the area.
