OK. So my husband and I had to make a quick trip to Vegas because we're moving from california to Henderson, NV. We came to pick up the rental and the woman who helped us seemed dissatisfied that we didn't want to upgrade. She spent a solid 8min trying to talk us into an upgrade. After declining, we were given a kia soul. Now, inside the garage area its kinda dark so its hard to see things. Fortunately we stopped at a nearby IHOP for breakfast and realized the driver front tire was severely bald (bald enough that it probably would have blown with the Vegas heat that weekend on the freeway). So we returned it and got another vehicle thats coolant light wouldn't turn off. I'm pregnant so vehicle safety is number one priority...I can't say I felt at all safe in either of the cars and I didn't even get a sorry for the troubles. On top of that we spent an additional $120 (give or take) on the rental after I had already pre-paid for it. When I asked about why it was so much on top of the money I already spent, the woman was kind enough to have an attitude about it and told us to make reservations on the Hertz sight and not to use a third party reservation sight...I get discounts from work and to absolutely honest, someone can kiss my rear to tell me not to use it. I just wish I had two more hands to give 4 thumbs down. I won't be renting from hertz again.
