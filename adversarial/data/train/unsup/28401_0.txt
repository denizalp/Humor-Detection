We went today and saw Brandy, I think that was her name, and it was perfect!! We had about 8 family members come with us to do a gender reveal all at once. We're having a girl!!! Brandy was so thorough and checked everything to make sure the baby was healthy, fluid levels, size, placenta placement. Really felt comfortable and even more so being able to walk out knowing my daughter is healthy. Other places I've been to just say boy or girl and take some screen shots. She actually seemed to care about the general well being of the baby. Not to mentioned she price matched other places specials!! I will definitely be going back and recommend this place to everyone!!
