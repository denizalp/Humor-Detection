I finally decided to try laser hair removal after suffering with being unable to shave more than twice monthly. After 6 sessions on my lower legs and underarms, I have very few hairs, enough that I usually don't worry if I can't shave. I can see why most places say you need 8-10 sessions to be completely hair free, but the touch up rate is very affordable. It was worth every penny, I wish I had been able to get laser hair removal sooner. It's made it so I can go to the gym whenever I want, and not have to worry about shaving before deciding on an outfit. It doesn't sound like much, but for someone for whom shaving has cost a lot of heartbreak (I was waxing and epilating, but that was so tedious and expensive), its made a world of a difference.
