I went here for my very first time on a Sunday afternoon with my husband. We knew they were going to be busy since it was the Sunday brunch crowd. We waited an hour and thirty minutes for a table just for the 2 of us. The wait wasn't too bad, we looked around the store and sat on their rocking chairs to kill some time. After our long wait, we were called on the overhead and got seated right away. They have a fun little game on the table to play to kill more time while you wait for your food. The service was good and the food was even better. My husband got the French toast and I got a children's chicken and dumplings and biscuits and gravy. I defiantly recommend the chicken and dumplings.
