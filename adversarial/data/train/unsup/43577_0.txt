I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars.  My wife and I came here for a date night, and was very happy with the ambiance of the place.  This has been ranked as one of the top 10 most romantic restaurants in Scottsdale, and I believe that this is accurate.  Food wise, I was pleased.  The foie gras seemed like a good option, and the chicken meatballs seemed like it would be tasty as well.  We ordered cocktails and they were inventive.  We had the lamb pasta dish and it was yummy and appropriately portioned.  So why the lower score? \nSome logistical hiccups.  First off, we called to make a reservation and were told 845 was the earliest they could do.  Then we book on open table and get a reservation at 815... What?  Also, my goodness was the service slow.  We had planned on ordering appetizers, desert, multiple drinks but couldn't because we could never found our waiter.  The lack of attention really put a damper on the evening though and as enchanting was the atmosphere, the service was the opposite.  There is a chance for a real turn around on this place.  All the ingredients are in place.  It just needs to hire a few more waiters and it could turn into a must go.
