Ray is an expert Italian cook (and Host) of the old school (finger to nose). Don't miss the Cannelloni or the Chicken Marsala.\n\nIt's the lobby restaurant for Days Inn (Red Roof Inn before that) on Camelback, West of 7th Ave. The room is way out of date as are the presentations, but the preparations are old-school quality at old-school prices... I ate for 3 (I wanted to taste as much as I could for this review) and my bill was $23! A bit of Hit and Miss, but the hits were HITS!\n\nFINDING THE PLACE\nLook for the \"Days Inn\" sign North of Camelback on 7th Ave. (Otherwise, come from the East on Camelback and look for the \"Days Inn\" sign before 7th Ave)\n\nRaimondo's \"disappeared into oblivion\" 2 years ago to anyone but those staying at this motel (restaurant signage is non-existent) AND THE REGULARS. OH, let me tell you about THE REGULARS... There is a steady stream of regulars who all know each other and the staff by name. It seems to have become the favorite of the former clientele of Jay Newton's Beefeaters.\n\nTHE FOOD!\n--creamy chicken soup too creamy. Thickener paste too pasty. \n--Salad very crispy but was too cold. Some pieces had given in. Tomato too cold. \n \n--Cannelloni masterful. Finished in pizza oven. Worth the trip. \n--Chicken Marsala. Masterful recipe. Alcohol just peeked through and the mushrooms, parsley and drops of lemon finished it spectacularly. Worth the trip. \nToo bad the tomato sauce didn't have time to absorb those spices. It had just been started.\n\nTHE CHEF!\nChef appeared after I was enjoying my main dishes with a bucket of ice to fill the bins in front of me. He didn't say a word. Humble as ever. As I got up to leave, he was standing far on the other side of the room, but even at a distance, I could see a gleam in his eye and his smile. Of course I walked over. What a wonderful man.\n\nI can't wait to go back. Ray strikes me as the type who'd offer me an apron and let me learn a thing or two some Sunday afternoon. I would be honored.\n\nP.S. Beware of 1-star no-face\/no-friends reviews.  ;)
