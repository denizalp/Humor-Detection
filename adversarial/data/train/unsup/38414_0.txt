First of all they racial profile, they asked my light wheelchair accommodating, also racially profile my friend who is a dark skinned male: they made home pay twice as much as how white counter part. $35 vs. $55 , that's wtf.. ALSO A man came into the women's restroom and opened the DOOR ON MY FOOT, almost broke my toe and justified it by \"keeping us safe\" dude, there's no danger in here. You came into our restroom out of total self interest you accused women of making a line. Sorry we have bladders not sorry dude.
