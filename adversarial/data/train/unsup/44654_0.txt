I love this place, from the food to the staff it's great. The homemade pita is to die for, I always leave with an extra bag which is only about $4 because I eat it at home with everything. The hummus is delicious and the you get a good amount. I totally recommend Olives they make it fresh right there in front of you so you know what you are getting. Try it you won't be disappointed and you'll be back at least twice a week like I am.
