I know this is a weird thing to say, but I enjoyed the Holiday Inn Express I stayed at the night after this hotel more. \nStaff was just okay and my room never really cooled down.  It was stuffy and musty. I pretty much only slept and showered there because I was so busy.  For breakfast I only had fruit and juice. \nI'm a fire blooded ginger and I'm not a tiny girl, I need a nice cool room especially because I can't really sleep without something on me. I would get comfy then sweat and throw the sheet off then get cold  because I sweat so I'd cover then sweat...not cute or fun. Comfy bed though.
