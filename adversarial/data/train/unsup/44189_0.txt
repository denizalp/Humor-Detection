Review: subs.\n\nI loved Vietnamese subs since I was introduced to them as a kid. They are essentially subs made with Asian ingredients. I knew I had to try this place after looking at all the stellar reviews.\n\nBottomline: no frills restaurant that serves tasty subs with the freshest ingredients. Slightly more expensive than other places.\n\nAtmosphere: although clean, the restaurant is not much to look at. Decor is pretty much nonexistent. Definitely not a first date kind of place. Service was one of a kind. She was enthusiastic and super friendly. Even offered a complimentary tea while I waited for my sub. Made me feel very welcomed.\n\nFood: the sub menu is extremely small. It's either chicken, pork, beef or straight up veggies with or without sate. However, because of their limited selection, their ingredients were very fresh. There wasn't anything too special about their subs, but the freshness took them to a whole new level. Everything was well seasoned and ratios were just right.\n\nValue; slightly more expensive than other Viet subs (1-2 dollars more), but worth the extra. Portions were average.
