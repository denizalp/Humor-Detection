Majority of the staff are very friendly. I feel like I'm on the set of Cheers when I check in because they know me by name. \n\nThe group fitness classes are pretty cool too. I've tried everything from P90X to Zumba to MixxedFit to BodyPump. If they want to stay relevant, then they should incorporate SoulClap into the mix like other gyms are doing. Also, the AC goes out at least quarterly in the group fitness classes and in the women's gym. \n\nSpeaking of the women's gym, someone needs to ensure that guys are not working out in there. Perhaps a sign would do the trick. \n\nLastly, the cleanliness of the gym could be a bit more frequent. \n\nOverall, you get what you pay for and memberships begin at only $9.95 per month.
