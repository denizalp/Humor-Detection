Two weeks ago my car got towed to Magill's Auto Service.  I asked if they could put on all new snow tires while my car was there.  They said that they would check to see if I needed them first.  I did need new tires and they quoted me a great price, which made me a little skeptical.  It was $200 cheaper than the price I got quoted at a local tire place.  When I picked my car up I was pleasantly surprised to see the bill was exactly what they quoted me.  It is now two weeks later and the car is running better than ever.  It used to rock back and forth when going around turns, but that is now fixed.  Everyone I talked to over the phone and when picking up the car was very professional and friendly.  I highly recommend Magill's Auto Service!
