Another nice surprise on our road trip. Had the pear, cranberry, walnut salad and it was very tasty. This was the salad where you got a bite of something good every time. They were not stingy with the portion. Hubby had the Philly cheesesteak and good portion of filling to bread. Waitress was attentive and smiling all the time. Glad we went at 5pm, the place filled up with people waiting by the time we finished our meal. Looks like a popular local spot. It was $32 with a soda and ice tea.  Today is 9\/22\/2013. This could almost be rated a 5.
