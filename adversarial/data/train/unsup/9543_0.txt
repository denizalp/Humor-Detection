What a view!!  The rooms in this hotel have fantastic views of the Strip.  I only stayed in a regular average room with 2 queen beds.  The beds were comfortable and the linens were good quality.  The square footage was a decent size.  There was small table with two chairs by the window and a large bathroom.  There is also a desk for those that need to do some work.  The bathroom has a separate powder room from the wash basins and a fairly good size shower.\n\nMy only complaint was that the shower didn't drain well.  They certainly need to update the plumbing or snake the drainage area.  \n\nThis hotel is hip and extremely popular with young adults who love clubbing.  The club is constantly packed and the area around has numerous eateries and restaurants that are, of course, full of people.  Make a note to try Secret Pizza if you can get it.  There is always a very long line.
