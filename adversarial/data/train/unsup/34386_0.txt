I decided I needed some aesthetic services so I came here for waxing, a pedicure, and a facial.  Melanie did everything from beginning to end and she was awesome!  She was friendly and made me feel at ease.  I would recommend going to her if you can.  \n\nI took off a star only because the facial space, although was in the back, was still open to people walking by.  Also, I found it slightly chilly.  Had there been a separate room, I think it would've been more relaxing.  \n\nThe waxing rooms are private and everything seemed very clean and well-maintained.  \n\nThey offer beer and wine if you're into that while getting your nails done!
