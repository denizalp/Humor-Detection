This place is so great. When I have an appointment scheduled, I look forward to it all day and am never disappointed by the experience. I have been seeing Lori for a year and a half, and am so glad I found someone talented to trust my hair with. From my first appointment, Lori has been honest about what makes sense for my hair, always listening to whatever new concern has cropped up for me and offering suggestions about maintenance, style, etc. While the great reviews on Yelp led me here, the incredible customer service and skilled team at Snapdragon will keep me a customer indefinitely. This local business has more than earned their community following.
