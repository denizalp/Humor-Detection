Yay, great airport food.  I love this place. My breakfast option this morning at 10:45. \n\nI'm so excited I have a great burger option while waiting for my flight to start boarding.  Staff is so super friendly.  Food is fresh and made to order.  \n\nI'm in Toronto a lot so I will be back, many times.
