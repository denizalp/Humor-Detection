well, its not like the original Stuido 54 but what person who actually went to the originally can make it to this one lol well my mother yeppers but she wont be dancing the whatever they danced in 10\" platform and buttwarmerskirts back then :) godblessmymommy!\nBut, this is one of THE funnest and best clubs so far. The drinks are, next to superpricy so chicas get a schmack to pay!, really strong and to fill it up before hand, go to centrifuge bar across the club at the MGM.\nEverytime me and my girly went there, we picked up some hot, or less hot, depending on the eye of the beerholder in the morning, guy.\n\nThe lines are usually superlong, even if you are on the guest list. But being a good looking slim chick with another hot slim chick dressed to the ten's helps you a lot! Even with drunken dudes nearly pucking up Jaegermeister on the poor skinny bouncer dude. \nIt is SO worth it! The girls are cute in there (us for example) and the guys are usually ok looking, so girls and guys: GO\n\nBUT girls!!! CAREFUL: if you have a crazybutt stalker in the club, do NOT rely on the doorguy getting paid $10 an hour to let you out the back door.... so grap your plastik stirring straw for self defense!!!\n\nEdit: Stewie (Promoter) I am not a HOOKER!! Dude... its ok though I forgive you haha
