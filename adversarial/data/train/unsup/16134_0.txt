Located in the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino, they have a pretty good system for patrons where you check in at a podium and then there are a couple different lines to wait in.  In our case, we never had to wait in line I guess because we didn't eat during peak hours.  Customer service was OK.  The first time I ate there, the service was great and we got a lot of attention. The second time, not so much-we had to ask for our drinks twice and the service was slow.  I guess it really depends on who your server is and how busy they are.  \n\nThey have a pretty wide variety of food including Asian, American, Mexican, seafood, pastas, soul food, etc.  Most of their food was alright, some really tasty and some A-OK.  You could tell that some of the food items were sitting there for awhile as the texture wasn't all that great and it didn't taste as fresh.  Overall, this buffet is mediocre.  It's such a shame the quality of food isn't better for being at such an awesome hotel.  I also prefer the dinner buffet over the breakfast buffet.
