We have a lot of restaurants to choose from but when you've had just about everything, it's time to dine at Pita Jungle. We should eat here more often 'cause the food is delicious.\nWe started off with a small plate of Baba Ganoosh. Even tho' it's not mixed to a fine consisitency, it's still good.\nInstead of my usual, Chicken Schwarma, I decided to try something different, Chicken Tikka Masala. The flavor was amazing with a little hint of curry. The chicken was cooked perfectly, was moist, the pea sprouts added that crunch and the brown rice was not overwhelming. My wife ordered the Chicken Schwarma and when she tasted my dish, she said she is going to order that the next time. Her Mango Lemonade was refreshing.\nOur server was being trained and she did an amazing job, making sure we had our drink glasses full.
