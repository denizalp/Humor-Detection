Six of us had breakfast here on Memorial Day. Pancakes, sausages, omelettes, and coffee. \nWhen one of our party requested an egg white omelette, the waitress came back from the kitchen and said they couldn't do an egg white omelette because of the holiday. (?)\nWhen we objected, she went back and then said they would accommodate our request. \nOne of us found the pancakes \"chewy,\" but my fried eggs and hashbrowns were just as you would expect.\nWhen my three year old asked for a pancake with a face, the waitress brought back a pancake with a whipped cream smiley face. \nJust your average neighborhood diner I guess, which is just what we were looking for!
