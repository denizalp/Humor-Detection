Very friendly, they don't have a good system down yet LLLOOOONGGG wait time. So order online and come a little late if it's the weekend. Food is not bad meaty chicken wings good selection of flavors but the fingers are heavily breaded. Some people like that but I like more chicken then bread myself.
