Super cool vibe, great service but uhh your kitchen needs a 101 on French fries... first round came out cold. Not even Luke warm like they were under the heating lamp. Just cold. Sent them back got them back and they were microwaved or since they apparently don't have microwaves they were thrown back in the fryer. Parmesan was completely melted, fries were hard as a rock. I've been in the industry long enough to know better.
