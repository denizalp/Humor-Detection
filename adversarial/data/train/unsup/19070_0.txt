This is far and away my favorite Michael Mina establishment. It ain't steak and it ain't seafood.  It is food created around the seasons for the needs of our ever changing palates, and relying upon what works whenever now is.  Most times we eat at the bar, always (so far) being tended to by one of the greatest bartenders in the world. (IME)\n\nIf I were to eat there tonight, I would first spend 20 minutes sipping at a martini, then this is what I would order:\n\nKobe Beef Tataki, Tempura Bone Marrow, Japanese Cucumber (to start, and order wine to drink while I am eating it)\n\nRed Seabream Cilantro Rice, Rapini, Chorizo Broth (as my entree)\n\nWhile my husband ate this for dessert:\n\nChocolate Banana Pudding Banana Cake, Malted Milk Ice Cream\n\nI would knock back the rest of my wine and sip at a double espresso.\n\n\nUpon leaving we will take Vegas by storm.  We will clean the clocks of every blackjack dealer in our path, and return to our beds just before the sun rises.
