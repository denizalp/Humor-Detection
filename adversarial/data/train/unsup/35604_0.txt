Went there with some friends. Our Chinese friend ordered from the Chinese menu but the American menu with the pictures also looks good. She didn't know about the Chinese menu (I told her!), she always orders from the American menu and was quite satisfied. The inside looks clean, not really your regular looking Chinese restaurant.  Service is a bit slow like some people remarked. They could be a little bit more \"friendly\". Food was very good, very hot. I will go back at lunch or with some family. \n\nMy Chinese friend said it was very popular with Chinese people, we went on a saturday night at 5pm, it wasn't completely full but by the time we left, customers were showing up.
