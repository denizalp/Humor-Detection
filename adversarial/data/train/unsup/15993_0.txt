Lobsicle... a lobster tail on a skewer!\n\nSounds good and looks great, right?\n\nFor the price, I was a bit disappointed. The lobster tail was on the salty side and I finished it in about four bites!\n\nHowever, it was fresh and I didn't have to peel it. \nI chose the grilled lobsicle over the fried version.  It was a novelty item and I'm glad that I satisfied my curiosity.  (It was served on a bed of shredded lettuce, with a lemon wedge and a small container of melted butter.)\n\nNext time we're at the Miracle Mile Shops, I might get a Lobster Roll. I had the lobster mac and cheese in the past and it wasn't bad.  \n\nI realize that this is a shopping mall with possibly higher prices.  That's why I really appreciate the free parking!
