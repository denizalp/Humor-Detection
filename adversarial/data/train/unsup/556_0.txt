Missed opportunity. \nDuring restaurant week you have a chance to grow your business. Why not collect comment cards and ask for e mail s?\nWhy not give a little more and at the end of the meal offer to book the next visit?  The managers in this town have no idea how to drive business. They missed every opportunity. The waiters act like your crappola if you order of the featured menu. We didn't even know that\n this restaurant was participating. We came in blind.  The minute we decided to order from the restaurant week menu we never saw our server again he was not interested. We spend a fortune wining and dining. Nice work.
