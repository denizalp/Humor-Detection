I have been to this restaurant several times and each time the service has been great and the food as well.  My last visit was just as expected.  The free chips and salsa came quickly and it was really good.  I had the combo burrito and enchilada. I spoke a little spanish and the waiter indulged my girlfriend and I by speaking spanish to us while not making fun of our broken spanish.  The whole experience was great and we will be back.
