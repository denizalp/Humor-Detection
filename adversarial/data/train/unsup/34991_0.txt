We came here for breakfast and boy was it good. Our waitress was Maria. She was nice and super helpful. I wanted to order the sourdough hamburger which isn't available until 11:30am according to the menu. But Maria said she could ask the cook and he happily made the burger for me. Yum!! It was cooked to perfection and very flavorful. It came with seasoned fries and they were tasty too. My boyfriend ordered the Ribeye steak and eggs and he ate every bite. My Mom isn't a very big eater and they have a menu for kids and seniors which has smaller portions. She had the grilled cheese with fruit and ate the whole thing. We all had the best food and excellent service. Even though it was busy here she still made us feel very welcomed and satisfied. I recommend Rise and Shine for delicious food and Maria will take great care of you.
