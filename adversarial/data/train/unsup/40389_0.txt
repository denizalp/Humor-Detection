One of the best features of the neighborhood. \nThe deli sandwiches are all fantastic and the pizza slices are pretty decent for the money.\nThey sell eggs from local farmers that have the laid date written in pen on them. The difference in flavor between grocery store eggs is night and day.\nNear the register they always have a selection of Millie's Ice Cream sandwiches, which are brilliant and addictive.
