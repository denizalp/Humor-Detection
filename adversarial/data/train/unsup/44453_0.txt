I was not greeted or helped by anyone.  When I was walking to the counter to pay for my purchases Ilek, Ilick (not sure exactly what her name was) walked to the back.  When she finally came out to ring up my purchases, she said \"Is this yours?\".  I said \"when I can finally pay for them they will be\".  She rolled her eyes.  I decided to leave without purchasing anything.  I will not ever go in this store again and would have given it 0 stars if I could have.
