We eat here a lot over the years and the food is usually great. Today my lunch came out cold. The waiter took it back to the kitchen and brought it back steaming hot about a minute later. Is that good? Yes and no. It was supposed to be hot in the first place AND it was reheated in a microwave oven instead of remaking it. I did't pay for a microwave meal, I paid for a freshly made lunch. Additionally microwave ovens don't belong in any restaurant kitchen. Please throw your microwave oven away or lock it up so your chef can't use it during business hours. It promotes mediocrity and laziness on the kitchens part. I'll be back and hopefully the quality that I have come to expect will be back too. ;-)
