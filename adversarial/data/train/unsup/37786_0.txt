Never cared for their pizza, I consider it more of a flat bread with cheese nuked on top of bread, it doesn't pull away from a pizza like it should.  Gave their wings a try, buffalo style.  They only had two to choose from which kind of sucked.  They said they would be crispy but they were very soggy.  They were a descent size and not horribly priced.  The sauce was straight forward hot sauce, nothing special.  If I was in dyer need of wings I'd hit them up, but nothing close to being anything special.
