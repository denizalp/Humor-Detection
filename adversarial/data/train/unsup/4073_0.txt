Pathetic service. I am an Indian and I know how indian food is supposed to taste like. The food I got served was a joke. The server had the balls to argue with me and tell me that I had no idea how indian food is supposed to taste? Really moron I was born and brought up in India. Wish ok could give a minus rating. Want to save money? Never eat here.
