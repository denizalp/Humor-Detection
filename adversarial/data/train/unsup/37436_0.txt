Our Pomeranian can't leave anything alone...he ripped a huge hole in the carpet. We had it fixed by another company. Could always see the patch that was there. Bothered the dog more than it bothered us. He went at it again! Made it worse. Had it patched again, this time by Las Vegas Carpet Repair & Cleaning, and I can't even tell there was ever a patch there. Awesome job! Thank you!
