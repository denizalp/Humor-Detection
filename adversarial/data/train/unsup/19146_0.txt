Only place I go for noodles now.  Open late till 10 pm everyday.  Cash only, they have no telephone and first come first served.\n\nI like the pad se ew noodles best.  The flat rice noodles are always cooked just right with flavor.  I wish they had a beef option; you can only choose from tofu, chicken or shrimp.  I recommend the shrimp as I did not like the chicken as much.  The tofu is okay.\n\nAlso, the better half likes the street noodle #2.  The tempura shrimp and thin noodles have just enough zing with the small pool of fish sauce on the bottom on the noodles.  \n\nTwo things I ask for:  level 1 spice and add scallions.   The level 1 spice is just right whereas 2 is getting to the point you have to drink water as you eat, it really builds up!\n\nAfter the meal, Millie's Ice Cream is next door if you please.
