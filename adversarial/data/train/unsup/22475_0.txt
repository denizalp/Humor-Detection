**Drinks only**\nPF Changs for me in general is a solid four star place. Love the food (especially the quality and consitency of product) and decor.\nTonight I wanted to grab a quick brew before a Yelp event. NODA Midnight Madness on tap? Impressive. Bartender who waited on me? Not so much. So I was carded. No big deal. All part of the transaction. Then he got a little bit snippy and asked me to take the card out of the clear case in my wallet. Really? I have bifocals and crow's feet. Really? Procedue is one thing, but being a jerk is another. How do I know? No one else, even way younger \"twentysomething\" looking people that came to the bar after me, got carded. I think he realized he crossed a line and tried to backpedal, making a joke. Too late dude. So what did I do? I tipped $2 bucks on a $6 beer. Kill'em with kindness, keep it classy and really make him feel like an ass.
