Immediately upping the quality of dining in Southwest Las Vegas it was only a few days after opening that dinner was enjoyed at The Goodwich on South Buffalo, a location less than a mile from the office making Josh Clark's Sandwich shop with so much more an ideal choice for #supportlocal lunch on Wednesday.\n\nCoordinated with ease by Nichole Hall, an online form plus the budget and a few suggestions crafting what was apparently the new location's first catering gig, it was straight from the hands of Chef Clark that several trays arrived minutes prior to the designated time, everything still temperature appropriate and displayed nicely with descriptive labeling.\n\nA long way from the days in front of Dino's Lounge, creativity never for lack but ingredients from Urban Seed and Michael's Gourmet Pantry allowing flavors to really shine, it was from five Sandwiches and three Sides that attendees were left to choose, the Curry-Malt Vinegar Chips immediately garnering praise for their crispness and big flavors while the \"Cobb-ish\" Salad surprised some with hidden Rice Noodles though every last Leaf, Seed and Nut was gone by the end of the day.\n\nTaking some chances with a crowd that ranges from nineteen year olds to physicians with more than two decades of experience, an immense tray of Macaroni and Cheese dressed up like Elotes making a good impression on a wide range of races thanks to familiar flavors and varied textures, it was surprising that a meatless Sandwich similarly themed was gone within minutes, a light touch of heat playing well off the Sweet Corn while Corn Nuts added crunch between pillowy pieces of Ciabatta.\n\nTold by Josh that change was already underway, an entirely new neighborhood making their likes and desires known as business grows, it seems likely that a Sandwich entitled \"Cheese Bomb\" will remain as a carryover from downtown thanks to the gooey blend of Provolone, Pepperjack and Cheddar while the Patty 2.0 served on toasted Marble Rye should also stick around as it is just as delicious as the Goodwich original, though less heavy thanks to spicy ground Turkey substituted for Beef and Zucchini replacing the Onions. \n\nTaking inspiration from two classic Sandwiches to finish, Jazz Club riffing on New Orleans' famous Muffuletta with Cold Cuts from J Michael Stamm plus Housemade Relish and a smear of Calabrian Sausage, those looking for a truly decadent way to enjoy the afternoon would be wise to invest $16 in Clark's \"Mi Bahn\" that features housemade Pickles and chunky Pate beneath a thick layer of Duck Liver Mousse...and of course who could forget about a Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie or three?
