Ordering process: take a gander at their (bright and blinding) back-lit LED menus lined up in the entry-way, order your food at the counter, pay, they hand you a table number, take a seat, enjoy the smoke show (there was a cloud of smoke surrounding the restaurant, coming from the open kitchen - so much smoke! we felt like we were inside of a haunted mansion lol), they bring the food to your table. \n\nAfter much consideration, my boyfriend and I chose the Gyros, which have: lettuce, chopped red onions, tomatoes, cucumber, feta stuffed into a warm pita bread and topped with the choice of yogurt dill sauce or hummus.\n\nMy boyfriend went with the Traditional (beef\/lamb) beef gyro (with yogurt dill sauce) $7.75 - The meat was more-so on the salty side, but the yogurt dill sauce helped cut the saltiness nicely. The size of this gyro was huge - there was more than enough food for him to become full and satisfied. \n\nI went with the Pomegranate chicken gyro (with yogurt dill sauce) $7.95 - The Pomegranate chicken had a pleasant, slight sweetness to it, but I could barely taste or make out any distinct \"pomegranate\" flavor. It was also charred black on some pieces, overcooked, tough and dry. This gyro was also a generous size - definitely big enough to stuff me silly. Although it was dry, I would most likely dabble in this gyro again.\n\nFor an additional $3.50, I turned my Gyro into a \"Gyro Platter\" which came with: \n- Greek salad - the zesty dressing was very vinegary and they barely gave any feta cheese. Also, the olives tasted great, but they only give you 3 tiny baby olives. \n- Basmati herb rice - the rice was very salty and the grains were extremely dried out. \n- Hummus & pita - the ratio of hummus to pita was un-proportional. The hummus wasn't bad, but they only gave us the tiniest container of it - it's not even substantial enough to comment on. The pita was cut up into 4 tiny points and tasted average. \n\nFor a total of $11+ to turn the gyro into a platter, it wasn't worth it - the extras were not memorable. Just get the gyro, it's more than enough food to get filled up with. \n\nThe yogurt dill sauce is what made the gyros enjoyable. It was refreshing and creamy. Whatever you do, get that sauce and drench the dry pomegranate chicken or the salty gyro meat in it - you will love it!
