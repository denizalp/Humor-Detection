What an amazing exhibit!  Just as advertised, its an amalgam of ancient secrets and modern science. It shows how the modern technology such as CAT scan deciphers what is inside the mummy, it's nature of death, the age of the mummy, it's possible past life, etc. \nit's possible that I had an amazing time because I'm obsessed with the human body. So if you are too, you will have a great time learning. Another great feature is the gallery of human senses and body features. Everyone who is in the medical field or interested in one can spend hours on this floor. They show videos of aneurysm, CABG, spinal surgeries, and so much more. \nArizona Science Center is a must see! The campus is ideal for family, youths and young at heart. Worth the money. Go early as there are tons to see. So easy to spend the whole day there. ENJOY LEARNING!
