Neat and clean corner cafe, with a menu that ranges from diner classics to Vietnamese soups, subs and noodles and a few Western\/Chinese dishes for good measure.\n\nStopped for a quick Banh mi and springrolls last week. Flavor in the sub was good and the price was 'aight, but the amount of sate beef and cilantro was a little below average. Made up for it though, with a nice crispy spring roll (even better when it's shoved dirt-ball style into the sandwich). Service was super fast and the room was bright, and very clean, with lovely orange formica benches.\n\nI'm curious about the greasy spoon specialties: burgers, eggs, etc,. and the service was very friendly and cheerful, so I think I'll be back.
