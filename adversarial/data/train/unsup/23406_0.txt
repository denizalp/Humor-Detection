Avoid this Place, I always avoid reading reviews but be warned. Service not great, unless you don't have a choice then your damned. Please call first to see how long your wait will be as they don't keep\nTime, it goes downhill from here......oh and avoid Dr. Wikler himself and Linda. No people skills or empathy...you might as well\nGo to a veterinarian!
