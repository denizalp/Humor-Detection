In general, I loathe UPMC as a corporation and disagree with many of their business practices. However, when it comes care, I have to say that that I was really happy with my recent surgical experience at Shadyside Hospital. Everything was well organized, from check in to discharge. They have a very simple patient monitoring system that allowed my husband to track where I was at all times. And the best part was that the staff was incredible...so warm, upbeat, kind, and comforting. Nobody looks forward to surgery, so it's nice to be surrounded by caring people when you're going through something like that...makes all the difference!\n\nThe only thing I would change is that I think they should comp parking for surgical patients like Presby does (in fact, Presby even has its own special section in the garage for those undergoing surgery). All Shadyside does is discount your parking to $5.00 for the day. Come on, Shadyside....I'm going under the knife here, throw me a frickin bone and give me free parking!!
