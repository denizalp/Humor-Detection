This is a secret passion for me, but I don't eat them all the time of course. The staff was super busy and so friendly. I ended up with half a dozen since it was cheaper than three individual donuts. Their red velvet donuts are the best, and this one was just as good. The white cream on top of the donut was really what made the donut so tasty.\n\nThe rest of the half dozen was glazed, pink and purple glazed. Out of all the glazed donuts that I have tried Pink Box has the best. Their glazed donuts are so soft and moist. Also, I noticed that their donuts are not as sticky as other donuts.\nIf that is possible, but its great.
