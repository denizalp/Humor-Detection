So unfortunate this is our local Jack In The Box. We live less than a mile away from this location and barley eat at Jack In The Box anymore because the service here is awful. We always come in the drive thru and it's always a rude passive aggressive male. They don't say hi or anything just rudely blurt out the total and never said bye thank you or anything. We used to love Jack In The Box when we lived in Cali but not anymore
