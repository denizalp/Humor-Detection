When my cousin suggested this place for a family dinner I was surprised he'd pick a non Chinese venue , but when I arrived I completely understood. \n\nAlthough it looks otherwise, this place can be categorized as Chinese Western comfort food. \n\nThe place is still reminiscent of whatever the old resto that it used to be. We had the entire back room to ourselves as they tuned in the tv to TVB\n\nThe menu has a usual pub fare, but their speciality is lamb. Lamb leg, lamb shank , rack of lamb. I had the lamb shank, braised and fall off the bone. For $15 comes with soup\/salad (get the soup) mashed potatoes and veggies. Also garlic bread. \n\nThe place is really interesting and a good place to take parents of all ages.
