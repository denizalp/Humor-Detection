Awesome little ice-cream sandwich place in Downtown Summerlin. I love that Vegas has all these cool places to eat from all over the place because we don't have to leave home to try all these amazing food places. \n\nPrices are on the high side but the cookies are always warm and yummy and the ice cream are so good and lots to choose from. Sprinkles topping and drizzle options are available and you must the ice cream taco especially on Taco Tuesday. The best thing ever. The shell is sweet with a hint of cinnamon I think and it's thin and crispy paired with ice cream I mean come on do I need to say more. Some are dipped on chocolate and you get whip cream and sprinkles on top...YES! \n\nAny how on a hot day run here you will be glad you did.
