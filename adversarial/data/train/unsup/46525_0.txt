This review is for the restaurant in the basement of the hotel.  It is called Bucci's Steak house.  For a steakhouse, the menu is limited to one page, and well, there are only a few steaks.  My business partner and I had dinner, both ordered the Filet, Medium rare, $40 a steak.  BOTH steaks were overcooked.  They cooked us both new ones, mine was charred.  At least they took it off the bill.  Selection was limited, service was mediocre at best.  I wish I could give it less then one star.  This is not NEAR the quality of a real steak house. GO ELSEWHERE.
