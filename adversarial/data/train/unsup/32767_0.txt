Popped in while waiting on my flight back to Newport News.  Kinda cozy spot out of the hustle and bustle of the rest of the airport.  A few flat screens to catch up on \"whatever\" is showing.  Horseshoe bar seats plenty.  Bartender was friendly.  Food and drinks available.  Six or seven drafts for those like me that like to take a brew from the tap.  Menu seemed to follow the tropical flair - I didn't eat anything, so no comment there.  Overall a nice place to relax while you wait for that boarding announcement.
