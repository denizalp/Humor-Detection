I've found Kimpton Hotels to be very reliable in terms of condition and service, and this hotel was no exception. \n\nLocation:\n\nThe Palomar is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix. While having a car is nice, if you don't have access to one, this is a great place to stay since it is near public transportation, a convenience store, many restaurants, and various activities. \n\nNearby Transportation:\n\nThe hotel is 1.5 blocks from the Light Rail and the Rapid Transit. Note: the Light Rail picks up at one location and drops off at a different location. The Google Maps app came in handy with navigating the Light Rail. Valet parking is approximately $30\/night.\n\nNearby Convenience Stores:\n\nCVS - 1 block. This came in handy countless times! Note: you will want to head directly to CVS to pick up some toilet paper of your choice if you know what is good for your lady bits.This is the only item where it appears The Hotel Palomar skimped on cost. \n\nNearby Restaurants: \n\nGrabba Green (Smoothies) -  1\/2 block. This place was a Godsend for breakfast. Service was very quick and they have an app if you want to pre-order. Starbucks - ¾ block,  Chipotle - ¾ block, Fractured Prune Donuts -  1\/2 block, The Counter Burger (many gluten free options) - 1.5 blocks, Five Guys - ¾ block, Jimmy Johns - 1 block, Studio Pizza (this place was really great and they have gluten free tapioca crust available) - 1 block, Gypsy Bar  - 1 block, Bitter & Twisted Cocktail Parlor -  1\/2 block, The Arrogant Butcher - ¼ block. The hotel also has an in house restaurant called the Blue Hound and other food options at their pool deck on the 3rd floor. \n\nNearby Activities:\n\n Lucky Strike Bowling - 1 block, Stand Up Live Comedy Club - 1 block,  Canyon  Rock (restaurant with live music) -  1\/2 block, EOS Fitness (free for Kimpton guests) -  1\/2 block if you go out the back door, Orange Theory  - 1 block, US Airways Center - 1.5 blocks, Stadium - 6 blocks?, Crescent Ballroom (music) - .3 miles. \n\nNearby Stores:\n\nUrban Outfitters - 1 block, Charming Charlie (jewelry) - 1 block.\n\nAmenities: \n\nThe room was well appointed with comfy beds, a very clean shower, nice robes, a yoga mat, access to Fitness TV, free WiFi when you sign up for the Kimpton Rewards program, a large umbrella in case of rain (love this!), and let's not forget the coveted makeup mirror! The Hotel Palomar also offers complimentary access to EOS gym directly next door, and a really nice wine happy hour each day. You can also borrow a bike from the front lobby to ride around town.\n\nStaff: \n\nThe staff was fantastic! They easily made some concessions for me as requested, answered many questions, and when I called from the airport concerned that I left behind some jewelry they immediately went to check and called me right back. \n\nCancellation Policy: \n\nThis hotel has a strict cancellation policy. You must cancel prior to when your stay begins, or else you are subject to the cost of one night's stay with taxes. For instance if you are staying M-F, and you want to cancel for Friday, you must cancel the Friday reservation prior to Monday. You cannot cancel after Monday, without being subject to a high fee. \n\nPriice:\n\nThe Government rate was approximately $93\/night in the summer (off season).\n\nI never made it to the pool deck or the in-house restaurant so I cannot comment on those two items.\n\nMy stay was great and I definitely recommend this hotel.
