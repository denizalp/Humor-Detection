Amazing customer service!! I was treated so well here compared to other ultra sound places. This was a bit of a drive for me but well worth it because of how I was treated. I've been to a couple of ultra sound places throughout pregnancy and they were rude and make you feel rushed! My experience here was not all like that! I would highly recommend coming here for anything ultra sound related about your baby. She was crazy sweet! & caring and I loved that! You'll have an amazing personal experience. And that's what pregnancy is all about :)
