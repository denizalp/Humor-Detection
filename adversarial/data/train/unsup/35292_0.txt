First time ordering here, everything was great, the Hawaiian pizza had real pineapple chunks in it that looks like they cut up themselves, not your typical canned pineapple everyone throws on their pizza, The cheese was high quality. I also ordered the Pizza Sub and that mushrooms were fresh, the pepperoni was perfect. lastly the cheesy garlic bread done right also. This could easily go to a 5 star rating if they stay consistent with the quality they are putting out right now. Delivery time was good, they said 45 minutes, and it was about 35-40 minutes. The order taker on the phone was a nice young lady. Delivery guy was friendly.
