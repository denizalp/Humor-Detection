Pizza Me is a nice place to relax and watch a few moments of the game on their big screen HDTV while chewing on your pie. \n\nThe key takeaway for Pizza Me is that their prices at are comparable to Fired Pie on Northsight or My Pie near PV Mall, around $7.50-ish. It's your standard flat 8\" pie with fresh toppings on top. But like anything made with yeast, the taste is in the crust and here, their pie is just okay.\n\nWe ordered two pies, one Regina Margarita and the other their meat lovers.  Topping were on the light side (see photos) and the crust somewhat crunchy and burnt; not soft or chewy as one might expect.\n\nThe folks behind the counter were very friendly and if we were grading on that alone this would be a five star review, but...\n\nExpect to pay around $10 each including drinks, more if you have a salad as we did.  We added a small tip to the receipt, but this is an order and sit down type place.  When your pies are ready, they call out your name and deliver the pizza to your table.  Nice.
