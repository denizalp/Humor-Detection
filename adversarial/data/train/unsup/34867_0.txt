We had tickets to go see Penn & Teller at the Rio. Since the Rio is slightly off the strip, we decided to head over there, grab a bite to eat, and then go see the show. \n\nWe looked at the lounge menu and saw burgers\/sandwiches in the $10-12 range and decided to go for it. Maybe a tad over the odds pricewise, but a downright steal by Vegas standards. \n\nThere were beers listed on the menu, but no wines. I asked the waiter for a wine list. He told me could tell me the wines available by the glass. He rattled off five choices, including two Cabernets. I was not familiar with either of them, but he told me they were \"both from California.\" (I head him telling another customer that about her Chardonnay and have no idea why that was supposed to matter. But, I digress...). I picked one of the Cabernets at random. The waiter told me it was the \"better\" of the two. I had no idea what the price was going be, but figured it was probably, at worst, going to be somewhere in the $9 range. (The beers on the menu were slightly above the odds costwise, but not outrageous.) \n\nImagine my shock when our bill came and I saw we had been charged $16 for a glass of wine!!!  It was a nice enough pour, but I never would have ordered it had I known it was that expensive. Ok, my mistake for not asking. But, really, that had to have been significantly more expensive than the other wines on the menu and the waiter really should have warned us. \n\nYes, our tab ended up being higher than expected, but that does not mean we left a better tip.  We left feeling ripped off and the whole thing put a damper on our evening.  So, what did anybody gain?
