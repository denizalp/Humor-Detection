This place brings out strong feelings among some of my friends.   My opinion?  It's fun, and kinda gives me a \"I brought sexy back\" feeling because I hosted fondue parties in high school for my friends.  Back then no one understood fondue.  Now they pay big $ for it.  I was fondue before fondue was cool.  But anyhow.....\n\nOne friend believes that this is the most fun EVER.  She loves this place like almost nothing else as a place to have a girls night.  \n\nAnother friend thinks it's ok, but unless you get one of the tables with the pot inside of it, it's not so great.  \n\nMy lactose intolerant but cheese loving friend thinks it's the devil.  She blames it for having an entire cheese course in front of her for 20 minutes so of course she had to eat it.  And as someone who carpooled with her on that occasion, I agreed.\n\nAnd yet another friend thinks it's the biggest rip off she's ever seen.  I think it went something like this:\nHer: So, they are giving you cut up veggies and stuff and you dip it into melted cheese?  Are they special veggies, or just what you could get at the store?\nMe: Um, just normal.\nHer: And they bring out raw meat for you to cook yourself?\nMe: Um, yea...\nHer: And if you forget which thing touched the raw meat and you end up putting that in your mouth it's not their fault if you die because they told you to be careful?\nMe: I guess\nHer: And this costs how much???\n\nAnd it was at that point that she and I were on the same page.  So it can be fun, or evil or both (especially the chocolate course!  OH YEA!!!) but in the end there is a part of you that wonders why you paid all the money and did almost all the work.  And for a 3 course meal, you could be there 2 hours easily.  Fine if the date is going good, or you are w\/ good friends, but not a good place for those \"how soon will this be over\" kind of dates...
