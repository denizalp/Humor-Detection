My second visit to he Popcorn Girl left me underwhelmed and over popped!  While the staff is friendly, there were 3 young men in the back room that didn't appear to be employees.  Pop cans and garbage all over the table which was noticeable to customers. I ordered the Carmel corn with nuts, it tasted like it had been made last year,  with the flavor of an old newspaper.  The Carmel corn I like should be chewy with a light Caramel color, this was dark and lacking in flavor almost a burnt taste.  Sorry Popcorn Girl, this will be a no go for me in the future.
