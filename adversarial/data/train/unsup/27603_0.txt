A friend of mine loves seafood and wanted to introduce us to this place after prides festivities this year.\n\nThe location is pretty accessible, in a prime location (spadina and queen).\nThere's limited seating like most Toronto restaurants but most people seem to eat quickly in an out so it was no problem getting seats for our group of 7.\n\nI wasn't feeling too adventurous so both my husband and I got regular fish and chips, which comes with tartar sauce and broccoli coleslaw. ($15)\n\nThe fish itself was pretty simple, wasn't bad, wasn't the best i've had but decent.\nThe fries were yummy as was the\nColeslaw, the coleslaw is what won me over... Yum!!\n\nThe service was pretty quick and efficient, they offer a jug of lemon water for free, which is great on hot days. Unfortunately on this particular visit tasted like it had been left out for a few days... Yuck.\n\nMy friend raves about the crab and shrimp so maybe i'll try that next time!\n\nCute restaurant, Im sure i'll visit again.\n\n3.5\/5
