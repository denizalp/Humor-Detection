As the saying goes...\"you get what you pay for\". 100% true. \n\nYes, the fruits and vegetables here are dirt cheap, and yes sometimes you end up with a moldy potato. But, moral of the story here is you have to double check before you buy anything. If you end up with a moldy potato then that's your own fault for being so oblivious. Stan's Market taught me to be a smarter and more aware shopper. \n\nI'm poor. Stan's Market is cheap. I love Stan's Market.
