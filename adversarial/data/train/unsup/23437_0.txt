Where do I start...I felt like I was getting scammed at this restaurant. The waiter had suggested that I try a little of each dipping sauce for my steak and later charged me for all 3. That was just the beginning...later I came to realize that he falsely promised us to waive the corkage fee for the wine that my party had brought if we were to order the dessert wine. As dinner progressed the service regressed. The waiter and manager started be more short and rude, the food was mediocre and overpriced and it's just a big scam. We were all here for a birthday party and this place managed to upset all 13 guests. For a place that charges 1400 for dinner you would expect a little more hospitality. I have received better service at McDonald's than this place, no wonder why it's off of the strip in an unmarked location. I want my one star back!
