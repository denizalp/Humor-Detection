BEWARE of this place. They have a sign of tip $10 for $20 massage! Sure. That would be understandable. Then today i tried $30 massage for 90 mins. Tried to give her ( emily was her name ) $15 tips which i thought would be apropriate for her work. Then she forced me to give her at least $20 for her tips. ( which i ended up given her anyways ). But really?!? Where is the math ?! And if they want to make more money they should have let the boss pay them more instead of ripping us out like this!!! After the $20 not even she said thank you but she said, \" well thats ok \". Wow. Seriously i dont understand about the manner of this place. Please think about it when you about to step in to this place. We go to several massage place here in vegas but never like this. Absolutely not coming back.
