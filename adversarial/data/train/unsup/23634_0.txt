I just love hanging out in libraries, especially when they are modern and new! The newly renovated Markham Village Branch is triple its original size...they almost torn down the original and rebuilt it from scratch...\n\nEverything is so new here... so spacious... with 12 feet high ceilings, large floor to ceiling windows... it is really good place to chill or even take a nap at one of their individual comfy armchair...\n\nOf course free WIFI access... good reliable and high speed and you never even get logged out ... and numerous outlets...\n\nAnd you can bring in a coffee\/water\/pop or whatever and you don't need to buy anything... and no one will give you mean looks even if you park yourself here for hours.. (uploading photos to yelp or writing reviews) Yes I am writing my 800th yelp reviews right now!\n\nOh almost forget they do have good selections of books and DVD... I have not buy a copy of books for years.. I either put a hold and reserve them online for later pick up or I will just grab some good interesting read off the shelves...\nNot only I saved money and so much more environmentally friendly too..\n\nOf course during school year, there will be a lot of high school students hanging out studying in groups... that do bring back memories......
