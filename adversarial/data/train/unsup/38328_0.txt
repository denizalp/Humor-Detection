Plate presentation is great and as we first eat with our eyes the dishes are already tasty before you even take a bite.  I had a chicken dish that was excellent my sister had the shrimp salad and it was one fantastic looking salad.  Her only complaint was it had only one dressing cup, I am sure they would have brought her another had she ask.  The service was outstanding.  I wish I had my phone so I could have taken some pictures of the plates.
