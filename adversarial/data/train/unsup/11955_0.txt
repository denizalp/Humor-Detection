The food here is great, but I'd probably only order something from here again if I were to get something to go. A group of us ate here on a weekday night and it wasn't too busy. There were only a few tables filled and we were the largest party eating here (5 people). The menu is fairly extensive on a large laminated double sided sheet so that your can use a dry erase marker to mark off what you want to order. We chose a variety of items: Cumin pork, beef chow fun, fried rice, pork and leek dumplings, and scallion pancakes. \n\nEach menu item trickled in one at a time to our table. All the meat items were very tender and well seasoned. I also enjoyed the dumplings whose outer skin was very nicely made. The fried rice had a lot of chopped meat and shrimp in it. I wasn't a fan of the scallion pancakes. While the outer layer was nicely crisp, the whole pancake itself was too thick and doughy for my tastes. \n\nService is really what keeps me from wanting to come back. I understand totally if there is a language barrier, coming from immigrant parents myself, but our server had a dour attitude and made us feel very uncomfortable eating here. She made us feel like we were a burden to her by deciding to eat at the restaurant and giving them our business.
