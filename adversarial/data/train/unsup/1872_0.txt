I saw a segment on Sonoran Living about their teeth whitening.  Since they had a special, (yes, I love deals) I decided to get it.  I booked my appointment online and it was so easy.  Later that day, I stopped by to check the place out, it is on the way to my home.  I decided to book an appointment for my hubby, too.  They are so nice and efficient.  You just sit on a comfy chair while they paint the gel on your teeth and them a lamp.  It was a breeze.  I got my teeth all the way to the whitest they have ever been.  I have not tried their spray tan yet, but I am interested.  They also have a little boutique up front with really cute items.
