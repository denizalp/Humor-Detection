I'm just not entirely sure how I feel about this place. I've been to two Vegas pool parties before- Wet Republic at MGM for 4th July weekend and then Sunday Swim at XS and they were (by far) a million times better than Encore Beach Club.\n\nI didn't have to experience the line thankfully as my girls and I were on the guest list for The Chainsmokers on Saturday. We got in no issues and, because we're not ridiculous enough to lay out thousands of dollars for cabanas or pool lounges, we just left our stuff in a little area near one of the many palm tree circle lounges in the club. I strongly suggest you purchase one of those waterproof pouches for your valuables and just carry them- otherwise your shit might get pilfered or lost.\n\nIt was about 12.30pm by the time we rolled in so it was pretty busy and there seemed to be a lot of dudes with crazy \"I'm the king of the universe\" attitudes. I cannot count the amount of times some a$$hole groped me as I was walking past. Drinks were $21 for a basic vodka and mixer, which I thought was extortion so immediately stopped drinking, and the pool was warm and full of cups, limes and probably other things I don't want to think about.\n\nI struggled to enjoy myself because of the pure douchebaggery of the other patrons. Absolutely no regard for other people. I was shoved and stepped on so many times not only when out of the pool but also while in it!\nThe Chainsmokers were great but we all left halfway through their set, we had tickets to XS for that night anyway so we'd just see them there. \nStaff were very friendly and super helpful. That was the saving grace of the whole experience.
