Party Time, Excellent. \n\nThese guys really helped me out with the last big party that I hosted. My budget is very minimal when it comes to these shindigs and stuff tends to add up very quickly. RSVP was very professional when it came pricing. It's nice to not get nickeled and dimed on every item. \n\nThey have great deals on six-foot tables, belly bars, linen, stanchions, and pretty much anything you could possibly need for hosting your next Quinceanera or Game Of Thrones viewing party. Yes, RSVP has life-like torches and severed heads that you can rent that will really add that extra flair to your GOT nerd out bash.\n\nDay of delivery and next day early am pick-up with no extra charge, I'm into it, but I wish they were clearer on delivery times. They give you a large time range; mine was 8am - 1:30pm. Make sure you're clear on the start of your party or this could be a big hiccup, also their payment is a tad funky. \n\nI was told to make a deposit in order to hold the party date and the items I needed. I did this about month before the party and was also told to make the remaining payment day of delivery, which I thought was weird, but OK. The Friday before the event I'm making few calls to vendors to verify other delivery. I call RSVP and I'm told if I don't make a payment by E.O.D. my order would be removed, wow thankfully I just happen to call. I'm surprised RSVP doesn't have a plan in place for people who haven't made their final payment. \n\nThis small mistake would have had made for dire consequences. How very Game Of Thrones. Minus this situation, everything else with RSVP Party Rentals was the cat's jam jams.
