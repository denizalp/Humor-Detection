This place is new so I thought to give it a try. They charge $35 for 60 minutes, $39 for 75 minutes and $49 for 90 minutes. So I choose the 75 minutes. I\nHere is where it went downhill:\n1. She started at 5:50pm. Didn't have all the techniques down. She spent the first five of minutes just purely putting lotion. Not actually massaging the lotion in. \n2. After the feet massage, she asked me to lay down and took the bucket of water away (at 6pm). She went outside and checked her text messages because I could hear her in the next area sending the messages on a  iphone. I picked up my phone and started looking through messages and realized it's been at least 10 minutes and there's no sign of her coming back. I dropped my phone on the floor trying to get up and she hurried back. She didn't bring anything with her. She just sat down the asked me to lay back down. \n3. Rest of the massage was also ok. I kept asking her to go stronger and sometimes it was good techniques but most of the time it was just putting pressure using the base of her hands than using her fingers.\n4. She ended right at 7:01pm. By that time, I'm ready to leave (note, not a full 75 minutes massage)\n5. Another lady came out from massaging another person and helped with the credit card payment. She asked if I wanted to tip cash, I said no, credit card only. She asked how much, I said $6, which is 15.4% tip for a service I didn't really care for and know I'm not coming back again. I don't mind paying a tip because the lady still massage me and I know I'm not coming back ever again so they will ever only get 6 tip from me...  BUT\n**** the lady pulls out this tip sheet and it shows happy, tip is $10, very happy tip is $15 and super happy tip is $20. She said that if I'm okay with the massage, I should tip $10. And the lady who massaged me was standing right there watching this whole interaction. \nMinimum tip is $10??? On a $39 bill, that'd 25.6%. \nSo I said no because i didnt enjoy the massage at all and it wasn't good. And despite that, they still insisted on the tip rather than apologizing for bad massage. The minimum tip had to be $10. So I said I'll pay on 6 or nothing. And yes, they tried the whole can't speak English so I spoke to them in mandarin and as soon as they realized I could speak mandarin, they didn't want to persist. This place is a complete rip off and you can't make people pay or feel bad for not tipping.  Not only that, looking at their tip menu, they are out of their mind!! CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!!!
