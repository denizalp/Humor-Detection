The Mirage may be a little past it's prime, but it still does offer a great place to stay while in Vegas.  I always think of Clark Griswold when I walk in here - what a feeling!  It is a fairly standard resort with casino, hotel, pools, various restaurants and plenty of entertainment. \nIt isn't as nice as the other high end hotels on the strip, but it's location can't be beat.  The rooms are all decent sized and somewhat updated.  Ask for a room on 24\/25 or the lettered suites.  The elevators are way quicker and the floors seem to be quieter.\nThe casino is pretty large and for the most part isn't too smoky.  There are two large sections of table games and blackjack is $10 min during the days, $15 at night.  Slots are plentiful, but they don't have some of the newer machines that other casinos have.\nHeritage Steak is amazing and should be on your list of restaurants to try.  The Beatles LOVE show was an awesome experience!  We planned a full day of entertainment and didn't have to leave the property! \nService was hit or miss, but that was expected at this price point.
