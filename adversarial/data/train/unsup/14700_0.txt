My daughter and I enjoyed their ramen here.  I didn't want any pork on our ramen so when I asked if we can substitute the pork for more veggies, they said no, we can only order an extra side of veggies.  \n\nWe got there on a Saturday around 2pm and we waited for about 15 minutes.  The place was small, clean and the waiters just want to serve and turn the tables over.  My daughter ordered the following:\n\nTonkotsu Shoyu Ramen ($7) - The portion was not very big but for $7, it's not bad.  The broth was flavorful and the veggies were cooked perfectly.  \n\nI will go again but since there are lots of other ramen places in Las Vegas, I'll try others first.
