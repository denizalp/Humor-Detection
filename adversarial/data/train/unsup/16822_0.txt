Very disappointing experience - first time flying Porter Air.\n\nTrip from Newark Airport to Toronto was fine.   Old prop planes - no wifi.   No big deal - short flight.   The B Gates where Porter is located at Newark is rather sad but adequate.   Decent first experience flying to Toronto - not wow but not disappointing.\n\nFlying back was very disappointing.   Flight delay information in email differed from what was on the website.   Tried to get clarification at Check-in where a very unprofessional gentleman behaved inappropriately.   He refused to give his name and said he was sending me for additional security screening (SSSS) - I was shocked by his behavior.   I asked an agent in the lounge area to give me the check-in agents name so I could file a complaint and she said all she'd give me is his agent ID (3121) and she said more than once that I was having a bad day and she hoped my day would get better - I felt that too was unprofessional (and she too wouldn't provide any identifying information - nobody wears name badges or anything).\n\nI've always had very good experiences with Air Canada and I have elite status with the variance alliances so all in all while City Airport is nice, I prefer to fly on a more professionally run airline.
