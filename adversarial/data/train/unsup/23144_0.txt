Worse show i ever watched in Vegas, place is LOUD, really loud it hurt your ears, sound like skrillex messing with a blender next to your ears.  they are like a budge theater, they let guests use recycled chairs from the 80s, dirty table, everything is a gross the whole theater is level so if you sit in the back you will not be able to see anything.  for $50 per person is a rip off, the TV screen show nothing but computer screen saver, the shows are boring, the girls aren't even into it.\n\nsave your money and watch youtube at home for free
