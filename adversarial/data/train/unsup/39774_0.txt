I was looking for a fast meal and stopped in here for a lamb shawarma. There was no one else there, so it got made pretty fast. I thought the meat was seasoned and cooked well, although if you get every additional component that they offer (which I did), it can get drowned out depending on how well mixed everything is inside. I found that the meat got stuck on one side, but those things are huge, so it's hard to fit it all in your mouth for a bite. The place is all the way in the back of a parking lot and is kind of squished on either side, so you might miss it if you're not paying attention.
