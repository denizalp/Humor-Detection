Yep, a line before they open! Lucky us we got a counter space! A line on a Monday way out in a Vegas suburb?  \n\nIt's a small modest store with a few tables and counter space. A very darling homemade sign lists a few menu items. \n\nThe Kimchi fried rice was delicious. A little MSG won't hurt you. The Black Garlic ramen was smashing! Service was super! The prices a reasonable!\n\nIt was a $40 round trip ride share fare from The Strip, however I will be back!
