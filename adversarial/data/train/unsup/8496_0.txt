Initially I didn't like the Monte Carlo because of the hard beds, horrible shower head and thin walls. But MC keeps throwing free nights at me and I'm a sucker for free. Eventually I got better beds and further away from noise so I'm much more amenable. \n\nBut damnits, what the hell is up with the shower head pressure??? You don't shower, you end up sanding your skin clean layer by layer. Another annoyance, they charge $15 resort fee but don't even offer Wifi. How outdated! \n\nThe pool area is the smaller version of the Mandalay Bay. It has a lazy river and volleyball beach area. BYOT! (bring your own tube) It's wonderful when it's not-so crowded!\n\nI like the location, walkable to lots of casinos, UA movie theater and shopping!
