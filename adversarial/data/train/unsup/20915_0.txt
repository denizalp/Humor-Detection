When I first started coming here in the summer of 2008, I really liked it.  I loved my dentist, Dr. Montana Skyler.  I had been jumping around with dentists for awhile now since I can't find one that I like.  Dr. Skyler was kind and explained everything to me.\n\nHowever, I have spents thousands there in the past 12-18 months.  (Seriously between $5000-7000).  Twice I have had extra problems that have needed additional work on teeth that were repaired by them to begin with.  I'm not sure why a tooth they had to put a cap on then needed to be extracted and a new crown put on within a year.  Very expensive!  Another crown is needed with a bridge and I went through the process of having the temporary, etc.  Then when I went for my final appointment for them to put the permanent on (well, the first time the permanent didn't fit correctly and they had to redo it) they told me that now I needed a root canal so I should wait to have the permanent bridge.  How did they just notice then that I needed a root canal?  And since when does a root canal cost $1500?  So I have still not gotten that done because it's just too expensive and it has yet to start hurting.  I also have an infection right now on another tooth that they capped for me last year.\n\nIt seems kind of fishy that every time I go in there, there is always something worse that needs to be fixed.  \n\nThey also did not tell my daughter's father that silver fillings were an option and instead he paid $100 each to have 2 white fillings done on the back top teeth (that will be falling out in a few years anyway!)  The dentist had always told me that it is not worth the extra money to have white put on the top back teeth.  This office just always seems to be wanting to make an extra buck.\n\nI also have a friend who went in for a root canal.  They drilled on the wrong tooth!  He left there and went elsewhere.  He was sooo mad!\n\nThe office manager\/billing manager is extremely rude.  She has zero customer service skills.  She told me that the nitrous gas would be $50 for my daughter.  Then she \"nicely\" said that she would comp it.  I called my insurance company and they said that she is incorrect and that the nitrous is only $10.  When I called her to ask why she was giving me the wrong price information, her answer was \"But I comped it!\"  Big deal!!  It was only $10.  She made it seem like she was comping me $50.\n\nAlso, Dr. Skyler has not been there.  I'm not sure where he has gone.\n\nI wanted to love this place, but they seem to be really shady.  I would not recommend them to anyone!
