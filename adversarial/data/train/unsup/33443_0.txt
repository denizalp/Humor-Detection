Pretty good, especially if you're hungover. Gigantic portions, decent prices, great service, tacky atmosphere, cocktails that will make you holla and the wait wasn't bad at all. I ordered the corned beef hash, which is the junky stuff and that made us happy. I only wished it came with some rice, but omg the blueberry muffin was bombbbbb. We all shared a stack of pancakes and to be honest it felt a little flat to me. It was tough and just didn't hit the spot for me, although they were large and looked delicious.
