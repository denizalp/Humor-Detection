I needed to have a dishwasher installed and read the reviews before deciding on Plumbing Experts.  My experience echoed the outstanding reports he got from others.  The owner, Aaron, was prompt, efficient, and courteous.  He explained what he did to improve the hookup over the last dishwasher we had and went over the details of the charges with me.  I wouldn't hesitate to call him again.
