I made an appointment last month with Cody for a haircut. The salon is located on the beach level near Mandalay Beach entrance. I showed up a few minutes before and was taken back about 5 minutes after my appointment time. Cody was great about listening to what I wanted and making suggestions. Loved the shampoo job and the haircut. He did exactly what I was hoping for with my hair and I had a lot of fun talking to him. Would definitely go back!
