I can't say that I'm a hotdog connoisseur but every once and a while I do get the craving for a good hot dog.   I don't eat beef or pork, so I can only eat chicken, turkey or vegetarian hotdogs.  My friend John and I were on our way to meet our friend to go bowling and I decided to stop by Maui Dogs and Slider. \n\nThey  just had a soft opening, but I wanted to review them right away so people can find out about this place. \nThe atmosphere, is very hawaiian and they have all kinds of   fruit relish with different   combination of mango, coconut, pineapple or banana. They have  a signature mustard being flavored with passionfruit. I tried their turkey hotdog with avocado and some sweet and spicy relish.It was pretty good. \nThe only way it could get better is if they had beer on tap.  Maui Dog  is definitely a winner in the wiener category!\n\nUpdate: (6\/9\/2011)  I've stopped eating chicken & turkey for 8 months now, so I haven't been back.
