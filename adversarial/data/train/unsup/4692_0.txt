Oh my god. This is bad. They hardly speak English. The food tastes like somebody with no idea threw it together. But the highlight: they charge you a 20%\nTip for their bad service.\nHey! I'd like to choose how much I tip. They just take 20% from you! Didn't like the service? No problem they charge you 20%. Absolute scum! Stay away from\nThis business! You have been\nWarned!
