I was appalled by the lackluster service we received at SW Steakhouse. For one of the Wynn restaurants, I expected much better. \n\nFirst off, we had to wait 10 minutes just to be seated at our table (even with a reservation). Given there was a crowded entryway in the restaurant, I could forgive this if it were not for the service to follow. It took 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive and an hour just to take our orders. It would have taken even longer had I not been tracking the waiter down with my eyes and giving her meaningful looks to come over to our table. Basically, my party of 6 had to wait ~1.5 hours for any food to hit our table.\n\nThe food itself was great but didn't blow me away compared to other steakhouses. I had the Tuscan Kale salad and the bone-in rib eye. The ambiance was entertaining with the waterfall show and we were seated outside as per my request.\n\nEverything but the service met my expectations. But for the price of the food, that kind of service is just inexcusable. I love the Wynn but not this restaurant.
