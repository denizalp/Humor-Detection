Leslie Zak is pure evil. I understand not sugar coating things, no. This woman is evil. She says rude remarks throughout your entire visit and is rough! A rough gyno is a no go lol. She got mad at me for not answering her questions quickly enough! Terrible bedside manners and their office is dirty as fuck. Not to mention, she doesn't listen to a single thing you say & treats you like an idiot when you ask questions. I have never left a doctors office crying in my life but I left crying and pissed off.
