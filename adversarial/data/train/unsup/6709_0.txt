Service (5\/5): In one word: exquisite. I wish I remembered our waiter's name (i was drunk) because he was absolutely terrific. He explained every dish in detail and when we asked how good an item on the menu was, he described each perfectly. He really made the experience at Hell's Kitchen a great one. I'm a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay, and coming here exceeded my expectation. It's definitely an experience I think anyone who appreciates good food and fine dining should go to. \n\nFood (5\/5): In one word: divine. LITERALLY everything we tried was DELICIOUS. My tastebuds went on a trip. Undoubtedly the best meal I've ever had in my young 22 years of life. \n\nAmbiance (5\/5): In one word: immersive.\n\nPrice (5\/5): In one word: expensive, lol. To be fair, my boyfriend ordered 7 dishes (i think) for $400+.
