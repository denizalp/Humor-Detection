Koko Bakery reminds me a lot of Asian bakeries back home in Southern California. I love stopping by here every time I'm in the area and stock up on some delicious Asian pastries :) \n\nMy favorite pastries include: \n- Pineapple bun (bo lo bao): Very crispy layer of pineapple-flavored crust on top of a piece of bread. \n- Crispy bun with sour vegetables and pork: this sounds very unappetizing, but trust me, it is bomb[dot]com :D\n- Pork sun rice roll: this is like a large sushi, with pork sun in the middle! I love pork sun in anything, so this was pretty much a given. \nAll of the pastries are priced around $1, so they're very affordable! \n\nThis is one of the few places that sell bubble tea in Cleveland, which kinda sucks :( I loved getting my weekly fix of boba back in LA, but Koko just doesn't do it for me, unfortunately! I've gotten the taro, Thai, Hong Kong, strawberry, and honeydew milk teas. All of them were hugely disappointing because they were just too sweet. Even if you add in more ice, the oober sweetness does not go away :( I guess I'd just have to wait until I visit Southern California to get some authentic milk teas! Despite this, I still love coming here for the pastries :)
