Good food, indoor and outdoor seating, Bellinis and Mimosas on the menu. Unfortunately, I was turned off by the claustrophobic feeling as soon as I walked in. This place had a line almost to the back of the cafe, & seating was limited so one of us had to swoop in on an empty table and sit down while the other stood in line to order. \n\nOnce we sat down, it took forever to get our food. When it finally arrived, it wasn't what I ordered. And we had no silverware. Or condiments. So I'm waiting on my meal, my mom is sitting there trying to be patient and not eat without me. The saving grace was that my food was yummy once I received it. \n\nThis was a Sunday morning\/early afternoon, so I get that it's going to be busy. I'd like to come during the week when it isn't so crowded.
