I was really excited to go here after buying a groupon. I received a voicemail reminder about sending an email with pictures of the dogs we wanted to paint as they were hosting pop art your pet. I attempted to call back the next day and was unsuccessful in reaching the owners. They did not respond to my voicemail or emails and I wasted 50 dollars with still no communication. Very disappointed as I had a friend go and had race reviews.
