For this review, I will simply cut\/paste my letter I sent to Lexus regarding my recent 60,000 mile \"service.\" Simply put, if you don't mind paying $600 for a \"service\", then feel free to use these criminals.\n\n\"We recently had a 60,000 mile service performed at Bell Lexus in Phoenix. I am completely appalled at the prices your company and this dealer charged us. $386.82 for what amounts to a glorified oil change. I feel like I need a police officer, since I was just robbed. There is nothing done in this service that isn't done by a standard Jiffy Lube oil change for $40.\n\nLabor costs of $257.40 for a couple hours (if that much) of checking and topping off fluids!!?? Is this some kind of sick joke??\n\n$125 to program a key that already cost us hundreds of dollars??? 10 seconds of typing onto a keyboard for $125??\n\nMy total bill breakdown is $444.90 of labor, $169.37 parts. (that include some oil and 2 wiper blades)Another $40 of \"misc charges\". \n\nI am appalled, and will NEVER visit any Lexus dealer for any kind of service again. And I will post my bill information on every review site I can find. \n\nYour company should be ashamed and embarassed. And no, some kid in a tux with a muffin and coffee when I arrive does NOT help.\n\nJeff Clay\nInvoice # LECS210612\nInvoice date 6\/23\/10\"
