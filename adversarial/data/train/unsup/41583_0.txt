I joined this gym about three years ago.  It is really a great gym! They have all the cardio equipment, free weights, and machines you need.  The staff is very friendly and the gym is very CLEAN (not only does the staff and members clean the equipment but they also have a cleaning service weekly)!  They offer personal training and it does not hurt that the gym is 24hours (which means no excuses on not going). The membership is very reasonable compared to the gyms around town.  Definitely try Anytime Fitness you will not regret it.
