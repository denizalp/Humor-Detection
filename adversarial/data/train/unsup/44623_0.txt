They messed up my appointment. My wife and I thought we booked 2 appointmentents but only had 1. Odd though that the person booking us, in person the week before, gave us paperwork for both to fill out. Things happen, I understand, but to not even offer an appology or attempt to accomodate was rude. Their behaivor leads me to believe this is a frequent occurance. I'll never return their and will make a point to relay this to others if asked about where to go for an eye exam. Terrible customer service.
