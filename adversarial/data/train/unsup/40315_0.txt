4 customers in store Saturday at 5 pm (and about 10 teenagers who didn't seem to be customers). Ordered a smoothie with couple additives (spinach and protein). Took over 15 minutes for order to be made and we were second customer. No smoothies were made for any customers the first 10 min there. They were calling out names of people that weren't there to see if they still needed to make drinks because order receipts weren't organized (I assume they were earlier patrons). One lady behind us got a return and left because of wait, but we weren't in rush so we stayed. When drink can't it tasted good (although not sure it contained additives- I couldn't see any green particles for spinach we ordered and by default I had to assume no protein in shake). Not sure I'll return, had two experiences with not the best service. They tried hard and were understaffed but I think we will go somewhere else next time. $10 for a smoothie with this experience just isn't worth it.
