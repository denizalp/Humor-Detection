I called to have my carpets cleaned in 3 very small rooms. The man who answered was extremely rude right away. By the end of the call he told me to clean my carpets myself. The man automatically assumed it was a 2 bedroom apartment with a living room, hallway, and dining room, so I'd need to have 5 rooms cleaned, not 3. He was wrong to assume and very rude about it. I will absolutely not ever use this company to have my carpets cleaned.
