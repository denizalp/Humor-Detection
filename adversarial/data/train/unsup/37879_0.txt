Service was good when I could get it but they tried to sell you parts not really needed - e.g. run capacitor.   Scheduling is always an issue with these folks, even when you have a maintenance agreement.  Better figure on three months out and you have to call them to schedule the appointment.  I'm done - finding a closer service provider.
