My second time to the Dim Sum truck was very disappointing. I ordered the shrimp and pork dumplings, steamed pork bun, mango bubble tea and coco perle. The shrimp and pork were alright - large, juicy and served hot, but they are served in the same tray as the salad. The hot salad with sweet dressing was disgusting by the time I got back to the office to eat it. The pork buns were hard and cold. I couldn't eat them. The coco perle that I loved so much the first time I had them were not chewy at all. They were nuked in the micro wave before serving them to me and became hard - very hard, almost crumbly. I couldn't eat it. Total disappointment. The bubble tea was warm - no ice and flavourless. It was the colour of mango bubble tea but was watery and really no flavour. There were about 6 bubbles (tapico pearls) in the drink total. Bummer. Lunch cost me $20. I feel really ripped off.
