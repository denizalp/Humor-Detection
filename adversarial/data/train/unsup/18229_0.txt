Had a real awful meal here.  Was excited based on the review and menu, which features huevos rancheros.  We both ordered huevos, the first order came out about 20 minutes before the second, turning a quick breakfast into an awkward ordeal where one of us was done ages before the other.\n\nBoth had the same traits -- eggs WAY over done (what's so hard about an over easy egg?), smothered in cheese and what seemed like ortega salsa.  Unaltered black beans straight from the can.  A couple corn tortillas underneath.  Totally lacking in inspiration and effort.  \n\nThe equivalent of a 15th century artist who never saw a manatee sketching a picture based on oral accounts... wanting huevos and getting a sea monster...
