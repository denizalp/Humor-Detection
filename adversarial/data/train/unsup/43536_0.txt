I've been to Red Rock many times, but I haven't visited their pool until the other day. They play upbeat music and there's a beautiful fountain in the middle of the pool. There are plenty of chairs and cabanas, as well as chairs in the pool. There is also a cafe next to the pool called The Sand Bar. For those interested, they offer poolside casino and table games. The pool wasn't very warm, but then again it's only the beginning of April. The pool temperature may be different during the hot summer months. Cleanliness matters more than temperature to me, and the pools were very clean. The staff was friendly and I had a blast!
