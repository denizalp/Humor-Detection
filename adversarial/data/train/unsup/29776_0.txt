So Dentists ... Well I have to say Dr. McAdams is the Bomb!  I had (of course) an emergency on a Wed and needed help fast.  We are new to Phoenix so where to turn?  Yelp!\n\nMcAdams Dental was first on the list so we called and I was lucky enough to get the Dr. personally on the phone, on his day off to invite me down.  After an exam, 2 X-Rays and TWO! extractions in no time flat I have to say if you can somehow make the visit to Dr. Don, do it. He has a manner like no other dentist or doctor I have ever met. The experience was actually a nice, right nice, experience.   The office, staff and the work was all top notch and friendly. \n\nIt feels funny talking nice about going to the dentist, but really ... just call them.
