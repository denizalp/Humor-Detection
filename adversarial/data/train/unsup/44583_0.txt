Btreakfast was good. Not great, but good. we did eat there 3 times for breakfast last week while in vegas. However, Tuesday night is seafood night and I would not recommend it. very poor buffet for dinner, especially when my mother came back to the tabel and told me she saw a guy about twenty something years old touching the food with his hands. beware!
