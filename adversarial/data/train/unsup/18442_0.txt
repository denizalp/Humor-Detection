Surprisingly, I haven't heard much about the oxtail soup here. Not until a friend from Hawai'i who was in town said she heard this is THE place to get the best oxtail soup in Vegas. We'll see. Btw... when rating oxtail soup, I'm spoiled with homemade Jamaican Oxtail Stew. Stew over soup all the way. \n\nOkay, before I get into the oxtail, come here for the cafe NOT the buffet. \n\nThe buffet is gross and it has limited selection. PLUS, the cafe line is shorter. If you're looking for a buffet in DTLV go to Main Street. If Main Street has a long line (usually Fridays for crab legs, get there before they open, if i'm not mistaken dinner opens at 4pm) If the line is long there, go check out the DTLV restaurants outside of the casino area. New and delish spots opening up. :-) They're walking distance. \n\nTIP: Usually there's a line and wait at The Cal's cafe (Market Street Cafe), so come here if you want Oxtail soup. \n\nThe oxtail soup bowl - Comparing to The Cal's... Paradise Cafe's has a larger serving for a regular size, the photo doesn't do it justice! More oxtail, more vegetables, nuts (nice touch), more cilantro and green onions. It comes with a side of ginger and two scoops of rice. In some ways it is better. Larger portions. \n\nOxtail is good during cooler months, but when it's warm out...the sandwiches & local food are the way to go. Reuben was packed with corned beef but it needed more sauerkraut & sauce. Comes with salt & pepper fries. Flavor and quality is not like the deli but it's decent. For Hawai'ian cafes that serve Reuben's I still prefer The Cal's. \n\n2017 Yelp Challenge Review #3
