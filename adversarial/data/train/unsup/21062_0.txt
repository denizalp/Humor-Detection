Before you judge me on my two stars, hear me out!!!\n\nThe store was semi-disorganized and it made me feel chlosterphobic.  I was there in search of sandals at a decent price.  And when I say decent I mean under or right at $20 bucks.  The shoes were displayed neatly but the boxes underneath them??  All over the place.  some of the shoes were put back in the wrong spot.  Frustrating.  I hate having to hunt for red october and locate items in random places.  Needless to say I was over hunting for shoes under $20.\n\nI moved on to slippers.  Found some for under $10.  Score!  That makes up for the shoe fiasco.  Moved on to jean shorts and was immediately turned off by the disorganized clothing racks.  I took my $7 slippers to the counter and checked out.  I was over it by this time.\n\nMaybe I should give myself 1 star and not the store.  I just hate going in here because it's never really organzied and I find myself wanting to clean up instead of shopping.  I have issues.
