I used the Groupon to try a dozen cookies. They had exactly a dozen flavours so that was perfect. I found I preferred the non-chocolate shortbread dough, but perhaps that's just a personal preference. All of the flavours were good and tasted as though they were made with quality ingredients. The packaging was lovely, the shop itself is very cute, the counter person was very warm and friendly and even gave me a bonus cookie. Good experience all around and would recommend for a gift or special occasion.
