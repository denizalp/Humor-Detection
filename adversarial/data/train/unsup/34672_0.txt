Let me start by saying that this was my first time ordering from this location.  Ordering over the phone was quick and easy.  \n\nMy issue with this location occurred when I stopped in to pick up my order.  When I walked through the door, the man working the counter looked at me and said \"I guess you got the Eco Buster\".  Which was correct, however he did not bother to ask how I was or if I would like anything else, he just walked to the back.  So about five minutes later, the employee came back up to the counter and began ringing my order up on the register.  I asked for garlic sauce and the employee just looked at me and then proceeded to walk to the back.  Again, no reply!  Nothing like sure, absolutely or even just one moment while I go get that for you.  When the employee returned to the counter and provided me with a total, that was the end of our conversation.  No \"have a good day\", or anything like that.\nNow customer service is what keeps me coming back.  This employee was anything but pleasant.  \n\nNow on to the food.  It was just okay for me!  The white pizza had almost no flavor to it.  The only part that stood out was the steak hoagie.  If I decide to ever order from this location again, that's probably the only thing I would get again.  I would much rather travel to another pizza place than go back to Vocelli's.
