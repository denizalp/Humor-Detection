Before I tried Komex - which my brother has been raving about for years - I thought I hated \"fusion.\"  Every fusion thing I had tried before was gross.  But, because it is my brother's favorite place, I went into it with an open mind.\n\nThere are vegetarian options (tofu, veggies, bean & cheese), but it seems like this place is more of a winner for the meat-eaters.\n\nI had the cheese enchiladas (not fusion style) and the seasoned fries.  (The menu has fusion stuff, just Mexican stuff, Asian stuff, and American stuff.)  My plan was to make my own fusion - enchiladas and fries!  Who does that!  No one!  Fusion!  I got a side of kimchi as well, in case I felt like getting real nuts.  (My brother got a side of the stir fried kimchi ($2) and this is way better than the normal kimchi - go for it.)\n\nThe enchiladas by themselves were nothing special.  I think they had mozzarella cheese on them, which was weird.  There was just too much cheese in general.  Beans were good though.  I tried some bites with kimchi, and it was a winner.\n\nThe fries were great though.  I put some of the sauces they give you on the fries, along with some of my side of kimchi, and they were booooommmmb.  This should be something you can order - feel free to call it \"Leslie's Favorite.\" \n\nBecause of this good experience, next time I'd be willing to try an actual fusion item - which is a big step because before Komex I had sworn off ever trying anything fusion again.\n\nService was great, but I didn't like all the people waiting for a table staring me down while I was trying to enjoy my meal - put those suckers behind a screen or something!
