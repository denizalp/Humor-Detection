I would go back if their food was actually good. I have been to zips sports bar many many times and I make it a point now to just enjoy the atmosphere and drinks. Which that's why a lot of people go but I don't think their zipparitas (margaritas) are the best and their beer selection isn't the greatest, let alone their prices on them. \n\nI would have given a 1 star but I know a lot of friends still go here and they do have a fun looking place with TV's everywhere and pool tables. They have a nice patio as well. \n\nI just usually go somewhere for food and drinks and if both aren't the best it's hard to go back even if the atmosphere is fun.
