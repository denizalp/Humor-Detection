Very nice restaurant, great service, was not crazy about the food. \nThe grilled octopus was so tough we could hardly chew it. It wasn't the way it was cooked, I think it was simply not fresh. For that price I was expecting the freshest seafood. \nOur fish was fresh but super simply executed, fried, with no side orders or any special sauces. \nCan't understand the popularity of this place.
