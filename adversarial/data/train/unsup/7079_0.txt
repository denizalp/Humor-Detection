Fast food. Literally, that's all you'll really get. \n\nI've been here a few times now and I think the novelty has worn off. I get it, you make sandwiches very quickly and for the most part they're mediocre and a tad overpriced. \n\nMy most recent visit here had me craving a tuna sandwich with sprouts. After staring down at my belly for a brief moment and wondering if in 9 months I would become a scientific anomaly, I walked up and ordered said sandwich from the emotionless cashier. After waiting what seemed like an eternity (2 minutes, which is long for this place) I hungrily unwrapped my sammie and discovered this thing was about 50% bread, 20% lettuce, 15% sprouts, 5% cheese, and the rest was made up of tuna salad. I was pretty disappointed in this, because in my past visits, my sammie has been a lot more evenly distributed and hearty. \n\nI dug through what could only be described as the front yard of an unkempt lawn and I finally found the base of this sandwich. The bread was a little tough and not easy to bite through. I'm not too fond of of their bread here anyways and I wish they had more carb loaded hoagie options other than white bread. They do carry different bread options, but no hoagie shaped variations. The tuna was... well... not my favorite and it had a taste that was a little off. I'm still live today and I feel fine, so it wasn't a \"fresh thing\". It was just a flavor thing, lots of onions. Not my bag baby! \n\nLike mentioned earlier in this review, what's with the emotionless cashiers?... \"Just give me your order, your money, and step aside bro.\",  I'm not complaining, but just an observation. I don't think I will be back to Jimmy John's anytime soon unless I need a turkey sandwich made in less than 1 minute. I will probably just got to Port of Subs and wait 4 minutes for it, gives me some time to check emails.\n\nThis is really a 2.5 star review, but their bathroom humor earned that extra .5.
