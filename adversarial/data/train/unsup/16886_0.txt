We are questing for decent dog parks close to home and decided to check this one out.  We had been to Sahuaro Ranch Park for a party at one of the ramadas.  The park is pretty nice, so we figured we would try the section for pooches.\n\nBest to access this park off 63rd Avenue.  There's a parking lot right by the entrance, which is always nice when you have a crazed beast or two looking to get inside to romp with new friends.  One of my boys weighs 90 lbs and the other weighs 25 but things he weighs 75, so we checked out the big dog side, where we found everyone from a Pomeranian to a Great Dane.  \n\nThere are a few benches scattered around the park and agility pieces are set up along the west and north sides of the big dog enclosure.  The little one seems to have them scattered throughout.  We were there at night, but there are trees, so I'm guessing shade.\n\nMy only complaint was not with the park, but as usual, the people.  Little kids running loose and grabbing at dogs; such a recipe for disaster.  Thankfully, my dogs like (or at least tolerate) kids.  I only know this because of the numerous times we've gone to DOG parks and encountered little kids.  \n\nThat wasn't the reason for our early departure though.  That would have been the gentleman who arrived with two dogs, one of them a female in heat.  I know the dog was in heat because the woman who was not watching her small children was busy talking to this guy about the dog birds-and-bees while the poor girl dog was running around the park with a pack of male dogs right on her tail.  Dog in heat + dog sausage fest = bad news.
