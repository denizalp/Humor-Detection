Such a disappointing night today. I've been a regular customer at Gal's for some time but today was just disappointing. First my family and myself got seated but we were given just the menus and no tea, I had to ask for it for someone to bring it to me. Then our food came but we weren't given any of the appetizers so again, we had to ask for it. Nearly the end, we wanted some refills in our tea cups and when we signalled someone, one told us to wait a second and another nodded but after 5 minutes, she completely forgot. I then asked for the bill and then we were bought a tea pot but why would I need a pot of tea when I'm already just about to leave? What a sad night.
