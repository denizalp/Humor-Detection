What a bad recommendation from my so called friends! I will never be back, nor will  I ever recommend this place... to anyone, not even my enemies. The fish was hardly a step above a fish filet from McDonalds... The Pete's sauce is basically a mix of cocktail sauce and ketchup.... The cole slaw was warm... I'm already popping tums from the grease overload. No thanks Pete's- I'll stick to the pub down the street. The single star is solely for the friendly staff, and because zero stars isn't an option.
