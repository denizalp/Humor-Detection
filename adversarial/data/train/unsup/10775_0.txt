Meh... the only reason I even stepped foot into Rock Bottom is because I had a lunch meeting and it was at the suggestion of my dining companion. I used to go to Rock Bottom in Atlanta every now and then and it was ok... especially if you go for beer \/ happy hour.  I going to be blunt here right now though:  this place sucks!\n\nLuckily, I enjoyed the company of those that I dined with, otherwise, it would've been a miserable experience!  Thanks for that, Miranda and Ken (if you happen to read this!)  \n\nI had their cobb salad and it was pretty average although the turkey in it was nasty.  Our waitress was slow as hell.  The atmosphere (keep in mind we were there for lunch) was nothing special.  Rock Bottom is the reason that I'm not big on chains.  I don't think I'll be returning.  Even if I'm stuck at Desert Ridge, there are plenty of other dining options that are far superior to Rock Bottom (CPK, Yardhouse, Rubios, and more).\n\nSorry, RB - had to do it...
