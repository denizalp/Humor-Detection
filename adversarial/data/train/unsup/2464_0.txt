Still the best thing to do while at Kennywood.  Yes, I did say THE BEST THING to do.  I mean yeah there are rides at the park and shows, but everyone, and I mean everyone, comes here for the fries to be had at The Potato Patch.  Not just any of the fries, but the cheddar bacon fries.  They are so damned good that you don't mind if you burn your tongue with eating them.\n\nI also have to say that I enjoy that they streamlined the way to get your order here.  Instead of bum rushing the counter you stand in line to pay and then head up to pick up your order.  So much easier and there is no evil eye to be given to the person behind\/next to you because you think they are trying to jump line.  \n\nIt is a total must to come here and get these fries.  If you come to Kennywood and do not partake, you are not getting the full effect of Kennywood.
