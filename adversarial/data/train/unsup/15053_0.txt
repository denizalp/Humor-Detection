I did the yelp special at this location on Tuesday during CES.  The place got busy and a bit noisy about the time my massage started.  my therapist kept having to leave the room to check the front desk.  i dont feel as though i got the full treatment.  he spent no time on my low back, which is what i needed. His hand smelled of cigarettes which i didnt like on my face. \nThen, while i waited for a taxi he came over and asked for his tip.  i didnt care for that.  i did go to the other location down the street and had a much better experience.
