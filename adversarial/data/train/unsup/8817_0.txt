\"What.... is... happening.........\" the only thought that was going through my mind the entire time I was trying to order here this past weekend. Either they just hired an entirely new staff or they are all firing up something other than pizza in the back, but something wonky was definitely going on. One guy, who seemed to be the only person who knew what he was doing, was running frantically back and forth between the chopping station, dough station, and cash register. Two other guys were making pizza. I ordered the Naples pizza with added prosciutto because I don't like to think too hard. So he does the dough, does the sauce, then looks at me and asks, \"so what would you like on it?\" .....\"um... the mozzarella, basil, EVOO, and added prosciutto.... the Naples pizza?\" he puts the mozzarella on. looks at the menu board, looks at the pizza, looks at me, \"basil, too?\" ... yes... and so on and so forth. The entire exchange is essentially repeated when my friend orders the pizza bianco as well. Then we get to the cash register, the one guy who knew what he was doing tells the girl \"a naples pizza with prosciutto and a pizza bianco.\" we say no, we're paying separately. she says ok, so which one is yours? \"the naples pizza with prosciutto.\" \"ok\" stares blankly at the cash register. looks to find the guy who knows what he's doing who has to come back over to punch the order in. again, repeat with my friend's order\n\nLuckily, the pizza does fire in 90 seconds, so the food came out quickly after that. \n\nThe pizza itself was pretty good. The 7\" is a perfect size. The crust was a little soggy in the center for my taste, but they do advertise as \"soft-crust\" pizza, so perhaps that is what they are referring to. There are no red pepper flakes on the tables, which is unfortunate because I love red pepper on my pizza (you may argue that it's because it isn't \"authentic\" Italian, but they do have salt and pepper and processed powdered parmesan cheese, so I don't think whole red pepper flakes would hurt their rep). \n\nMaybe I am just not a fast-fire pizza kinda gal, or maybe I was so distracted by the shirtless kid running around the place unsupervised (admittedly not the restaurant's fault entirely), or maybe I was so thrown off by the ordering process, but I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon.
