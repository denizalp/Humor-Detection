Refuge was such a fun place! Climbing walls, fitness area, and the wonderful instructors that were there to help every level of experience. We took our Girl Scout Daisy Troop here last week for our end of the year party. While I didn't get a chance to climb (you know how that party host life is), I did watch our girls and they were having such a great time climbing. The instructors were kind and patient as they assisted the girls putting on the gear and teaching them the skills they needed.\n\nGreat place for a birthday party. They have a little room that you can rent out by the hour. It wasn't the cleanest, but they did have folding chairs and tables for us to use. We had a potluck and was able to decorate the room with our Disney princess balloons. The employees did offer to clean up for us and to put away the furniture which I thought was such a nice gesture! The use of the party room, the climbing fee for the girls, and the private instructors were well worth the amount we paid. So if you're looking for a fun venue to throw a party that's not the usual arcade or pizza place, come schedule your event here instead. \n\nOverall, we had an awesome time. I did get a chance to look around the facilities and the place is clean. This place was filled with regulars and everyone knows each other, which says a lot about Refuge. People are just relaxing on the couches in between climbs. Chill vibes all around. \n\nThe only con is the location. It was so hard to find even with all the GPS. Many people from our party had a difficult time finding this place. It might of been the construction in the area or maybe it's because it the middle of an industrial area-- just give yourself ample amount of time to find this place if you are on a schedule.\n\nHappy climbing!
