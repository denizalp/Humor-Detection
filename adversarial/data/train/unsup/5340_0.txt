Hmmm...This place is located in downtown phoenix, but not close at all to the rest of the bars and hotels. About 1 mile away\/20 minute walk. Polish bar, with cool architecture is the only positive thing I can say about this bar. Came here a few days ago for a small event they were having to help promote the new bar...was very disappointed.  First was the exact location,  2nd there were ants and bugs all over this place (on the bar, in the bar, on the floors, in the bathroom..\nIt was insane), 3rd this bar is trying to copy\/imitate your Bitter & Twisted\/Bluhound & charging $12 a drink as if the drinks are \"craft cocktails\". Let me tell the price point for this place is not on point and the drinks are not good at all. Lastly, they charge a cover after like 8pm...but then close early and tell customers we aren't trying to be like a club...However they have charged covers! I know for sure our group that was here last week will not be back!
