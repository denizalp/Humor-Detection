In the city that never sleeps and a hunger to feed, there are so many restaurants to choose from. Sushi samba is one of my favorites. We always go with a group and get the chefs tasting. It starts at $50\/person and you get 3-4 dishes per course. My favorite dishes are the sea bass skewers and moquesca mista! So amazing in taste and flavors.
