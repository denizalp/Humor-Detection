Pretty good for Pittsburgh-- was impressed overall. BUT way overpriced considering the portions! Not to mention, they serve the banchan in boonshikjip style, so it's part of your tray of food... which is smart on their part because you can't really ask for more banchan. A shame though because the banchan was really clean and good. My tofu jaeyook was also pretty good; I'll be ordering that again the next time. \n\nI'd be more inclined to give them a 4-4.5 if they lowered the prices and allotted more banchan! (Yep, I'm a banchan whore.)
