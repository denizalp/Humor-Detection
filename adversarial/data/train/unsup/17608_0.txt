Being from Hawaii, I'm always excited to find food inspired by the islands. We have visited Da Valley Grill three times now, and we have enjoyed each time. The location is a little hard to find. If you weren't looking for it, you would never know it existed as it's located in an industrial-looking business center. We drove past it the first time we went. \n\nOn our first visit, the hubby ordered my all-time favorite plate lunch, Chicken Katsu. It was lightly pan-fried and was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The accompanying sauce was a little different that I have been used to, as it's a little on the sweeter side. I'm used to a more smoky favor, but it was still tasty. So we could try another item on the menu, I ordered the Kalua Pig. It was flavorful, tender, juicy, and not too salty. The plates are served with two scoops of rice and one side (macaroni salad, potato salad, or coleslaw). On the second visit, the hubby again went with the Chicken Katsu, while I ordered their Kahuku Shrimp (mostly because my dad is a Kahuku High School alum, lol). The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice, spicy kick to it. On our most recent visit, I couldn't pass up the Chicken Katsu yet again, so we both ordered it this time. \n\nWhile the restaurant is small, it is clean and has plenty of seating. Service has been friendly and consistent. I wish their saimin was served all day, rather than just during breakfast (7-10am weekdays, none on Saturday) as it is one of the foods I miss most from the islands.
