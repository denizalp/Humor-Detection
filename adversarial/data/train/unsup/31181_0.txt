My wife and I absolutely loved this place!  We felt as if we were enchanted during the entire meal.  From the time we walked through the southwestern garden to the end of our meal, we felt taken care of.  The southwestern garden is romantic and floral.  The servers were falling over themselves to help us.  Furthermore, the sommelier was helpful and the scene was very romantic.  The food was pretty good.  We had the seared ahi tuna on the Himalayan salt rock, the Wagyu beef and the short rib.  I thought the menu options were a bit safe, and it did seem like a dated menu.  However, the food was pretty good.  The seared ahi tuna was fun, the wagyu beef was good and had a foie gras tarragon.  The beef short rib was very yummy.  We left enough room for the chocolate mousse and that was pretty awesome too.  Overall I'd give the ambiance and service five stars with the food getting four stars.  Overall ***** for the experience!  It was so good, we thought about having a mini staycation at some point so we could try one of their adorable casitas.
