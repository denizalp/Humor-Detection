They're closed for good now, but at least I got to say goodbye. \n\nWhen Wendy mentioned on Twitter that JAROblue was closing up shop, I was sad and bewildered. Great reviews, lovely staff, good food (that I had gotten to sample previously at an Elite event) and better cocktails. Why close? \n\nBut, staff seemed to be in good spirits, even though I arrived late and ordered something that had just been taken away due to an order mix-up. I didn't know! You could've left it, and I would've happily inhaled it in a post-workout frenzy that was later witnessed by everyone at the table. What, you were expecting a lady after I'm forced to do mountain climbers and traveling pushups? Sorry, you are getting a bottomless pit with no shame. It was delicious, by the way.\n\nWhat no one else seemed to witness, as Arc whom was sitting on my left was conversating with Wendy, and Crystal on my right was deeply engrossed in her drink and Danelle across from us; was the horribly creepy Jersey Shore reject that walked in behind a group and decided that flashing me his flabby areola, was a perfectly acceptable, casual mating call. Five minutes later, someone that had walked in with him agreed, as she decided to accept his tongue in her throat. Not enough bullflower martinis in the world to erase that image from my brainmeats, and now you don't make them anymore because you are closed.\n\n:'(\n\n:'(\n\n:'(
