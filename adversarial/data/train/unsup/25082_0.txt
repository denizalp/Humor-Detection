If I had zero stars I put that down... I use to come here all the time with for five of my girlfriends. I'm a huge fan of MJ bread and pretzel sticks over the years. I was SHOCKED to come home after vacationing and find out that they are no longer using MJ bread! The new bread is absolutely disgusting, the crust is so hard it hurts my gums and in the center, it's so weak it won't even hold up all of the toppings on the bruschetta! All of my friends could barely even swallow it. Such a disappointment, and wow the prices when up! Obviously an attempt to cut cost. Used to love Postino's but their bread with everything. How are you going to get rid of one of your best product? Almost everything on their menu they had bread on!! So disappointing. Absolutely won't go back until they bring back MJ Bread!
