Hands down the best Chicken & Waffles I have EVER had ! \n\nThey know exactly what they're doing. My boyfriend and I had this dish 2 days in a row because they were so good and we were craving ! \n\nWe also shared a berry fruit smoothie that was good but do not recommend adding any energy\/protein to it. powder they used didn't mix well and was chunky. \n\nGreat place ! Looking forward to returning and getting another order !
