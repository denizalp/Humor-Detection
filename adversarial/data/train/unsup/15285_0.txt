FABU~LOUS! is the best descriptor of this place. They still have some issues to work out with the taps and the bill can change depending on who rings you up, but these are all easy fixes. \n\nMs. Desarae and Leikia took wonderful care of my friends and I. Make no mistake that when asking for a strong drink, Desarae does not fool around. I left my fate in her hands and she handed me a rainbow sprinkle rimmed adio and bid my ass farewell. There was no sour mix or sprite, just pure alcohol. When her inquiries about how messed up I was did not suit her, she poured more vodka into my glass. One drink from her equals three drinks from anyone else. \n\nStarting at 8pm, if one of their designated songs comes on, all the ladies will stop what they are doing and start performing. \"These boots are made for walking\" came on and the fierceness began. \n\nThe environment is everybody friendly. The large area in the back for billiards and lounging is more tame. Upfront closer to the bowling alley and bar is where the fun is to be had. The girls pass around and check up on everyone. A live DJ is present throughout the night spinning mixes of popular top 40. It is a fun atmosphere and will only improve with time.
