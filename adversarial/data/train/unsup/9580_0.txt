This bottle recycling depot is the quickest I've been to in this city and that's important when you're standing around with a hundred dollars in empty beer bottles. Or maybe I'm the only one with that much after as month or two....\nAnyway, these guys are quick despite always being busy. They haven't ripped me off yet, either. This is the second most important thing about a bottle recycler. If you live in the area, give this place a try. I have to drive a bit for it, but it's worth it. The service has always been first-rate.
