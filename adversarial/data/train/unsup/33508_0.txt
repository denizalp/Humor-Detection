Bareburger makes burgers other than your traditional beef patty-they have elk, bison, pork to name a few. It's a good place to go if you want good portion of meat in your burger and the onion rings are massive! It's a bit heavy but it'll keep you full.  Great place to hit up before a show\/game at the Rogers\/Air Canada Centre. You can see the kitchen through their open concept space, so there's a chance you'll smell like fried food if you're sitting close to the kitchen.
