The rating might be closer to 3- 3 1\/2 stars but i decided to bump it up to 4 stars based on value and the belief that the shortcomings can be easily corrected.\n\nHit Envy a few  nights ago with the roomie.  The restaurant is located in the lobby of the Renassiance Hotel basically next to the convention center.  Decent looking place.\n\nNot sure why but decided to try the tasting menu ( never done this at a steakhouse .)  Another first, I opted for the wine pairings - i've never done this with a tasting menu anywhere.\n\nThe roomie had the calamari ,signature sea bass and lobster mac n cheese.  mine ($99 ) - tuna and crab meat dynamite, seared foie gras, the sea bass, filet mignon, sides of mash and creamed corn  and  dessert trio ( cheesecake, warm choc cake w\/ tres leches ice cream,  cream brulee. pics added \n\nHighlights:     my tasting menu - GREAT VALUE  !  the  1st 3 courses are 1\/2 sized orders but the sides and dessert are a full order.  mac n cheese was very good, but the lobster is totally unnecessary ( $15 ) .  The sea bass perfectly cooked, tasted great.  The chocolate cake - excellent. The wines - i was really impressed with the late harvest Zin - great with the desserts ( i questioned whether or not the wines were a \"full\" pour , but it was enough given the food serving size )\n\nAverage - the calamari ( supposed to be salt\/pepper - where's the salt ? ) mashed and corn - ok ( the corn a little too sweet ) , the dynamite - very small portion ( i thought it was an amuse and not the 1st course )\n\nLowlights - the bread basket - SUCKED ! After serving the dynamite, the manager comes over to tell me that the chef did not like the quality of the foie gras so they were  not serving it - really ?  he just figured this out at 7:30 pm ?!?!  subbed a maryland crab cake - decent but I WANTED MY FRICKIN FOIE GRAS !  \n\nThe service was great and after giving the server a thorough review of the meal including my displeasure in missing out on the foie gras and the filet being at best, luke warm, they took 10% off my bill.\n\nI will definitely return and try the tasting menu again.
