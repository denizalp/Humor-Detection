Food was tasty and service was friendly and prompt. I was given a complimentary muffin! \n\nTwo things that brought my rate down from 5: At around noon on Easter, filled to about two thirds capacity, it was really loud. A lot of the sound was from fairly loud music. It made it hard for the server to hear my order correctly, he brought \"fries\" instead of \"fruit\". The noise also hindered our table talk. Yelp said \"average\" noise, but I thought it was louder than that.  \n\nAlso, I ordered a chicken-salad sandwich that tasted fine but was a challenge to eat as a sandwich. It was a full 4 inches thick when served, and as soon as I picked it up almost all of the chicken salad fell out of the sandwich. I ate it with a fork, and was left with a lettuce and tomato sandwich.  Maybe the chicken chunks (nearly 1\" squares) need to be cut smaller to make it more of a spread.\n\nNevertheless, it's a good place to eat.
