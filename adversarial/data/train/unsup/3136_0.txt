This place is awesome especially late late nights and you know someone who works behind the bar. Happy hour menu for food is like tacos here in LA but here you can order duck tacos. (I didn't stutter, did I?) Among other things you can order here but you know what? My gravy train is over as I heard our in is gone so it's time to get out. Nothing lasts forever but it was great while it lasted. Thank you very much for the hospitality!!
