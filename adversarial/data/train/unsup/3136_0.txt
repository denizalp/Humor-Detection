My girlfriend asked me if i had been to this place called black hoof before....i replied no and that was the end of that. We planned a girls night out and black hoof was the main event. She treated me (such a good friend) as this was going to be food i have never had before and she wanted to share it with me. HOLY CRAP i ate some s*** i would never have thought my tongue would touch. But a couple glasses of wine later and there i was. The most memorable item i had was the tongue on brioche! Ok so waaay back in the day there was a show on tv that use to review movies and in during commercial breaks would make weird recipes and one night one of them was cow tongue.  I was utttterly (no pun) disgusted. My girlfriend told me that I had to have it cause it was so good. Now in allll honestly it was AMAZING. I would have it again, and again, and again. It was juicy and succulent. The bread was perfect and it was so nicely seasoned. It was not at all what I thought tongue would taste like. It was much better lol. We also have a chicuterie board with different meats on it and one of them was pig heart. You could even see where the arteries were! But none the less also amazing! Now I know this one sounds gross BUT we had deep fried pig entestines (I think they were enestines lol could have been some other part of the pig) but they were delish! The dipping sauce also and obviously complimented them so well and made the experiemetal eating all worth the while. Our server was fantastic and the wine was great. I have been meaning to go back and hope in the near future will check it out again. The menu is seasonally changing I believe with some fo the same items on it but this will be the one spot that I wont be eating the regular stuff lol
