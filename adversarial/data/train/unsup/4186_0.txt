I would have to agree first & foremost with the FLY INFESTATION theory! they really really REALLY need to control it, being indoors doesnt stop them at all!!\nlast time 2 of us went there it somehow came up to $50 which was insane! they are good but.... \ncoleslaw is very very plain\/flavorless, i still eat it.\nthe ribs are very good, shakes = good, atmosphere good.\nI do have to agree it does get very loud sometimes, generally quiet and not busy in the early afternoon.\nOH\nDO NOT\nI REPEAT, DO NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING FOR THE FRIES\ni substituted onion rings\nthey added on $2 more and gave me like 5 onion rings!!!\nI do like the fact they seperate the trash\/plastic\/recycling etc..\nim sure ill be back\nWITH MY OWN FLYSWATTER!!!!!!!
