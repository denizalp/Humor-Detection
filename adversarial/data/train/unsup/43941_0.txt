Southend barcade!!!!!  Woot woot!  Checked out Palmer St after work on a Thursday evening.  Super cool space with original arcade hardware.... all games are free to play with exception of the pinball machines that costs 50 cents.  I hear that they try to rotate out a couple games a month (they have some stashed in storage in the back) and also hope to expand maybe next year.... outdoor patio included in the plans.\n\nMajority local beers on draft... around 20 drafts to choose from.  They have eats too!  The bar is made from salvaged wood from the warehouse space as well as 372 cassette tapes that are set in resin.\n\nJust a really neat spot and space.  Old movies play in the background....a ton of cool memorabilia line the walls.  The tables in the back are made of old arcade game headers.\n\nStaff are super friendly and are willing to provide samples for the beers- also make recommendations. They just want you to hang out and have a good time.
