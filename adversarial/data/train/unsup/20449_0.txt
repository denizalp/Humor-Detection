Do not go here! I was a regular customer from 2009. My first visit with them they replaced my water pump, timing belt and hoses (allegedly with all Nissan parts for close to $3000). About a year later I ended up with an overheated Nissan and a rust corroded radiator, which they said needed to be replaced for $500. My boyfriend replaced the radiator himself and then it happened again! He kept saying that it had to be the water pump but I told him there was no way because it had been replaced, so while we tired to figure out what was going on the car it was out of commission for months!!! We took it to the dealer and they said water pump & expensive job. Eventually we found a GREAT mechanic who looked the car over for an hour, no charge, then he said there is nothing else it can be but the water pump. He did the job replacing both the water pump and timing belt AGAIN and showed us the parts. Thiele's never replaced the water pump, it had rusted out! AND the timing belt was NOT replaced with a factory part (as these two guys will tell you is all they use)!  Additionally the person who originally referred me to this garage had already stopped going because of similar issues! Do not use them and if you have and suddenly have a mysterious issue, it could be something you already paid for!
