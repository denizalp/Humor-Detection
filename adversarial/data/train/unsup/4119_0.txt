I will definitely start off saying... I see the appeal.  Being in the pod floating should be the most relax filled time you'll spend all day. \n\nBut\n\nThe music didn't work in the pod so you are forced to listen to the front desk girl make phone calls, deal with other customers, phone ringing etc. \nYou are supposed to be alloted 1 hour and 15 minutes then the lights come on. As I was floating the lights came on and as I got out I thought it was a little too quick. I showered off the salt, got dressed and walked outside. I told the front desk girl that it seemed a little quick and she said I must have dozed off. Chalking it up to that I realized that was not the case when I had to wait 40 minutes for Andy to get out of his room. (We went in at the same time) The girl ended up telling me I got out 40 minutes early..  Now why would I make mention of it not seeming like I was in there for very long if I chose to get off early? \nI didn't ask for my money back but I will never return to this location. The cherry on top was the front desk girl telling us we could have hooked our phones up to the pod all along to listen to our own music. She said she always forgets to tell people. Hopefully she'll remember next time
