Compared to the other ratings I see, 3 stars may feel like a slap in the face. I was really hoping Charlotte finally had a place that could figure out pizza. But it looks like we'll still have to stick to BBQ. The pizza was fine. Definitely not bad.  I was just hoping for more. \n\nThe slice is huge, but more of average doesn't always equal great (i.e. The Golden Corral model...if I eat a stack of newspapers, I'll be full, GC, but that doesn't make the newspapers worth eating)\n\nAlso, you pay for the giant slice ($5), so it's not the greatest deal. *sips haterade* \n\nand did anyone check out the price of a full pizza from Benny's?!?!.....I know it's NODA, but do you know how high I would have to be to order a $38 pizza from this place???...I mean...damn...a family of 12 could live off dominos for 5 yrs for that price.
