Updating my review to 4 stars bc my daughter told me to lol, jk... not really . She loves Chipotle and she personally stated she feels this location has drastically improved on service, cleanliness,  food prep, serving size, and keeping plenty of fresh guac . So here you go Chipotle, thank one of your most devoted 16yr old customers
