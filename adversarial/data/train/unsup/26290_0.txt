Negative stars if possible. While waiting in line I was greeted by an extremely rude black bouncer yelling \"Hello! Hello! HelloOoo!!! I need to see your ID!\" while he remained seated several feet away (there were several other people in line with me, how was I to know he was speaking to me?) instead of approaching me and asking politely... \"excuse me, may I please see your ID?\" When I confronted him about his attitude he said \"Do you want a drink or not!?\" I promptly replied \"yes, but I don't have to get it here\" and left.
