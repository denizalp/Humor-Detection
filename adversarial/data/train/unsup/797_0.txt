The custom-donut concept has come to life. It's the round donut, dropped in the fryer upon order (well, two of mine were already \"up\" and only the third was dropped in at time of order). Then, you choose your frosting - changes every day - some choices included: caramel, peanut butter, white, strawberry, maple, chocolate... Then you choose your topping: sprinkles, bacon, almonds, chocolate chips...\n\nEach donut is $1.00 or $11.00 for a dozen.\n\nThe \"fresh from the fryer donut\" - strawberry w\/almonds - was very light and airy - a solid 4 star tasting donut!  The other donuts - caramel w\/bacon and a plain maple - each tasted a bit \"heavy\" and actually the one loaded w\/bacon was slightly soggy, though the bacon was fresh and wonderful.  I probably would actually request less of the sugary topping because it seemed to render that donut soggy. They're also just a tad greasy (like you feel it on your fingers, but that's also just how fresh they are.) \n\nThe staff is very welcoming and I appreciated that. We'll go back again, for sure! and see what other combos we can create. They also offer Kona coffee, among other bevvies and there's free wi-fi. \n\nDefinitely A-OK plus a half star!
