I chose this location for proximity to the airport and less expensive than renting directly from PHX. I walked in and someone was being assisted at the counter. That did not stop Barb from immediately greeting me with a hello and smile. I did not wait long at all and appreciated the water cooler. Renting was a breeze and only took a few minutes as Barb explained everything in the rental agreement. Being my first visit to the area, Barb was extremely informing of directions, ideas and mapping my whereabouts.  The car I received was exactly what I requested, very clean and new smelling. Returning the car was was even quicker. I would definitely use this location again!
