I do really like this place. Cool look inside obviously, with games and books on the tables. I love how big the menu is! I'm a picky eater but there's still so much to choose from! Love the open faced turkey sandwich. Yummy yummy. And their home made chips are to die for.. Sometimes service can be a bit slow, but I understand it does happen. Plus they make up for it by being incredibly nice. You keep doing you Rambo
