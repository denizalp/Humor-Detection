Just waited 10 minutes for a table. No line really, unless you count the 2 people who followed us in and subsequently left after 5 minutes. We chose to give them additional time to get it together. After being told twice it would be just a minute and being ignored by multiple employees just peeking around the corner or walking past us, we left. All this while the restaurant was barely half full and half a dozen empty tables remained unbiased. Unacceptable!
