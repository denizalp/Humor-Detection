Delicious food and a humbling experience. The whole room was giggling as everyone tried to butter their dinner rolls (I ended up with butter on my lap... I would recommend wearing clothes you don't mind getting a little food on!). We shared a surprise starter and a surprise dessert and we are so glad we did! Ordering a surprise lets you have a little fun with the experience. Our waiter Nazir was great and helped to increase our comfort level with his guidance and explanations.
