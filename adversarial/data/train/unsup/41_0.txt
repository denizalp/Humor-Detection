Let me state right up front that I am no fan of the shopping mall as a construct.  Over the years I have been cajoled, coerced, and co-opted into going to an egregious array of them throughout North America and many other parts of the world.\n\nYes, it IS super-convenient to have all of my \"favourite\" retailers lined up in antiseptic little recreations of Stepford and all those yummy chain restaurants revved up to serve me mass produced culinary mediocrity - why would I ever even want to go downtown where everything may not be predictable and replicable? What would I even do with - what do you call those things again - oh yeah - NEW EXPERIENCES!\n\nI don't want to go off on a rant here... oops - too late!\n\nThis is what those in the biz call a \"destination\" mall... a destination for the aimless perhaps.  Kind of an Epcot-like fantasy fun ride of consumerism.  \n\nIf you like malls, you'll probably enjoy this one as it seems to tick all the boxes and have \"better\" versions of the larger shops and expansive seating areas in both the movie theatre and chain restos.  Be advised that the cinema is a bit of magnet for sub-suburban MallPunklets and other pseudo-toughs - mostly just loud and obnoxious enough to ruin the latest 3D epic.
