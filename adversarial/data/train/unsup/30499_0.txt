So I usually never post negative reviews on yelp but I am pretty upset about my experience at Sonoma Grille. I booked a dinner reservation for 10 girls for my friends Bachelorette Party back in April. Keep in mind the reservation was made in February (over two months in advance). \n\nSince it was a special occasion I was contacted by their Event Planning & Sales Coordinator. We were promised a great experience and it wasn't impressive to say the least. When we arrived for dinner they lost our reservation. We had to wait 25 minutes until they could figure out where to put us - since the restaurant was full they basically pushed a few tables together in front to accommodate us which ended up being fine. The Manager was very apologetic and comped us two bottles of champagne which was nice. He kept apologizing and saying we were going to have the best night ever and they were going to make it up to us.... That's when things went down hill. \n\nWe ordered a couple bottles of wine which we had to wait over 20 minutes for. When the appetizers came it was another 45 minutes until we received our entrees. The service was so slow. I understand that our server received another 10 top that he wasn't expecting; however, they certainly weren't \"making it up\" to us as promised. The food was tasty - that was probably the only positive thing about the experience. Dishes piled up in front of us - they were not cleared in between the appetizers and dinner. For as much as we spent there I definitely expected better service. I definitely will not be going back. \n\nI wouldn't have written this review if Sonoma would have gotten back to me after I had sent an e-mail following our experience. I can't believe that my e-mail was never returned. Just overall poor customer service.
