\"eh\" is the best way to describe my all around perception of this place.  I went to use some social coupon deal and got a fantastic massage, and an extremely low-par facial.  The front room of the store is nice, couches, plants, magazines, candies, etc.  The back of the store is a little less than stellar though.  I kind of got the whole, curtain falling and seeing the wizard feel when I went to use the washroom, having to walk past the washer and dryer where employees were folding smocks.  Also, in between treatments, there is no place to put your things, so I had to just carry around a rumpled pile of my clothes, my purse, and my shoes in one hand and jewelry in another. The waiting area between treatments is just the hallway between rooms, which was ridiculously cold (especially in only a robe) and didn't have any good place to rest my stuff.
