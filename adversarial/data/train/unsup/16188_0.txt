Yippee! I was so looking forward to trying Flower Child especially after seeing their menu online. As I mentioned in previous reviews I am a fan of Fox Restaurants and I feel like Sam Fox is like Midas and again he has turned a dining establishment into gold. \n\nMy friend and I ate lunch there today. Flower Child is a fast casual concept where you place your order and then they bring you your food.\n\nI ordered the Asian Avocado salad and a side of sweet corn w\/ quinoa. Everything was absolutely delicious. I pretty much devoured the whole meal. I let my friend do most of the talking while we were eating because I was enjoying the food so much! My brain was in total food reward mode. \n\nOh...did I mention that they have gluten free baked goods? I had a gluten free bittersweet brownie and I'm pretty sure it revolutionized my entire life. I'm pretty sure if the brownie were a man, we would be walking down the aisle.
