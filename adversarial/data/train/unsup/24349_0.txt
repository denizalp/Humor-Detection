I came here for lunch with a colleague on Friday and I wasn't super impressed but if you're hungry, it will get the job done!  You can tell that it is a locally owned, family run business and the staff was extremely personable. They get 5 stars!  I got the parmesan chicken salad sandwich and it was good, not great. It was served warm with chicken salad and cheese only. It was very basic. The salad was also super basic and the Italian dressing tasted like Wish-Bone from the grocery store. My colleague got the turkey club and it looked good! I wished that I ordered it when the food came. His looked much better than mine! There aren't many restaurants near them so i'm sure they get business from the nearby corporations!
