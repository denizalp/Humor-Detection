It seems so obvious.  In fact, I'm surprised that it hadn't happened sooner.  Secret Pizza in Cosmo, Five50 in Aria, New York Pizzeria in New York New York, Pin-Up Pizza...it's almost like folks suddenly realized it could be profitable to sell pizzas by the slice along the Strip.  I mean, it's not like there are a lot of folks out there looking for a (relatively) cheap meal\/snack or some post-clubbing\/drinking\/gambling eats.  But hey, better late than never!\n\nLocated on the street level of Planet Hollywood on The Strip, Pin-Up Pizza features the same New York-style slices as the likes of Secret Pizza and New York Pizzeria, but their range of pies is a bit more unique than their competitors'.  Of their seven different offerings (Cheese, Pepperoni, Big Meat, Margherita, Chicken & Spinach, Prosciutto & Arugula, and Pancetta & Mushroom), I opted to get a slice of their CHICKEN & SPINACH ($7) as it looked a bit more appealing than the rest.\n\nAfter they warmed it up in their oven, the first thing that struck me about my slice was how large it was.  Their menu isn't wrong about how they have big slices - mine was spilling off the plate!  What's more, I really the white sauce underneath all that cheese and how they didn't skimp on the toppings.  The only (slight) bummer for me was the crust.  Not bad by any means, but I wish it was a little softer\/chewier and that it had a little more flavor to it.  Otherwise, this was a very solid slice!\n\nGiven all of the fast food joints that are within a short walk from Pin-Up Pizza (McDonald's, Popeye's, Panda Express, everything in Miracle Mile, etc.), there are plenty of alternatives for some cheap eats.  However, as far as late night slices go, Pin-Up is a solid choice that's literally on The Strip (doesn't require going into the hotel for) and at a decent price, considering how large the slice is for your money.
