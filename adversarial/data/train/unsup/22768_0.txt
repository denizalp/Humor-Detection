I LOVE Pho! But who doesn't?\nMy husband and I were in that area for ice cream and ended up at this restaurant.\nWe got there at 6ish and the place was quite busy. We were sat right away and the waitress brought our drinks.\nT start we ordered fresh rolls with pork and shrimp that were just okay. What made total difference was the peanut sauce that has been the best one I've tried so far J\nThey had many options to choose from but since I am a Pho lover a had the brisket Pho and my husband had some type of pork.\nFood came out quickly and it was really good!\nTheir decoration is nice, the staff is friendly and fast and their prices are regular for the type of restaurant.\nThey have a cute aquarium with many pretty fishes.\nEven though this restaurant is not on our daily route we are highly considering to go back, because it is really worth it!
