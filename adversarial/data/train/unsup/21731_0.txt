Where do I begin? For starters, the food is mediocre, AT BEST. Nothing is very flavorful and my enchilada came out smothered in shredded cheese from a bag, as well as the cheese inside. I could have made it at home in my own microwave.\n\nAlso, I was verbally accosted by a family who clearly had too much to drink sitting next to me. The woman personally attacked my friend's appearance, simply because we had given them the stink eye ( they were tickling their 3 year old incessantly, causing her to shriek very loud.) That is fine if they want to go home and carry on like that, but I personally do not want to be seated at dinner having to listen to a shreiking child and witness horseplay. They then attacked our age and simply because I am in my early 20's assumed I was in college. When I told them I was not even in college, they told me maybe I should be. I graduated two years ago....\n\nGetting off topic, the man whom I thought was the manager on duty turned out to be the owner and stood back and did nothing when he found out what had transpired. No apology, no comforting to my crying friend, NOTHING. It was obvious that just because we were younger meant no respect or empathy. \n\nWhen I had gotten home and called him to express my concern at his lack of diffusing the situation, he told me there was nothing he could say and next time he would \"try to be a better person next time.\" I'm smart enough to distinguish a condescending and patronizing tone when I hear one and believe me, his was one of them. \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back. Ever.
