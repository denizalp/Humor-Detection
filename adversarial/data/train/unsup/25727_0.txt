This is a comment on their policies  regarding insensitivity to unforeseen circumstances. My girlfriend and I were scheduled to spend four days in Las Vegas from April 12 to the 16th. Sadly at 4 AM on the morning of April 12 she received a call from her brother in Budapest. Her mom just died. She's flying back to Budapest tomorrow for about three weeks. I sent John several texts explaining this and even an email. He would not issue a refund. \nRefunds are also  not the policy of Groupon or LivingSocial. However, they do have circumstances (i.e. death or deployment) where they make exceptions. Both of these merchants did refund me. Even discount ticket agencies where I bought show tickets refunded me.
