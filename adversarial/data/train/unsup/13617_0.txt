Well I stand at the hostess station while she is busy talking. The manager comes up and asked if I want to sit somewhere....well yeah....I want lunch. The waitress comes over and I order....she returns with a flat soda....not a great start. \n\nNo check to see if I want refills, but the wings were ok. I think I shall pass on additional trips.  12 bucks was a bit much for six wings and a drink.
