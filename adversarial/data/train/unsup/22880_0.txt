Watch your step. Really. You trip in to the door, trip from room to room, and trip over items spewn over the floor. (How they get insurance is beyond me....)\n\nThe items are housewares (lots) , jewelry, coins, and some military. One room had a selection of mid century furniture, but rough.\n\nThere is little to no air conditioning, so consider this when the outside temps are above 90.
