Why 5 stars? Because ice cream + Texas Sheet Cake, are you kidding me?\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nOur visit here was brief, but my decision was very easy once I saw this little gem on the menu:\n\nJoe's Cake Dish\nChocolate Texas Sheet Cake topped with your choice of vanilla, chocolate, twist soft serve, organic whipped cream and nuts.\n\nMy wife makes a Texas Sheet Cake once or twice a year and I'm convinced that it is literally the greatest tasting substance on the planet Earth. I don't ever recall seeing it on a menu anywhere before, so as soon as I read those magical words, I was in.\n\nAfter practically inhaling it in a matter of a couple minutes, I ask this question: why does every dessert place in America have this on their menu? Especially when paired with ice cream, I don't think it gets better.\n\nSalute to Shakes & Cones for being the trendsetter that we need! More Texas Sheet Cake on menus in 2018!
