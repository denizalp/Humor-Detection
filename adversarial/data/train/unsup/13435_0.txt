Waffle me, please. \n\nOnce your senses are completely overwhelmed from casino dwelling on the LV Strip, head over to Tiabi for something a bit more down to Earth: smoothies, coffee and waffles. \n\nIt sounds a lot more decadent than it really is: an honest to goodness cafe. No gimmick, no half naked servers, no gaudy decor or slots. Plain and simple good eats, drinks, wifi and everyday people.\n\nTiabi opens early, around 6:30 am on weekdays. Which is good because I arrived around 7:45, parched and hungry. Strawberry banana smoothie took the edge off for a few hours, then the West Coast waffle sando took care of the rest. \n\nA few hours of normal does a body good. I headed back to my hotel feeling recharged and ready to take on the Strip again.
