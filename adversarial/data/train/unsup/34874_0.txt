Wanted to try this especially at the price point of the dishes and the head chef being from Joel Robuchon. Well here is what we ordered:\n\nBacon Jam w\/ Blue Cheese Fondue - So good the only thing I felt was instead of kettle chips I wish it was either with fries or toasted french bread..\n\nCervantes Lombinho & Abacaxi - Three good sized bao buns with pork belly and pineapple...pork belly was so good and cooked to perfection...excellent flavor\n\nBraised Beef & Piedmontese Rice - Yo this dish is on another level...highly recommend it \n\nChicken & Mash - Chicken could have been better flavor wise...a little bland in taste compared to the beef but those mashed potatoes doe....the mashed potatoes were rich, buttery goodness\n\nWhat's crazy is these four items, while small plates, are full of flavor and are so rich that we didn't even finish everything....the brunch menu looks good and the small tastings around the world look interesting...they are planning to revamp the menu and so you know that I will be back
