After having a not so great experience the first time I was contacted by the manager of the restaurant and offered for me and my family to come in so we could give them another try. It was a completely different experience! Everyone was extremely nice and the food was fabulous. I would definitely come in again! Thanks Patrick for the excellent lunch, it was a wonderful afternoon.
