This review *should* only be valid until Labor Day - this is when they tell me the expansion renovations will be completed. Until then, the bathroom situation is completely unacceptable to me, so I will go elsewhere.\n\nThat being said, the wine, charcuterie, soup, and lettuce cups I enjoyed before needing to use the restroom were top notch as I expected. This is normally a 4 star establishment and the food and drink certainly were. \n\nI will be back, just not until the dust settles.
