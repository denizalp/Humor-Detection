This is one of the most unethical businesses that have approached me... please be aware and stay as far away as possible. They will try to coax you into signing up for certification study content through their online tools by offering attractive yet fraudulent promotions. There is no support what-so-ever. After signing up, if you need guidance, or email\/call them you will never get a response back. There's your money down the tube, and months later, you'll still be left without any certifications.
