Time for an update! I decided to come back since management contacted me to resolve any issues. I'm all about second chances especially if management is willing to improve and make a customer happy. \n\nMy hubby came for dinner and it was a whole different experience. Our server was friendly and our food was delicious! I ordered the rotisserie chicken (based on Yelp recommendations) with the side of Brussels sprouts and hubby on ordered the steak sandwich. My rotisserie chicken was so flavorful and I highly recommend that you order it! Hubby liked the steak sandwich. I thought the Brussels sprouts were ok- not a fan of how they made it with nuts and cranberries. We also decided to order the white chocolate brownie since they DO have \"White Chocolate\" in their name. I don't regret ordering and eating it because it was sooooo good! I'm a sucker for sweets and this did not disappoint!\n\nOverall, a way better experience than the last. I still think that prices are above average, but you can always take advantage of happy hour here!
