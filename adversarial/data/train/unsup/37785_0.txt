In Mesa for a week on vacation, our last evening we wanted Italian & Il Forno was less than a mile from our hotel.  We came in and were greeted and seated by a nice young lady that would also be our waitress.  I ordered the bolognese which is a favorite if mine.  Being from CT where Italian restaurants give a salad with the meal for $16 here at Il Forno that was not the case so I was hoping my meal would be amazing.  The garlic bread was tasty.  The meat sauce & pasta was just okay to me.  It had a lot of ground meat but it was missing the touch of cream and spoonful of ricotta I'm used to accompanying this dish back east.  One of my dining companions ordered spaghetti and meatballs she enjoyed it and said the sauce was good.  My other dining companion ordered the chicken parm dinner.  She ended up sending it back because the chicken was visibly burnt and tasted burnt as well she said.  The waitress was very nice and accommodating and took the dish off the bill even though she ate the pasta it came with.   I think this place has the potential to be a great place to eat.  It's just a few minor attention to details that made this experience fall short for me.
