The ordering here is very similar to Hawaiian bbq places - you order at the register first and then seat yourself and they call your name when your order is ready.\n\nWe ordered the Hafa Adai plate, empanadas, and spam musubi. The cashier said the Hafa Adai plate was the most popular and that people usually share it. It wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be, but definitely sharable for 2 people who aren't super hungry. It comes with bbq chicken, 1 spare rib, cucumbers, red rice, and an empanada. The chicken had a nice grilled taste to it but it was a little dry in the middle. The spare rib was pretty good, but they only give you 1 compared to like 8 pieces of chicken. The red rice was really good - it had a very subtle flavor but tasted noticeably different than white rice. The cucumbers went really well with this plate too, it helped out when the chicken was a little too dry.\n\nThe empanadas side dish comes with 3 empanadas and they were deep fried and the skins tasted like corn taco shells. Inside was I think mashed red rice with some pieces of chicken. They were super crunchy but pretty much just tasted like rice, and I felt really thirsty after each bite I took. Other than that, the texture of it was really nice and made me want to keep eating it.\n\nThe spam musubi comes with spam, red rice, Furikaki, daigo (pickled radish), and spicy house sauce wrapped in seaweed. I liked how they had Furikaki and daigo - it was different than the average spam musubi. It does come with a lot of rice though.\n\nOverall, the food here is pretty tasty. It was definitely very unique and a good dining experience.
