I go to Water Mart for my ice cream and the Frys next door for my water. The owner George is one of the coolest and nicest guys you will meet. If you have never had a scoop of Thrifty ice cream make sure to check this place out. Note: there is a 50 cent fee if you pay with a credit card and your transaction is under $5.
