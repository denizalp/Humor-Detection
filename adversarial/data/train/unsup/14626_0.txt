07\/07\/10\n\nHad coffee and some sweets here w\/ a friend, and after much anticipation on trying the fare here, I was a bit disappointed w\/ what I found :(  I decided I'd try a couple of scones and a berry coffee cake, and a cup o' joe.  I really enjoyed the coffee, but the pastries?  Not so much.  The coffee cake wasn't sweet enough, and I found it to be too greasy.  The scones, also a bit on the greasy side, were so flat, they looked like cookies!  Out of the two, I liked the butterscotch best.  However, I wouldn't order these again.  \n\nA few hours later, I decided I'd go back to write some reviews and have another cup of coffee.  I went back up to see if there were new additions to the display, but was turned off when I saw a couple of flies crawling over the cupcakes.  (((shudder)))  The clerk manning the counter followed my gaze and saw the flies, but didn't shoo them away.  Tsk, tsk.  Turned me off on trying anything new.\n\nI am a big fan of Joe's Farm Grill and The Liberty Market (a little less of Joe's Real BBQ, but I've only gone there once, so a return visit may change my mind), so I'd like to give their sister company The Coffee Shop another try.  The sandwich and salad menus look delicious, but most of the selections are off-limits to me.  But... flies in the sweets counter?  I don't know if I can stomach another visit :(
