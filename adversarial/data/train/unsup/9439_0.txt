There's something to be said for choosing one thing to do in life, and doing it exceptionally well. \n\nJim Chai Kee adheres to this philosophy. \n\nIt's raison d'etre: wonton noodle soup. \n\nI know, I know...if your only experience with won tons and soup is the tepid dishwater slopped forth from your local Manchu Wok, you'll wonder why the fuss?\n\nBut if you're steeped in the greatest of brothy arts, you appreciate a good bowl, and you'll come to appreciate Jim Chai Kee for the Souperstar it really is. \n\nFull disclosure: like many noodle-in-soup joints, the ambiance is somewhat lacking. But then, if you're planning on taking a first date for a big bowl of slurpy noodles your game plan needs work. Better to build rapport and a sense of trust...then get to slurping. \n\nEven still, decor won't win any awards unless you have a thing for hospital cafeterias. \n\nFuller disclosure: wait staff are rude. I've written about varying degrees of unpleasant service here before. At Jim Chai Kee, you just don't exist. You are a body at a table and you get what they bring you...and since there's only about four menu items, chances are they'll bring the right food. Want water? Or tea? Get it your damn self. Seriously. Samovars and pitchers are set up for you to help yourself. Which is actually pretty convenient, if you think about it. \n\nFullest disclosure: I am advised that this is actually the Canadian location for an international chain. I'm not sure if this is true, and I'm generally inclined to be harder on chains because I'm not part of the 1%, even if I don't always wanted to eat at yurt. \n\nSo why does Jim Chai Kee rate four stars? Because. Soup. Is. Good. \n\nThe broth itself is rich and golden; improving on the current, ridiculous \"bone broth\" trend by adding copious amounts of David Chang's favourite ingredient: MSG. I used to be one of those people who took issue with MSG for health reasons. Now? Screw it. Delicious. Soup. The best broths all have a bit of viscosity; it comes with the breakdown of collagen in whatever meat and bones you boil to make it. Jim Chai Kee's soup passes the test. \n\nWhat do they put in your soup? Here are your choices? Want something else? Go to Mandarin:\n1) golf-ball-sized wontons bursting with fresh sghrimp cooked just to briny crunchiness. \n2) beef in oyster sauce. Tender. Slighlty chewy. Great textural addition. \n3) fish balls. As a lifelong gefilte fish afficionado, I've never known what to make of this style of fish-ball. Vaguely fishy; compressed to homogeneity, contributing more firm texture than any kind of taste...but then who am I to argue with the world's largest economy. \n4) springy yellow wheat-and-egg noodles in massive quantities. \n5) on the side, Chinese greens. Again, I know...but the bitter crunch provides excellent contrast. \n\nWanna fancy up your bowl? There's soya sauce and pungent chilis-in-oil and hoisin on the counter. I recommend chilis-in-oil on everything. Even on my post-meal Cream Egg McFlurry, so I guess I'm biased. \n\nEat. Pay. Leave. If you're lucky, after sitting a few minutes you'll be sent off with a cheery \"GET OUT!!!!\" \n\nFour stars.
