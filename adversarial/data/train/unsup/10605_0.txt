As a preface: \n1. I have been avidly Crossfitting since 2007 when I was introduced to the program at Crossfit NYC: The Black Box. \n2. I have trained at boxes in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Connecticut, New York City, Utah and Colorado. \n3. I have visited countless boxes while traveling. \n\nWith that said, Crossfit Full Strength is the best box I've ever trained at. Hands down. The programming is on point if you are looking for a balance of strength training and conditioning. The trainers are competitive Crossfitters and, as such, have insight into what works for progressive strength gains. In addition, there is a focused approach to developing and practicing olympic lifting on a 3x per week basis. \n\nBeyond the programming, one of the aspects that I find so impressive about this gym is that the owners are not afraid to expand. Since 2009, I've seen the gym invest in high quality equipment including Pendlay olympic lifting bars and plates, C2 rowers, expanded pull up bars, jerk blocks, etc... Steps in this direction not only attract new members but also work to provide more value to existing members. Crossfit teaches its members that routine breeds stagnation and the owners of CFFS have taken this adage a step further by applying it to their business model. \n\nWith that said, if you are looking for performance gains, aesthetic improvement, and community, CFFS is the best bang for your buck in the Phoenix area.
