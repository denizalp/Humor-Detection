What's not to love? Fresh food - great sauces and brown rice option! This place doesn't disappoint. Portions are pretty good and the food is hot and fresh. Prices are decent and there is variety for every palette. Thai curry is a bit too hot for my liking and they cannot alter the spice level.  Ginger broccoli is my fave paired with the brown rice. Next time I will order with less sauce or sauce on the side....at times the items are heavily sauced.
