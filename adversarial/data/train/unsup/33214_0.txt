The Mckenzie Towne location was still super busy at around 9pm on a Friday night.  Packed full of families, and groups.    \nI really enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere; going up to the counter to order.\n\nThe pizza was traditional and the toppings were tasty but a bit stingy.   I loved the authentic Italian beverages they had on menu as well.\n\nNice atmosphere and overall an affordable dining experience.
