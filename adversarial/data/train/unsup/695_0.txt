While being in the West valley, this is a pretty long drive for me. Although I know that some can agree that their own mother\/ grandmother or someone in their family that they make the best pho and that going to somewhere else isn't just good enough. Then there's Pho Thanh, I gotta day it's pretty good, not close to my mother's pho but it hits the spot. The portions are big, the prices are decent compared to the ones in Arizona and I usually end up satisfied everytime I'm here. It's a good spot to eat when my mom isn't making pho. I recommend the Pho Dac Biet aka the (phuc dat bich), and if you just want to keep it simple order the pho bo vien (meat ball) or pho tai  (thinly sliced beef)\n\n#CertifiedBanger
