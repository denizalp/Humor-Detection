My experience with the Apple Store at South Park was very disappointing. I had to wait about an hour past my reservation time and when finally called upon, the young heavyset lady who \"assisted\" me at the genius bar had a pure attitude.  I had to exchange my iPhone for another one and the one she exchanged for me has been having problems from day one.  Based on my experience with her  I decided to do my next exchange through snail mail as opposed to dealing with this young lady's lack of customer service.  If you do go, beware and request  someone else if possible.
