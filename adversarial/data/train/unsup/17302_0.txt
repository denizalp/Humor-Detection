I frequent Ulta because they have a wide range of products, competitive pricing and some pretty great offers.\n\nThis location is well stocked (better selection of fragrances, skincare, makeup etc) and the staff is nicer compared to the one at Tempe marketplace where they are always sold out.\n\nIf you need assistance you will have to ask that's pretty much true for every Ulta.\n\nAlso, don't forget to check out their rewards program.\n\nCheers!
