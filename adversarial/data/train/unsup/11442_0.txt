Not a place for a novice? \n\nI went to summerwinds nursery today, and I am sorry (really sorry) to say that I was not very impressed. I was expecting bigger, better, more. But I do that sometimes; it is like preparing to go see a movie. I build it up in my head to be so great that it just does not stand a chance in real life. \n\nNot too bad though. Most of the plants were healthy. Prices were average. I could not find the plant I was looking for, so selection... IDK, I guess it could have been better for a nursery. I did leave with 2 bags of premium soil (fish\/seaweed\/non-slug soil!) so that was cool.\n \nI was hoping that they would have had the store conveniently laid-out & sectioned into xeriscape\/water maintenance needs. But it did not seem that way - though some of the plants had tags with their needs on them and there were some helpful signs. I found myself confused and picking through cacti that were mixed with and seated along side water loving plants. I would have loved to walk into a xeriscape section and start picking out plants; instead, I had to pick through ALL of the plants one-by-one and read the tags (and not all had tags) to find the types I was looking for. I guess it is really not a place for a novice.\n\nThey weren't very busy today. After being there for about 30 minutes, someone finally asked me (when I was leaving) if I needed assistance. She was sort of helpful. I need to landscape the pool area and start a veggie garden. I asked if someone could assist me in picking out the proper plants (ya know which are best for the pool area and the light\/water it gets) and tell me a little about their growing habits, needs and etc. She said someone there - might - be able to help me with that.  Really? Might? At least, she was honest.\n\nI will not be going back. I plan on checking out a few more nurseries and this time with - not - so high expectations. \n \nSorry Summerwinds. I really wanted to LOVE you. You are so close :-(
