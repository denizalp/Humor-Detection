The food here was pretty good. I came here in the afternoon for lunch and had a savory crepe which came with a side of spinach. \n\nThe service here was not the best since the waitress NEVER refilled my water, and I was irritated since I was so dehydrated.. But  since Shaq was eating lunch there too, seeing him made up for the bad service.
