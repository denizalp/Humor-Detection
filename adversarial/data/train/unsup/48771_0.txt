what an awesome spot. from the super-big menu to the great atmosphere\/environment, I was definitely impressed.\n\nIt took me a while to check this place out because, being gluten free, I wasn't really sure if there was any options available to me...BUT THERE ARE!\n\nthey offer 2 GF bagels, one plain and one everything.\n\nwhen my boyfriend brought over my bagel, he had told me that the line had actually changed gloves, cutting board, and knife. I didn't have it toasted due to cross contamination but was definitely impressed by the above-and-beyond steps.\n\ndisclaimer: we went on a monday around 9 a.m. after flywheel...you now gotta refuel!...and it wasn't very busy. it has been told to me by the boy, that if you arrive past 9 a.m. on weekends, be prepared to wait.
