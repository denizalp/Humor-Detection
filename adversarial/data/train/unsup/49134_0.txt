Higher end Italian-American restaurant in GVR (Green Valley Ranch).  Decor is nice and definitely not a cookie cutter type of feel.   I've been eyeing this spot for a while since they opened.  I went with a group of 5 and I ordered the calamari as an app for the group along with chicken parm and a side of pasta.  The pasta does not come with the dish and everything has to be ordered separately which I don't mind at all.  The chicken quality and taste was good.  The pasta and sauce was absolutely average at best.  This is the sad part to me.  I think the chicken itself was $25 plus the side of pasta being $6 I was expecting a lot more...especially from the pasta.  It was your basic spaghetti with marinara.  I also knocked it down a notch because our waiter made us wait over 15 minutes for bread and kept telling us they were \"making it\"...so naturally I was thinking it was going to be fresh made (at least warm) bread.  It was cold and serviceable...nothing special at all...so when he said they were making it, he meant that someone had to throw the cold bread in a basket.  We were already done with our apps by the time the bread basket came out.  I would go back to try it again, but more than likely I'll just go to Pizza Rock when I'm back at this hotel.
