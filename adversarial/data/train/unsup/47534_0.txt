I've seen this cart on the square in Charlotte for sometime now and finally decided to give it a try.  A co worker and I went for lunch and it just so happen to be during their \"happy hour\".  The owner took what seem like forever to explain the short menu and exactly how his happy hour works. He was nice but too chatty and I guess he thought he was funny too, but not. We got our tacos and headed back to the office.  My expectations for these tacos were very high.  I've heard so many good things about the Mexican food in Southern California I was expecting \"the best\" and the fact that this cart has been at the location for well over a year I just knew if was going to bet great.  I was very disappointing, I could've done better making tacos at home. Wal mart's rotisserie chicken is better than what I had.  The food was bland and cold.  No seasoning whatsoever on anything. Needless to say I will not get tacos from this cart again.
