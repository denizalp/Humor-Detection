Given that it was in Phoenix during Spring Training , we were lucky to find a room at all. (luck = +1 star)\n\nOur luck just about ended there.\n\nI thought I understood why a front desk clerk would clarify if anyone was allergic to pets.  I thought it was because there was a potential for pet hair that might make someone sneeze.  What I did not anticipate is peeling something off my foot, and then flinging it across the room the moment I realized it was poop.\n\nI have stayed in a variety of roach motels in my life, and this was a first.  Had it been at all possible to get another room it would have been great, but with no other options... we were stuck in the litter box.\n\nStrike 3 for Phoenix.
