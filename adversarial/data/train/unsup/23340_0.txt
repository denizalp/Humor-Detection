This place is really bad and they keep posting shill reviews of themselves. Avoid! \n\nI paid $11 for the Original Chongqing Spicy & Sour Glass Noodles which ended up being a bowl of sweet potato noodles with some chili oil and soy sauce, NO PORK nothing. \n\nI had the Soup with Beef and Mustard Noodle and it was inedible. The meat had so much fat and gristle, the soup was overpowered with vinegar. \n\nMala Express - Don't try to cover up. Fix your food!\n\nedit: see below.
