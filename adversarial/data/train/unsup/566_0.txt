NO ONE WRITES TO THE COLONEL. \n\nHaha that's how I read it first, intense. This is a bar\/lounge with intense swag. You walk up a couple stairs and everyone's hanging out in so many different areas. So many different chairs. But everyone is really happy. And that's quite the accomplishment coming from the diverse group of people that came out on this Friday night. No seriously, I ordered my drink based on a recommendation of a 60+ woman sitting at the bar beside me. \n\nThis drink! It was a long island iced tea that she promised would, \"get me\". It didn't completely, but was surprisingly drinkable given the fact that about five different hard liquors are being used together. It was harmonious! \n\nI recall some throwback music, very fun. There was a DJ going in the back but no one was dancing. Too cool. \n\nThe coolest were the bartenders. Just some super nice guys, one with a sweet hat a patron that night insisted upon giving him. When they ground up fresh mint for mojitos, you could smell it from a mile away! It was heavenly and clearly, they know what their doing. They doled out some free shots as the night went on. Very fun.
