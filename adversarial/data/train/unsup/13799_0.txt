The Old Spaghetti Factory is a place of many memories for me.  When I turned 18, my friends and I went to OSF by whim.  We had be doing research at the Burton Bar Library and it was just right there.\n\nWhen we first walked it, we were mesmerized by the comfy looking couches, the retro games, the sleigh in the corner...  and when we sat down to eat in those big velvet chairs, we were hooked.  It was love at first sight.  We even got to take home our glasses since we had the Italian sodas!  The food is excellent, portions are decent, and you get some spumoni at the end of your meal.  How great is that?\n\nWith prom being one or two weeks later, we all went with our dates and a bigger group back to the OSF.  Everybody loved the food.  We were all dolled about and had a great time there!\n\nNow when I look in my cupboards six years later, I see a dozen OSF glasses.  If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of the place.  :3
