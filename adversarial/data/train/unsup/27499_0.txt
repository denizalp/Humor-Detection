Guess it was my fault for ordering duck wings from a sushi truck, but, still didn't mean I should get sick from them. Buried in sauce, not even that tasty. Got sick an hour later. Went back and told the people on the truck who gave a very casual \"sorry to hear\". Would not eat from this truck again.
