This became my home Y when I moved to the Central Phoenix area. The facilities are clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. There are lots of newer cardio and fitness machines as well as free weights, so even during peak hours any wait would be minimal. The outdoor swimming pool is heated and of a decent size. There are areas for basketball, racquetball, and other activities. While my former Y in Glendale closes at 2 pm on Sundays, this one stays open till 4 pm on Sunday - which is good for me because I tend to wake up really late on that day. As  with the other Ys, this branch offers various programs, classes, and other activities for the community.
