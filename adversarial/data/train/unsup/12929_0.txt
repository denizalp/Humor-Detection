Just a reminder that LEGGINGS AREN'T PANTS! \n\nI don't need to see the contours of the servers ass and legs while i'm attempting to eat. \n\nIt is rude. Lazy. Unprofessional. And disgusting that management allows them to wear leggings, yoga pants, or whatever the fuck they are called. \n\nI don't care if they are comfortable or whatever; they are unacceptable.
