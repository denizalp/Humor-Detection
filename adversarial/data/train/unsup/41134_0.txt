Actually. 4 1\/2 stars is more accurate. We came in for dinner on a busy Friday night. The wait was a little longer than estimated (20 actual minutes, rather than 10)...but that was the only small drawback on a very good experience. Cocktails are well mixed, with some creative options. Entrees were solid. Fish and chips featured good cuts of fish, well battered and fried without a greasy finish. The jambalaya was interesting...a tad drier than many settings, but well-sourced and on point in seasoning. Server recognized our pressing event, and made sure we were kept on schedule and well cared for.
