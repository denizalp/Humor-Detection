Can't say enough great things about Nevada Chicken Cafe!\nThe foods is always fresh, hot off the grill and cooked to perfection!\nJuicy chicken and ribs, seasoned well, best in town!\nGreat selection of sides too.  Fresh and crisp salads, creamy mac and cheese, too many to mention.\nThe owner, Nico, is always so accododating and a pleasure to see every time we go in!\nMust check this restaurant out, you will become a regular!!!
