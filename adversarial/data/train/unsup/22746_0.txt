As far as banh mi goes, Mekong Sandwiches are some of the best!\n\nThey are delicious, consistent, and load on the toppings... and the ingredients are high quality and fresh!  I usually order the #2 (grilled pork) and I love that the amount of fat on the pork is relatively non-existent.  Prices are very reasonable... and they even have a \"meal deal\" where you can add a drink and save a little money!  Their boba milk tea is pretty good... but if I'm at Mekong Plaza, then I'm probably going to just walk down a few doors to my get my favorite-ever boba milk tea.\n\nI have also ordered their pate chaud.  Not fantastic... but it does have a lot of flavor (and a whole lot more filling than the ones over at Lee's)... and the price is definitely right!  The name of the place indicates that sandwiches are the true works of art, so lesson learned!\n\nService is always quick to greet me upon entering... and is ready for my order before I'm even ready to order!\n\n*****FIVE STARS*****
