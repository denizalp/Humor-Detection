We came here about 6 months ago and then again just the other night because we remembered enjoying it the first time. They raised their prices drastically, completely stopped serving noodles with hibachi, charged you $3 extra for rice (even though It's supposed to be included), and stopped serving sake. The cooks weren't even as fun as they used to be. We ended up paying $100 for a subpar meal for two people. Liked the old Shinto, but this time we were so displeased we will not be returning again. Wasabi on rte 18 in Akron is much better.
