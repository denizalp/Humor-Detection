DeFalco's is a Italian market deli and restaurant that will truly have you coming back for more :) We stopped at DeFalco's yesterday on our way out of Scottsdale and as always it was amazing . The stuffed pasta shells and the antipasto salad are the best I have ever eaten and as we shared a half plate that came with garlic bread I left a very happy mamma .
