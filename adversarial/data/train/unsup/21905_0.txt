All in all - totally dug THE Hotel. Although I hated having to say, THE Hotel over and over. It just sounds so freaking pretentious.\n\nAnyway, I'm in a hurry, so we're doing this quicky style. Here's what I liked:\n* THE Room. We got the lowest level one bedroom suite. I think it's called THE Suite. Very nicely appointed. Very comfy bed. VERY huge tub. \n* I really loved that tub. It fit me AND my boyfriend, who is not a small guy. Wait! I mean it fit me. I would never take a bath with a boy! Are you crazy? hehehehe...\n* Loved the pool - for the most part. I loved the lazy river, but hated the fact that so many freaking people weren't on inner tubes. It's kind of annoying having to constantly make sure you aren't going to kick someone in the head. Makes it a little hard to relax. The wave pool was really fun, but the one wave every 5 minutes or so thing? Huh? Why???? I did really, really like the east and west lagoon pools which were very chill. You can bring your drinks, your smokes and just work on your tan. \n* Loved the restaurant choices. We ate at Stripsteak our last night, which was great. Our one room service meal was a burger, fries and mac & cheese and the burger pretty much kicked ass - and if you know me, you know I'm not such a burger fan. My mac and cheese was damn good too. Of course, it was damn expensive, but hey - it's room service at THE Hotel. \n* Lastly, I love that I won $200 on the slots the first night. I'm convinced the first time you play with one of their membership card thingies they hook you up.\n\nThere are just so many fun places to stay in Vegas that I don't know if I would return to THE Hotel - if I stayed anywhere in the complex it would probably just be at Mandalay Bay since I feel that it's more convenient to stay in the main part of the hotel. But it was a great weekend and I'm glad we got to check it out!
