So many Starbucks in this airport that I can't be sure I checked into the right one. This is for the one across from 1897 Market.  It is small inside so you need to sit elsewhere. I sat in one of the white rocking chairs with a side table next to it. Surprisingly comfortable!  They didnt have any protein boxes maybe they never do. I already had breakfast but it's still breakfast time so I got the classic oatmeal and a coffee.  Their water is very hot, hotter than I am used to at the locations I frequent. No complaints about that, just an observation. They were super quick and got my order - and everyone else's ahead of me - within a couple minutes.
