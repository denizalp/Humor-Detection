I was on the fence about getting a Costco membership, so I went in today to check it out. The greeter greeted my partner and I at the door with a wide, smug smile. He directed me toward the food court, and advised that we'd need a membership card. He laughed when I said, puzzled, \"Oh, I didn't know I needed a card to eat here.\"\n\n\"You need a card for EVERYTHING here,\" he snorted. I explained that I didn't realize that because I had eaten at Costco at Christown without a membership card in the past. I exited politely, bewildered at his attitude. I believe I'll continue to shop at Fry's.
