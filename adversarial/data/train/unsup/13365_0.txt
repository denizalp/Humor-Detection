I tried to break in here. I managed to Jimmy the lock. Then I went into their Johns and did my business. Look, I need to get my jollies somehow okay. Don't judge.\n\nJimmy Johns doesn't make huge sandwiches, so don't expect to get stuffed to the gills from their products. I also don't think their bread is very good. But what I will say is that their ingredients are miles and miles better than Subway. This location was the first JJ I ever went to, as it's right around the corner from my friend's house. He likes these things more than me, but I have to be honest, their cold cut sandwiches are not half bad. I like the one with salami, cappicola and ham. I always ask for mustard on it, because, well, it mustard been love, but it's over now.
