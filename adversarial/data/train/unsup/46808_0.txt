This place is always packed, and it has been on my must-try list for so long! I was always told the wait was 30 minutes to an hour whenever I visited, and this time I finally managed to avoid the peak time and popped a visit on Thursday afternoon. \nAs for appetizer, we got braised beef (kalbi), and for the main we got chicken kanpunggi tacos and octopus tacos. And oh my, were they delicious. I really recommend the octopus tacos. They're spicy but as an octopus\/seafood lover, I loved the big soft chunk of marinated octopus leg on the taco along with guacamole. Chicken taco was really good and crispy as well. \nI wasn't sure how big the portion would be, but 3 tacos def filled me up. If you're a guy, maybe with an appetizer. \nThe service is superb, the vibe is amazing, and the price is great! I'll have to go back a few more times to be able to say it is one of my fav restaurants in Toronto, and I'll be happy to go back. If you'd like to try a good Korean Mexican fusion for a reasonable price, def give this place a try :)
