I mostly shop here for toddler high end brand name clothes.  I find that you can usually find great deals on toddler shoes also.  \n\nI am Joe's jeans addict so love their selection of jeans here.  There is a lot to choose from and good sizes for petites.  \n\nDiaper changing station is a plus.  \n\nOther than that, NOT impressed at all with the selection of womens' clothing.  Feels like TJ Maxx or ROSS \/ Marshalls.  I shop a lot at the actual Nordstroms and not sure where the Rack is getting their inventory, but it doesn't seem to be from the actual department store.  The Rack in DC is ten times better.
