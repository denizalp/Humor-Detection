Met friends for dinner. They don't take reservations for groups under 6. So we waited but not too long about 15 minutes. The place is very basic. Plain tables and chairs are not that comfortable. But the pizza is why you go there. It is very thin crust and they say they are Authentic and I believe it. The four of us split three pizzas and they were all so different. (the pizzas are 12\"). The Italian was the most eaten and the Bianca three of us liked. \nWe did have the calamari to start. It was NOT good. Very fried and overcooked. Very chewy and the marinara was so bland. We ate it because we were hungry.\nWe had a piece of their cheesecake and that was amazing! DO get that! \nService was just ok. Never got bread even though we asked for it. We had to flag down our guy to order drinks. Asked to have the TV changed to a local basketball game but he never did it. He said he would but after asking twice we gave up.Lost stars for that. \nThe couple we were with were great and the conversation was good so we ended up having a good time.
