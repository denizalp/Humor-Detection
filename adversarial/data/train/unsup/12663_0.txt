They are so nice here at the desk and its always quiet and you can mill around and i just love the cafe here, its real clean and you can see the sandwiches good in the glass counter and you can get a half sandwich for 2 bucks, all types which is handy and they have coffee all day and they have really delicious scones like lemon...they have different flavor scones often and i love how you can also sit ouside and eat if you want to and the patio is kind of blocked off by plants and upstairs so its private, you can daydream and look out and feel private out there on the phone or talking to friends etc...Everyone I know loves this library, its very quaint and has so many nice areas.
