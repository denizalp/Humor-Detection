One of the cleanest hotels I have ever been to. The inside decor is very well done  and I was impressed at home un-smokey it was. The room was really nice, with all new equipment and very comfortable bed. I was at a lounge during happy hour and they had $3 martinis (1\/2 off drinks). What a deal! Ling and Louis (an asian fusion type of restaurant) was extremely quick and very reasonably priced and tasty. I was going to try Schulas Steakhouse but I read some bad reviews and decided to stay away from it. I would stay there again, it was a great deal.
