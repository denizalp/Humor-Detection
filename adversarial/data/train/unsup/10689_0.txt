omfg....lorilla men...you are my life savers.\n\nthis is an awesome place. a while rack of delicious ribs for UNDER $15. hell under $12. the ribs come slathered in sauce and with garlic bread, beans, and corn. surprisingly i ate most of my whole rack. the bf got the chicken. i could have cared less about the chicken. it's the ribs! i'm looking forward to the next time i'm in vegas for ribs!! oh and root beer!
