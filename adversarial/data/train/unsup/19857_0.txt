We found ourselves needing an urgent care for one of my kids this morning and this one seems to have the best reviews and I felt comfortable coming here. Last urgent care we went to in surprise was awful. The location was very clean, front desk employee was friendly, and after we signed in and filled out a few papers we were taken back within 10 minutes. The Assistant that helped us was great and took great care with my daughter. Although we couldn't get an exact diagnosis here and has to go to the ER I was very satisfied with the care here and will definitely choose this location for my family if we ever need help again.
