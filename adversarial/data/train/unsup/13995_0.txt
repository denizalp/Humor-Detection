Wife, daughter and I decided to do brunch. Checked times and distances and drove 15 miles to get there. We got there at 1:40 PM, posted hours are till 2PM.\n\nThey had already put out the closed sign. When we questioned them we were told we were welcome to order coffee and hang out till 2:00 but the kitchen was closed.\n\nIgnore their posted hours... they close a 30-45 minutes before they say they do.\n\nExtremely miffed and, tho their food is good, I'm considering other places from now on. There are plenty of good breakfast places around that actually honor their hours.
