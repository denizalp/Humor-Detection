Thank you to the staff and Dr. Matchette for the wonderful vet service I received today. My 3 dogs ingested a large bar of chocolate this morning so I called Kaibab and they were able to see me immediately.  Dr. Matchette took great care in examining my dogs and explaining what she was doing. Luckily, my pups are OK and Dr Machette let me know what to watch for in the next 24 hours in case of any changes in my dogs behavior.  I appreciated the quick appointment time and friendly and helpful staff!
