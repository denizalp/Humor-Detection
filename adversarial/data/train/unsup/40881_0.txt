Listen, Jessica is the best. My old boss whom has been getting filler for years even raves about how jealous she is that I've only been getting them for a few months and look better than hers. It's never painful, uncomfortable, or stressful. I look forward to coming in and seeing the sweethearts at the front desk (the blonde guy I can't remember his name I'm so sorry is the biggest sweetheart you'll ever meet). But they've all been very hospitable and professional. I have had one appointment mix up that was super annoying but they made it right again and I enjoy this company so much they still deserve a full 5 stars. So go on a day that one guy is at the front desk and let Jessica make you gorgeous. Thank you laseraway! Probably see you in a little bit lol
