I wish i can give negative star. The worst service worst pizza and at the end they argued. I walked into get pizza ordered a thin crust cheese pizza they told me its going to be 15 to 20 mins after 45 mins of waiting i get my pizza in thick crust and cheese was not even spread evenly pizza crust seemed half uncooked.  Similar experience happened multiple times with this location.
