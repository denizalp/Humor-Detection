Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes AND stuffing? You can't go wrong with this place! We brought my mom here for a late Mother's Day dinner.  All she wanted was liver!!!  She was adamant that I call in advance to ensure that they were not sold out!?  So to appease her I called to make sure.  The gal that answered the phone could not be any nicer!  She was actually quite funny.  She said yes, we always have liver.  I asked if they had green salad and she laughed and said \"nothing healthy\".  I said, nothing healthy? She said nothing healthy all comfort, girl!  \n\nWe arrived at 6:00 and were promptly seated.  With in a minute or 2 some hot corn cakes were brought to the table.  We ordered our drinks and happily ate our little treat.  They tasted great!  We ordered some water and some muddy water.  Muddy water is iced tea and lemonade.  It was better than any Arnold Palmer I've ever had.\n\nMom got her half order of liver as did dad.  Both loved it!  Cesar Q ordered the full order of smothered fried chicken and said it was really good.  I had the half order of fried chicken and while it was tasty, my all white meat order was rather dry.  I was a little disappointed thus the 4 stars.  The side orders were all great!  The mashed potatoes and gravy were tasty and homemade.  Mac and cheese was baked and so so good.  The stuffing was just perfect and the red beans and rice..oh my!  The collard greens were the only side that we felt wasn't the best.  But I think that was just our taste buds.\n\nThe service was friendly and efficient.  As we sat more and more people came in.  We left a little after 7 and the place was packed! We will be back to give this old school Mississippi diner another go round!
