I'm picky about food.  As an aspiring vegetarian food choices can be a challenge. Especially at restaurants.  This is my go to neighborhood spot for delicious high quality flavorful healthy food.  The food is so delicious I'm doing a wiggle but happy dance sitting in my chair as I'm eating it.  Try the dolmas for sure.  The make them hot here and it's fabulous.  They have a sweet little beer and wine bar for a drink with dinner. I'm enjoying a nice Pinot at the moment.  The service is gracious and attentive.  I wish this business owner every success and encourage this neighborhood to patronize this establishment. You will be happy you did.
