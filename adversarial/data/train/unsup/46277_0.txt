I would give this 0 stars if I could. \n\nThis was by far one of the worst meals I have eaten. From the rubber tasting queso to the fake sour cream sauce on the chimichanga, this food is inedible. There were four of us and we probably left the equivalent of three uneaten meals between us. The rice was hard and dry. The refried beans were tasteless. And everything was over seasoned with cumin. A frozen food meal would have been a better alternative. \n\nThe service staff was inexperienced and all appeared to be high school age. Very untrained. \n\nDo not eat here!
