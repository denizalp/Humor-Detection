The Westin is my go-to hotel in downtown Toronto.  Sure there is the Sheraton, One King West, the Hyatt and countless other hotels closer to the epicenter of Bay Street and the banks.  But if you are looking for great views (from the water-facing rooms), fresh rooms and friendly service, the Westin is the only choice that qualifies.\n\nI have spent almost 50 nights at the Westin over the last year.  One star has to be deducted for several reasons--a bit of a convention hotel feel, no good dining options in or right around the hotel, ugly walk from the hotel to the banking district.  While these might sound like significant downsides, the alternatives are much worse--Sheraton (dated rooms), One King West (variability across rooms, no loyalty program), the list goes on.\n\nAs an SPG platinum or gold member, your benefits during the stay and after (use those points to book your vacation resort in Bora Bora) are significant.  Book in advance if you can--availability is scarce almost year round.
