This restaurant is located inside The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino of Las Vegas. Milo's is a Greek seafood restaurant. We decided to try this place during lunch. Amazingly, they had a $22.14 lunch per person on the menu. That included a 3 course lunch with several different presets matched by the fish category. I had the Sea Bass and my wife had the Chicken Skewers for the main course. These dishes were delicious. Our appetizers were actually just as good and plentiful. I had the smoked salmon and my wife had the Greek Meze plate. We also had a half bottle of red wine to go with the entire lunch. \nWe will go back to Milo's again when in Vegas.
