We have been eating here for about 4 years and I have honestly never had a bad experience whether dining in or taking food to go.  I'll admit that I'm very much a creature of habit. I'll usually get the same thing. My husband, however, has tried different dishes and I've enjoyed those as well.  \n\nDine in experience is always pleasant and service is great.  This is the happiest we've been since we don't have the Chinatown from home to enjoy.
