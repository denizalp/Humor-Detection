Depending on whether you head into the lounge or the restaurant, this place is most likely overhyped a bit. This review is just for the lounge portion of the restuarant. \n\nI stopped in on the bar side after attending YSB on Sunday evening. The decor is funky and eclectic. Lots of mirrors, plants, and neon lights. Beyond that there was nothing very special about his bar. Their signature giant drink was much smaller than its reputation. A limited bar menu is also available in case you don't want to drink on an empty stomac. It was relatively quiet insided so you didn't have to yell at the top of your lungs in order to have a conversation.\n\nI think there are better bars\/lounges with better value, drinks, and food.
