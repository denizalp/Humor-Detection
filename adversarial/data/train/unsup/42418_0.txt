I've had decent service in the past but today was bad. I had placed an order with my friend and waited a while. My friend got served and I noticed other people that came in after me were getting their food. I finally had enough and told them to cancel my order. I was then charged for my pop and was given nothing for the inconvenience. If I would have at least been comped the pop I could chalk it up to a busy night but its apparent this is the type of place that has the attitude \"take it or leave it.\" I'll leave it and urge friends to try other places around town.
