Hmmm... I really can't fault anything about this restaurant.\n\nThe service was awesome. The waitress (Victoria?) was friendly and very helpful. \n\nThe food was simple, fresh and delicious. The portions were generous. \n\nThe decor is fun, eclectic and comfortable. Perhaps a bit too dark for me? But I guess that's the mood they're going for.\n\nThe thing I like most about Piano Piano is that it's completely unpretentious. It lives up to its name.
