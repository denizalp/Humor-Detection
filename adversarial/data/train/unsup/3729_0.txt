Finally, a delicious Mexican(fusion) restaurant in Arcadia!  I have been twice now already and both trips were amazing from beginning to end. Food, drinks and service have been top notch.  Everything I've had so far has been fantastic but the standouts to me have been the PB & J de Puerco, the Costilla taco and the Costilla Plate and the salmon dinner, Pez Plancha which was my favorite.  I might actually go in today to try the grilled Mahi tacos and to fill up my growler with the Papago Orange Blossom beer! Can't wait to watch some NFL there and enjoy the patio.  Keep it up Milagro!
