Unfortunately, this is my least favorite bar in Tukee. It's filthy, gnats and fruit flies are abundant, bathrooms are nasty. Wouldn't dare try the food knowing how dirty the place is. The AC is never working or turned on. If you are not a regular, don't expect good service. Check your bill, they will charge you full price for happy hour drinks (happened twice) and give you attitude when you bring it to their attention. On duty staff drink with the patrons to the point of intoxication. Enter at your own risk.
