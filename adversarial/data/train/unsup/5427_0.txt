THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE LATE NIGHT DELIVERY!!!! \n\nI was sooo stoked to hear they deliver...until 3am. WOW! They have a late night special for $5- it's a gyro w fries from 11pm until 3am. it was super yummy. There is a $10 minimum delivery and everything is cheap and inexpensive. (just re-reading my review and wondering what the difference between cheap and inexpensive is? hehe) cheap and delicious*** \n\nso many late night delivery places are just nasty and blech. this one was super enjoyable.  \n\nI love you, oliveo. will you be my bff4l?
