Wow wow wow!!! So impressed with my experience here. We bought our fridge, oven, and microwave from them a while back and had a GREAT experience. Then, our old dishwasher broke and I was shopping around for a new one. Spencers went above and beyond. Plus they honored the price a competitor had. I think the guy I worked with was Gary? and he was super helpful.\n\nI am all about supporting local and Spencers makes it totally painless by honoring competitor prices AND providing service that is unmatched. Will definitely be returning for any other appliances. When they honor competitor prices, how can you not support local?
