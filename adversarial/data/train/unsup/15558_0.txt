Okay, I admit it. I used to be a biggins. That's right, I was a little on the heavy side for a while. College and awesome food don't mix. But it's okay, my girlfriend was a total chubby chaser, I enjoy wearing Hawaiian shirts and I think I carried my weight well. But after a while, the ol' truffle shuffle stopped making people laugh and instead produced more of a :(\n\n    Like most American's I want stuff fast and easy. Loosing weight was going to be no easy task. Soccer helped me shed the pounds. Although, proper diet helped a little as well. \n\n    Soccer Locker is exceptional in every way. Their astro turf is clean, as well as the field, largest in Arizona. \n\n    The store has some of the best customer service around. One of my first purchases I got a discount on and a coupon for my next purchase. I think it was 15% off but that's a lot off when I put it towards my new Mercurials.They have a huge assortment of club jerseys from Atletico Madrid to Real Madrid as well as colossal sale section from boots to scarfs.  \n\n    On certain matches, they will even host viewing parties in their event room. My only complaint is the ventilation on the field isn't that great and gets a little warm. \n\nAnyways, $575 for an adult team and one hour of practice a week.\n\nYou should definitely gggoooaaaaallllll to this spot!\n\nNo? Not into that kind of thing?\n\nWell if you're still not convinced I have also uploaded a picture of how I looked with a double chin. I rocked that hard.
