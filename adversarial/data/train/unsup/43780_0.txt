Danniello is the man! While picking up the car he patiently walked us step by step. The whole process was seamless. We rented a convertible, which was ready on time. Couldn't be happier with the service and the car I received for my recent trip.\n\nIf you're looking for the location, the booth is located within the D hotel with the cars parked on the 10th floor garage!
