Dr. Madejek rocks! I've been under her care for the last month and I can honestly say that I feel relief as a direct result from her chiropractic treatments.  Prior to this, I had never seen or been treated by a Chiropractor for my own personal reasons. After this experience with Dr Madejek, I'm a firm believer in chiropractic care and treatment. Dr. Madejek made me feel comfortable and what I really liked about her is she kept me informed and educated about everything she was doing to me.
