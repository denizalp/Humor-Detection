I met some out of town friends and of course they wanted buffet. The people are very friendly and helpful. The food is a bit better than most. The only thing I don't understand is that you have to get your own drink. It sounds petty but at the stations they get your drinks while you get your food. It's on the table when be you get back. I feel the Mirage is a nice enough place to provide this service. Its over three times the price. They do have a local discount, that was a nice surprise.
