I debated giving this place a 2 star because their prices are very cheap but the truth is, I would never want to lodge at this hotel again no matter what the price. First of all, this is the first time I've ever stayed in Vegas but I really wasn't in Vegas...I was in Henderson =\/ I've never driven pass the strip and so quickly see it fade away, I was sad. Apparently my friend had stayed there before and liked the cost and the room but it was her first time in Vegas so obviously she had not been exposed to better hotels that have decent prices and are within a 2-3 mile radius of the excitement. \n\nWe checked in and within 2 minutes did a meet and greet with about 10 cockroaches...it was disgusting. One even managed to crawl on my friends leg...which only indicated they have no fear and were probably going to cuddle up next to us in bed...NO THANK YOU! None of the phones in the room worked so we had to walk to front desk and request another room. They set us up in another tower on the third floor (no elevator) and that room had twice as less lighting as the previous room, a smaller dining table, and it smelled like piss...BUT not a roach in sight. \n\nJust looking at the dingy furniture and bed spread made me want to wrap myself in a full body condom. I guess the nice thing about these \"suites\" is that they come with a full kitchen and living room area but by no means is this place luxury so don't let the word 'Suite' fool you. \n\nI guess if you are super cheap and don't mind the creepy crawly house guests then go ahead and try this place out but if you plan on taking a taxi to the strip then it's going to cost you which means that a closer hotel would probably be more economical in the long run...think about it.
