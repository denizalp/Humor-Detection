With our 3 year anniversary looming, Kay and I came to Bistro 19 after striking out reservation-wise with several other restaurants. My lack of foresight became destiny for Bistro 19 gave us a scenic, gourmet flight with no turbulence encountered. \n\nDimly lit with wavy patterns decorating the fang-white walls, we were given a commodious and comfy booth in the back of the dining room (it helps to mention that you'll be celebrating an anniversary when you make your reservation). Since our reservation was for 5pm, an hour after their opening time, we felt almost as if Bistro 19 belonged solely to us as we each cracked open the ornate, metal-backed menus, if only until the dinner crowd began to dribble in concurrently with the mild rain. \n\nA typically tasty Caesar Salad kicked off my end of this special meal. A crunchy plank of foccacia crostini bread came with the anchovies-garnished mound of fresh Romaine, diced tomato, and grated Parmesan, the tart and milky dressing acting as the salad's reason to exist, countering the brine of the small strips of cured, oily fish. If there was a textbook ideal for Caesar Salads, this would have been it in terms taste and presentation. \n\nPan Seared Sea Scallops were the appetizer of the evening, and like the salad, were made to shine by a tiny, essential component. In this instance, it was the inclusion of a bacon marmalade, the exquisite union of brackishness and sugar topping the juicy, quivering scallops which in turn capped disc-shaped croutons. A sensational smoked tomato vinaigrette that called up Russian or Thousand Island dressed an eclectic pile of mixed greens in the middle of the two pillars.\n\nHaving poured through the menu online and at the restaurant, I had trouble deciding what I wanted. All of the items were good, good reads but either contained components I don't care for or were simply dishes I've had too often of late. I finally stopped dallying and arbitrarily chose the Black Tiger Shrimp. Fate, once more, proved that She had the upper hand. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dfqSPFBU8vw\n\nPacked with artichoke, spinach, cream cheese (?), and a tomato parmesan sauce, the fat, gracefully displayed foursome of savory prawns surrounded a heap of cheesy risotto and more bales of spinach. The sauce was reminiscent of the dressing involved in the starter only that it was obviously served warm. Wolfgang Puck probably wouldn't have approved of the dense risotto (he'd likely thin it out with chicken stock), but it was tasteful enough that I minded very little, lugging the shrimp through it before every bite. \n\nI had planned on indulging in the Caramel Popcorn Sundae after dinner, but considering it was an anniversary we were observing, we were brought a helping of the Banana Foster Napoleon to share, complete with a lone candle sunk into it. Turnovers and baklava are easy comparisons with flaky meeting syrupy halfway. Gobs of scratch whipped cream kept things from being too decadent as tangy blueberries countered the hot starch of the banana chunks. A pastry's pastry sitting in a shallow lake of saccharine goo and filled with a luscious vanilla creme, we were left with no reason to complain and every reason to return (I want...to try...that sundae...). Bonus: We were not charged for the dessert!\n\nChef Jessica Gibson Bauer is to be thanked for providing us with such a thoughtful, creative, and relishable meal, her apprenticeship at the Carlton (another amazing restaurant) proving invaluable. Gastronomers, may the stars lead thee to Mt. Lebanon. Treat your significant other to a commemorative night at Bistro 19 whenever the date arrives. \n\nP.S. The service provided by Cheryl, our waitress, was peachy. \n\nP.P.S. Don't let Wolfgang have the risotto here...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mRp2phlJWXA\n\nAgain, its composition didn't really bother me, the non-chef, but I couldn't help but think of the above clip as I partook in the risotto.\n\nP.P.P.S. To think my relationship with Kay began innocently with some pizza 3 years ago...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/italian-village-pizza-pittsburgh-8#hrid:QuAqwfGv9CRAGOVXJVOTPw\/src:self
