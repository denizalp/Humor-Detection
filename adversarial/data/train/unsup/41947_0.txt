A real treasure in the city of Phoenix, I discovered the place through a Google search and thought I'd try them out, that was about 3 years ago and I still use them to this day. The place is hidden in what I would call a warehouse district, and you can miss it if you aren't careful, even when you find the right back road that goes past it, you may want to use a GPS or use an online map to find it. Once you do you'll find a building that is quite obviously used to house spices for wholesale, it has a small store section where customers can walk in and purchase. \n\nThere is nothing fancy here, just bins in alphabetical order with pretty much any spice you can think of, at least out of the common ones. Everything is packed in plastic bags so they can keep their cost down and pass it on to you which is no biggie if you have spice containers to store the stuff when you get home. Most things are sold in 1lb bulk, though the more expensive spices are sometimes sold in small weight sizes. You can even purchase bigger bulk bags if you wish, but I'm more familiar with the smaller bulk sizes of 1lb. Everything is fresh, and you often have a choice between whole spices and ground, they even have special blends of spices for specific things such as ranch, chorizo, or taco seasoning. The prices are extremely affordable too, the cheapest I've seen, that is for sure.\n\nTo put it in perspective I bought 1lb bags each of chili powder hot, chili powder mild, mustard powder, MSG, cumin (whole), and granulated garlic, all for  $23. Be warned though it is only cash or check, they do not accept credit or debit. Considering the low prices I'm willing to deal with it.
