I think a lot of people are going to Blondie's for the wrong reasons. The thing is you gotta walk into this place knowing what you're getting yourself into. Blondie's is basically a Hooters that hosts beer pong games. Forget about the food, forget about anything else but beer and you'll be okay. Am I saying it makes up for their poor service and prick bartenders? Nope. But I'm just making a point.\n\nI went here last night, pretty damn late with a group of guys (a majority of whom were Marines). We went to play beer pong pretty much and that is what we did. The beer pong tables were pretty packed and everyone around us was having a good time. It was pretty loud and fun and all the people around us were nice (tossing back balls, joking, just having a good time). It was 4th of July weekend so we were all doing what Americans do... drinking beer and yelling about how much we love America.\n\nWould I go out of my way to eat here? No. Would I go back if I weren't with a bunch of Marines playing beer pong? No. But it's a fun time for what it is.
