Originally founded by two out of work PhD's The Burger Inn serves messy, oozing, but scrumptious burgers. I suggest trying a different burger each time as not all of them are fantastic and the selection is huge (buffalo, elk, pork, lamb, wild boar, and vegetarian just to name a few). And when the clerk says \"with everything?\" just say yes and they will smother your burger with all kinds of goodness.  \n\nUnfortunately you don't get the same level of quality every time you go, sometimes the burgers are a little over done, sometimes 'with everything' includes mushrooms and sometimes it doesn't but, for me at least, it's unpredictability is one of the charms.
