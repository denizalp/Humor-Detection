The Hawaiian a√ßai bowl was good. Everything tasted fresh. But it didn't really stand out from any other bowl that I've had. There is a local place in Southern CA called Blenders that has realllly good granola and they have boosts that you can add (i.e.antioxidant, energy, protein, etc.). It would be nice if they had something like that. The rest of the menu looks really good and I'll definitely come back and try something else.
