Such a great place!  We came in on a Friday evening with our baby in a stroller and the staff were amazing accommodating us.  Not only were they super friendly, they offered to help, they put the stroller where we could see our baby sleeping, and they kept checking on us to make sure things were going well.  Furthermore, the burgers we had (Rockwood burger) were so delicious!  The staff here are very friendly and kind, and I do not hesitate to give this restaurant with a fantastic atmosphere a top rating.  If we ever return to Montreal, this will be on our list of places to come!
