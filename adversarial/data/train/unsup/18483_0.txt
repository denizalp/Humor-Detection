The wife and I have been here enough times for me to write a real review of Bliss, and ReBAR for that matter. I've been for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner, for drinks. I've been on a Monday, a Tuesday, probably a Friday or two, likely Saturday and definitely a Sunday. Heck, lets just throw in Wednesday and Thursday for good measure.\n\nIt's the type of neighborhood bar where every one knows your name, as long as you happen to know everybody who's there that is. One of the best Macaroni and Cheeses in town - the best? perhaps, you should judge them on that one for yourself. The wait staff is always friendly, the drinks are poured 'well' ;-), the food always comes out tasty, and the friends are always here. What else could you really need?\n\nI wouldn't exactly call this a dance venue, but there's generally always dance music playing in the bar and on the patio over the weekends; I've seen some people get down. They've got a cool patio for brunch when it's nice outside, an interesting outdoor bar with heat lamps for those chilled \"winter\" evenings, and indoor dining in the bar as well as the restaurant.\n\nFYI, this is a gay bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), so if you're looking to pickup on the opposite sex, you might have some trouble with that here, but it's a great spot for gathering with your friends.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix! :-)
