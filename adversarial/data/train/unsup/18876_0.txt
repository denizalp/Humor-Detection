We arrived at 7:15 to meetup with a group of 14 people. The organizer had a reservation at 7:30. I was excited to try a new restaurant. At 8:10 we still were not seated. The entire group stood in the cold entrance area for more than 55 minutes!' We decided this was ridiculous and left as 2 other couples decided the same thing. We were highly disappointed and it wasn't the fault of the meetup group organizer since she made prior reservations for the group. Not a good first impression to all of us that were coming to this restaurant for the first time.
