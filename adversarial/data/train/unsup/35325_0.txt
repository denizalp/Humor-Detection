Shopping in a Kirkland's store may be ok, but their online customer service is AWFUL.  I received a damaged item in a damaged carton.  After working with 2 service reps I finally got a manager on the phone to provide door pick up for the return. The shipping carton was too large to fit in my car to drop off at the shipper.  8 days after Kirkland's received my return and after I contacted customer service again, I got a partial refund.  Kirkland's charged me for the shipping on the damaged return.  2 more days have passed without a reply from customer service to get the shipping refunded.  This is the WORST customer service I have experienced with an online retailer in years!  No more online shopping at Kirkland's for me.
