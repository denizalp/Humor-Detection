After a horrendous experience moving from apartment to apartment last summer, I decided to use a moving company and it was undoubtedly one of my best decisions. After shopping around, it was clear that Above Average Movers was the best option. Terry was very responsive and accommodating when setting up the move. On day of, they were ahead of schedule in their day meaning they could accommodate me about an hour before planned - much appreciated! The two movers were prompt, polite, attentive, and friendly; getting everything out of my old apartment and into my new one in around two hours. Overall the experience was quick, affordable, and painless. Hands down best movers in Madison!
