Review # 500.\n\nThe Cuyahoga Valley National Park is little known to those outside of Ohio.  It is a wonderful resource for those in the region with a wide variety of recreational opportunities, all within a relatively short drive of metro Cleveland or Akron, OH.\n\nSome of the many things I have done in the CVNP:\n\n*watched the Perseid Meteor Shower while I relaxed on the grass listening to the Cleveland Orchestra play at Blossom Music Center.\n*taken courses on backpacking and winter camping at the Institute of the Great Outdoors (IGO) which were followed up with backpacking and camping trips.\n*hiked along the old Erie Canal.\n*tons of mountain biking.\n*day hikes of 6 hours or more.\n*attended bluegrass and Irish music concerts.\n*hiked and scrambled through one of the east's only areas with narrow slot \"canyon's\".\n*Visited a working farm running as farms did 150 years ago.\n*numerous picnics and family outings.\n*enjoyed a 50 mile rails to trails loop.\n*attended many rock concerts at Blossom.\n*visited a working lock which has been restored on a section of the Erie Canal.\n*tried to snap photos that rivaled the ones world renowned photographer Galen Rowell has taken in the CNVP.\n\nIf you make it to Northeast Ohio pay a visit!
