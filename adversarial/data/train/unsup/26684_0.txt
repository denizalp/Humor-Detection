Great rustic urban atmosphere at NYNY in Las Vegas.  We tried the duck wings, which were get out of town good, and the cold lobster sliders, also equally amazing.  My husband found an IPA and a DBA on the beer list that he really liked, but I went with one of their Rum infused shakes (the salted caramel one).  AMAZING!  This was a quick stop in to snack, but I am interested in returning for a meal.  The only negative was since we were in at an off our (which really shouldn't exist in Vegas) the service wasn't the best, but not enough to ruin our meal.
