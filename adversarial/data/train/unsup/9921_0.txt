I've been here roughly 20 times.  I used to see the same woman every time, however she moved to India...sigh. My world was shattered... She was the best eyebrow lady a girl could ask for. They were always naturally shaped, not too thin, symmetrical, perfect - and it was painless! After she left I figured I'd give the place another go. I've been back a few times since, and I've had a few different ladies. They've all done a pretty good job - but not as good as my old go-to eyebrow magician. Most eyebrow places tend to make brows a little too thin - not at all what I'm going for. I've learned to specifically ask them to make sure they're thick and they usually get it. I was especially impressed with my most recent trip there, they were almost as good as my old faithful. This place is only $10 - not shabby! I'll definitely be back.
