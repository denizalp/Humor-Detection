When it comes to Thai food I have definitely had my share of experiences. The only experience I have yet to experience is actually eating in Thailand. I've had Thai food around many places in the U.S. Such San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago. I also had Thai in China. \n\nThat being said eating here tonight has By far reached and exceeds beyond my expectation. I was joined with my friend who is Laos. Laos being neighbors of Thailand, the food is just about the same with of slight differences. After a 20min wait on First Friday, we waited another 15-20 mins per each dish. We ordered 3. The first dish was spring rolls. Let me tell you I have had my share of spring rolls with peanut sauce. I thought I would experience just any other experience I've had, which is average. I mean it's spring rolls. The first bite with the peanut sauce was the most delicious bite I have ever had. I could of just ordered spring rolls and I would of been more than satisfied. My friend mentioned that the sauce was authentic sauce it was not your typical restaurant sauce. My friend felt like a she tasted a piece of home.
