Don't want to go to the State Fair to see livestock? Just head over to Pratt's Pets and its like visiting the state fair any day of the year. Sure, it's basically a feed and livestock store and they don't really have any items for your pets that you can't find elsewhere, but it's fun to go in and check out all of the live animals they have on hand. Who knows, you might leave with a new chicken, snake, goat, or turkey. Even if you just have cats, dogs, birds, or fish you can get everything you need to care for them. Or, if you're like me and you have kids, you can buy a few bales of hay to mount targets in your backyard and let them safely shoot their bb guns and bow and arrows.\n\nIf you have pets, like animals, or just want a fun experience, drop by Pratt's and check it out.
