When I just can't even any more I like to go to Amelie's. This is the perfect place to wrap yourself in your infinity scarf, read a good book and sip on your coffee while using their free wifi. The atmosphere is quaint. Almost TOO quaint. Like \"Am I supposed to live here now? It's so cozy.\"\n\nThis is a great place to bring your headphones and an electronic device of your choice with you. Surrounded by fellow patrons in yoga pants and Uggs you will feel right at home. The cashier recognized my Rick and Morty t-shirt and we had a hilarious conversation about how much her son loves the show. You had to be there.\n\nThey are hidden away in the back of the Park Road Shopping Center so if your map app doesn't get you there don't give up. You are so close. I've only ordered coffee and breakfast sandwiches from here so far but I hear they have great pastries. Perhaps next visit. Oh, there will be a next visit.\n\nSidenote: Sean King I know you're reading this. Unblock me on Twitter. Not cool bro.
