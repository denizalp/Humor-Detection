Whenever I tell people about Rolo, they always, without fail, think it's a chocolate store. Wrong! It's better than chocolate! It's the best shop in TDot!\n\nI'm the quirky\/unique type, so I love these kinds of stores. Rolo is tiny in space, but it doesn't seem like that since there are so many awesome gadgets and gifts inside! I guess you can say \"good things come in small packages\"! \n\nI have loved every single thing I've bought from Rolo and I plan on coming back if I'm in the Yorkville area. \n\nIf you're the quirky\/unique type like me, this is the place to be! :D
