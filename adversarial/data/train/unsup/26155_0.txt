The gym has all the equipment you need, even has pool, sauna, full basketball court, child care. The facility is good and the staff are nice too. Their membership is straightforward, you can cancel whenever you want without any fees., they basically just charge per month and doesn't force you stay for 24 or so many months or else (like the other gyms which has 24 or x month contract)...I guess they are confident that their customers will like their gym. \n\nThe child care staff are nice too. The only thing is that you have to pay first (if you don't have the monthly child care) before they let the child in but doesn't refund if the child doesn't like it afer 5 minutes and you ended up having to take a child out. \n\nOverall, this gym is a good facility to workout in.
