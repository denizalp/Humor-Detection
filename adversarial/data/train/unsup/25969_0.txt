Amazed by this show. I have never heard of this guy until my buddy offered me a ticket that he got for free. I just thought he was just a regular comedian that talks about his \"funny\" life. But never expected anything he did on this show! \n\nLoved it, family friendly, and he interacts with the crowd very well.
