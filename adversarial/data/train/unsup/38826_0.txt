Delicious!  I got a chicken bacon avocado panini and it was really good. My husband got their house sub ( we can't remember the name) but it was really good too. It is a little pricy at 8 or 9 per sandwich but they use quality ingredients so it's definitely worth it.  Oh and we got complimentary chocolate chip cookies and those were delicious too! Definitely going back but probably only for carryout as there are only a few seats available.
