If there is one thing the common American schlub can do well, it's gripe, whine, and nitpick about the smallest of inconveniences. I think this place is great, especially for what they charge. They are one of a kind. One of the few pizza joints that actually uses plenty of cheese and doesn't price gauge its customers with every topping. Instead of squabbling with friends over who likes what on a shared pizza, the pizza is cheap enough that everyone can get their own lavish variety. For $7 a pie, I am not going to rip it apart over a $1.50 ATM fee, lack of my personal favorite drink, and no sitting room. From the sound of many of these reviewers, I am going to count my blessings that there is minimal room to mix company. Unless it is a matter of quality, cleanliness, prices, or service, these trivial setbacks in one's day are not a reason to give a bad review. I am not noticing any of these as being most people's problem. The service and friendliness at all Two Hippies joints are exceptional by far. If you want cheap, crap food for your $1.50 with full capacity seating, then head to McDonalds and sit in their Playland and poison all five of your senses at once. At least they accept debit by God! To tell you the truth, due to their unfortunate choice of a name, I refused to try these guys until my boss tricked me by hiding the box. It was so amazing I got over it and have tried every one of their shops and been pretty impressed.  That name is my only complaint. They've won me over.
