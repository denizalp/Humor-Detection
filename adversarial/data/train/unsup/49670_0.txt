It's a good happy hour after a long day at work to wait out the traffic mess. The bartenders are very friendly and the cocktails are delicious. Great selection of beer too. But my favorite thing about it is the old movies that play (with no sound) in the background. Nothing like watching a really bad japanese monster film and while enjoying a good drink.\n\nParking can be a mess depending on when you go. You can go in on 7th avenue side or up the fire escape staircase to get in. Either way, it's a cool bar with a good vibe.
