We called Celebrity Patios because our patio was damaged by a falling tree during a recent wind storm.  Ken came and gave us a quote for replacement.  He gave us several options and didn't \"nickel and dime\" us with extra charges for special cuts, etc.  And after getting several quotes from other local companies, Celebrity's was the best priced.  Ken even came back before we made our decision just to confirm we were all on the same page with regard to the patio construction.  He answered all of our questions and offered additional suggestions as well.  The construction time was better than we had expected.  And Celebrity was the only company out of the group we asked to quote that did not ask for any sort of deposit before the construction began.  Ben and Gary (the construction team) were on time, friendly and knowledgeable about their tasks.  Each set to work on their specific jobs and worked together like a well oiled machine.  And two nicer guys you could not find!  They were great in cleaning up after the job was completed too.\n\nIn short, we are sooooo happy with our Celebrity patio!  We have already recommended them to 2 people who are looking to replace or enhance their existing patios and 1 person who is just starting to plan a backyard.  We are confident that Ken and his team won't disappoint.  \n\nJerry and Susan B
