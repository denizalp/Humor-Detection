As others have stated, this is the place to go to for some great bar food. And the Graveyard Menu?! Even better! I'm always tempted to over order just because of how cheap and good everything is!\n\nThe Range (chicken fried steak) is amazing for the price that you're paying (six bucks I believe) and the shrimp cocktail is surprisingly tasty as well. I'm always ordering to pick up and every time I'm there- It seems as if other people are doing that too.\n\nCustomer service can be on the slower and spotty side but it's understandable when there's only one person running the game after midnight. The only thing they could change is how bright it is inside. Other than that, I'll be back. Especially when it's close to home.
