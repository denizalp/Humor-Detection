Solid place for Italian food. The food isn't fancy but its decent and it's pretty cheap to boot. The calamari we got was kinda soggy...  But our manicotti and angel hair pasta didn't disappoint. The tiramisu is tasty though it doesn't look very impressive. This place could use a bit of a facelift... The decor is pretty dated.
