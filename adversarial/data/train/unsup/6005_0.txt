If I could put 0 stars I would, all I got to say is the buffet is really really SAD , the waitress are really nice but  you can tell they get there cooks off the street, be PREPARED TO PAY 25$ for OLD  COLD MICROWAVE food that will give Diarrhea all day, just the smell walking in will make you gag , honestly only because I have a voucher I forced myself to come down to this buffet, don't be disappointed save you're money this place is literally trash they really let this place go. This lady littrely flicked trash from the dirty dishes into my eyes idk if it was on purpose put its discussing experience.\n\nUPDATE literally came up to my room and started sweating with horrible nausea threw everything I had in my stomach up, picture to prove it , hope you have a better time first time in VEGAS
