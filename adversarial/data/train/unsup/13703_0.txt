I've bought Wei's chocolates a couple of times at the farmers' market downtown.  They are definitely tasty--I liked their chai- and chili-flavored ones--but really expensive ($30 for a bag of 24 pieces).  \n\nTheir homeopathy aspect of their chocolates is also a bit hard to swallow.  From their website:  \"thanks to the principle of physics called sympathetic resonance, we can benefit from the frequencies of flowers. ... we partnered with Lotus Wei to bring you vibrationally enhanced chocolate.\"  ... Uhhhh... OK ...  sure...
