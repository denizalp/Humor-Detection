Food was good but wow, the people here couldn't care less about taking your order. We got a hold of a bus boy after waiting for 20 minutes and he said he wasn't allowed to take our order. I then went up to a manager and she went to find out server. In FRONT of us, she said she was too busy to take or orders. The restaurant was only about 30% full. \n\nWe ended up having another server wait our table. We could only get our bill after waiting for 10-15 minutes after we finished and getting up to ask for it.
