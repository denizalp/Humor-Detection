This hotel was amazing! The rooms were very clean and neat. I got a great deal and so was nervous because it was such an amazing price but when we got there we were extremely impressed. The staff at the front desk was very friendly as well. I will be staying here every time I visit Phoenix! I can't say enough good things about it
