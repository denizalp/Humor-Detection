I had all but written off Shopsy's Deli. Too many undercooked meals at their Toronto locations and service that left something to be desired. My opinion was recently given a complete overhaul as Shopsy's Markham became the location for a recent YRSBiz tweet-up.\n\nPart of the appeal of Shopsy's is it's classic Deli look and feel, some of the downtown locations have received fancy makeovers and cross the border boarder of greasy spoon to sophisticated dining. This location is on the brink of one such makeover with the introduction of a new owner\/management. I'm looking forward\n\nOnce initial talks were over the staff proceeded to bring out tray after tray of canape style versions of some of their favourites with special twists on them to amaze us. And amaze they certainly did, the staff was on point with going into great detail explaining each dish as they were brought out. Describing the ingredients and making this already full patron reconsider just how much room he could spare to fit in a sandwich...or two....or 6. Oy Vay!\n\nHere is the menu we were treated to:\n1. Beef Burger sliders with wasabi mayo and French fried onions.\n2. Fresh shaved smoked turkey sliders (sandwiches)\n3. Chicken quesadilla with chpotle sauce drizzled on top\n4. Smoked meat (corned beef) slider with Dijon mustard on an onion bun\n\nFor desert the offered up a buttermilk pancake with an apple compote dine with what I recall was a burbon\/whiskey glaze.... Holy Food boner Batman!!! Wow.\n\nAside from desert my favourite of the lot definitely had to be the smoked meat and the beef slider (the wasabi mayo and french fried onions made a huge difference). Deliscious!!\n\nHad an opportunity to have a breif chat with the new manager and owner and this guy \"gets it\". He is all about customer service and doing what it takes to repair the image of this once failing restaurant. I'm more than excited to see this new and improved Shopsy's rise up to smoked meat and slider glory once again.
