I was doing the local playing tourist thing yesterday, and I decided to try Bachi HLK for a different breakfast.  I ordered coffee which was brought quickly and was refilled without asking for more.\n\nI think I knew from when I walked in the door that I'd have the brioche French toast and that's what I got.  A very flavorful stack of four brioche rounds, wonderfully soft and flavored nicely with almond.  On top of the stack were some banana slices and the plate had some small pieces of chopped kiwi and mango.  The plating was very nicely done.\n\nI had a choice of three syrups and I went with the coconut syrup.  You also have the choice of getting whipped cream which I opted for.  Along the the whipped cream and the syrup comes a small container of almond butter which is very rich and very tasty!\n\nService was excellent.  Well, you'd expect it to be!  I was the only person in the place who wasn't an employee.  \n\nI really like the decor.  Modern with lots of wood.  On the wall near where I sat was a TV with the Cooking Channel playing and while I waited I watched Nigella's show and her making Jamaican jerk chicken.  It passed the short wait very pleasantly.\n\nI plan to go back soon and try their fois gras de canard.  A good choice for breakfast with quality ingredients.
