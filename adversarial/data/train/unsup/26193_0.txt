I had the wonderful opportunity to stay at the Le Westin Montreal for a whopping 5 hours and 2 minutes since we arrived close to 2am and left a few minutes after 7a. The joys of traveling for work...This Westin continues to be on my top 10 list and is my GO TO hotel while I'm in Montreal. What a beautiful city...the staff at the hotel are wonderful and it's nothing but a great SPG experience.
