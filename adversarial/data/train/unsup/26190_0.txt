I don't know I just wasn't that impressed. It was a neat little store and the employees were super friendly but I couldn't find much (then again when I buy used I usually go to salvation army). I walked out with a dress that was 30 bucks and I have yet to wear. Maybe it's hit or miss? I just didn't find it that great.
