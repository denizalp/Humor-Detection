DO NOT FLY WITH ALLEGIANT THEIR LOW PRICES ARENT WORTH THE HEADACHE OF DEALING AND FLYING WITH THEM\n\nThe stewardess was the most ridiculous person I have ever met! I missed the \"turn off your phone\" announcement due to listening to music the stewardess came by and just picked up my phone disconnected my headset and told me it was confiscated no warning or anything not even the curtesy to realize I missed the announcement. I didn't receive my phone back till deplaned and went to the ticketing desk to retrieve it.\n\nFIRST AND LAST TIME FLYING WITH ALLEGIANT
