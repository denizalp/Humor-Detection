the staff that work there are so incompetent!  They stare at you when you place an order and make you repeat each sentence again!  They are a cluster of complete morons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Revamp them and start from scratch.  Maybe you might pick out some credible employees who actually want to work.  The only employee that stands out as polite and professional is someone by the name of Francis.  She friendly and deserves to be recognized by her manager.
