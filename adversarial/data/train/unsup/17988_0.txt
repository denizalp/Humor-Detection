My 1st time ever to experiment with Nitrogen Ice cream.\nNicely located in between Atwater Metro Station and Guy Metro station, so obviously, the students are the best clientele. When I arrived, the place was semi full. When I arrived to order, I was rushed to order, but I don't know the products at all, and I couldn't ask questions to understand. So the service was very disappointing.\n\nWe took a pineapple Gazo tea, which was very delicious. Then two ice cream Matcha and Oreo flavors. It was a lot of fun to receive the ice cream with cold smoke around it ... just flowing for a good 3-4 minutes!  Our ice cream cup continues to vibrate for very long time. The texture was so creamy, which surprised my mouth immensely. Personally, not my preference... I always preferred a mix of texture ( that's why I add nuts or granola in my yogurt).\n\nNitrogen ice cream was interesting fun experience.
