A little history....this location, which is an old house, is below street level and in the backyard of many new housing communities located on the corner of Sossman and Queen Creek Rds.\n\nPRIOR renters, and there have be at least 6 other businesses, have come and gone in 5 years... For some reason, this business owner, overhauled the property....lit it up more., added a volleyball court and lots of outdoor space...which is larger than the indoor space....when 117 degree weather hits that might be a terrible decision.\n\nThe menu is limited, tacos, with store bought tortillas.  I HAD the steak bowl which was so tough, I could hardly chew it....my friend could not chew his tacos at all.  They comped his meal.\n\nThe waitress was very nice, the manager, a sweetheart and he wanted to make it right...but based on our food I would never come back. (you earned 2 stars because of nice attitudes).\n\nCosta Vida, Chipolte , Cafe Rio, charge 6.00-8.50 for a superior product....\n\nThen menu is very limited and you better like tacos.  Our complementary, spiced, chips, were tiny and broken.  \n\nMy advice, expand your menu and look and see what others are doing at their Mexican restaurants and make it better to justify 10.99, for a bowl of slop.
