Gregg  Swarz (owner) was recommended by my local Honda specialist when I got stranded in Cleveland after my clutch went out. Unfortunately, we were 21 miles away from him and only 2 miles from a dealership.\n\n Gregg didn't perform any services for me, but he did help me understand the cost of replacing a clutch in my 2008 Honda Civic SI. I was going pay for the tow to him to repair because he quoted $1000 less than the dealership. However, the dealership lowered their price based on his quote and I avoided the hassle of the tow. Gregg talked to me multiple times and was always friendly. Without his help I could have overpaid.
