They lied to me about not being able to cancel a lottery ticket to fix the mistake they admitted to that they made and made me pay for the extra costs.\n\nCame here to buy lottery tickets, the lady there serviced me and I got 2 free tickets from my previous tickets. She asked me 3 times if i wanted encore (once before she printed each ticket) and I kept saying \"no I don't need it\". That was fine but when it came to pay, I noticed there was an encore on one of them, I told them I didn't want encore and that i only had enough money for what i came for since I am used to buying the same amount each time. The lady even admitted it was her fault and wanted to just pay that $1 extra herself but the guy kept saying \"just leave it. She'll leave. We already collected her money anyways\" outrageous! The guy there said he can't cancel my encore and cancelled my quick pick without my consent! He just took away my quick pick and gave me $2 back. I am sure encore can be cancelled out plus it was their fault for misprinting it. In the end, my mom had to come with the extra money i needed and we just left cause she didn't want to make a scene.
