I have never written a review for one single item, but here goes! The blueberry scone is quite possibly (wait for it, wait for it) the most amazing pastry I have ever sunken my teeth into. And I hate scones. They're usually so dry, so tasteless, so carb-y, but not this little number. The two times I devoured these bad boys, the deliciousness was served fresh from the oven, still warm! The things are packed with blueberries, so much so that the dough-y nature of the pastry doesn't hold together and crumbles as you break off bits to eat. Not an issue for me though, or the other great friends (Eric T & Jas) who turned me on to these suckers. I do love baking, but I don't know enough to say these are so incredible because the flour to egg ratio, or the cooking time must be different. I can tell you though that I haven't had a scone quite like this one, it's pretty unique in my opinion. They have another flavor, a maple I believe... not the same. Get the blueberry and devour that bad boy. Some day I'll go back and have a real meal, but I know nothing will compare to this little gem of a morning eat.
