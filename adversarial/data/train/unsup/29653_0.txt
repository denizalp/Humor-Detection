Went to this new place to try it out on their opening night. Excellent atmosphere, and the staff really had it together! Their wine selection is excellent and reasonably priced. I look forward to going back to try Chef Nick's food - it looked excellent! The owner Frank came over to introduce himself and chat for a bit, which was awesome. Keep up the great work!
