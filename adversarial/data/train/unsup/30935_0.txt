Walked in with a shopping bag full of pet foods, toys and leashes and a pile of old blankets for a shelter that rescued the Houston animals. The man didn't even blink an eye, no sigh, no eye roll. Just packed up my stuff and sent it off. I love this place and the superior service they provide. Thank you!
