The old fashioned burger basket combo was a joke.  The patty was thinner than the tomato.  A piece of bacon would be thicker!  Never even tasted the meat.  Asked me how like it cooked, couldn't be specific on this burger since the second it hits the cooking surface it would be done.  Come on, is this the Wammy Burger from the movie \"Falling Down\"?
