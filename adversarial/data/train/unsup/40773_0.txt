Good food experience, lightweight service.  We enjoyed so many great things here, and the last several visits have been truly memorable as the whole meal was put together well with very attentive service.\n\nI had a pear martini (they always have great drinks), seared foie gras, and trout - very nice.  However, at a restaurant with this level of quality and at higher price, I expect a high level of service.  \n\nNothing was terrible, but I feel like it is was missing polish.   Our water and wine were frequently empty - we needed to ask for more or pour our own.   I also remember last time there were beautiful finishing touches, like a chocolate truffle and handshake from the manager on our way out.  The night's special was also not fully outlined by our server (didn't mention dessert that was supposed to come with it).\n\nI guess I would say our experienced was not as \"magical\" as last time.  I'm not sure if we'll return given it is an higher priced restaurant and just expect it based on prior experiences.
