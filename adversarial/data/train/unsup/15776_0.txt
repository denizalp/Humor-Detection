WHAT TO TRY??\n\nTheir divine cookies!!! Chewy yet heavenly, fresh baked cookies!! \n\nThe smell of cookies the moment you step foot inside their bakery makes you very happy. They have over ten flavours (14 flavours to be exact!) and they all taste slightly different. I think the base is the same, however the toppings and sometimes the flavor extract is different. The chocolates are imported, they use natural vanilla and definitely lots of butter!! I love nuts so I definitely liked the nutcracker! I also liked the lemon delight a lot since it's different from the regular cookies you see everywhere else. \n\nBe careful though! Because once you take one bite of their cookies, you can't stop eating them. So you need high levels of self control when you eat these cookies because before you know it, you would have finished the whole batch you bought! I suggest you share it with a group of friends or your family so you don't end up eating all the cookies yourself! Watch the calories!! It can be on the sweeter side though so get a glass of milk ready or a cup of tea while you enjoy their cookies. \n\nLast tip?!\n\nThe cookies are sold by weight and can be ordered ahead of time. As well, if you're looking for a gift and cookies come into mind, they sell it in a bouquet style or in tins for you to give it away to your special someone(s). They wrap it up really nicely too!
