Whenever I want to try light vegetarian food I look for South Indian restaurants in the area. In North America outside the fine dining establishments, the South Indian restaurants are mostly small in size with light decor and small table chair setup. Madras cafe is such an establishment, small in size, light in decor. On to the food I am here for. Ordered a Mysore Masala dosa. Though I know but they were prompt in letting me know about the peanuts content. Mysore masala dosa with chutney on the insides and potatoes was very authentic. So were the coconut and peanut chutney served in the side and the sambhar. The masala tea as an afterthought turned out to be really good. Go for food and taste.
