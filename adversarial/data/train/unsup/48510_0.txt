This cool spot is conveniently located at the MGM Grand if you need a quick break from some slots.  The food was way better than I expected.  I tried the pork belly sandwich and caesar salad and was really impressed.  Both of these dishes are really, really awesome.  I tried the pizza with all the meat lover's fixings and it was extremely tasty but not as crispy as I would have expected (as a native Bronxite, I'm understandably biased).  Overall, I highly recommend this joint!
