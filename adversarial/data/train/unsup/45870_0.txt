Saw this place on that tv show, diners\/drive ins\/dives.....food is authentic...and fabulous!!!  Tried the Itaian sausage sandwich, the meatball sandwich, and several pastas.  The salads are great, and save room for a lemon bar or piece of cheesecake.  Yum!!!  Good for eat in, and for take home....enjoy!!
