I got gel nails put on exactly one week ago, and already one has fallen off, and the entire set looks atrociously fake. My gf went to a place on queen and spadina and paid half the price 3 weeks ago, and her nails still look great! I'm so upset by the fact that I have to get mine redone only a week after paying $75 for the set. \n\nSave your money.
