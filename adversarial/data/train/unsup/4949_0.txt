DO NOT COME HERE. CAFE MODA IS UP THE STREET.\n\n-FOOD WAS WAAYY OVERPRICED AND POORLY MADE. I ordered the chicken wings and is was basically bone and skin. Pancit was dry hardly any meat just noodles and veggies. Portions are small for the price. \n\n-THE DJ HAHAHA. tipping is something that shouldn't be expected. especially to a DJ that sits on his ass drinking sodas all night and smoking cigarettes outside. and if you don't tip him you don't sing. the employees sing most of the night which is weird...um....shouldn't you be working?\n\n-THE PLACE ITSELF...SHAKE MY HEAD...I stepped into the the twilight zone. its Christmas, a zoo, a Circus all in one when you step in. Christmas lights all over trying to make it look nice? Awkward paintings on the walls of clowns and fairies...like WTF am I looking at?\n\n-HEALTH DEPARTMENT PLEASE VISIT. no disposable seat covers so as a women I was forced to stand up squat and pee. lol.
