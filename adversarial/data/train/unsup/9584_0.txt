Well I am a fatty and after a rigorous hike, my legs and back were aching so I dropped in for a massage and they were able to accommodate me within 15 minutes.  I wanted it deep and hard, now now that's naughty.  To release those tight muscles, you know.  This is getting worse.  Okay, Tawny was wonderful, the hot towels warmed up the muscles and she certainly did make it hurt, but in a good way and I actually felt the tight leg muscles relax.   Very clean facility and massage room was equipped with full bath.  Good price $95 for 50 minutes.
