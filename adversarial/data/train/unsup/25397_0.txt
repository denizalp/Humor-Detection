I'm an Iguana Mack's kinda girl but we often go for \"one more next door\" or for food. Dos is a fun bar. I think it's even more fun on a night that's kind of slow. Bartenders are all fun and attentive which is really important to me. The stuff that's painted on the walls is pretty funny, especially in the bathroom. Great specials. I love that they have $1 shots when it rains!
