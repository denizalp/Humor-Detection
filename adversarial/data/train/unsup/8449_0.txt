While I can say that the chocolate ice cream was damn near close to the best ever and the chocolate and pecan mouse will knock your socks off...the service lacked so terribly that I can't help but give 3 stars.\n\n If you would have thrown it to the ground and passed a plastic fork...we would have still eaten it and cried in endless joy but that's not the point. It COULD have been a wonderful experience, one of the best but you screwed me Juliette. Get your chocolate coma staff a shot of espresso and a tad bit of direction and you'd have yourself a true gem.
