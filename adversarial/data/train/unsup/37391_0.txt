This is the best buffet I've been to in Las Vegas, hands down.  It's a little bit more expensive than some of the others that are nearby (perhaps by $4 or $5 if you're going for lunch), but it's well worth spending the extra few dollars.\n\nI think the most important thing to mention about this buffet is their obvious emphasis on quality over quantity.  Sure, there aren't nearly as many options to choose from here as there are at the Carnival World Buffet or even at the Spice Market Buffet... but the care they put into preparing everything they serve is totally obvious.  There is not a single thing I ate here that I would not have ordered (and been fully satisfied with) as a stand-alone entree at a sit-down restaurant.\n\nThe meats at the carving station were nothing short of divine (they had the only moist, non-dried-out turkey I found on a carving station all week), the sliders were actually really good, my boyfriend loved the BBQ chicken and red onion pizza, the pasta dishes were great, and the desserts - OMG THE DESSERTS - were fan-freaking-tastic.  \n\nIs that a soft-serve ice cream machine on the dessert bar?  No, no... it's actually got raspberry and peach sorbet inside.  \n\nThose eclairs are definitely going to be mushy and previously frozen, right?... oh, no, no... they're moist, delicious, and full of chocolate cream.\n\nGet it?  The desserts are awesome.\n\nWhy 4 stars instead of 5?  The waitress was efficient enough, but she was a little on the surly side (she was actually my least favorite server I had at any restaurant or buffet during my entire vacation).\n\nIf you visit a single buffet during your trip to Las Vegas, I'd highly recommend that you make it The Buffet at Bellagio.  You're not likely to be disappointed.
