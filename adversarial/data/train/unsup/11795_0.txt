Oh dear Lord, what an experience...\n\nProblem number one is the front line staff does not speak English even to an 'average' level.  I placed a very simple order (even pointing to the item on the menu) and it turned into a rendition of Who's On First.\n\nAfter some discussion a second employee stepped in (he was wearing a polo, so I am assuming he is leadership) and the problem did not resolve.  Eventually, my food was complete, relatively close to what I ordered and I paid the rather large bill for 2 adults.  The front end\/ordering experience was absolutely horrible to the point that I would really avoid this business going forward and find a different Qdoba.\n\nNow for the food: I had steak tacos and the 3-cheese nachos.  Excellent.  Great flavor, savory, tender, all around good.  Good seasoning, perfectly cooked.  If I had even adequate service they would not get less than 4 stars.\n\nUnfortunately, they tarred and feathered me prior to the food experience so I probably won't be back (to this location).
