This place is open 24 hours. Came here for breakfast yesterday. They have a special on their pastry menu. You can pick three for $9. Got the blueberry muffin, bagel, and cheddar chive biscuit. The biscuit actually seems like the red lobster Chesapeake biscuit recipe. This was actually the best pastry on their menu. You get two huge biscuits, honey, and butter. Not a bad deal!
