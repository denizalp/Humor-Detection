Amados is one of those places you might see featured in the movie Clerks if Kevin Smith decided to use a restaurant instead of a convenience store. Dirtbags hanging out on the outside, bizarre people on the inside, but products that you just want to keep going back for.\n\nAs my friend used to describe it, \"You get a burrito the size of your calf for about 3 bucks.\"\n\nAmados attracts a mixed clientele from construction workers on their lunch break to high school kids using the patio as their own personal smoke shed to post-clubgoers grabbing a 2 am snack.\n\nThe staff is all hispanic and most speak english with a strong accent prevailing, yet in the hundred or so times I've been there my order has never been screwed up. \n\nBreakfast burritos are good and carne asada burritos are so loaded with meat that I often avoid it because it's too heavy a meal. Even the basic bean burrito was too much for my ex to finish each time she ordered it. \n\nIt's hard to argue the quality, service and low price even if the parking lot clientele may intimidate you at first glance. Avoid the place after midnight if that's the case. That's when the hoopties are in full swing.
