We have been living in our rental property since September and fell in love with the home and location. Initially there were only small problems: broken soap pump, dishwasher didn't dry, pool filter things like that were handled within two weeks. Then we discovered termites... Ok I understand it's not if you get them but when. That was taken care of as well in a fairly timely matter.\n\nThen the icing on the cake: THE HOUSE IS INFESTED WITH ROOF RATS. absolutely horrifying. After two estimates, it's clear that colony American went with the cheapest company because they didn't even get in the attic to survey the massive amount of damage that has been going on for YEARS! They bought the least expensive package (3 traps) for a few weeks and then are having another company patch the 17 holes in the roof. Backwards?! You don't even know. The property manager, Karen, doesn't return phone calls. I hear the rats tap dancing above my head but because the traps are only at the entrance to the attic and NO WHERE ELSE the clever rodents have learned to avoid them. \n\nThis experience is absolutely horrendous and I do not understand how a company can be so irresponsible. We pay so much money to live here only to listen to rats frolic above our heads. \n\nWe have one more week of Burns Pest Control with traps and then Truly Nolan will fix the roof. \n\nThe disappointment and disgust is palatable. They understand the gravity of the situation and actively choose the least effective path. Not to mention the two rats we did catch had to sit up there cooking for two days at one point so the house smelled like rotting death. We couldn't even eat here. \n\nIf I can give anyone any advice about this company it's this: RUN. They do not care about you or the home. We can't afford to move right now. Don't get stuck in a similar situation. It's not worth it. \n\nUPDATE 7\/21\/15: It has been 24 hours since Caryn called. I have left three voicemails in return and nothing.
