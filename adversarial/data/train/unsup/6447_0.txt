Bootlegger has been on my to do list for quite a while and I finally came by for lunch with my mom. \n\nThe restaurant is so large, but still feels very intimate. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and my mom ordered the meatball sandwich. My lunch special came with a very generous sized side salad. The house dressing was great. My entree was excellent and I enjoyed everything about our meal as well as the friendly and attentive service. \n\nI look forward to coming back again soon.
