The lobster in garlic sauce and mild is better than captain boil mixed sauce. I like the shrimps basket that comes with Cajun fries. The seafood fried rice is also good but I put some captain boil sauce with it and it becomes better,  otherwise, I think it's a bit dry and not enough taste. There isn't much seafood in the fried rice as well so that's the bad side. The mussels are good and very meaty. I had it with garlic sauce mild and captail boil mixed sauce mild. Both sauces are good with the mussels so it depends on personal preference. Also ordered a pound of clams but I prefer the mussels over the clams. Overall, this place is pretty good and service is acceptable. Make sure to make reservation, otherwise, you may have to line up for table.
