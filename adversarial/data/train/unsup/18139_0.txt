Osaka has been around for a few years, but closed a while back due to a fire.  They re-opened recently, after extensive renovations, and I'm very glad they're back.\n\nI go over once every week or so.  The food is always fresh, well prepared and gorgeous to look at.  The sushi is amazing.  The entrees are always brought to the table very quickly.   There is an extensive menu, with many options for people who don't like sushi.  There are lots of noodle dishes, tempuras, BBQ'ed meats, vegetarian dishes, soups, dumplings.. The list goes on.  The bento box meals are one of my all-time faves.\n\nThe service is quick, and friendly.  It has a very relaxed atmosphere, clean and tidy, and the new decor provides booths with some privacy as they have large partitions between them.\n\nThis restaurant is one of those hidden gems that you need to experience.   The price might be a bit higher, but the food quality is excellent every time.  I've never had a bad meal here.
