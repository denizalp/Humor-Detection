Wow! What a beautiful remodel! With the previous establishment having been soooo disgusting, i know it took a lot of time and money to get the place so warm and inviting! They have some great craft beers, specialty cocktails, and an appetizing menu! My friend and I shared the 1\/2lb. Stache Burger! It had about everything imaginable on it- well worth the cost! The staff uniforms and unique atmosphere really bring the speakeasy vibe! Can't wait to go back!
