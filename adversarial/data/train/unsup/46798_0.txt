After just a moment reviewing the menu you'll get the idea that this place is run by the chef...and you'll be right.  We've enjoyed a total of six different dishes and each was more delicious and flavorful than the last.  I have noticed over the course of the last month the crowds are building and I expect the wait to soon become as intolerable as its neighbor Kitchen Table, but I guess that is the price one must pay for truly good food.
