You ever work back of the house at a suburban chain restaurant? Picture that disgusting dish rack. The greasy ass floors. You crawl out like a slug at the end of your slimy shift.\n\nThat's this place.\n\nIt might be the setup--kitchen at the front and clogged lunch line blocking the door. It could be the low ceilings and wobbly cafeteria tables. It's possibly the abundance of grimy college kids taking a study break. No offense college kids, but your grimier activities elsewhere leave you thinking this is a safe haven. It's not.\n\nThe sandwiches are not good enough to justify how dirty you feel when you leave. So order to go? They take away your fries.\n\nBottom line: avoid this place. Spend an extra 20 minutes and catch the 61C towards the cleaner location in squirrel hill.
