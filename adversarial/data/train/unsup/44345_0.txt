If this review was just for the morning crew, it would be a lot higher. They are awesome. However, the afternoon crew is another story. There wasn't any of the Pike roast available when ordered. No worries. Waited a few minutes. And a few minutes more...10 minutes go by, so up to the counter we go. When asked if the coffee was ready, the barista says \"oh..yeah.\" And starts pouting it. He had completely forgotten about it and apparently forgot that it was paid for as he started talking crap as we were leaving. A few other customers got their order incorrect as we were waiting too. Maybe less time chit chatting at the counter and a little bit more time focusing on your customers would help.
