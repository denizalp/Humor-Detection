The More You Know: \"One of the favorite sushi fishes, yellowtail, is factory-farmed like veal and fattened until its muscles disintegrate while it's still alive.\"  Yum.\n\nThree of us walked in on a Sunday night for Reverse Happy Hour and we were told to sit anywhere we wanted.  Seeing that there was only one clean table, we grabbed a very comfortable booth seat.  The whole time we were there, none of the tables had been cleaned even though we saw quite a few members of the staff standing around talking.  \n\nNow the food:  Uneven cuts, high prices, okay quality, and soggy seaweed.  All our rolls had black\/purple\/forbidden rice.  I was all for it, my brother was against it, and our childhood friend was on the wall about.  I think the slight nuttiness of the forbidden rice paired well with some of the stuff while in others, like in the sweet shrimp, it was distracting.  Depending on which chef made the rolls, they were either uniform or uneven.  Why even send out the food if it's obviously cut sloppily?  Also, our Avocado Unagi Roll didn't appear to have unagi in it.  The gyoza we ordered was practically doggy paddling in sauce.  I did enjoy the Deep Fried Mac & Cheese and the Tootsie Roll though.  We spent nearly $60, before tip for gyoza and six rolls.\n\nIt's a trendy restaurant but I don't see myself coming back.  The price point definitely doesn't match the quality and portions.  3-stars and A-OK all around but yeah, life's too short for \"meh\" sushi.  Also to note, there's a weird smell to the restaurant.  Aiyah!
