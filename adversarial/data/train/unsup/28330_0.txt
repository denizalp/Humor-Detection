So far the juices, food and service have been wonderful. Prices are also very reasonable. I wish they would specify what was organic vs. not, however that won't stop me from coming. Also the music in the place is usually a bit much for me (natural foods with synthetic music), but it is like that in so many places now. It's just nice to have more options for healthy foods. Keep up the good work!
