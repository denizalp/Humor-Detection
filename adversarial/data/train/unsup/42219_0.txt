this tequila bar is located just outside the entrances to both Fuego Steakhouse and Amigos Mexican restaurant.  We each enjoyed a house margarita and orders of Southwestern crab cakes with a chipolte sauce.  There was probably more filler than crab meat with the chipolte sauce adding most of the flavor.
