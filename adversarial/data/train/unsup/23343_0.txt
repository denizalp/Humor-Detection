The service was great--that is, once we were seated.  The place was packed, and we were told the wait would be 45 min to an hour.  Seeing that home was less than a mile away, rather than stand around, we decided it would make more sense to leave for a bit and come back.  We returned to find out our name was called a half hour earlier, and the hostess, clearly agitated that we weren't there, was persistent about having us put our name back on the waiting list, forcing us to wait again.  It wasn't until a manager was brought over that the situation was quickly remedied and we were immediately seated.\n\nI don't know if anyone spit in our food because of that, but my dish sure tasted delicious.
