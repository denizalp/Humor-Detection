Spelling errors on the morning news, errors reporting the news, dumb jokes... how do the morning folks stay on air? How has Jason made it this far in journalism? When he reads the teleprompter it seems like he barely knows how to read! Jason and Monica together are total clowns. They don't even pay attention to the other reporters or to each other. There was once a story about a street being named after Sammy Davis, Jr. The reporter was on scene talking about it. When we went back to Jason and Monica in the studio, it was clear they weren't even paying attention... Jason asked, \"Do we have a street in Las Vegas named after Sammy Davis, Jr.?\" Uhhh, Jason, what in the world was your colleague just talking about? They are unprofessional and unprepared. I don't know much about journalism, but I know I expect a certain level of professionalism. I feel like monkeys could more efficiently tell me what I need to know about local, regional, and global news in the mornings. Why do I even bother turning this channel on??
