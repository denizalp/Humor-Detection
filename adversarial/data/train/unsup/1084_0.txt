My lady and I went for a late lunch and was overwhelmingly surprised by the great beer selection. There menu was awesome too, we had a couple of burgers to boot. Let me tell you when you order a burger do not expect to leave hungry. They were absolutely delicious. I had the diner burger and she had the tap house burger. Everything and everyone was spot on. Micaela was are server\/bartender and was very knowledgable and very friendly. We will definitely be frequenting this establishment.
