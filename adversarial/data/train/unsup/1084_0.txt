To date, this is my favorite AYCE KBBQ in Las Vegas. Pricing is good, menu is not difficult, and food quality is mostly consistent. I've been coming here forever and I'm just realizing I haven't ever reviewed this place!! Haha \n\nI believe they have 10grill tables (if I counted correctly) so the place is small if you're dining AYCE coz the other side is menu ordering with no table grill. So coz it's small, expect to wait. Especially if you go late night  for they after 10pm $13.99 special. The place is always packed. \n\nThe food quality and service is usually consistent but I do notice at night during the special pricing hour, the brisket slices are a lot smaller than when you come to eat during the normal pricing hours. If you wanna get your fill of meat, Tofu Hut does not go wrong. $16.99 is a price you can't beat and $13.99 for after 10pm is a steal. \n\nMy go to is steamed egg (not included in the $13.99) brisket, and tongue. The marinated rib eye and short ribs are so good in their flavor, but personally too heavy for me and I get full faster. So I'm all about the salad, sticking to only one bowl of rice and making that last, and load up on the meat. Get my money's worth. \n\nKBBQ is not well known in my hometown, so when I have visitors from Jacksonville, Tofu Hut is a must to grub at! best part is I never leave disappointed, just really full lol\n\nWhy 4 stars? Well as much as the great, coz I think they get so busy and turn over tables as quickly as they can, the overall cleanliness and decor is just ehhh... Nothing spectacular. The bathroom is ehhhh also, and menus are very oily and sticky from grill splatters. But these don't stop me from coming and grubbing. But just in case you wondering why 4stars, but otherwise I'm a Tofu Hut loyal.
