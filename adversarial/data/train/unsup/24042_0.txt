Ri-Ra's is an Irish pup, not a stereotypical Chinese man saying \"We Lost\".\n\nOn weekend's they'll have a cover, but this is offset by the lack of a bathroom attendant, so the overhead expense for going out here is in line with the rest of downtown Charlotte.\n\nThe prices of drinks are probably a bit higher here, so you may wish to get a base going before you find yourself here.\n\nThe bartender was pretty nice to me.  I used an iPhone app with a drink database to order a random obscure cocktail and \"Irish Twist\".  She had no idea what it was but made it for me using the iPhone recipe, injecting some uniqueness into my Ri-Ra's experience.\n\nAnd it may have just been the Irish Twists handling my perceptions, but I'm pretty sure she liked me.
