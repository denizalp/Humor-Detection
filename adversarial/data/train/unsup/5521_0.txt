Worst customer service ever.\n\nI dropped my watch off on a Thursday, and the clerk said it would be about $20 to repair, and it would be done by tomorrow. Little did I know that I would receive it 2 weeks later and be charged more than twice the amount he specified.\n\nI came back the next day only to find nobody at the store, even though it was well before closing. My guess is that they were on a lunch break but didn't bother letting anyone know when they would be back. So I came back Monday and he said they sent the watch out to another guy to get repaired. He said to try calling tomorrow. I waited an extra day and called on Wednesday, and he told me to try calling on Friday. This went on for another week, of me having to continuously call the store, and having the same clerk tell me it would be done the next day, only to have him tell me the same thing.\n\nI do not mind if the repair would take a week or two, but if it does just let me know straightaway, instead of telling me lies constantly and putting it off.\n\nFinally I asked him what was going on and to give me a definite date. So I came in on the second Saturday since I dropped off the watch and had to wait for it to be delivered. After it came in, he charged me $45, when he initially said $20. I mentioned this to him and he said he normally charges $75 instead. At this point I just wanted to pay and get out of there as soon as possible.\n\nThe watch itself has been repaired and works fine now, but I would not recommend this place to anyone because of the service. You can get the same thing done with better service elsewhere.
