I really enjoy eating hot pot, especially in the winters. I've always eaten it at home but my family decided to try Chinese hot pot outside the home for once. \n\nYou are given two choices of sauce in a cute little yin and yang style pot. We ended up getting seaweed (white) and herbal spice (red). The herbal spice ended up being too spicy for almost everyone.\n\nThe Red Pot is an AYCE \"grab it yourself\" style restaurant. They have all kinds of food -- frozen, of course, or keep chilled so you can cook it. \n\nYou even make your own dipping sauce, which is awesome! They offer so many things so you really can get your creative juices flowing. First time here and don't know where to start? Try my recipe: sesame sauce, a pinch of red tofu sauce, a pinch of the greenish sauce next to it (didnt see the name), and a bit of sesame oil. Then I went over to the other side and added cilantro, green onion, a dash of soy sauce, and a wee bit of garlic. Mix together thoroughly and taste. I found that this was too salty for my taste, so I added some water. This also helped the texture become less pasty. \n\nOther than that, here's what I had and my thoughts:\n- Lobster rolls: YUMM! \n- Corn: mediocre... it was so bland, not sweet, tasted old?\n- Scallop: yum!\n- Masaigo balls: YUMMMM!!!\n- Imitation crab: yum\n- shrimp: yum\n\nI had some other fish balls that I cant remember the name of, but I didn't particularly like it.\n\nIt was extremely slow in there. I think there were maybe 3 other tables in the restaurant, and the staff were all very attentive in refilling the waters and changing plates.\n\nWhen we got to the end, we went to the back to look for fruits. They had watermelon, lychee, oranges, pineapples, but it seemed to be sitting out all day so we didn't touch it.\n\nThe price wasn't worth it, IMHO. It was $35 before the 20% winter discount was applied, which in my opinion was too expensive despite the AYCE concept. Basically, I would have much rather buy my own food at the local market. From now on, hot pot at home!
