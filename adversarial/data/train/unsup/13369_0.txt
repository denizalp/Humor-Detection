I mean who isn't attracted to $3.59 Chicken and Waffles?! My BF and I stumbled upon Sunny's on Yelp and (1) ratings were great (2) saw the prices and right away were like \"okay let's go here\" \n\nThough it was 20min from our apt, we were excited for this meal. It isn't in the best part of town (deep east side), and the restaurant isn't one I'd call fancy, but don't let that scare you off! \n\nI took off a star just because the food did take quite a while to get ready. I wanna say we waited about 25-30min for our food.. My BF got the chicken and waffles ($3.59) and I opted for their catfish fish and chips southern style ($5.99). Okay presentation looked great, prices were AMAZING but I guess the food was just good\/okay. The chicken was seasoned very well. The waffle was really soft and kinda soggy. We both agreed we like it better crispier like how other place make it since the chicken obviously will make it soggy in the long run. My catfish looked great and came with a lot but they were also thin so it was more of the breading than the meat, which was a little disappointing too. The fries it came with were really soft too. Ehh idk the prices are GREAT like I said, but the food was honestly mediocre and took forever.. May or may not come back since it is quite a drive, but we'll see
