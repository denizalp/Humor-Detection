Simply awful. I didn't want to go to spring mountain, so walked here. I called first to make sure I could get a foot massage, and when I arrived, the lady said only body massage for $60. Strike one. The massage was horrible and she had \"bad allergies\". Strike two. Constantly leaving the room and sniffling. Strike three. After 30 minutes of nothing, I walked out. What a waste of money and time.
