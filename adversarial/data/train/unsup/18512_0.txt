I'm not the type to go for spa treatments, I tend to leave that to my wife. However I found a deal with Red Flag Deals and was stressed at the time and decided to pick up the offer as its close to my office.\n\nTrying to book an appointment was next to impossible. They would never answer the phone. Their web site is outdated as the hours of operation are not at all up to date. I decided to go and pay them a visit to book my appointment. \n\nOnce there, I would have to say everything was fine. The therapist was great as I asked her to focus on my shoulders. She was able to release the tension in my back and shoulder. I was happy with that.\n\nGot an insurance form too boot.
