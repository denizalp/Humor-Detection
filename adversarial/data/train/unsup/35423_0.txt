We saw a review of French Grocery on Check Please! and decided to give it a try for dinner. I'm not a huge fan of French cuisine , but after looking at the menu I knew I'd be fine. This is more of a French\/Creole style place. Our server , Willie, made our experience incredibly fun! He was very well versed in wine and did an excellent job pairing for us. To top it off, he has a really great personality that made us feel like regulars. Now, on to the food. I had Veal Sweetbreads to start and holy delicious! My mom had the Crab Canap√© and I'm pretty sure it's what heaven tastes like. Brown butter, fresh crab - just divine! I had the Cassoulet with a roasted duck leg and let me tell you...decadent doesn't even begin to describe this seasonal dish. I don't even like duck and I couldn't get enough. Go give it a try!
