Review for their Beignets only. My friends and I were craving something sweet and decided to order the beignets. Oooo this hit the spot! Beignets were crisp on the outside, soft and warm on the inside and the dipping sauces were amazing!! I definitely recommend!\n\n*Please keep in mind they only serve beignets at the Palazzo location and not at the Venetian.*
