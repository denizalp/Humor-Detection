Bienvenidos! Always wanting to try new places, my brother and I came here for dinner one evening for their happy hour. It was too humid outside so we snagged two seats at the bar inside. It's a small trailer-like spot with a bathroom reminiscent of one in an airplane. It was cooler inside but a bit cramped of course, and I didn't appreciate being around alcohol and the smell but it was worth it being indoors.\n\nWe ordered the jackfruit fries from their HH menu to start and I got the Bumblebee biscuit. My brother got the Koko biscuit, which he enjoyed. I thought the fries were great, shoestring topped with purple slaw and jackfruit, such an interesting and tasty food. I loved my biscuit, the fried chicken was done right and the sweet and savory flavors of honey and mustard worked really well. Topped with pickles for a nice crunch and change of texture. \n\nThere are several vegan options as noted by the V on the menu. Definitely a great spot for dinner and open late.
