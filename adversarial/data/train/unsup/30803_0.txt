Shauns towing is literally the best towing company ive ever dealt with in vegas! They came fast and they charged a flat rate of $75, ive had companies charge me $90 to tow my car half a mile and it took them about 2 hours to get to me. Shauns towing got right on the job after we called them and sent someone right over! If you ever need a tow truck this is definetly the company to call and this is the only company my family will be using for now on
