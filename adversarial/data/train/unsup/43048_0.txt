Absolutely amazing. We both had chicken gyros. They were delicious and I appreciate the extra sauce. The fries were amazing my wife said \"I think these might be the best fries I've ever had in my life.\" We're a little snobby about food but this place is incredible. I'll be back! And great customer service.
