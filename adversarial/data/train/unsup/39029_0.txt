Neck in neck with other candy stores, Suckers just doesn't measure up! If I wanted to buy a pack of skittles, I would go to the dollar shop and buy them cheaply! The outside of this store is quite inviting, colorful, vibrant sign, it hits you like bullseye.  \n\nI've been to my fair share of Candy stores, I'm addicted to candy, but there's a fine line between reasonably priced candy and a total ripoff.  The only positive thing that I can say about this store is that it does carry sugar-free candy, and it has a whole section for jelly bellies!! If there's one thing I'm a suck for, it's jelly bellies. \n\nFor a good quality candy store, check on the Nutty Chocolatier on Queen East (in the beaches).
