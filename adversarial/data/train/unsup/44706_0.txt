Ordered delivery for 1st time. Pleasant guy answered to take order & offered advice. Arrived to Beechview in ~35min piping hot by same guy who took the order. Really nice & his mother in law does the cooking. My fave chinese in town is sesame inn so gave it a shot. Hot & sour soup was on point. Real nice hotness & thickness. Chicken egg roll was average & it reminded me how good sesame inns are & i wished i had one. Rice was sticky but nice. Sesame Chicken & Orange chicken both interesting. I asked for white meat. It was good quality but was very soggy which can be typical for takeout. Plenty of tasty sauce but no signs of any vegetables in either. I'd try something different next time around.  Not my favorite ever, but far from the worst. Grade B for food & A for delivery service
