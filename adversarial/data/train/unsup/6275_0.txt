This European market is a new find for me- I usually just take my business to Jones Market but love to stumble upon and explore other options around town. Heads up that this place does not have a produce section, but they make up for it by having a deli with sandwiches baked goods. \n\nExterior needs some work- appears to be a generic convenience store. Inside there are several rows and a few refrigerated sections, the aforementioned deli and a dine-in seating area, a ton of sweets\/baked goods, and a large section of alcohol\/wines and smoking paraphernalia\/products. \n\nStaff is laid back, store is clean. \nHighly recommend the deli section- they have a bomb Italian sando, as well as a really good turkey BLT option that's great with mozzarella. The meats and cheeses are cut to order. Baked goods include breads (day-old for as low as TWENTY CENTS) as well as sweets (giant cupcakes for under $2). Pricing is good, selection is decent.
