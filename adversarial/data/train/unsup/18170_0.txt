I walked in hoping to find some tile for my new patio enclosure. The salesperson at the front desk was on the phone, and there was another salesperson behind the desk who said nothing to me at all. When the girl on the phone finished her conversation, she just started talking to the other guy and never asked if I needed help or anything. I looked around, didn't really see what I wanted and left. I was the only person in the small showroom, so there was no reason for both of them to ignore me.  I work in retail, and not acknowledging a customer is a big no-no. I doubt i'll ever go back to that store.
