This is such a great place for kids to learn to swim - instructors like Andrew and Sayors and front desk ladies Shay and Rebecca  make for a terrific experience from registration to learning to swim. Andrew has such a great demeanor with the 3-4 years - very impressed with the progress of my granddaughter who I have been bringing here since she was 6 months old. I just can't say enough about how appreciative I am of the outstanding experience I have had. If you want your child to learn to swim - this is the place!! Thank you WW staff!
