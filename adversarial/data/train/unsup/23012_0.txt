I requested Cool Blew through my warranty company (One Guard) for a second opinion after another company kept repeatedly misdiagnosing issues with my AC unit that left me with a non-working AC and zone control system for over a month!\n\nI must say, I had a much better experience with this company than I did my first. A technician came out to diagnose my issue, but since they predictably concluded that it was tied into my zone control, he requested that a more experienced technician look at the problem. Even when a second technician came out, he requested that yet another crew member stop by in order to check my ducts, making sure they rule out all possibilities. And even after the necessary adjustments were made, I still had to have yet another senior technician come out to make even further adjustments. Eventually, things were up and running as they should be.\n\nIt took repeated visits and multiple technicians for them to get a definitive conclusion of just what exactly needed to be done. But unlike the previous company I dealt with, when it was done - it was done right. And it didn't require all of these out of pocket costs for \"guess work\" that ultimately failed to solve the problem.\n\nCommunication was very good. All phone calls were returned promptly and all appointments were scheduled in a very timely fashion, with very little time lapse between each visit.  \n\nIf I ever have AC issues in the future, which I probably will given my luck, I will specifically be requesting that my warranty company send out these people.\n\nRecommended!
