I've been craving Chinese takeout for weeks. When I saw that Spicy Mama had opened, I headed on over. Though it's set up similar to Panda Express (cafeteria style bowls and plates) with pre-made food on display, they made two of the three entrees I tried fresh to order. \n\nSalt and pepper shrimp were freshly-fried with 6 to an order, served with peppers and onions but not quite as salty or peppery as I prefer. The beef and broccoli was solid, with tender meat and broccoli that was cooked just right- not soggy and drowned in sauce, as elsewhere. The Chinese Ribs aren't my thing, but my dining companion really enjoyed them and the light honey-based sauce kept this from being too heavy. I prefered their fried rice to the noodle, which could have used more veggies. Feel like an eggroll should be included in the plate combo. \n\nThey advertise combos available starting at $5 for a single-entree bowl, up to $8 for a three-entree plate. Note that several entree options have (reasonable) add-on fees. Majority of business is takeout or delivery, small and clean dining area available.
