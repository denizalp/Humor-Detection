Whenever I crave Chinese food, which is often because I AM Chinese, I hop in my car and drive 27.1 miles down to this place for several reasons.\n\n1) It's authentic.\n2) It tastes reliably great every time I go.\n3) There isn't another Chinese place on the north side of town that serves anything comparably good.\n\nI know the young college kid\/busboy\/waiter that Madi D. mentioned and yeah, there are times when he's a little space brained but it's not intentional and for the most part, he's pretty attentive to customers.  So yeah, the service may not be a 5 but once you get to know the people working there, they take care of you.  While I agree that it shouldn't matter because a patron is a patron but still - this is just how it is... \n\nMy favorite dishes from this place include:\n\n* Eggplant and garlic sauce\n* Beef stew\n* Porridge\n* Salty fish & chicken fried rice\n* Four season beans\n* Beef noodles\n* Bitter melon\n\nIt's all very tasty and believe me, I wouldn't drive over 50 miles round trip several times a week just so I could yelp about it later.  I've brought many friends and family here and will continue to do so in the future because it's just that damn good.\n\nIf you see me there, feel free to introduce yourself, you can tell if I'm there because my oil dripping car will be in the parking lot (read my review for Right Toyota!).\n\nCheers!\n\nc
