I've been to this San woos many times years ago when the food was actually good. My husband had a craving for duck so we decided to have lunch there before heading home to Cali. I ordered the cod with tomato Sauce and he ordered the duck and pork bbq lunch special. When we got our  plates we both looked at each other with disbelief. The kiddie size cod portion with pile of rice, an egg role, and soup were all squished  on the plate as though it was just thrown together. The sauce tasted like sweet and sour rather than tomato sauce so I asked the waiter and he said it was the same thing. His duck portion looked like 1 small piece(small drumstick size) cut into small slices. Same with the pork. So small u could spoon up the slices in a spoon and eat it in one bite. The taste was just as worse as the appearance. Both  duck and pork were dry. It looks as though they just served the left overs. The egg drop soup salty. The bill was $19.36 for both. Such a waste of money. We just wanted a great meal before our long drive home. Instead we left feeling like we got conned and ripped off. NEVER will I ever step foot in that place! Oh, and before we even ordered the table next to us complained about a hair in their food. To make up for it we went to Thai noodle house across the street! Awesome food and geat prices!!
