So we went back to Red 8 this past weekend on Saturday night after being invited back from the Red 8 team. This dining experience was fantastic. The service was outstanding and the food was superb. The Sweet and Sour Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pau Chicken and Spring rolls were amazing. We shared the food it was perfect. I wish i could remember the servers name as he was very attentive and the waiter assistants were helpful as well. Thanks for a great Saturday Night Dinner before a night out on the town.  We will go back for sure...
