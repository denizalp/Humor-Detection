I don't know why so many people are ragging on this place. I've been coming here every time that I come to Vegas.\n\nYes, the decor inside is a little \"old\" and yes so are the waitresses, but don't knock that down before you get to the awesome menu.\n\nTo me, it's just a vendor serving up some good, local comfort food.\n\nTry coming for lunch as they have an affordable menu and plenty of tables available in the area.
