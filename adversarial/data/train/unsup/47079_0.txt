The food and service was perfect. We shared the calamari as an appetizer, I had the scallops and he had the braised short ribs as our main courses, we shared the Mac & Cheese\/Brussel Sprouts as our sides then shared a brookie for dessert. Everything exceeded expectations and I would definitely come back. Yes, it's pricey, but definitely worth it. Not sure why this place hasn't received more 5 star ratings!
