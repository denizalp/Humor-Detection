I've never seen so many sodas in one loci. They look like a never ending train entwining the store.\nAlso there are all the best retro candies and gum. I saw big cherry, and fruit stripe!\nI'm just sad they can no longer get Blendheim's- best ginger ale in the business. It made me sneeze every time I drank it, it was so spicy. Good stuff. Not their fault though.\nGood assortment of taffy.\nAwesome weekly drawings for a shot at a free case of sodas-your choice,can be all different!\nThat appeals to me,gemini! :)\n\nWhat a fun store. They have old-looking ads on the wall too, cuz some of this stuff is pretty dated.
