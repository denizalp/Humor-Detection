Had the summerlicious lunch menu here (and shared halvsies with a friend, so got to try two of each course!)\n\nThis is what we tried:\n\nAppetizer\n- Salad: Had a really nice dressing, and the cherry tomatoes were super tasty\n- Plowmen's Platter: four slices of salami, pickled veggies, tapenade, and three slices of toast. Everything was really good, especially the tapenade (it wasn't too salty - yay!)\n\nMain\nFish and chips: delightful. The fish was done just right, and the fries were yummy (skinny fries!). Highlight was the orange coloured dip. Tartar sauce was ok.\nSmoked chicken sandwich: i was expecting a sandwich-looking dish based on the name. But it looks more like a burger. This was SO GOOD. It really hit the spot. Bread wasn't too bready or dense. Smoked chicken and peameal bacon were so tender. Everything came together really well in this sandwich.\n\nDessert\nCookies: the choc chip one was good, the other one had too many choc chips\nStrawberry sorbet: was pretty meh\nSome friends ordered dif ice cream flavours. Whiskey one was strong (could def taste the whiskey in there). Toasted marshmallow was good but didn't really taste like toasted marshallow to me.\n\nAll in all, great atmosphere and great food. Summerlicious was also a great deal ($23 for three courses)
