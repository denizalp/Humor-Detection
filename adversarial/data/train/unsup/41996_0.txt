Too many (all visits) horrible experiences. Layout of store unreasonable. Non comprehending employees send you on goose chase to wrong isle (on other side of store) or to wrong product.\n\nCheck out is always a disaster.\nSlow is understatement. I was 2nd in line for over 10 minutes!\nCashier doesn't notify any people in line, that there will be a (long) wait for supervisor, who never shows up.\n\nTarget has swift check out. Cashier can \"suspend\" transaction, ring up next customer, (no waiting), while supervisor can solve issue. Extra cashier's called if more than 3 people in line.\n\nWalmart has no handicap isle for disabled who can't stand for excessive length of time to get through.\n\nWatch prices at check out. 75% time they overcharge. (Forget a price check, 30 minutes to resolve)\n\nSmall packaging, only at Walmart, deceptive pricing. (Other stores will have normal size for same price.\n\nThis location is cleaner than other Walmarts. Restrooms clean too.\n\nSo good store for restroom & you have a lot of patience, walking back & forth. plus have a lot of extra time to find items (if even in stock)\n\nTime is money. You end up spending more, get less.\n\nI've decided to shop on line from now on. Avoid Walmart stress, get exactly what I want. (Amazon)\nFree shipping, right to my home. No hassles, save on gas too.\n\nAnd no one coughing & sneezing on me to spread the flu.
