I can't possibly say anything that hasn't been said about this place.  Amazing salsa.  Lovely smell.  Chewy, gooey tortillas that they make in the back and you can see them do it.  Whenever I finish eating food from Carolina's, I cry a little... gentle, muffled sobs.\n\nThey provided the food for an event that I had at work.  Luckily, some of my clients don't like tamales or delicious little burros, so when they left, I ate more than I should have.  Their pansiness is my benefit.\n\nIf I could, I would make sweet, sweet love to Carolina.
