Went recently as part of a group for a baptism. The environment was nice and the place was packed. Service was very slow, so the staff tried to compensate by continuously bringing bread baskets...most guest ended up filling up on bread. Their dips were average, the salad was well dressed, but their moussaka was on the bland side.
