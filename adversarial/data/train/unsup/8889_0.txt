Nothing to see here people. This place was NOTHING to ride home about as the food was mediocre at best and the service was INSANELY slow. If I had it my way, we would NOT have had dinner here, but sometimes you just don't have a choice. I did my best to order something I might like. The Fajitas were good, but the amount of chicken they give with the sizzling platter is pathetic especially when this place is known for portion sizes. \n\nThat being said, the decor is pretty cool. Beware of the stilts walking pirates....
