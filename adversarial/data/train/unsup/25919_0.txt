As a fairly social person and someone who is not a stranger to bars, Sierra gold is a place that I have frequented quite a bit. \nThe draw of Sierra gold is that it's a PTs, but just higher class, which I mostly agree with. You walk in and you see that the bar is quite spacious, there's the bar and the dining areas, so you can choose how you want your experience to be. I've had all types of nights here, from just a quick midday drink, to watching the game, to let's get chocolate wasted type of night. The bartenders are usually pretty knowledgable with their drinks and the service here, as with most places tends to vary on the staff. It sucks, but you just do what you can in that regards\nAnother amenity they have is a VIP room, so if you want a private place for to hang out with friends for like an event, that's totally doable but you do have to reserve it in advance. \nTL; DR I like this bar, it's not the greatest but it is good quality and I generally have a good experience while coming here and I'm rating it in the sense of its a locals bar
