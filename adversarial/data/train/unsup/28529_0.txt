oh ya, 5 stars.  for the food!\n\nalso, pleasant service.  warm atmosphere for all its nooks and lofts. \n\nbut the food!  bit pricey, but not as pricey as when you go specifically for a quality and creative food experience.  that's how i would describe this menu.  good portions too.  the flavour combinations were such a surprise, not just for a place that seems to be much more about the acts.\n\ni was told the chef's name is Trevor Viirre, that the menu is his creation.  our whole table raved about the meal.  ...except for the quiet one... oh and the cynical one, but i could tell they loved it too! \n\nthis guy trevor is a super star.  very talented.  what a treat.
