Every one of the seven massages I've had so far by Julie has been utterly divine!  My first session was a rejuvenating full body, deep tissue massage.  The next six sessions were amazingly effective facelift massages.  I don't consider myself a very wrinkly old lady (yet!) but I walked out of Devine Touch after each facelift session and truly looked like I did back in the 80's!\n\nBefore we began each session, Julie asked if there were any areas that may require additional focus and then during the sessions she was able to read the way my muscles reacted to her techniques to ensure that every one of them was properly releasing tension.  After the body massage, I stood taller and felt wholly tranquil.  After the facelift massages, all lines, wrinkles, bags, and even my awful jowls were smoothed away;  my face and neck were toned and my entire body felt relaxed.\n\nThe Devine Touch spa is located in a semi-residential home which gives it a certain aura of coziness.  The studio is clean, the room's temperature is comfortable (I've been during both summer and winter months), and it is pleasantly lit. Julie uses any number of essential oils and incense that can be changed based on your mood or needs.  All-in-all, it is a very serene environment. \n\nJulie is a certified massage therapist who cares about her clients and who is very skilled -and practiced- at ensuring the most beneficial results for her clients.  I will definitely continue to use her exemplary services!
