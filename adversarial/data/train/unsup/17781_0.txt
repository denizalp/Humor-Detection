This is a free standing Kiosk in several locations throughout the mall. They sell beauty supplies from Curling Irons, Flat Irons, Hot Brushes, Extensions and much more. The kiosk are demo booths that you can allow one of the employees style your hair. \n\nI purchased a flat iron from the Kiosk on 8\/2016. It was not cheap but I loved what it could do. Because I had a warranty when the flat iron did not work up to par they allowed me to exchange for a new one which cost $20.00. The staff is always friendly they of course want you to buy but they are not pushy.
