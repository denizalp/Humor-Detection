I hate to say this, but I would not go back. I had been wanting to try it for quite awhile. I always noticed it in the parking lot. So one day(a week day) I thought I would give it a try. I came in and there was only one other table there. They serve only a Buffet during lunch.\nYes, I would love to give it a try.\nLet me start by saying ,I love Indian Food. The flavors are magnificent and to me it always smells wonderful.\nThis was not. On the buffet was quite a variety but everything looked as if it had been cooked last night. They had laid saran wrap plastic on the bottom of the containers. So i guess it would not dirty the pans. However, it kept the food from being really warm, and certainly not hot. I like Goat meat, but theirs was full of bones, and not really much Flavor.  The dishes were all dry, even though they were smothered in sauce.\nI felt the food was dry. As if it had been way over heated too many times.\nThere were piles of dirty dishes everywhere. Which really turned me off the food. I hate seeing used plates when I am eating.\nI never got a refill on my hot tea. Also, the Buffet was $9.00 and some change, I gave her a $20.00 and she shorted me a dollar. Just a small thing,but one of many.\nMaybe dinner is better, but I think I will pass in the future. Nothing was great at all.
