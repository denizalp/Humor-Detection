After we had started eating, my friend asked me what Konbea meant in Japanese. I responded with, it probably means \"shitty sushi.\" One of the worst sushi, let alone conveyor belt sushi places I've ever tried. There were so many things wrong, I didn't even know where to start. I guess if you really want good sushi, go to a Japanese place, not a Korean sushi place (although I did appreciate the Korean dishes).\n\nAYCE option is priced at $21.95 for lunch, but I went for dinner, which was the same price for a 3 day promo. The difference is that you get a few extra one-time order dishes such as the tobiko, sweet shrimp, blue fin tuna, and fatty tuna nigiri. First, I've never seen a place have tobiko has a one-time order nigiri. The sweet shrimp was decent, but the tuna was terrible. As I watched the plates of tuna move by, I noticed there was no difference between the blue fin tuna and the normal tuna (I suspect there wasn't any). On top of that, the fatty tuna looked dried and days old. The flavor was sour and spoiled. I quickly spit it out of my mouth.\n\nSome of the other plates like the crispy rice with spicy tuna had the rice fried as hard as rock. I thought it was hard to screw up eel, but the freshwater eel nigiri was awful and one of the worst I've tried. The color was drained completely from the eel and it also looked days old. My favorite dishes ended up being the Korean BBQ short ribs, and the salt & pepper chicken wings.\n\nThe other positive was that service was great, and the waitresses were very attentive on refilling our waters. Also dessert was good with either a crunch bar, a red bean mochi waffle, or a melon bar. If you're looking for a fun, but good conveyor belt experience, go for Sapporo instead.
