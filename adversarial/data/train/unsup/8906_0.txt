If you are a fan of Indian food then this is the place for you.  The market has a private lot where you are warned to park at your own risk but makes it handy since parking in the Strip district can be a nightmare.\n\nOn one side is the market where you can purchase all types of meats and canned goods, etc to prepare and Indian style meal. The other side is cafeteria style where you can order meals, salads, gyros, or sandwiches.\n\nSince I was having lunch with my son he ordered his favorite which was tandoori chicken and chili chicken. It came with vegetables and an Indian rice platter. I decided to settle for a lamb gyro since there was a sign that stated \" if you are ordering a prepared entree please allow 10 minutes.\" This is just a heads up if you are on a lunch hour as my son was. Cards and cash are accepted. If you order a sandwich or gyro then for a slight upcharge you can get French fries and a beverage of choice. You can order as take out as well.\n\nFirst of all portion sizes are enormous! For Indian food yes it is very spicy including the vegetables that caught me by surprise!  The lamb gyro was just okay but I really enjoyed the French fries! My son and I were sharing our dishes and believe me we both ended up taking food home with us.\n\nI would recommend that if you come here then as another reviewer noted bypass the gyros and prepared sandwiches and go for the authentic Indian food. Most of these foods are very spicy. However, I must say that you'll never go wrong with their French fries. They are one of the best I have anywhere!
