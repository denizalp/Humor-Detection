After being with the same lady for 5 years before moving out here from NY I was nervous to try anyone new... So after doing it myself for 5 months I finally had enough. I stumbled upon this place right here on Yelp and I am super excited that I did. I saw Trish who had me in and out in less then 15 minutes. There was no pain at all and she was so pleasant to talk to. A very comfortable experience which is important when getting a brazilian. Not to mention the price was super afforable! If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  It is safe to say that I found my kittys new home :)
