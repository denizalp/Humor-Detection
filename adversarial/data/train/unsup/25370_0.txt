The food here, for me, is \"5 Stars\". The service was a bit disorganized...only 3 tables of people eating when we were there, but the person serving the food got every order wrong. If you are patient though, you will get some great mideastern yumminess. The schwerma plates had enough for two meals. The standouts for us were the hummus...the creamiest I've ever had! The fresh lemonade with mint. (Drank 4 glasses!) Amena makes pita bread to die for. We also took home very large flatbreads that were like lavosh only moister. On another trip there I got some of their pastries and liked those too, though they weren't the best I've ever had (not enough filling). When I'm craving schwerma, hummus, or fresh pita in Las Vegas though, this is the place to go. (And it's not a very long taxi ride from the Strip, for you visitors.)
