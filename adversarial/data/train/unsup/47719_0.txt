I am going to keep this review short and sweet. Silver Nugget has cheap bowling until 5PM. They have 24 well oiled lanes that are easy to bowl on. Never once did the fence get stuck. Nor did the ball return. No complaints there. Beers were cheap too. Certainly no complaints there. A good place to bowl. Nothing fancy but far from a dive. I'll be back.
