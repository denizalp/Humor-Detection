After visiting this post office I completely understand why the USPS is going out of business. Customer service is something that keeps businesses going in this country. That ideal is not displayed at all at this USPS. I work in McKeesport myself so I'm familiar with the cliental in the area. Poor customer service in any area is a shame. I left this location and went to the UPS store in White Oak. Never again will I go back to this post office again.
