I've only hiked the Cholla Trail because the two times we have gone to Camelback, we have not been able to find parking in the super small lot at the Echo Canyon trailhead.  For the Cholla Trail, you have to park on Invergordon and then walk to the trailhead.  The first time we went to Camelback, we only had an hour...definitely not enough time so we barely made it halfway before having to turn around.  Today, we conquered Camelback and made it to the top! \n\nLessons learned from hiking Camelback:\n*Wear good hiking shoes...they will come in handy\n*Bring lots of water...one water bottle is not enough\n*Bring snacks to munch on while you enjoy the view when you reach the top\n*Going down is just as tough as going up...your knees will feel it\n*As you get closer to the top, it becomes less hiking and more climbing\n*If you like people watching, you will love Camelback. I swear we saw all different kinds of people, and quite enjoyed overhearing a couple of guys trying to pick up some girls at the top.  \n*According to some hussy at the top, Barry Sanders girlfriend is a bitch. Good to know. (She was bragging to some guys how she's met NFL players before)\n*Enjoy the view from the top. You worked hard to get there, so take some time and relax.\n*I will never never never be the woman who gets to the top of Camelback and then drops and does 25 pushups. Not.Going.To.Happen.Ever.\n*Somebody should open a beer stand at the top of Camelback. I think they would make a lot of money.  I know as soon as we reached the top, I said, \"I want a beer.\"\n*I feel grateful that I have good genes that graced me with long legs. They came in handy.\n*Being thin does not equal being in shape. I'm getting my ass to the ASU gym and signing up for a membership this week!\n\nIt's amazing that a place like Camelback exists in a major metropolitan area, but it does.  I plan to take advantage of it as much as possible while we live out here!
