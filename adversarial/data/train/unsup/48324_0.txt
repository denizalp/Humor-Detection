I want to give them 5 stars so bad because I went on a day when it was half off pasta dishes (monday and tuesdays for a limited time) and so my bill was super cheap, I feel like I robbed them. Anyway, came expecting to get pizza because I've had it before and it's really good but saw half off pasta dishes and figured I'd try them out. Service was excellent and everyone was really nice. For the full price (12-16 dollars) the pasta dishes would probably still be worth it as they were really good and come with a salad and bread but at half price this place is a steal. It doesn't get 5 stars because for me to give 5 stars I usually need to think either of two things while I'm eating: \n\n1) This is the best deal ever (if the prices were always 50% off I would say this for sure)\n\nor\n\n2) This is the best food ever \n\nThis place is really really good and the service is REALLY great but it isn't ever going to be something I dream about at night. That being said, I would pick it over a chain italian place any day.
