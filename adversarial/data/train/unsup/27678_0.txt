My wife and I love this place. We take people here all the time. They just changed the nachos from a wonderfully tasty chip to ones that are meh. For a Mexican place you would think they would stay with what works. Hopefully the other locations do not use these sub par chips. We will not be ordering out guac \/ salsa \/ and chips anymore. Why bother,
