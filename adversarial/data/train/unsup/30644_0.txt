I've been here a few times over the years and I always tend regret it later. For the area (walnut st.), I really wish it were better quality because it's super convenient and on my way home from work, but it always leaves me under-whelmed. \n\nThe inside is cramped and over-stimulating; I went in a few weeks ago with friends for mani\/pedis and I I was literally tripping over other people and staff, equipment, etc. while the employee helping me looked at me like I was the idiot for needing room to put my bag and shoes. I also feel like every time I go here, the music is loud and obnoxious and not in the least relaxing; one of the employees is literally always on on her phone talking SUPER loud. If you're looking to go somewhere where you can relax and enjoy your mani\/pedi, this is not it. \n\nThe pedicure was alright, nothing special...my gel manicure was a bust since it peeled the next day and he filed so hard he cut two of my cuticles and surrounding nail area. They're decently priced but go elsewhere if you can.
