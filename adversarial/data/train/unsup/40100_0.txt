What can I say... Service does not exist here. Spend a few more bucks and go with a more reputable provider... It's worth it.\nThe person who accepted my car return made me feel he was doing me a major favor coming over to take my car. No greeting whatsoever... \n\nWith their cheap trick and scare tactic to get you to buy collision coverage, you are better off going with Avis (on the same floor) that offers way better service and end up paying less.
