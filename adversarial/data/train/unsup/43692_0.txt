Superior is right!  These guys are what I would call \"real detailers,\" as opposed to the more common type who just want to keep you coming by every 4 months for overpriced traditional services with outdated products.  Instead, they use only the most advanced and durable products.\n\nWe live in a remote town in the High Sierra with limited auto-care services available, and so have a tendency to neglect our vehicle exteriors. We were recently in town for a music festival, and decided to take advantage of the opportunity to get our FJ Cruiser detailed.  I initially dealt with Peter on the phone, and then Taylor for the actual work.  They could not have been more accomodating and professional...as well as reasonably-priced.
