Awsome restaurant. Awsome service.\nI am vegetarian and I like to eat veggies with pasta and all spices and sauces they offer.\nI will give a tip..i like it that way if someone want to try it.\n\nSo what I do is..fill up bowl with all vegetables of my choice. I put green onion always and jalape√±o too.\nNow always take sauces and spices in a separate small container and mix it up with a tester spoon . Now when i give to grill person..i tell them to cook very well done and all sauce put at the very end just to mix and pour in plate. As sauces and spices not cooked too much it tests awsome.\nTry it..
