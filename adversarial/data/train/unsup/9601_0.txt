I have been wanting to try this place for a while, so when I saw they were participating in Restaurant Week I decided this was the perfect time to try them out. My husband and I started with extra dirty martinis with blue cheese olives which were perfect! We were served complimentary focaccia with a calabrian chili butter and a marscapone spread which were quite good. For our first course we chose the gigli and linguine pasta. Both were perfectly cooked al dente and the sauce was amazing. The gigli had a fresh san marzano tomato sauce with a flavorful pesto and the linguine had a pork sugo which was to die for! Our mains were very nice too, we had a medium rare skirt steak and grilled swordfish. We went with our servers recommendations for dessert and had the tiramisu and pistachio gelato with toasted crumble, both delicious. Service was wonderful, the staff was on-point at every moment. We weren't blown away by the main courses here but the pasta and cocktails are worth coming back for. We will definitely return to try more of their menu.
