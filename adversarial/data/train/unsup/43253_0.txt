Love to support these kind of small indie stores and hope this place does well for itself. I've stopped by a number of times to buy gifts and have always left happy with my purchases, and the recipients have always been happy too. They have the usual gifty stuff like candles, ceramics, stationary, but their selections is way better than most other gift stores that have the same stuff over and over.
