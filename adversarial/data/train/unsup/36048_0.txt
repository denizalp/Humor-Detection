My sandwich was very good. It had beef and shrimp and the bun was very good... the balance of bread to meat was very good and the bread seemed to get out of the way and give the other flavors room to speak.\n\nI'm not sure that including french fries with each sandwich is necessary... Aside from adding to the perceived value proposition, I'm not sure that french fries would be a recommended side for this type of sandwich.\n\nIt's just that the sandwich is so flavorful and the fries (of which they give you a lot) taste so bland and eating more than a few seemed like slog. And trying to eat them in the same bite as the sandwich seemed to take away all of the flavor of the sandwich and make you feel like you were eating a bunch of plain potatoes.\n\nAnyway... very good food and I would go back again, but I'd like to see them figure out how to take these excellent sandwiches and put them in a context that makes more sense and maybe step their beverage game up a little bit?\n\nThey've nailed the sandwich itself... It'd just like to see them spend a little more time perfecting the sides and beverages and rounding out the whole experience. It could be *even* better.\n\nThis is just explaining what prevents me from awarding the last star... 4 stars is absolutely a good review. I think the sandwiches are fantastic and it's really close to being a 5 star place for me.
