Our AC just went out this past Friday night at 7:00 and I thought they would be closed and have an on call or weekend rate.  Much to my surprise the girl on the phone said they offer a FREE inspection right now and are waiving the 59.99 fee.  Not only did they waive the charge the guy was installing a unit in Scottsdale when I spoke to him and said he would not be able to make it until 10:00 and would that be too late.\nToo late, trust me it's never too late when it's 113 out.  Calbe Garver at 10:30 was fixing our unit with no overtime\/weekend rate.  It was an affordable fix.  Could not have been happier!
