Booked through Orbitz. The reviews were great and solidified our family trip. Swipe the card, purchased. \n After booking, it was time to plan the trip and bookmark places on yelp. I get to Palms Place on yelp and holy moly panic set it. What the heck did I plan?! Why didn't I look at yelp first?! I found many reviews that made me worry beyond what was normal........\nFAST FORWARD\nPlane ride: Good. Rental Car: Smooth. Parking:(I read in multiple reviews that the parking was an issue and it couldn't be found. Called ahead to prepare. Found the parking and there weren't any surprises) Always found a parking space. No issues. Plenty of spots. \n\nCheck in: woman was more than friendly. Welcomed us and the kids. \nWait for the elevator: it was prime time checking in, so had to wait awhile for everyone leaving their level. \nIt was go time, my husband let me use my room key, I held my breath, opened the door and let out a huge sigh of relief. \nGreat view of the mountains, everything was clean, shower was large........ I was happy to see everything was opposite of what I prepared myself for. \n\nI saw a few reviews ripping on the valet... asked a few questions. They didn't rip me a new one, they actually helped me. \n\nI waited until the security deposit was released on my charge before leaving this review as many people stated they had issues.... no crazy charges. \n\nThe Palms casino had a theatre in it, it was a decent walk via tunnel, but I liked the walk. Not my favorite casino but it was neat to see. \n\nI love yelp. I depend on yelp a little more then the next person. I liked my stay at the hotel. The kids liked their stay.  The entire stay at Palms Place was consistent and we had a great visit.
