The hotel itself was a great choice for our girls weekend in the city of Toronto. I'm not typically one to jump to yelp (for the good or the bad) but what brings me here is the amazing above and beyond customer service my group received from Dave the Concierge. Dave flawlessly guided us through an experience to remember in the city, our one regret of the weekend being that we strayed from the path and went to the worst night club any of us had ever been to (Tryst Nightclub,  not recommended by Dave and we instantly regretted the decision). \n\nWould stay in the Hilton again specifically to view more of Dave's Toronto.
