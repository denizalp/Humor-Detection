My friend and I met up at Fez for a causal lunch. I had been to their old location a few years ago & had really enjoyed it mostly because of the atmosphere. It was really relaxed and the food was good too. This visit, much like my previous visit, was pleasant.\n\nFor our meals, I got the Fez burger (with chicken instead of beef) & a side of fries and my friend got the Fez salad. The sandwich was a bit hard to eat because they're very generous with the sauce, and that paired with the pear & feta cheese is a bit sloppy but absolutely delicious. My friend said her salad was good too!\n\nI'd definitely recommend trying the g-spot to drink. I'm not much of a grapefruit fan but per recommendation of our waitress I got it. It was super refreshing & delicious, especially for the summer time.\n\nI will say that the service was absolutely terribly slow even though it wasn't busy at all! It took a while for our server to come by and get our drink\/food order & then it really took way too long to get our checks. Since we had the afternoon to kill, we were ok spending a little bit more time there than anticipated, however.\n\nI liked that there was a large parking structure right by the restaurant so having to look for parking wasn't an issue. I'd definitely recommend this place if you have time to spare. We'll be back in the future.
