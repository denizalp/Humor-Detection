I felt like Alice jumping down the rabbit hole.  By far my best experience in Vegas EVER!  My man really out did himself on my birthday with this one.\n\nFood was amazing.  Show was unique and amazing.  Service was impeccable.  \n\nAnd the Ambiance.  There is nothing like it in the world as far as I'm concerned.  A full sensory experience that is worth every penny.  Do the whole dinner and show.  It's worth it!  \n\n7:30pm-- Entered the hostess room which was very dramatic (I'm not going to ruin it).  Was seated in the \"Parlor\" of the restaurant which is set up like rooms of a mansion.  Enjoyed bits of show that spilled out into our dining area as the walls moved up and down.  Ate some of 40+ Small plates from a wax sealed menu.  All of the items were to die for.  I was not disappointed by any of them.  This included:\n-Warm herb brioche rolls\n-Roasted Brussels sprouts\n-Slow braised pork\n-Fois gras with duck fat fries\n-Braised short rin stroganoff\n-Titos Moscow Mule (on tap)\n-Birthday Bear Cookie Jar (see pictures)\n\n9:30pm--Saw the most amazing show in the \"great room\".  It was a revue style performance.  It's so hard to explain.  Dancers, comedy, burlesque, and more!  The pictures don't do any of it justice.\n\n12:0pm--Stuck around and caught the 12:00pm show for free standing in the back.  Not as good at the 9:30 show, but also very cool.  I love that each show time is different. \n\n\nHonestly, I have not had such a unique, beautiful, and tasty experience in my life. Rose.Rabbit.Lie is pretty much the best thing ever.
