I got a laser treatment on my face in April for tiny freckle-like brown spots on my face near my eyes which left me with LARGE brown spots where he used the laser (burnt my face with it) all around my eyes and I'm STILL dealing with it. I had to cancel interviews, dates, etc as I was so self conscious about it. It literally looked like I was wearing dime size freckle goggles around my eyes as dark as the color brown! I've had to buy creams and make up which cost a fortune to cover up. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PERSON WITH A LASER WHICH IS WHAT HE IS TO ANYONE. He has no certification whatsoever and no resolution for his \"patients\" once the damage is done.
