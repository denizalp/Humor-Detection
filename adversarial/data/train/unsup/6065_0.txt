This place is bad on every level. Expensive prices and bad selection and horrible customer service. The fuses on my TV needed to be replaced, it took 4 different employees until I finally got some help. The doofus who worked in the TV department didn't even know what a fuse is. There's never more than 2 cashiers working even if it's busy. I bought a laptop and the battery went bad in less than a year, there warranty was worthless!! And doesn't cover shit. Not to mention they don't carry replacement parts for the items they sell. The little prick @ the geek squad is no help at all. It's pretty sad when you know more about electronics than the experts in geek squad. I hope they go bankrupt, I will gladly give wally world or target my business.
