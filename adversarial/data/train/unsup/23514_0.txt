What an awesome park!\n\nI'm always on a lookout for another great place to walk and take my puppy, so I was very excited when I heard about this location. This park is farther away from my place than I would normally go, but what puppy parent wouldn't take their puppy just a little farther to have a great place to walk and play. \n\nLocated in the downtown area of Phoenix, this is such a beautiful park with a trail that goes around the whole park, trees that give shade for those hot days, lots of green open fields for field games or just to relax, a cute little lake where people fish from, and two fenced in doggie parks one for smaller and one for larger dogs. It also features a children's playground and covered picnic tables with grills that also feature a sink! Such a nice addition for those who have parties here. It makes for easy cleanup when you're done. \n\nI love how this park offers areas for dogs to be off the leash and just run around and burn off all their energy. Even though my puppy doesn't do so well with big crowds of dogs, he does seem to enjoy being able to just run around and play freely. \n\nEven though this is such a nice park it is easy access for the homeless and drunks, so while I was there, they made the beautiful scene look not as nice. They filled up the empty tables and had all their stuff all over the ground as if they were camping out. \n\nI will come back again!
