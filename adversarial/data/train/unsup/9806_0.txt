Ok, I'm hesitant to write this review because this is one of Las Vegas's hidden gems. I drive a taxi here, and when moving here I needed a place to stay that was cheap, fairly secure, didn't hassle me for a giant security deposit, and let me stay on a weekly basis paid in CASH. (my wallet was stolen the second night I was in town, try to find a place that will rent to you without a debit card... just try)\n\nThe rent is $122 a week, with $100 fully-refundable security deposit in CASH ONLY (praise the lord). The rooms are smoking or non-smoking, up to you. \n\nYeah, the place is a little run down. The drains are slow, there's paint chips on the exterior of the building. Some (ok maybe most) of the tenants are a little sketch. But it's got that \"old-town\" charm to it. Looks like it was built in the 1940's and the owners have done their best to keep it up. The pool is \"pretty clean\", there is a \"nightclub\" downstairs, with swing on thursdays, and reggaeton on fridays that does get pretty packed, but it's vegas, there's a nightclub everywhere in vegas. \n\nThe wifi is free, and fairly fast, (I clocked up to 10mbps) and if you tunnel your traffic through a VPN, you might just be able to torrent that latest Linux ISO you've been desperately after. \n\nThe staff were always incredibly nice and willing to help, but I wouldn't expect much in services. I brought my own iron and ironing board, and they were cool with letting me bring my own hotplate, toaster, and refrigerator even though it says you can't in the agreement. (just keep it on the DL, throw a blanket over that yo)\n\nAll that said, you can't beat it for the price. 122 \/ week that's only $17.49 a night, no taxes or \"Resort fees\" for pretty fast internet, a bed, decent air conditioning (I bought a $10 box fan and my place was 68 degrees in the middle of summer) and it's pretty secure. It's tucked away off the main strip, and the 6' wall of concrete around the back keeps out the zombie crack-heads that wonder the night in Vegas.
