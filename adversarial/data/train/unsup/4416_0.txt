Valentines Dinner 2013!!!\n\nQuestion for you...Where does a Yelper celebrate Valentines?  A restaurant that's been bookmarked, that's where.  No quiet candle light, no short walk around town, and no 5 star restaurant.  I'm just as romantic as it gets.  \n\nGeisha Steakhouse is located on the eastside of town.  Not the best neighborhood at night, but nothing stands in my way when it comes to food.  Their normal menu is put on hold for Valentines so the choices are Their Valentines Dinner ($99), Seafood Lover ($40 each person), or their Land Lover ($40 each person).  I wanted to try their Land Lover, which consisted of their Rib Eye, Chicken and Filet Mignon.  I wanted this so bad, but couldn't since I dropped red meat for Lent.  My Valentine and I opted for the Seafood Lover which consists of Shrimp, Scallops, Lobster, and fried rice.  I admit, this meal was pretty damn good.  All three seafood pieces looked, tasted great, and was flavorful.  I've always loved lobster and shrimp, now scallops are becoming a new favorite. Because it was seafood, the meal wasn't too filling in the beginning. In other words, I wasn't initially full. It wasn't until I finished my fried rice that I became stuffed.  I was so full that my second Valentine venture was going to be a tough one to accomplish. \n\nI enjoyed the ambiance that almost all Teppanyaki restaurants have to offer.  Geisha Steakhouse has that same type of ambiance;  group type seating, entertaining\/skillfull teppanyaki chefs, and great tasting food. \n\nI really can't wait until Easter so I can come back and try their chicken and filet mignon.  You definitely can't go wrong with this place since there's a selection.  \n\nPS:  I love me some lobster.  Geisha's was good, but they also reminded me that I must take a trip back to Lobster Me for their Lobster Mac N' Cheese.
