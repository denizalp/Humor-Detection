This updated review is for the rooms at the Palms.  I had an offer for a night's \"Playcation\" and I took them up on the offer.  \n\nI had a room on the 8th floor of the Ivory Tower--the original one right off Flamingo.  I'm sure the rooms have been renovated since the hotel opened a number of years ago.\n\nThe room was large and nicely appointed with a modern look.  My view was of the Gold Coast and the Rio but I could see some of the Strip hotels when the lights came up.\n\nThere was a good sized bathroom in 3 parts.  The main area with sink and towels, a toilet area, and the shower.  The shower area had no curtain.  There's just an amount of glass to protect water from leaving the shower and going onto the main floor. I'm sure this makes housekeeping a bit easier.\n\nThe room was very comfortable and was very clean.  Housekeeping is doing their job here.\n\nI'd stay at the Palms again should they make another offer.  Not bad when you can get home in 20 minutes if there's the need.
