The perfect amount of color!  I am fair skinned and usually turn orange with the airbrush tans.  Bethany, the owner did my Evolv Airbrush tan and it was so natural!  I got the lightest hint of color and she only did one coat.  It also lasted for a good week and didn't wash off uneven.  The place is super clean and nice and I can't wait to go back this Friday for another session.  I even got compliments at the nail salon about my color...which I was surprised about because I was worried it would scrub off.  Definitely not the case!  I LOVE this place and you will too!
