I usually hate buffets and this place just confirms on every reason why. But since a free buffet came with out stay at MGM, we felt obligated to go.  There was no variety, and what food was there just completely lacked in any kind of flavor or finesse.  There was a meat carving station which had prime rib (I didn't have any but at least it was there!) and a sausage (which was decent) then there's everything else expected..a small salad bar, some Italian food (like dried lasagne and pizza) some Chinese food (if you can call beef and broccoli Chinese and some fried rice and dried noodles) and some other not very memorable dishes. I was even a bit scared to eat their snow crabs and shrimp cocktail because I thought it might not be the freshest. The desserts were very subpar too.  But good news, I didn't get sick and I made it through this crappiest and saddest buffet. Everything is up from here I guess!!!! And it was free! Actually I wouldn't even come back here again even if it was free. That bad. You're basically just filling your tummy with things. Tasteless useless things. Ick.
