It is one thing to shop at Best Buy, it is another think to purchase and utilize their Geek Squad services. For the past year I have had my ACER all in one in the shop under my damage protection program I had purchased and usually it was a hardware issue and they had to send it out.\n\nThe last time I had it in the shop the online agents totally messed up my photo gallery and included at least 87,000 images most of which came from pc browsing and I was told to clear them off.\n\nMy damage protection plan has been up for renewal and I had made multiple attempts to talk to Geek Squad about payment and have even gone to the Best Buy store itself to arrange it. Every time I spoke to someone I got a different story. All they carry all types of products for your home and office their protection services which I pay for should be consistent or it is not worth the money.\n\nI have now learned through their fault that my damage protection program will not be renewed because my ACER was too old. They should have told me this information in the first place. I am now resigned to check other places if I ever need a new pc and I'm certainly going to buy any necessary home appliances from another store.\n\nIf you decide to purchase from Best Buy then I would strongly advise against purchasing Geek Squad services.  I have been totally disappointed with my experience and do not ever intend to return.
