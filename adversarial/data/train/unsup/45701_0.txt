My experience at Halo was excellent!  Kyra and Vanessa were professional and courteous, answering several questions for me with patience.  Ana did an amazing job piercing my navel and forward helix.  But before doing any piercings, she made sure all my questions and concerns had been addressed.  Ana is awesome!  Top notch sterilization and disinfection techniques.  Love my piercings and have not had any issues during the healing process.
