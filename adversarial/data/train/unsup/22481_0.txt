I'll admit it: I'm a baked-goods addict. And Almond Butterfly does them right! I've tried most of the gluten-free offerings from the bakeries around the city (doughnuts, cupcakes, brownies, cookies, etc.), and these are hands down the best. \n\nMost gluten-free baked goods crumble too easily, are hard and unpleasant to bite into, or are gluey and starchy. None of the goods on offer at Almond Butterfly are any of those unpleasant things. The cupcakes are light with a nice crumb and flavour, and the icing is light and delicious. \n\nI tried their chocolate chip cookies, the moelleux au chocolat, a chai spice cupcake and their banana bread muffin. Everything was amazing. The moelleux au chocolat was rich and decadent, the cupcake well-spiced and topped with the perfect amount of delicious icing, and the banana bread muffin was moist and brimming with banana flavour. \n\nSkip the new rest of the gluten-free bakeries out there (I'm talking to you Bunners - your stodgy treats are gross!) and go to Almond Butterfly!!\n\n(Edit: I also had the opportunity to try their bagel last night, and man was it delicious. I challenged it to hold up to a large, messy sandwich and the bagel stayed together and continued to deliver on its commitment to deliciousness from start to finish! I definitely recommend them to any gluten avoiders out there.)
