*Minor star removal due to horrible use of zip ties and electrical tape on the unit. Why?  Photos to follow. \n\nI have a home warranty with AHS. My upstairs unit failed on Sunday and started blowing out hot air. After turning off the unit I requested service and received a message for\n AHS stating that I would be contacted within 24 hours. I received the company name and a bad phone number but was able to locate it easily on the web.  My warranty company has the wrong number (fixed)  on file and because of this, I called at 1240 the next day to ensure I could personally reach someone. I was contacted at 1:44 pm and was told that they had tried contacting me all morning. I quickly informed them that this was exactly why I called and left a voicemail. Unfortunately, they couldn't come until Tuesday.  I am very lucky to have two AC units in my home so deemed this a minor setback. \n\nMy tech was Jesus and he was absolutely helpful. He was very knowledgeable and did an efficient job. Quickly diagnosed the issues, repaired it and checked his work. He left the area clean and was very professional and easy to talk to. I am impressed with this technician. \n\nI will continue to update this periodically as I have seen many issues with re-repairing issues they have already fixed.
