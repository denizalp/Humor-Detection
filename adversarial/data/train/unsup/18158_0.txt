They lost me forever. Ordered a chicken avocado with no bacon. Got home, there was bacon. Trashed it. The restaurant states I have to deal with corporate for refund in form of coupon. \n\nI say not really. I will file a lawsuit and seek not only damages, refund but a change in policy. Never heard this from fast foods in USA.
