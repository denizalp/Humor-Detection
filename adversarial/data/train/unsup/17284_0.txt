Quite a few steam tables here at Dynasty and they were doing a great job of keeping them fresh and filled during the lunch rush. Even with most of the tables filled and a lot of people coming and going, the buffet was kept quite clean.\n\nSushi was meh with a small selection and nothing especially creative. The rice was not the right kind but they were certainly trying.\n\nService was excellent. \"Candy\" did a super job of keeping drinks filled and being friendly while she cleared our dirty plates.
