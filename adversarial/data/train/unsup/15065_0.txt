I've come to really enjoy Hi-Scores. They have an intimate atmosphere, good beer selection, weekly pub quiz and pretty decent food. What more is there to ask from a bar?\n\nWe go in every other week for pub quiz. It's one of the more organized and time-efficient pub quizzes in town, which I appreciate. So many other bars drag is out all night and on a weeknight I'm usually not wanting to stay at the bar until 10pm when I have to work the next morning.\n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive, too, which is key. I'm a regular here and don't see that changing any time soon.
