If you are looking for a cleaning service, this is it. Booking was super simple, prices reasonable and service was superb.  Ladies were punctual and checked with us for any special focuses. We couldn't be happier, our home was like new when they left. All our stuff( pillows and decor) was placed back accurately. As some of you might've experienced, it's a pain when the cleaning crew leaves and one has to rearrange things. The cleaning crew was awesome, the way they vacuum (very precise), the strategic way they clean stainless steel, we can go on on. We definitely recommend Rhino's for any and all your cleaning needs. Hope this review helps, we rely heavily on reviews (called them based on their current reviews), definitely glad we did;)
