Glad we caught it before leaving the Vegas stage.  I love the story line, and the movie was cute, the music additive, but to see the actual stage play come to life with the characters and costumes was fantastic! \n\n I can't always get my husband to tag a long with me to see things like this, but tonight, he had to agree with me that it was done really well.
