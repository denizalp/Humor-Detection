I finally made it down here for a meeting. It is an interesting concept. live stage for music,play area for the kids...some diverse shops and places to eat. however,it is still in downtown vegas and it is very small. Im not a big fan of getting stabbed while walking in the area,so if you go its like valet,container park,valet lol. They do have a groovy fire shooting psychedelic praying mantis at the entrance that's pretty cool...they also had a Mexican place there that didn't have a name on it ..i thought that was odd...after you have been here for 10 minutes its either get some drinks or dinner or get going..its probably much livelier when they have concerts...
