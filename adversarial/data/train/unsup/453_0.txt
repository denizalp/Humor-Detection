I stopped by with CM this past Sat. around 5pm after a visit to the Mattress Factory for a quick snack.  We were a bit hungry, but weren't necessarily up for a full dinner. I whipped out my trusty Yelp app and saw that El Burro was an establishment nearby that I'd bookmarked, and CM said he was up for Mexican. Thus, we decided to brave the quasi-sketchiness of this end of Federal St. to check it out.  \n\nThe first thing that immediately became apparent upon walking in was that there were no tables--only a handful of counter seats on either side.  Between that and observing other customers, it's pretty clear that most of El Burro's business is take out.  Undaunted, we decided to get a few tacos and settle in to eat them at the counter.  CM and I both ordered two chicken tacos in hard shells ($3.75 each), and I also got a bottle of Tamarind El Jarritos soda ($2.29).  The tacos were served about 5 min. after ordering.  Unfortunately, though they had appropriate textural variation, I found them bland in flavor.  The skimpy portion of red salsa served on the side, while hot, added little flavor to them.  No guac or sour cream was included, which was disappointing--apparently, you have to pay extra for it. \n\nUnfortunately, I feel that El Burro epitomizes what's wrong with the Mexican food scene in PGH--Mexican food is supposed to be bold and flavorful, not bland!  Between the blandness of the tacos and the price that we paid (over $16), it just wasn't worth it.  In retrospect, after looking at the photos, we would have been better off ordering two flying saucers instead of the tacos.  If you're looking for delicious, inexpensive tacos, I recommend Edgar's in the Strip or Las Palmas in Oakland.  TBH, I probably wouldn't return unless someone insisted on it--or unless I was stuck in the North Side without cash, as was the case on Sat.
