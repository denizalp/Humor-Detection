DO NOT BRING YOUR PET TO THESE SCAMMERS. THIS PLACE WILL OUTRIGHT RIP YOU OFF!!! For two years in a row, I've taken my dog for his vaccinations here. They have to do a physical with his shots and advertise that the shots are only $12, BUT the physical is another $50 something. For those same two years, they've cut my dog's nails and that was always included in the package at no charge.\n\nToday, I ask my sister to take my dog in for his shots and ensure they cut his nails free of charge as that was always included in the past. They cut my dog's nails, bring him out and add an ADDITIONAL $21.50 to my bill without ever advising me that there was this charge. I hate this place from the bottom of my heart. \n\nMy sister then advised me of this charge and I called the receptionist on the phone who then said \"no, no....there is a charge for that,\" to which I relied \"no, you've never charged me in the past two years\" and she says, \"well.........now there is a charge for that!\" \n\nI will NEVER EVER return to this scamming place again. They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING and find every excuse to charge you for ANYTHING. Why the hell would I take my dog to get his nails cut at this place for $21.50 when Petsmart will do it for $11?? \n\nHEED MY WORDS: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. THERE ARE FAR BETTER VETS WITH ACTUAL ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES OUT THERE.!
