The fact that Networks had four stars a few days ago and now only averages three demonstrates the potential impact of not treating your customers well, especially when six out of eight of them just happen to be Yelpers who are not afraid to write about their bad experience. \n\nI was part of the group of 8 that stopped by Networks during last Saturday's pub crawl (which was featuring drink specials and food samples from downtown businesses). This event was clearly planned in order to generate more business for these local spots, which makes the manager's refusal to give us $1 beer and wine or any sort of meaningful concession (when the downtown pub crawl materials said \"$1 beer, $1 signature wines\" with no \"off\" anywhere in sight) that much worse. \n\nYou are certainly free to check this place out for yourself and maybe these four one-star reviews won't do anything to change Networks' core crowd of patrons, but I can guarantee you that Networks lost the approval (and referral) of five very grumpy Yelpers!\n\nP.S. Congealed, cold pizza cut into miniature slices doesn't count as a \"food sample.\"
