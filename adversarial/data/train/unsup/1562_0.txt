Store is very clean and very organized. Some of the cashiers at the customer service desk can be rude but most of them are pretty friendly.\n\nDeli counter, hot table are the worst departments. Old food at the hot table, no one is ever at the counter and forget asking them a question the know where nothing is!!!
