After a couple of hours touring the Springs Preserve I was feeling a bit hungry and thirsty.  I was also kind of hot as late May in Las Vegas is starting to warm up.  To complete my experience I thought I would give Divine Cafe a try.  It did not disappoint.\n\nI ordered a burger because I was hungry.  I ordered an iced tea because I was thirsty.  I ordered a salad because I was hot.  It did not take long for my burger to come out.  And it came out perfect.  I asked for medium and that is exactly what I got.  It was still pink in the center and taste like quality fresh beef.  I had juice dripping down to my elbow so you know it wasn't dry.  The toppings were good too.  A nice thick slice of tomato, greens, super crisp bacon.  It was a fantastic burger.  The salad was pretty good too.  I like the greens they used.  And the cucumber slices were a nice touch.  I would have been upset about not having my choice of dressing but it was exactly what I would have ordered anyway.  A delicious vinaigrette.  The one complaint I had about the salad was the 8 inch long stripps of carrot that looked like orange noodles.  They were kind of hard to eat as they were too thin to be picked up by fork the way everything else was.  Other than that, no complaints.\n\nI was fortunate that the staff at the order window saw I had left my bag from the gift shop at the counter.  I had a couple of things in there I did not want to leave without.  Like my ball cap and sunglasses.  I was worried when I could not find my bag but then I noticed they had pushed it aside and were waiting for me to collect.  Goodonya, Divine Cafe.
