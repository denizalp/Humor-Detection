Why does the SW side of Vegas have all of the good stuff?! \nPlantone's is located in a plaza that already has a ton of amazing restaurants and it fits right in. The restaurant is cute and the service is great. Right away, someone will help you at the door with an explanation of sandwiches, pizzas, calzones, spaghettis, etc. The menu is extensive and the portions are HUGE. If you have a boyfriend that prioritizes quantity over quality this is the place to go. If you have a girlfriend that prioritizes quality over quantity, this is also the place to go. The food is amazing and the portions are huge. \nCalzone: The menu was confusing saying 1 meat, 1 vegetable, but we were told it's 3 meats? We were recommended the pepperoni and sausage, I would highly recommend it! We added green peppers and it was perfect. \nAngry sicilian: The sandwich was also what they recommended. With fresh mozarella and a huge portion of meat you can't go wrong. It was good, but I liked the calzone more. \nHappy hour has amazing prices and a really cute vibe. I'll for sure be recommending you guys!
