I'm a little conflicted about this rating. \n\nWe did the Pearled Pachyderm and for the first 90% of the room we had a great time. The puzzles weren't insanely challenging and we were able to get through them relatively quickly. If the room had ended there, solid rating. \n\nWithout giving away too many details, one of the last \"puzzles\" wasn't a measure of your problem-solving skills or brainpower it was more a test of dexterity. We must've spent a good 10-12 minutes on this last test and we still ended with 10+ minutes remaining of the full hour. \n\nIf we hadn't escaped because we couldn't figure out the puzzle that would have been one thing. But wasting that much time because of clumsy fingers? I don't know. \n\nComes down to personal preference, I suppose. \n\nThe gentleman who ran the rooms and I'm assuming was the owner was very friendly, chatting with us about past horror stories. \n\nI'd definitely be willing to come and try one of the other rooms.
