Drinks here are consistently good. They have creative cocktails and reasonable prices. My favorite drink is the gin, prosecco, and pear, but I've liked everything I had tried!\n\nIf you come later in the evening, after the dinner rush, it's not hard to get a table, even with a large group. On Sunday nights they are open late - hard to find in Pittsburgh! The ambience in the evening is nice, low lighting and not too loud. I think it would be a great date spot \n\nI have not had food here, but on my last visit my friends ordered dinner, and particularly liked the pirogues.
