Blanca, I know I told you over and over today how happy and was but I will say it again, YOU ROCK! Thank you so much for making me feel comfortable and relaxed the whole time. The atmosphere and homey feel really make it so nice. I love supporting local business over chains and the fact it is you and your brother is sweet. I wish I could do something like run a business with my brother. My hair feels great and I forgot about my anxiety for the first time ever with a stylist. I will be coming back as long as you are willing to have me.
