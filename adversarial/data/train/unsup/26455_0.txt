This is the perfect restaurant to go after a night of partying  and drinking in Vegas! I always get the bacon Mac-n-cheese burger and nachos  (yes I've been here a few times) everything is delicious! \n \nThe wait time varies on what day you go, obviously you wait longer on the weekends. But if you are a person who really dislikes waiting try going before 4pm and not for dinner.
