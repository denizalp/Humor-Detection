Went in today around 2pm as a walk in. I was quickly greeted and checked in. There were two people ahead of me and three stylist on duty, so the wait was about 5 minutes. My stylist Angel, a 26 year old male was perfect for my no fuss, trim and shampoo. He even gave me a little head massage while he washed my hair. His talent and skills were on par with high end salons in Scottsdale, at Great clips prices..awesome find for me. I don't usually like getting haircuts. It had been at least 6 months since my last one and now I plan to go back for trims more often and ask specifically for Angel. So pleased with my new layered haircut, 5 stars all the way.
