I am so glad we found this place! The food quality is fantastic and the prices are phenomenal! The food comes out steaming hot which I absolutely love. It can take a bit longer but trust me, it's so worth it when your food is that hot!\n\nWe ordered the dumplings which were really tasty. I can't remember which ones we ordered though, I want to say soup dumplings but don't quote me. \n\nWe got the beef stir fry which was so good, definitely something to get when you need some good comfort food. \n\nThe lamb cumin is amazing! Oh my gosh, we scarfed it down! The spices, warmth, and crisp veggies stole the show. They were phenomenal. \n\nThe part I loved most was at the end the owner sat down with us and talked with us. We told her how much we loved everything and how we wanted to try more on the menu, so she said that she'd help us pick more \"traditional\" items the next time we come in. \n\nIf you go, try the beef pie! The owner said it was fabulous, and it's on our hit list for next time!
