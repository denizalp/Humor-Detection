I was raised in a household that commonly played the Beatles. I love the Beatles. But this show... Meh. I wanted to love it, but it felt disjointed and lacking real wonder. \n\n1) Song selection - Top 10 most overplayed Beatles songs. I will never understand why they decided not to  include Across the Universe... \n\n2) Many people in the Yelp comments state, \"there are no bad seats\". There are. The last four rows are not included in most of the effects, including the tent and confetti.\n\n3) Storyline - One of the main issues I had was the flip-flop between abstract and linear narrative. It didn't work for me. Either completely abstract or real Beatles stories please. \n\nLucy in the Sky with Diamonds was a highlight and many of the performers were extraordinary. The man in red and black striped pants stands out for me. \n\nPerhaps my expectations were too high, but I wouldn't recommend to friends.
