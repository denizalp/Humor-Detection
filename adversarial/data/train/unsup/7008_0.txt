This is the closest Starbucks to my place of employment, so if I have a lunch time Starbucks craving  this is where I head. \nSo my lazy butt wishes they had a drive thru, but I am happily suprised every time I go that there is no line and I'm in and out pretty fast. The shop is on the small side. The staff is pleasant and has even offered me suggestions. My drink has always been served quickly and is made well. I have had no complaints.
