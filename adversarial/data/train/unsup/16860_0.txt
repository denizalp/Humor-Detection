I used to live about two blocks from here. When I first moved there I tried \"create\" burger and it was just about the worst thing I have ever tasted. I got an egg on my burger and that egg must have come from a Pterodactyl it was so old. I would often lay in bed at night thinking, \"If only a group of men would come and offer me a tasty burger\" and sure enough baby jesus answered my prayers and Five Guys came to the rescue. \n\nI used to live in DC so I was familiar with their work and went there immediately. Obviously five guys is a chain but oftentimes chains will have varying degrees of quality- the food is still made by humans(... for now) and so there can be huge differences in quality. This Five Guys is probably one of the better ones I have been to, I will give a few examples of what I mean\n\n1. Online ordering- when I ordered online the first time it said \"your food will be ready in 8 minutes\" - usually a claim like that results in me getting to the place on time and then waiting 20 minutes for my food. Not so here- I got there in 7 minutes and by the time I had finished my drink my food was ready. The last thing they did as I was waiting for my bag was fill my cup of fries- and then dump an additional scoop of fries into the bag for no reason other than awesome. \n\n2. I am waiting in line for my food and I realize due to a miscommunication they have given me a burger with no cheese. I bring this up and they fixed it without charge - and in fact gave me extra cheese. \n\n3. 300 flavor coke machine.\n\nThe burgers are really good for fast food- as are the toppings. They all seem to be freshly prepared- lettuce is crispy, tomato not mushy, jalapeno crisp. I even like the buns.
