So all this time I had thought there were three dim sum restaurants in the valley - Great Wall, Phoenix Palace , and C-Fu.  Today, I found out I was wrong.  There's one in freaking Mekong Plaza!  To think I've frequented Mekong sooo many times in the past and just glossed over the fact that they had an awesome dim sum restaurant.  We went on a weekday at around 11 and it was pretty empty so it wasn't too surprising that only three of the carts were out.  We had our drinks orders attended to pretty much the second we sat down but the carts took a little bit to make their way over to us.\n\nComparing Mekong Palace to the other three (Great Wall, Phoenix Palace, and C-Fu), their steamed cart was good, loved their siew mai, they didn't have har gow when they came by (frownie), the BBQ pork buns were filled with pork and gravy and were also light and fluffy - I'd eat the entire plate myself, don't judge me.  The desserts were a little cold but still good - the custard in their custard bun is a little more liquified than others that I've had, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and their egg tarts were eggy with the right amount of sweetness.\n\nHonestly, since I havent stopped by Great Wall or Phoenix Palace in a while, I don't know how I'd rank Mekong Palace against them (sorry C-Fu, you no longer make the list), but you know what, I think this calls for some research, ie. I might just have to swing by to get more dim sum this weekend!
