Great service - such that it reminded me a little bit of the SNL Italian restaurant skit in which every waiter kisses the woman at the table. \n\nIn all seriousness, the fancy food slide show at the front is what lured me in but don't let that fool you. The food wasn't totally horrible but definitely not worth the money.
