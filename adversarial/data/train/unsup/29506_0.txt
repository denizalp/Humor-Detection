Andrew made the process of setting up an appointment for removing a lock to my townhome and reinstalling, rekeying locks a breeze.  He is very professional, has experience in understanding the complexities with how deeds \/ transfer of titles \/ and proof of ownership work, when opening up homes.  This was a big help.  \nI tried another local locksmith that didn't have that legal background, and I wasted a lot of time with him.  But Andrew at Andrews Lock and Key is sharp- he knows his stuff about the legal side of the locksmithing biz, and that made the whole thing much easier.  His price seemed reasonable too.
