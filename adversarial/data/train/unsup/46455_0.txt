I've been going to Deana for a little over a year now and I just LOVE her. Not only is she super sweet, she is so talented with her work and very knowledgeable of the process of hair coloring. She's amazing at tailoring any kind of hair color or cut specifically to each person so that it looks amazing and complements your personal style.\n\nSo far, I have done a full or partial balayage every time I have gone and I've gotten a haircut once. I've loved my hair every single time! I've done varying shades of blonder, browner, ashier, more golden - I've been obsessed with my hair every time I've had it done by Deana. Whether you have something very specific in mind or you're open to trying something completely different, just know that you're in good hands and your hair will look absolutely fantastic no matter what!
