9-22-14.  Went to Sam Ash Music Store on Mayfield Rd., Lyndhurst, Ohio. Wanted to see how much they would give me for a Hirade Takamine, 1984, Master Series 7, classical guitar with hard case.  Have my original receipt from1984 for $734.  Guy at Sam Ash said they're worth $100-$200.  Mine in great condition so he'd give me $250.  I told him they're on Ebay starting at about $800.  He said that's \"asking\" price, not \"selling\" price.  I went down the street to Guitar Center. Man there brought up Ebay on the spot.  Gave me $450 for it.  Sam Ash rep must equate \"old\" (me) with \"stupid.\"
