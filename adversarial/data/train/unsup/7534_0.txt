You don't have to read my reviews to convince you this spot is just terrible. The Palazzo itself is grand, awesome and has beatiful places for pictures.\n\nI was reluctant to come here. My girl stated,\"Yeah a friend of mine has hookups there.\" Truth of the matter Vegas has no hookups for men, yet we usually pay the bill in Vegas. I already know and understand this about Vegas. No biggie.\n\nLet me illustrate to you how poorly run this waste of space is. From the beginning. The line causes confusion. You have an entrance door that within close proximity to an exit door. Once you enter, you eventually end up at the exit door. Then you ask yourself, \"Why don't they just use both doors?\" One can be used as a VIP entrance. No fire codes would be violated in the process.\n\nBars are poorly stocked. Lost count at the amount of times bartenders were calling for replenishments. Then you get other employees trying to squeeze past you carrying drinks \"by hand\" to get to the bartender. Aisles are super tight on the second floor. This is the main club area. Security here is inefficient too. Keep the aisles clear guys. Cmon. \n\nVery frustrating place to be. We exited within 20 minutes.
