Waited 35 minutes for the signature appetizer crab cake before asking if there was any food in our future.  Five minutes later, the crab cake was presented -- along with the moronic excuse that the chef did not like the first one, so he sent it back.  Of course, no one mentioned that during the time we waited -- despite their refilling our wine glasses twice.  Shortly before finishing the excellent but ridiculously late crab cake arancini, the primo and secondo courses arrived simultaneously, which is obviously something that should never happen in any Italian restaurant, much less this pricey joint.  The primo course, burrata agnolloti, was hot and delicious.  But, the secondo course scallops were not only delivered 15-20 minutes before they should have been, they were room temperature.  When advised of the temperature of the scallops, the waiter offered to send them back to have them reheated.  Not wishing to have vulcanized scallops (I own a car with a spare tire I could chew on for nothing), we opted to eat them cold.  The scallops were actually quite tasty.  Had they been warm and delivered at the appropriate time, they would have probably been rated excellent.  Our dessert was comped, but I would never recommend this place, nor will I ever return to it.
