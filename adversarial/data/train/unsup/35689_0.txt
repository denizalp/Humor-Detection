The perfect blend of old and new--the exterior architecture might not be modern, but the library's definitely with the times in terms of technology.  You can even check your own books out with the self-checkout machine. But, if you're feeling nostalgic for libraries of the past, I know of at least one good ol' fashioned card catalog in the building, in the second floor reference section.\n\nThe place never feels overly crowded--I always find somewhere to sit near the stacks that I'm browsing.\n\nHere's something neat I discovered on the second floor, in the nonfiction section in the back of the building: there are windows that look into the dinosaur hall of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.  You can get a peep at the dinosaurs for free, if you don't have the money for museum admission, and\/or enough time to visit the museum.
