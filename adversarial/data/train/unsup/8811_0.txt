I hate to say this but this is one of the WORST No Frills in the area.  I don't even bother going there anymore, even if it's to pick up one item.  First of all, you'd risk being hit in the parking lot, they rarely have any items listed in the circulars, shelves are not stocked properly and, in my opinion, a few of the cashiers are pretty miserable.
