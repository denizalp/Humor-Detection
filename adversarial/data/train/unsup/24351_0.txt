I have been seeing Dr. Diaz for over 10 years.  He is the best, kindest, compassionate neurologist in town!!  I have referred several friends and strangers to him.  His staff is just as incredible.  They always have smiles on their faces.  They have been with Dr. Diaz for as long as I've been going there.  It's nice to be able to go into a doctors office where they know you by your first name.  I have to say the wait can definitely be a bit much, but I wouldn't trade the care I get from him for anything.  Some people are just bitter and unhappy!!
