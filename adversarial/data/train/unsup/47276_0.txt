Great place for customizing your noodles. They have many soup options to choose from and are all pretty good. I really like how this place gives you a lot of ingredients and are not stingy with it like some other places. They have many drink options as well which is nice. The side dishes didn't blow me away but we come for the noodles not the side dishes.\n\nI would recommend the peanut sauce broth and the original broth.
