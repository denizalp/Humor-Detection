*giant sigh of disappointment* So, in my last update, I mentioned that this was no place to write home about. Well you can now! If you feel like being negative...\n\nSo I ordered a veggie roll (8 pieces, $12. Are you kidding me?!) and my friend ordered some sort of salmon roll (8 pieces, $12 also...). Jimmy ordered chocolate cake.\n\n And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.... and 20-40 minutes later, we were finally served. Jimmy's cake was literally one of those generic three-layer-take-out-of-freezer-and-thaw cakes. Super sweet, cold and high in preservatives. Sushi places usually have some sort of mochi, ice cream or sweet rice- not here! My sushi was barely cut all the way through and not laid out too nicely. It was pretty disappointing.\n\nThe server I have had before and he was awful and not very attentive... I thought it was maybe because he was doing prep work at lunch. Thennn there was this time. He wasn't working any other tables once we ordered and the service was still awful. Miscommunication with the bar (my friends ordered sake and it came INCREDIBLY late), Jimmy's cake (they said they were out of cake after 20 minutes, then brought some out 10-20 minutes later), and of course a long time until we got our food.\n\nOh Akahana... tweak your staff, adjust your sushi prices (get rid of the buy one, get one free and just make them reasonably priced), lower the terrible music and get some decent desserts. Then we'll talk again.
