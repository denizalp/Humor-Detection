-5 stars. This place is a total scam!!! SCAM SCAM!! I went here until I realized it was a scam. No real education. They just want your money and don't give a crap about the students. You will get in debt with loans and trust me, you will make nothing and have a crappy job after. \nStay away. If you want to learn how to cook, get a job in a kitchen and work your way up. No need for this BS school. Stay away at all costs. It is not worth it. You will loose going here. I was lucky and only took a few classes before bailing. They tried real hard to get me to come back but I refused. I graduated previously with a BS in advertising from NAU. I know a good education and I know a scam one I see one. They pushed me through their student finical aid department, I got a loan in 5 minutes. Did not realize until later it was at 13%. Luckily my dad came to save me and paid off the loan so I would not have to pay $100K for a 13K loan. \nThis place is just bad news. Chef's are morons here. I only had 2 that were worth a damn! The rest were idiots! Sure they know what they are talking about but they could care less. Do what I said and if you want to cook, get a job in a kitchen and work your way up. Cheaper and faster. By the time you blow $35K on this BS you will have money in your pocket and a career. If you go through This crap hole you will be broke and in debt forever with no real job.
