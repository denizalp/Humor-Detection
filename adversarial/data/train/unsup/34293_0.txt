We went in on a Thursday evening around 7pm...  only a few tables taken but alot of activity with take out.  The place is very comfortable and welcoming and the reno job is great.. the service was great.  We specifically went to sample the pizza and have a couple of beers.  The flavors were tasty... tried the Margherita (had to!!) and one of the specials of the day...  very good and better that its just a short walk away.  Would like to see a couple of more items on the menu.....
