An A-OK visit and experience...\n\nI just recently returned home from a three day business trip to Toronto - two days and two nights at the Royal York. I chose this hotel because a conference I speaking at chose this hotel to host the event.\n\nLet me be clear - the Royal York is a beautiful hotel - it really is. The service checking in and out was great, helpful, and the environment was rich and luxurious... but for me, I couldn't help feel that my experience was a little over rated.\n\nHere's why... for a standard room at $259\/night (and that's a discount due to the block reservations) I just didn't see the value. The room was clean, full of the usual amenities and such - nothing special, and nothing you wouldn't find at a Hampton Inn... yes, I just compared the Royal York to a Hampton Inn... does that sadden you? How about a Sheraton then?\n\nWhen I get charged $259 a night, two nights, I don't understand why they also charge $10 for a bottle of water, or getting charged $14 for wifi... and it's the slow wifi. Fast wifi is more... by the way, if you sign up for their email list, wifi is waved... but I don't wan't more email. So I sign up for email to save the $28 and I'll unsubscribe when I get the first email.\n\nThe Royal Yorks towels weren't any softer, the iron & ironing board weren't better (yes, I use them to press my own shirts (some habits I just can't break) - and  yes, I've seen better irons in the Hampton Inn... the bed wasn't any more comfortable, nor were the pillows. And you know what, I'm sorry but the staff weren't any better than a Hampton Inn or Sheraton... Just saying. \n\nI don't understand why they charge so much for amenities that are 2\/3rds less or free in a hotel with a comparable sized room (bed and bedding as well).\n\nDear Royal York - you're a beautiful hotel, you really are... but the things I'm paying for - bed, bedding, amenities and such... they are not on the same level
