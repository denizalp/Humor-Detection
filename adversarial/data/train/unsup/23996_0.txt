I love Indian food that's spicy and full of flavor. I came here for the first time with my family after hearing about them rave about it multiple times, and I definitely believe this is some of the best Indian food in the valley. \n\nWhen we first arrived on a Friday evening at around 5:30 PM, the restaurant smelled amazing and the place was relatively empty. I ordered the chicken tika masala, and it did not disappoint! You have the choice between mild, medium, and hot masala sauce - be careful if you order the hot and you're not used to spicy! The dinner portions were huge (I probably could have shared mine with my sister), and I definitely enjoyed everything along with their buttered naan.\n\nThis will definitely be the place that I visit when I'm craving Indian food. I just wish that they'd fix their website so that I could order online. It'd definitely be a lot easier and more convenient.
