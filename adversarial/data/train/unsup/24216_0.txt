We have seen this place a few times when we visited another place and were really curious as to what this place is.  Never having a Pasty before, I really wanted to give this place a try and see what the food was like.  Its also a bar, so you get the best of both worlds here, food and drink.\n\nI had the Shepard's Pie Pasty and it was WOW...If you like Shepard's Pie, this is a place you have to try because I can tell you have have never had anything this good and its a Shepard's Pie like none I have ever had.  \n\nThe menu has a great variety of choices and if you do not know what a Pasty is, it is what ever kind of meat and veggies you want inside a dough folded, cooked and cut in half.  It is definitely a meal and the prices are not outrageous. \n\nThe only sad part for me but hopefully great for them is that they are moving from the current location to Charleston and Main.  The parking will not be anything like it is here at this location, so I hope it all works out for them.  The other thing is the bar currently only serves beer and wine and at the new location they will have a full liquor license which can only be a positive.\n\nI would highly recommend this place if are looking for good food, a friendly staff and an all around nice relaxing time.
