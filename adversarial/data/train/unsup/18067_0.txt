This was an unexpected surprise!  Island style is a restaurant a couple miles off of the strip that looks kind of run down from the outside, and not much to look at from the inside either. I was brought here to try food that was Hawaiian, but also Korean\n\n...huh?!?  \n\nRegardless of what type of food it was, it was super tasty!\n\nI ordered the teriyaki beef plate.  It came with rice and macaroni salad.  The beef and the macaroni had great flavor.  The rice was rice, and tasted like rice should.  The curveball was that they served Korean style vegetable side dishes, like kimchi, to go along with the food.  They were okay, but the real highlight was the main entr√©e.  I am still salivating over how delicious the beef was, and I can't wait to have it again.  \n\nIsland Style is not the type of place to take someone who is vacationing in Vegas if you want to impress them...unless they really like flavorful food! Thankfully I do! It was an awesome find, and a great new place for me to go whenever I want to venture off of the strip.
