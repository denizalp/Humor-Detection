Normally when I visit Thai restaurant for the first time I order Penang curry. Since for a Thai restaurant I think making good Penang curry and Thai tea is very important. So I ordered Penang curry. To be frank, Penang curry was not as good as I had at many other places in Phoenix. However, my colleagues order other dishes and as per their review all dishes were good. Also, this place medium spice is equal to less spice. Piece of advice: So at this place if they ask you spice level on the count of 7 and if you can handle medium spice at other Thai places then ask for 6 rather than 4. \n\nI might visit this place again to check out other curries with spice level 6 and see how it goes next time.
