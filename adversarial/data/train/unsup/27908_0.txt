Johnny B's version 2.0 - I like it.  Love that they had a Groupon not too long ago - got soft drinks, 2 huge servings of wings, a large salad, and kid's pizza for under 5 bucks!  (Plus tip, of course!)  The only thing that stinks is that it was really cold and the only seat available was by the door - avoid that spot like the plague if you can!  Family friendly atmosphere, good service, great location.  Keep up the good work!
