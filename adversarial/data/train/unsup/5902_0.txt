I come here every month for a free air check and when I need to get my tires rotated.\nThe 4 tires I purchased from here are 15 months old  now and barely have any wear on them.  Yokohamas I think? When I purchased them, DT had price matched them to an online deal and for such a quality tire, I have been extremely satisfied.\nSergio, Assistant Manager usually assists me and he is always courteous and hard working. Sometimes he is inside to assist customers, other visits, he has been in the shop.\nI've been a customer of Discount Tire at other locations for over 10 years, and I have always found them to have excellent customer service across the board, this location being exceptional. \nToday I came in for a free tire rotation, and I was out the door in 9 minutes. That has to be a record!
