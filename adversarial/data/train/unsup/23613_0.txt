::Updated Review::\n\nI came back to Scarpetta because I had such a wonderful experience when I first ate here.  Unfortunately, my recent visit was not as great.  Although, the ambiance is still nice and classy. \n\n::Drinks::\nThe Berry Smash was a hit but when I got it again, the flavor was different.  The alcohol was strong which was good but the drink was not as fruity.\n\n::Food::\nI got the Lardo Wrapped Prawns before and I liked it, but on this visit it was too salty.  The Prime Filet of Beef was tender but there was no \"wow\" factor.  My highlight of the night is still the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti; it's so good!!\n\n::Dessert::\nI picked the Nutella and Vanilla Creme Bomboloni.  It was warm and fresh but nothing special.  \n\n::Customer Service::\nThe customer service was superb on my first visit.  The second time around, surprisingly it was not the same.  I was a bit disappointed.\n\n::Tips::\n-Try the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti!\n-Request to sit by the window so you can watch the Bellagio Fountain Show. \n-Please read my first review for more information or if you are curious about my first visit.
