This place has a huge warehouse-type environment that kind of reminds me of Costco, but there are some major differences: no membership fee; there are bulk bins where you can get grains, nuts, and other foods by weight; and you're not forced to buy items packaged in bulk for large families. The prices are mostly low, the establishment is clean and very spacious and the staff is very friendly.
