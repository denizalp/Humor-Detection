I admit, me and my family come to this place often on occasion. I always go with my family and always leave satisfied. The service is always great and there is a lady who is very nice and funny who always comes to check up on us often. However, I went to eat here yesterday and left in an unpleasant mood. I enjoyed up until I got to the sushi bar. I saw that some of the sashimi was dark and not fresh as further back on the plate, and I grabbed a few pieces from the middle which you can tell was fresher. I could tell the sushi chef was about to grab for the tongs which I was going to hand to him, but as I was trying to hand it over, the sushi chef had taken the tongs from my hand and began moving the sashimi on the plate followed by speaking in a rude manner which I couldn't understand. As I proceeded, I just felt very uncomfortable because he glared at me over the counter. It wont keep me from continuing to come to this buffet, but I felt that the attitude towards customers should never be like that, which is what upset me coming to this place..
