I've been going to this salon for a many years and over the years the owners have run it into the ground. They had pretty good stylists over the years but they are lost in the very annoying male owner who sits at the front desk and rudely talks about clients calling in and has the worst customer service manners I have ever seen. It's a Aveda salon with almost no products on the shelves because the owner doesn't know how to run a business. If you want an Aveda salon go to the Surprise Salon and save yourself the pain of walking into these doors.
