Loved the variety of Latin cuisines and the ambience. The Chicharr√≥n de Pollo is delicious with the most amazing sauce and a bigger portion for being an appetizer. The Corn Pops are a great appetizer\/side. My husband wasn't a fan but I happily ate all four pieces myself. And the Brazilian Beef Tenderloin was to die for!!! The most tender, butter-like piece of meat I've had in a long time with great flavor. Would definitely return!
