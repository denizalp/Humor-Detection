While this isn't the best park ever, there are some awesome features that other parks do not have. There is a $6 fee to drive in and a long road that leads you through out the park. A map is given to you upon payment and you are able to park at different areas to view different things. With the Vegas bipolar weather, we took advantage of one of the warmer days to drive out here and have my son see the animals. Here is my pros\/cons park list: \n\nPros: \n1. Ducks, geese, peacocks, bunnies and turtles. My son loved them all. He especially liked the bunnies and went right up to them. \n2. The ponds are stocked monthly with fish. Fishing license is necessary.\n3. Everyone we encountered at the park was super friendly. The employee at the gate, the people enjoying a nice walk, the family having a picnic...all friendly! I guess nature does that to people. \n4. There are picnic tables everywhere. You are also able to book parties with a reservation. \n5. I was surprised at how clean and maintained the park was. \n6. It would be a very nice location for a photo shoot.\n\nCons:\n1. The ducks and geese were a$$holes! They are super aggressive. They swarm you at the first sign of food. And we actually saw one duck holding another duck's head underwater. We learned this was how they mate. I felt bad for the female. \n2. Be careful where you step on the grass because there is poop everywhere. \n3. In certain areas, it smelled...like poop. I can only imagine the smell gets worse towards the hotter months. \n\nWe definitely enjoyed our visit here. We won't be back for a while since it's on the other side of town. But we will definitely visit when we need to get a sense of nature again.
