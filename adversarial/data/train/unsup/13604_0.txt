A friend of mine was needing some parts to repair one of his faucets and asked me to help.  Not sure why he asked me to help since I'm not a plumber nor do I know much about plumbing outside of the human body : -)\n\nWe went to the Homeowners Plumbing Supply store on 51st and Thunderbird to get what we though we needed.  This place has been in business for a long time, owned and operated by an experienced plumber.  It's in an older strip center and doesn't look like much to do from the outside and inside, but they know what they are doing and have what you need.  They can help the most uneducated and ignorant plumber out there, and that was us! \n\nWe showed the plumber dude a picture of what we thought we needed and he found us what we really needed after asking us a few questions.  He also recommended the things we needed to help in putting everything back together easier.  \n\nI'm a fan of this place and recommend you try them the next time you decide to tackle a plumbing project at home.
