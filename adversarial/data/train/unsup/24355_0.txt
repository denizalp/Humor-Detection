Here earlier for Chocolate Bark Making Class with Dining with the Girls meet-up group. Great class, who knew how temperamental when it comes to making chocolate. Robin, our instructor gave us the history of cocoa and cocoa beans. We got to made a Chocolate Bark. Got my chocolate fix after class with a large latte and a truffle\/Bon Bon.
