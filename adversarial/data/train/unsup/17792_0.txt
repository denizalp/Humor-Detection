So here is the Real Deal on Streetville Motors. \n\nI just bought an Audi A 8 from Eli with 63,000 km on it. \nStreetville Motors is a small car lot with two other dealer apart of the same locations. Eli is a young dealer who been there for 6 years now. \n\nI work with cars for a living. I'm Happy with my purchase from Eli. Everything Eli said he was going to do, he did and more. It's a small operations that if you give them the time to make your purchase right, they do. I found that Eli only problem is his youth. He try's really hard to make everyone happy and sometimes you miss your target. That's understandable. \n\nThe cars he sells are mostly off lease or have very low km's on them. I believe you do get great value from him over any other highend used lot. If you are straight to the point with Eli you get everything you want and more.\n\nI do see myself doing business for years to come with this young man who gave it his all when it comes to dealing with such a picky customer like I am. \n\nSo if you don't ask for certain things to happen in your deal, then you can't expect it too happen. Eli did everything I ask and believe me I'm an asshole to deal with when it comes to cars. \n\nSo way to go Eli for making me happy with my purchase. \n\nThis is the Real Deal on this location of Highend Used Cars. Eli was the Real Deal for me and I hope he is for you. When you go there tell Him Glenn sent you. :-)
