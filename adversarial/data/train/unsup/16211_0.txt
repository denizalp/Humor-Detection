Believe me when I tell you that I'm not a sushi or sashimi fan.  People will ask me to go for sushi and when I mutter that I'm not a sushi-fan, I get weird looks.  I normally try to avoid Japanese restaurants unless they can offer me something else.  This place did it!  \n\nTry to give yourself a lot of time when and if you go on a weekend.  The wait is ri-donk-u-lus!  But once you finally get seated, most likely with others at the long communal tables or at the bar, the food will come fairly fast.  Don't mind if people yell at you when you enter and when you leave -- it's some traditional Japanese greeting and farewell thing.\n  \nOkay, excuse my Japanese since I don't know the name of any of the dishes, but the yellow-tail something-or-other was yum; the seared scallops were to die for; the tuna in cucumber was so good; and the miso soup was made with red bean so the richness in colour and taste was amazing!  I also tried deep-fried chicken knee cartiledge; which may sound gross, but I'd take that over chicken wings any day!\n\nMost dishes range from $5-$10 dollars.  For two people with about seven dishes and some saki, the bill came to $85 or so -- not including tip.\n\nI'm a Guu fan!  Not a goo fan.
