I'll start by saying that as usual the wings are good. The problem is with the service...\n\nWe ordered 225 wings to go, along with fries and potato wedges. When ordered, we requested extra ranch and blue cheese. The lady taking the order to which I replied, that is fine, I am already spending $175, a few dollars for ranch isn't a problem.\n\nWhen we picked up the food, they handed us a big bag and said here are your condiments. When we opened it, there were two ranch and two blue cheese... Oh, tons of ketchup which is what was filling the bag.\n\nCalled to let them know, expecting nothing more than a genuine apology and instead, the \"manager\" whose name was Chase let us know that is how many you get with that size order and we would have had to pay more for more. Absolutely no resolution and not even a sincere apology.\n\nI would not recommend this location!
