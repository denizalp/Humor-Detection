Springs rolls are generally the same wherever you go - they taste great, but the portions aren't known to be the hugest. Which is a downfall for me since I love to eat until i can't get up. This doesn't happen when I come here, as I contemplate Mcdonald's on the way out. But, for the majority of people, I'm sure this is a good place to eat. \n\nWhat stands out the most about this place though, and you'd probably never guess it, is their bathrooms. Oh my god. It is the nicest bathroom I've ever seen in a restaurant. I wouldn't have minded eating my meal in here to be honest. \nEach urinal comes with its own little television where they play music videos. It has a huge lounge feel. Obviously, I spend more time in here than I need to, shaking it more than I should, but it's worth it. \n\nBut back to the food - I usually get the Pad Thai. It is pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. I may be biased though since I'm so fond of my asian buffets. I guess I'm quantity over quality? Or I just love chicken balls and this place pretends they don't exist.\n\nBottom line - if you need to hit the bathroom, and aren't dying of hunger, definitely come here and check it out
