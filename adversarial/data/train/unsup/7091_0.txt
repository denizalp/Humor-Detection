I was excited to try this after hearing the excitement from other people that \"Tommy's is coming to Vegas!!!\" After a short description that included \"the chili is kind of like Hormel\", I was in. I've always kind of liked Hormel chili, but I also always thought it to be the lowest possible standard for chili. Tommy's has lowered the bar. \n\nThe chili is a weird sticky\/greasy concoction that they dump on everything. It barely tastes like anything... They give samples to everyone before they order, I think because they KNOW it's horrible and most people will hate it. \n\nEven after the bad sample, I got a chili cheeseburger, hoping it would work in its home environment. It didn't.
