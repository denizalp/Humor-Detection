Look no further for a dollar store if you're in Liberty Village - you can find a lot of things at Your Dollar Store With More - it's at least on par with the average dollar store in terms of the variety of items and selection.  The staff has always been welcoming and helpful with me.  I think the prices are relatively close to what you would expect to find in a dollar store, despite being located in primo Liberty Village.
