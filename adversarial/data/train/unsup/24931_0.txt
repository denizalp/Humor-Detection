High-fives. no...? Okay, Four stars. \n\nDelicious gyro I have visited three times and each time satisfied. Each time I have had traditional gyro and tasty french fries. Gyro meat is nice shavings and I add tomato and onion to good pita. Tzatziki is good as well. Holler back.\n\nThey have white aprons on the walls filled with good tidings and signatures. At the register is the next work in progress with a Sharpie for you when you visit. This is somewhat like Yelp however you also get a gyro.\n\nSomeone please post pictures of this place. I feel depressed writing a Yelp virtual  review. Their logo is a caricature of two Guys that I assume are Greek proprietors. I don't know their names and now I am depressed. I am going to stop typing now.
