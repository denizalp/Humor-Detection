They were awesome. Completed the move in less time than expected, were patient, courteous, responsible and very skilled in moving large furniture with awkward grips through small corridors and stairs. \nI was ok with them using their dolly up my stairs, but they insisted they would carry it by hand because they didn't want to take any chances with the new carpet on my stairs!\nAwesome experience!
