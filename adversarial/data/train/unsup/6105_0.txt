I love Panera Bread! My favorite thing to get there is their Pick 2 with the BBQ chicken flat bread and their Greek Goddess salad. For a breakfast item, I love their Mediterranean Egg White sandwich. \n\nEvery time we go through the drive thru they seem to keep forgetting some of our items.... the first time, I didn't check the bags and when I got home, I was missing my salad for the Pick 2. I contacted them saying that I didn't receive my salad and when I went back to get it, they gave me a full salad. I very much appreciated that.\n\nThis time, we ordered two Pick 2's and GOOD THING we checked our bag to make sure we got everything.. we were missing TWO of our salads. When we told the lady at the window, she was not even apologetic about it. How do you miss half of our order?! The receipt even showed that our items were crossed off. She failed to hand us our complete meal... \n\nAll in all, I'll still be coming back here because it's only two minutes away from my house. I'm just very disappointed that this keeps happening here.
