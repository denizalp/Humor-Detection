Hard to find the entrance.\n\nI hate the \"Bottles and Burgers by Double Helix\" name.  First off, when I hear bottles and burgers i think beer and beef and buns, not wine and beef and buns.  They have wine pairings for the friggin french fries for crying out loud?  Please.  Stop.  \n\nI know that the 16 dollar burger joints are all the rage, but stop with the wine pairings and upscalifying of it.  If you're gonna charge that much for a burger and then $4.50 for an order of fries they better be badass.  My burger was overcooked and underseasoned  and underwhelming.  Not bad, but small and overly precious.\n\nI also hate when joints like this serve their food on a fancy plate to make it look fancy.  They have these fry server things with a sauce receptacle that makes an order of fries 18 inches tall and all fancy-looking.  Problem is there's only 20 fries and the fancy aioli sucked in spite of the special serving containter.  Fries with champagne and shallots?  No thanks.\n\nSo, the concept is wrong.  The value is not there.  The portion sizes are laughable.  The food is ok at best.  The room is schizophrenic.  Is it a bar, a restaurant, a soda fountain?  The accoustics stunk and the room stunk.\n\nOne last beef.  What's with the \"by Double Helix\" in the name?  Is that a household name?  Is that a signifier of quality dining?  Is that a trustable brand that everyone recognizes?  Nope.  It's a struggling wine bar for tourists @ a casino that 99 percent of locals don't know about  and a newly opened, lame rehash of a wine bar @ Town Square.  Don't get ahead of yourselves, rich guy restanteurs.  You haven't proven anything yet except that you have enough money to burn to open a few restaurants.\n\nCheck out Shake Shack in New York if you want to see how this idea should be executed.
