I love this place. It's not as cheap as Panda Express, but that's the point. \n\nIf you want a good, fast Chinese food experience, eat here.\n\nIf you want to get some Starbucks before or after, this is a good place too.\n\nIf you're lonely, write more yelp reviews.\n\nPlease take some time out of your day to try some Chinese that's not poured out of a semi truck shipped from California(if not further).
