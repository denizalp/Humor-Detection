Bartenders are nice and they take turns singing on stage! I accidentally sprained my ankle earlier that night and a friend was able to fashion an ice pack for me with the help of the bartender. \n\nDon't expect super fancy cocktails since it's such a laid back atmosphere. But it's a nice respite from the other establishments in the area.
