Only have been here twice and both times ordered a burger. Its so hard not to, as they serve fresh made burgers! Bonus is the hand cut fries. Why any restaurant uses frozen is beyond me.\nI am happy with this place thus far and would recommend to burger lovers. Although its more than a 30min ride to get here, I will be back.
