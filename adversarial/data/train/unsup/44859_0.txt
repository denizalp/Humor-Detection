It all starts with a deplorable store manager, Gloria Garcia.  She lacks basic customer service skills that managed to filter down to a couple of other employees.\n\nThis is sad because I would have rated this outlet a \"5\" based on previous interactions with several helpful and knowledgeable employees.  It all started going south when I tried to buy a new i-Phone.\n\nSix visits later, the phone now works well but with virtually no help from the employees we got in the random turn of events.  Our son basically did what Verizon could\/would not do to help.\n\nLong story short, you'd better hope that you do not want your new phone to operate like the old phone.  This Verizon store says \"take it home and figure it out, not our problem.\"\n\nWhen the glass cover installed by the Verizon employee was done incorrectly, you'd think that the store manager would step up for a few bucks to make it right.  Not so suckers.  At this Verizon store, go home and figure out the \"warranty process\".  It's not our problem.\n\nAmazingly, an employee named Marco helped me out with a new glass cover over the phone no less, with no hassle.  That seems to have ended this debacle.\n\nOver all, this was literally one of the worst consumer interactions of my entire life.  Please save yourself the potential irritation and go somewhere else!
