This is one of the better Port of Subs locations left in town. I have to start paying for double meat because they have become thin it seems on the meat over the years. The meat and cheese was sliced fresh in front of me and this is a busy location so the bread comes out of he oven fresh all day. I like a few of the different sandwiches here so I change it up depending on what sounds good. The toppings always look and taste fresh but with the hustle and bustle of making sandwiches they get olives mixed with lettuce and so on. I don't like olives or certain other options so when I ask for lettuce and end up getting a few black olives on my sandwich, the flavor stands out. They have always taken coupons I have with no problem but they no longer take the punch card.
