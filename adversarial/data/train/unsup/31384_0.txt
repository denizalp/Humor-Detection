We landed here for lunch. There was a nice prefix menu for $29\/pp. The salmon tartare was very fresh and the octopus was refreshing.\n\nThe lobster pasta was prepared well. The pasta was perfectly cooked. The sea bream was flaky and was simply prepared with capers.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly. However, service was average.\n\nOverall, excellent food coupled with average service.\n\nTry the lunch, it's a really good deal!
