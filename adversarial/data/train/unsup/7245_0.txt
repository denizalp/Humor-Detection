Someone who knows me would say I'm obsessed with animals. I'm the annoying person who takes pictures of them and send them to anyone on my contact list who cares. I can have a whole conversation on the adorable things animals do, and so on.\n\nMy senstitivity to animals was cultivated at a young age, and to this day, I'm a bit paranoid with how 'I think(in my head)' they feel. So, when one day, Larry, the Jack Russel Terrier I had been sitting for two years had a lump in his fur, I panicked, like 'oh my god, it's cancer!' based on the diagnosis I googled.\n\nI decided to take Larry to his vet, and he goes to the Glamorgan Vet Clinic. I was able to get an appointment by the next day, and the staff at the clinic were very courteous of my not so calm self. Dr. MacAulay was SO kind, and so calming, that I felt better as soon as he entered the room. He was thorough in examining Larry, and was very gentle with him, which is important to me. He went over his history and answered all of my paranoid questions, and told me Larry likely has a cyst, and no, it wasn't cancer. he let me listen to his heart with his stethoscope and told me if I had any questions that I could call them anytime. He also told me that on certain months, they offer discount services to their clients, which was nice of him to let me know.\nI was so impressed with his knowledge and kind manner, that I dont care where I live, I'd drive to see him next time I get a pet of my own.\n\nIf you love you some animals, like I love all the ones I have in my life, then you can trust this clinic 100%.
