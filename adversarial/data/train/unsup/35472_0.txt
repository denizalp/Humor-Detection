This Starbucks was my jam up until today. \n\nWhen I asked for a dash of cinnamon, I'm not sure\nHow that translated into 3 tablespoons. \n\nMy Chai Tea Latte was disgusting today and this usually happens once I become a regular. It's like the barista knows your drink because you order it everyday so they just want to f*ck it up because they're having a bad day or just for fun.\n\nOh and there was a little cat hair on my cup once I opened the lid. Thanks for the surprise!  \n\n\nUgh  I don't know. Dear Starbucks gods, is lifelong consistency from one location too much to ask?
