I have no doubt that this place knowingly rents to drug dealers as I am next door to one of them.\nI spoke to the property manager after finding out that the neighbors next  door to me clearly were into illegal drug dealing activities and after she promised that she would asked them to leave, no such thing happened. I am going to contact the authorities to put an end to these illegal activities. I am referring to the Emerald Suites located at Paradise RD.
