Service- 1 star\nFood -3 stars\n\nImam be brief.  The food was nothing special.  I got the sliders.  They were tasty enough.  The chocolate chip ice cream cookie wrapped in bacon was mediocre.  Unique concept but lacking in bacon.\n\nThe service....ugh.  Well, actually one interaction in particular.  Our actually waitress was nice enough.  But midway thru our meal another waitress delivered a dish to our table.  We asked her to take some of the dirty dishes to make room and this is where the wheels fell off the bus.  Her response to our polite request was 'well I'm not your waitress but I guess I'll take it.'  Woman please.....like record skip I was so appalled.  Comment wasn't addressed to me.  Had it been I certainly would have followed up with the manager, but my girlfriend wanted to handle it.  But firstly,  our waitress or no....you work at the restaurant don't you...and further more...YOU JUST DELIVERED FOOD TO THE TABLE.  By definition that makes you a effin server does it not.  I was appalled.  Yeah. I will not be back.  Period.
