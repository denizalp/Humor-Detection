The monthly cost isn't bad, but the startup cost I found expensive around $200.00.  There weren't many classes for instance Zumba only mid morning and late evening.  Nothing early or mid afternoon and just a few times a week.  For such a large building there weren't that many treadmills.  They really tried to push additions which was just really annoying to me.  They constantly wanted me to buy vitamins and then they started some outdoor fitness class and they emailed constantly about that too.  I think it's a better gym for people wanted to be buff they offered a lot of weights and personal training I just wanted some weight loss and a fun way to do that.
