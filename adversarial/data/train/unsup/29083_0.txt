I am a new customer. I was looking into a Maverick 88 shotgun and had been calling around town to get the best deal. East coast weapons beat all prices,and even told me I could purchase the gun on his website for even cheaper and have it shipped to store free! This saved me $20 bucks. Even if I paid the extra 20 by purchasing in store stock, it still would have been cheaper than the other guys.  Customers service was top notch. Would def recommend!
