Had a great business lunch there and would absolutely recommend Olive & Ivy!!  Loved the atmosphere, decor, food and most of all the service.  Our server Mark was attentive, without being obnoxious.  They serve bread with their own Pesto sauce as their version of bread\/butter, it was delicious.  I had their Gyro Sandwich with a light salad and it was flavorful.  Wish I would have sat in the patio area, but was concerned that it was still too cool.  Went out afterwards to check it out, and would highly recommend it.  The interior decor is definitely inviting as well, but with the great Phoenix Spring weather the patio should be great option.  Enjoy everyone!!
