My teenager nephew didn't ask for a novel or game book; he wanted an educational history book for Christmas.  I was so happy.  Then I realized it was impossibly difficult to find a decent selection to browse and choose.  Costco, Walmart and the like carry mostly trendy bestsellers, or classic children fictions.  To find a good selection of non-trendy books, one must visit a bookstore.  I guess many can say this is not a pure bookstore.  No, this Chapters is not in the league of World's Biggest Bookstore.  Yet WBBS doesn't exist no more.  There is no point in living in the past, and thinking that a brick-and-mortal bookstore of a decent size can survive on book revenue alone.  So I much appreciate that, amidst candles and gifts, and shelves after shelves of fictions, there are several full bookcases of history books, even a quarter of a bookcase of mythology books.
