A meatlover's dream. Beef, pork, chicken, duck, smoked meat, headcheese, homemade sausage. You can buy every single part of the animal (I loved seeing vats of duck fat) and being able to purchase foie gras at a reasonable price. I picked up a cured pork sausage with truffles and foie gras with truffles. Let me just say, that I really savored every bite for two days. The sausage had beautiful marbling and was not too salty.  The foie gras had the most beautiful texture and the bits of truffle really emphasized the umami taste.  You can purchase pre-marinated items to cook at home, or if you're a big cook, you can buy all your ingredients and make your meal from scratch. SO YUMMY
