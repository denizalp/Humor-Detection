Amazing place. The craftsmen who work here can fix anything, hence the wide variety of players they sell, plus cool, modern stuff like this Crosley I just bought from them (http:\/\/www.crosleyradio.com\/Product.aspx?pid=1686).  I feel really good about how they'll stand behind everything they sell maintenance-wise 100%.  Highly recommend this shop to anyone, even someone who has never owned a record player before (like me!)
