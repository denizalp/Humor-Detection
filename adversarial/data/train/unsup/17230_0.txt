I Own a 2010 Genesis Coupe.\nHad all four brake pads and rotors replaced at Nextmod Mississauga(Dundas & Cawthra) in October 2014.  Asked the guy at Nextmod to suggest a good brand.  Went with what he suggested.  \nWithin 4 months there was loud squealing on the front passenger brakes.  Took it back to Nextmod.  They charged me $80 to do brake servicing\/cleaning.  They said it was because of the snow, salt and debris build-up from winter driving.\nIt was STILL squealing as I drove out of the shop.\nI asked if they could replace the parts under warranty.  They said there is NO WARRANTY on the parts, because its considered \"performance parts\".  These were carbon-ceramic Hawk Pads and Hyundai OEM rotors.  Hardly considered \"performance\" in my opinion.\n\nToday, I took my car into Kal-Tire to get my wheels aligned.  They did a complete car inspection and showed me the condition of my rear pads and rotors.  Pads are almost completely worn and Rotors are in bad condition.  I am not an aggressive driver.  I maintain  my car very well in order to drive it throughout the year...summer & winter.  \nEither NextMod installed very crappy brakes and charged me a premium for \"performance brakes\" or they didn't replace my rear brakes AT ALL.\nEither way, you should probably avoid shady guys like this that refuse to honour new parts warranties and recommend terrible quality parts, yet charge a premium for them.  Don't fall for the cool decals and shiny colourful parts in their display cases.
