My girlfriend and I were walking around campus looking for a sandwich\/cafe type place to get lunch and chose The Bread Company. \n\n\nWalking in the door we were charmed by the atmosphere: mismatched chairs, chalkboard menus, and the wonderful smell of fresh bread! After a quick run through the menu I hastily chose the tuna salad on multigrain and my girlfriend had the mixed salad (pears, walnuts, blue cheese, raspberry vinaigrette). \n\nAfter ordering (and not yet paying), we were told to stand in an alternate line where we were to pay for our lunch. This is the only part of the restaurant that I didn't enjoy. We ended up standing in line for 10 minutes (with only one person in front of us!) waiting for the cashier to take our money. It's not that he was busy working, which would be completely understandable, he was walking around seemingly looking for people to talk to instead of working the register.\n\nBesides the payment debacle, we enjoyed the food immensely and will definitely be returning to try out dinner and brunch - hopefully by then the payment process will be a bit more streamlined ;)\n\nUPDATE:\nI've been to dinner here twice and LOVED it both times. The bread company is now part of my regular restaurant rotation.
