We ordered the sweet bread french toast and even though the toast itself is just ok, ask for the COCONUT syrup since they usually just bring out the plain ole maple syrup. Trust me, it'll change the taste of all future pancakes, waffles, or french toast you'll ever have.\n\nI wish they discounted their half order of benedicts if you ordered two different kinds since its' about $11-$12 for a full order, which is two, or $7-$9 for a half order. I also wish they let you do half orders of the sides, but they don't. But that's ok, because this place was so good I'll most likely be back to try everything else on the menu.\n\nI ordered the crab cake benedict with tots and these were the best tater tots I've ever had. I also tried the kalbi and garlic cilantro sauce for their salad. God, why is everything so good here?! I could eat salad like this for days if it came with the heavenly garlic cilantro dressing.
