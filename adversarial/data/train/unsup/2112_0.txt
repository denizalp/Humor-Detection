It might sounds strange.. But I have been waiting for Tilted Kilt to open for months! And I was glad they finally open for real.\n\nI am not here for the girls and I know it is just a little awkward for them to wear that \"uniform\" for work that makes Moxie's waitress uniform looks conservative. But the draft beer selection is the best in the area.\n\nI don't mind being surrounded by monitors of all sizes and I do enjoy watching sport games with a beer or 2 with friends.\n\nSuggestion: They really need written down list of what beers they have on draft on a chalkboard or whatever. This is just not professional when the wait staff does not even know what they have?!\n\nI will be back for a drink for sure and maybe even try out some of the food. \n\nBTW, there are also some waiters in kilts too but nothing compare to what the waitress are wearing...
