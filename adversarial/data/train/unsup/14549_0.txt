Wow. What can I say about Wilbur. I went in, a hungry, naive fellow in the midst of a busy work day, and in need of a quick take-out bite. Little did I know I'd be walking out with a bag full of the most glorious and fresh food this side of town had to offer. \n\nI ordered three fish tacos, thinking two wouldn't be enough. Ha, what an idiot. I was given my number, lucky 11, and took a seat at the handy and efficient take out bar stools, reserved for exactly this situation. \n\nThe people in front of me were given their food before me. They didn't get take out. They sat in a booth. I watched as the waiter brought their food to their table. I swear he was floating like an angel. An angel with Mexican food. And then it happened. My food came.\n\nThe woman tried to get the container into the plastic bag but kind of fumbled. She laughed and said, \"I always have trouble with this!\" After exchanging a chuckle and a thanks, I walked out the door, unaware of the tastebud voyage I was about to embark on. \n\nWhen I got back to work, I opened the container and to my surprise found quite a bounty of fish tacos. They looked incredible. I took a bite and the crunch of the fish felt wild between my teeth. But the wild ride didn't end there. It only got wilder. \n\nEvery bite was flavour explosion. I swear I could taste the sea. So fresh, wow. \n\nI love Wilbur and I will be back.\n\nMaybe next time I will try a different item on the menu. The Wilburito has a name that made me giggle.
