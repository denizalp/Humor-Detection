Sushirritos are apparently not a new idea, but I have never heard of it before. Sushi and a burrito all in one? I was intrigued. SoHo occupies a small space across from Palace Station, next to David's Bridal. The dining room is small and there are only a few tables. The first time I came here was around dinner time and the dining room was packed. There was nowhere to sit so my friend and I walked to the Mickey Dees and ate there. The last time I came in, around 7pm, there were a few open tables so my friends and I were able to eat there. I wish they had a bigger space so they could have more seating, but they are still new and Rome wasn't built in a day. \n\nSo how it works is you make your own bowl\/burrito\/salad\/nachos, or you can choose one of their signature selections. I have tried a few signature items but I prefer to make my own. I almost always get a burrito on a seaweed wrap with fresh salmon, surimi crab, tempura shrimp, spicy mayo, unagi sauce and masago. This costs about $11 or so. All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty. You can get your items ala carte or upgrade to a combo that includes a drink and a side of your choice for a few bux more. Side options include edamame, miso soup and taro or tortilla chips with nacho cheese. The taro chips were surprisingly sweet, and went really well with the canned nacho cheese. I love sweet\/savory combinations and this one was pretty good. Make sure to grab salsa\/soy sauce\/ginger\/wasabi from the salsa bar.
