The food at this location, without exception, has always been some of the best. I've been to a couple Pita Jungle's in and around Phoenix and this was the best. \n\nSadly, they also have some of the WORST service I have ever seen. Doesn't seem to matter if the place is packed or not, lunch or dinner crowd or just the in-between, you always seem to get slow service. \n\nWhat's worse than that is the fact that there is no apology for it. My wife and I were regulars and had been going to this place, literally, for a couple of years on an almost weekly basis. More and more, the service began putting us off and recently we had two or three bad experiences in a row and decided to just stop going there altogether. \n\nThe servers in question just left our table hanging, despite working the table right next to us, right in front of us and right behind us without missing a beat. A lesser person who didn't always tip heavily would have thought it was deliberate, were it not for the fact that it happened multiple times with one seasoned and one brand new server. \n\nI did bring this to the attention of the owner and he informed me that he only works the day shift now, which means he is never there in the evening when my wife and I used to frequent the place. I suggested he spend some more time on the night shift and get his wait staff in line, but I'm not going to spend any more of my time or money to give them a fourth or fifth chance, they have given me bad service for the last time.
