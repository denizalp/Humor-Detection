This was my first Pure Barre class.  I split my time between Los Angeles, where I do the Bar Method regularly, and Las Vegas, where there are no Bar Method studios.  I prefer the Bar Method, but Pure Barre is a close second choice for me.  The studio was nice,the staff was very friendly and I felt the workout.
