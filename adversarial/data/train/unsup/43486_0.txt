I had a lot of fun, I love tacos, and I love variety!\nI wish I would have taken pics of all the tacos I tried.\nMy favorite taco for taste was Pork on a Fork's pulled pork taco. I am not a big fan of pork and rarely eat it, but went back for a second taco from here! I will also be frequenting them for lunch along with my bf soon.\nFavorite chicken taco was from Sandbar and the jalepeno mac n cheese was also a treat.\nBiggest bang for your tickets were Dos Gringos (2 street tacos for one ticket!) and Rubio's- a full size taco (mahi mahi habenero, yum!)\nThe best beef taco I had was from Milagro grill. They had quite a line, but luckily, it was worth the wait and now I want to go their for dinner sometime.\nFriendliest booth was Macayo's, and their guacamole was muy muy delicioso!\n\nI didn't like that smoking was allowed, and to add it to it, a gal was walking around selling cigars. I came with a minor cold, and left feeling sick as a dog (not from any food, just from being really congested and exhausted from the heat!) Woke up the next day with full blown bronchitis, and this was the only place I went all weekend that I struggled to breathe at!!\nI also could not find Yelp, or Jenny. I asked at Information and they had no clue :( \nI was looking to give out a high five!\nI also disliked the high admission price. Thank goodness Yelp hooked it up with 50% off!\nWater costing $4 at an outdoor festival when you can get 2 tacos for $2 is also ridiculous. However, the same place (Dos) you could get 2 tacos for 1 ticket, you could also get a water for 1 ticket. Everyone else I saw wanted 2 tickets for a 16.9 ounce bottle of water!\nSome of the seating was shaded, which was fantastic, but overall, not enough seating for the amount of people. \n\nI would definitely go back next year, I thought it was a great concept, but a few things could have been executed better.\n\nOne tip- if you don't like crowds, get there before 12.
