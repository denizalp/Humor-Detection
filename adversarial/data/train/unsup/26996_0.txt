Ajs is by far my favorite place to eat, hands down. Classy yet casual. I love the salad bar, deli, and best of all the boulangerie. I am telling you these are the best desserts in the valley.. And if you come in the morning you can get any assortment of bagel, muffin, or pastry. The possibilities are endless!!! I can tell you that I will continue to support Ajs for the rest of my life!
