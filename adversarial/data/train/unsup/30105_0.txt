If you are on a tight budget, this is not the place to do your grocery shopping.\n\nThey have a good selection of veggie dogs, cheeses and prepared foods.  I also enjoy trying the various free samples.  Today's samples included balsamic vinegar with bread, oranges and assorted cheeses with crackers.  There's nothing worse than buying expensive cheese to discover it's not to my liking.  So the samples save me the expense and disappointment.\n\nI'm also a fan of flavoured aioli by Private Stock which is not available at the average grocery store.  They come in several flavours and make fish worth eating.\n\nThe cashiers are friendly and getting a small discount for bringing a reusable bag is a nice touch when checking out.
