I have been waiting to try this place out for a while. Menu looks very appetizing and thought out as well as side options. I ordered the blue ribbon. Couldn't stop salivating. Really good and got some condiments to add on. Went here on a weekend with my brother. I loved the interior and vibe of the place.
