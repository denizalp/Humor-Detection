$13.99 gets you a perfectly cooked Prime Rib, baked potato (with real butter) crisp green beans with garlic and a beer (yes, it comes with a beer).   Need I say anything else?\n\nOk, here's the catch.  When you walk in you will feel like you have found the WalMart of all casinos.  People are dressed in pj bottoms, slippers, sloppy t-shirts and have cigs hanging between their yellow teeth.  I'm past all of that.  Hang a left pull up a chair and have a delicious inexpensive meal with the locals.
