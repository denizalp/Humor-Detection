Typically, I am wary of establishments that put the words: best, tasty or even yummy in their name. However, Ingo you are quite the exception!\n\nHaving breakfast at their sister store, La Grande Orange, across the street before it was an absolute must to visit Ingo's if you love their food. Instead of fresh juice, pizzas and crepes Ingo's provides grass-fed beef burgers, healthy apps and a good variety of wine and beer (some coming from CA) to cause some CA nostalgia.\n\nSince I was dining with my roommate we decided to sit out on the patio and to share a meal with a couple of items so we could see what Ingo had to offer. We decided to start with the Hummus and Pumpkin Seed Guacamole served with crudites as our appetizer, the Paris, Texas burger to share and to drink the Black Market Hefeweizen and the Lyric By Etude Pinot Noir.\n\nHummus and Pumpkin Seed Guac- pretty large portion app for two people to share, good creamy hummus, with slight heat, thick consistency, the Pumpkin Seed Guac was not my fave, but it was all a personal preference. Comes with cauliflower, cucumbers, carrots, celery and golden beets.\n\nParis, Texas Burger- Really good burger, cooked well, juicy, love how the sharp cheddar cheese came through, crispy bacon, slight sweetness from the BBQ sauce and the pickles were awesome! They crisp the interior of the buns giving a good texturally crunch contrasting the soft, airiness of the outer bun.\n\nBlack Market Hefeweizen- Fruity, light, refreshing. I could drink this all night.\nLyric By Etude Pinot Noir- Apparently acidic, tangy, berry flavor, spicy and tannic.\n\nGreat service through out the night, lovely atmosphere inside and out and awesome food! Definitely will be back to try their other burgers, the rest of the drink list and hell, I just realized they carry dessert here. Hold that last thought, I'm on my way back already!
