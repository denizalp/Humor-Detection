I officially know what life would be like in a giant igloo! \n\nWhat a fun bar. I came here with some friends for my birthday after dinner. Just to walk in is $17, entry including 2 drink tickets is $37, and prices just go up from there the more you add to your package. \n\nThey absolutely do not allow phones or cameras, so much so that they provide you with a locker to lock your stuff up. They also provide you with boots, gloves, and a parka. Once you get dressed up they give you a quick rundown on what goes on inside and some general rules and you are on your way. \n\nInside EVERYTHING is ice. The cups you drink out of, the tables, the seating, and the walls. You see your breath when you talk. The cold atmosphere made us want to drink more to warm up. The bartenders are entertaining and they serve creative drinks. There is a photographer walking around because you obviously will want a picture to remember the experience. \n\nThis is one of those bars that you have to experience at least once.
