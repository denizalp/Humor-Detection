Wedrick Campbell took special care of my wife and I while we were shopping for a second vehicle he took the time to walk us around the parking lot showing us various models and continued to go up and Beyond the call of service very professional. Wedrick  Campbell  is a no-pressure guy and my wife and I really enjoyed that. Soon I will be in the market for a vehicle for myself and I will be back to see Wedrick I will be referring all my friends to him in the future. Thanks again we love our new LS 460\n\nVictor & Mary Guerrero
