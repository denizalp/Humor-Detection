If I could give 0 stars, I would. Dana (the front desk clerk in the mornings) is completely rude and utterly vile to guests. When I tried to ask her for help with the coffee station, she not only refused to help me by rolling her eyes and yelling \"that is not my job!\" and walking away, but she did so in front of a manager. When I called down to the front desk a few mins later to complain to the manager, he said, \"Well, that isnt her job.\" And he hung up on me. The hotel quality is below par and the customer service is horrendous. The staff are rude and unforgivable. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my life.
