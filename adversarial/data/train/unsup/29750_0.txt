This is a great place for a variety of AYCE items. They offer dim sum, thai, Japanese, italian and American food. All of their dishes are surprisingly delicious. I've never seen an AYCE that offers escargot. The place is well decorated, and has a classy feel. The only downside to this place for me is that it doesn't offer dessert as part of the buffet lunch\/ dinner menu. I thought at the very least, they should offer ice cream. Their desserts range from $6.00-$9.00 extra and only have a few selection. Their drinks (tea included) are also at additional cost. Overall, it is good place to check out if your looking for some high quality AYCE.
