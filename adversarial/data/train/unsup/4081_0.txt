Really great place for dogs.  Huge play area with anything you can think of for your pup to play with- like wonderland for dogs of all sizes.  You can tell the staff care about the dogs under their care. Very very clean facility! I used them to board my dog while we went on vacation and couldnt be happier. My dog came back happy, social, and clean as a whistle!
