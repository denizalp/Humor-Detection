I looked up this place on Yelp before my trip to Vegas to visit a friend. The reviews were great so I thought I would give it a chance...\n\nI really wish I could take this place back to San Diego with me, I would be a regular. \nThe services I received were a manicure with the OPI Shellac polish, Deluxe Pedicure and an eyebrow wax. \n\nMy nails are cut perfectly short like I like them and nicely shaped. I've had a few shellac manicures and this one is set a lot better. \n\nThe Pedicure was heavenly, my feet were tingling for an hour after from all the wonderful mask and treatments. \n\nMy eyebrows are pretty! The salon is very clean, and they don't skimp on the lotions and use all good stuff. \n\nThis is the best nail salon I have been too, friendly staff, great customer service. On my next trip out to Vegas I plan on going here again.
