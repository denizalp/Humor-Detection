I don't want babies! I am too young and too selfish to handle one of those bald headed responsibilities! \n\nWhat better choice than to get the Paraguard IUD to avoid further complication of my life and possibly getting elected to be on Teen Mom?!\n\nI couldn't have picked a better place to make this responsible decision. Dr. Dorsey and the medical assistant were AWESOME. It was just a cramp and then a pinch and then done in 5 seconds. Don't be like me and google about IUD's, you'll get yourself worked up for no reason! \n\nIf I can get through it, you can too! \n\nAnyways, thanks Arcadia Well Woman for continuing to be such an awesome group! I really appreciate it! :)\n\n**UPDATE: 7 months later and still no babies! What a lifesaver and a dream come true!
