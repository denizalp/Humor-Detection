I had a great time at this unique cafe. Word of advice, you should get there early (before 7) or else you might have to wait a while for a table. If you have to wait they take your number down and you can walk around the annex if you want. There is a cover of 5$ to play all day but that's nothing considering the selection of games (literally thousands). \n\nThe food was very good and the owner was extremely nice. One of the people in my party paid for a brownie that took a while to come out so he included a few extras to make up for it. They were all delicious.
