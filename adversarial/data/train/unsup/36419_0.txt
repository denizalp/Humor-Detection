We have been here a few times and never had a bad, nor spectacular experience. I sure do enjoy the old school track train ricketing around the ceiling. Beyond that it's pretty nondescript. TVs (new, flat), diverse crowd, some bar games... \nWe have posted up at the bar each time. Friendly service. The menu is pretty big and diverse. The food is good enough to fill you up and prepared well. Wine was cold in a smaller glass than I prefer. Beer was cold and specials were going for happy hour, though seemed on par with general drink prices for HH in the area. Our tabs have all seemed in the 40 dollar range for a 3 hour stay or so. \nThe problem is, when I look back I really just can't think of any experience or situation that stands out. I looked at my check-in here and it honestly took me a few minutes to remember what this place even was. :\/. \nIf you are looking for a neighborhood strip bar of good size and varied menu and drinks this is a fine place to go. It just really didn't have any real effect on me. \nThis boring\/neutral review pretty much sums it up. Um...Cheers?
