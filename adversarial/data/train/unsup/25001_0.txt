Really good dishes.\n\nDeep fried prawns with sauce vs Lotus of Siam Garlic Prawns.   I think Chada is better priced but the Lotus of Siam (LoS) Prawns taste better.  The sauce at Chada is good but it takes away from the flavor of the prawns.\n\nFor a party of six, 7 dishes was barely enough, we could probably have gone with 9 dishes.  I would double up on any dishes that you like.  We got 2 prawn dishes but 5 single dishes.  The dishes are really small here so you can't go for seconds in a large party.\n\nPad See Ew is also better at LoS.\n\nDrunken noodles were good also.\n\nParking lot is packed.  And usually you have to hound for a spot.
