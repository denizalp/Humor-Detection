I signed up for the unlimited washes but after moving from the neighborhood I've attempted on 4 occasions to cancel my monthly unlimited washes. This has been going on for 3 months now. On the first 2 visits to cancel I was in the office as they clicked away on the computer telling me that they were canceling my membership right there.  All attempts to cancel I was I was told my membership would be cancelled and that I would not be charged, but that in fact has not happened and I've continued to be charged. Im now resorting to canceling my card.
