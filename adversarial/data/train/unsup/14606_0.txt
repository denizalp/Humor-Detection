I don't kid myself.\n\nI will never be able to afford a single item in this store. Even if I could afford it, I could never install the right equipment to maintain the artifacts they sell here. To quote two great men (Wayne and Garth, from Aurora, IL) : \"We're not worthy!\"\n\nThis store, my friends, collects our history. They have signatures of Abraham Lincoln and FDR gracing the walls. They have first editions of everything - like Cat in the Hat to Tom Jones. They have handcrafted freaking illuminated bibles on sale... you can practically see the priest hovering in candlelight as he scrawls on the parchment paper.\n\nUn-freaking-believable. This bookstore is hardcore porn for book and history lovers alike - sorry, just saying it as it is.
