When we walked in we were seated immediately and our orders were taken. The food was great, but during our dinner we repeatedly watched people come in and be escorted to sit on the opposite side of the restaurant. We noticed that we were the only ones seated on that side of the restaurant, right next to the restroom. We could not help, but feel discriminated against. We voiced our concern to our waiter and we were told that it was because they were closing the side we were sitting on due to a slow day but when we asked why we were seated on that side instead of the side they intended to keep open he could not respond. We were enjoying our dinner until the realization of such discrimination set in.
