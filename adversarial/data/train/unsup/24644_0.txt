I've seen two comedy gods here in the last year, so maybe that's why i like it. It is really snazzy compared to that dump, the Improv, across the river. Also, the Improv has real crappy comics. Not Cleveland-comedian crappy, but still crappy. Back to Hilarities: very cool theatre with very intimate seating and attentive staff. I pass on the karaoke\/champagne bar or the dinner theatre ( not my scene, man). East 4th used to be a uriney alleyway with junk shops and wig stores, so the new look is astonishing. Now you can head over to west 6th for your uriney alleyway needs.
