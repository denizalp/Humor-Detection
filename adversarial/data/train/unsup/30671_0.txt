This place handles things really well. Good food with both interesting and healthy options. Great beer selection, best belgians outside of Brasserie V. \n\nDesign of the place is fantastic-- huge open ceilings, lots of light, and every square inch is designed to the T. I'm sure the upstairs porch area will be fantastic in the summer, and the bar is perfect for sports.\n\nOverall, someplace I'll be heading to over the Great Dane for sure now.
