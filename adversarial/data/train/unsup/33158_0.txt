I tried this restaurant a few days ago for dinner while my husband and son were at the mall.  I had the chicken with half rice and half salad. I have lived in Ahwatukee for 15 years,  and am so bummed I haven't tried this place earlier!! I liked it so much I brought my husband and son back the next day.  \n\nThe food tasted very fresh and they were huge portions  (we each had our own meal and we all had enough left overs for the next nights meal). \n\nI am a big fan of kabobs,  tziki and salads... It just feels like a healthier eating option than fast food.  There are a few other places like this that are close by,  but they are a little more franchise'ish with smaller portions.  \n\nThe staff here was also very nice.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant,  I'm sure it will be a new constant for me.
