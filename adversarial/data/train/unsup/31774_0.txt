People still go to this mall?  There are stores for those few people to even go to?  I could have sworn I heard they were going to be tearing the whole thing down and turning the place into apartments or something like that.  With the unfortunate gang activity and multiple shootings that have taken place, this is not exactly a safe place to go, for any reason, even when they had more stores than now.  Consider traveling a bit further to literally any other mall and you'll be fine.
