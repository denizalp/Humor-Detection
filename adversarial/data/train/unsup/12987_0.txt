10\/10\nHoly fucking mother of fucking God. Let's get shitfaced tonight after such an amazing breakfast on Christmas eve. This is, honestly, the best restaurant I've ever been to. All those positive references are so right. We arrived at 1pm for breakfast, we were 2 people and waited not even 5 minuted until we got seated in an amazing place in the back of the restaurant. I was totally overhelmed of how awesome this place is, there were many people in there, the food looks nice, and so does it taste. And the portions are huge, and not overpriced. The toilet is the most fancy one i've ever seen, you have to move your ass in there or you will regret it. If you can't, take a coffee and get some free refills first. I have no idea how my meal was called, the card is only in French, but a surprise is a good thing sometimes ;) and I was not disappointed - that thing was like a whole family dinner on a cut in half whole bread - and the Mokka was really good as well. \n$22 before tip for mokka and that complete breakfast. Fruits with real maple sirup as a free appetizer makes everything perfect. Just, go in there, you have to! \nOnly the waiter didn't show up often, but he's excused as there were so many people. And all the other waiters looked friendly and were really busy as well, so yeah. Go there.
