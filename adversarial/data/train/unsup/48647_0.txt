I came here after my husband continuously asking me to go here for our next date night. We rely a lot on Yelp for our date nights. Based the the stars from Yelp, I decided to give this a try.  \n\nWe ordered for Gorgonzola flat bread, calamari, chipotle chicken pasta and pesto linguine. \n\nPresentation - I was disappointed receiving our appetizers. It looked like our flat bread was microwaved however main dishes were ok.\n\nQuality of food - the food was good. I was however disappointed at how watered down the sauce with calamari was. I would dip my calamari in the sauce and it was dripping like it was deluded with water. \n\nPrice - price was fair. It was a nice restaurant and very clean so the food and ambiance was nice.\n\nService - not the best. I'm not sure if our waiter wasn't serving everyone by himself, service would have been better. The water tastes horrible, the soda was stale and I had to request a refill on my drinks. I also had to ask for a box and someone who was not our waiter came by our table once to see how we were doing. This place was not busy at all, however, there could have been a little more effort. \n\nI would rate this place a 3.5.
