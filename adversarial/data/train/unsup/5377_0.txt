I am a straight up sucker for Uno's Spinoccoli frozen pizza at from Woodman's. Yeah, that's right. FROZEN PIZZA. My husband cooks it to perfection at home. Loved it since he introduced it to me 3 years ago. So why not go to Uno's for real?\n\nI tried my hardest not to order anything spinoccoli related. The menu was extensive enough with some pretty good choices. Even so, my husband ordered the chicken spinoccoli pasta. The chicken breasts were stuffed with the vegetables and was surprisingly moist. He really enjoyed it. \n\nSince it was Friday night, I had the fish fry--which was perch. It was reaaaallly delicious. The breading wasn't overkill so the fish was plentiful. I haven't had too much exposure to fish fry here in Madison, but it's my favorite so far.\n\nService was average. Nothing too special, but not terrible. Since it's closeby, it's likely we'll come here again to try the rest of the menu.
