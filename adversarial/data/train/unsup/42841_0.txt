I saw this place while visiting another restaurant in the same parking lot. I bookmarked it to remind myself to check it out. Today I was really craving crab!  we were going to go to a different restaurant, then I opened my yelp app and was reminded of urban crawfish! We decided to come here and was able to get a seat right away! I got one lb of snow crab and one lb of shrimp in the urban mix spicy sauce!  it was delicious and the service was great! Will definitely tell my friends!
