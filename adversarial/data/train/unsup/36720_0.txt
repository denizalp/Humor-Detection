3.5\/5, +.5 for service\n\nI probably had one of the biggest burgers I've ever had in terms of height. I'm normally not a huge burger person, but I pass by Tom's Burgers almost 10 times a week and have never stepped in. I always see cars parked outside, so I figure there has to be some sort of attraction here.\n\nIt's certainly not the most eye candy restaurant, but eye candy should honestly be the last thing most people should care out. Hell, their TV inside is decades old and has funky colours, but you go to restaurants for their food, and that's what should count overall.\n\nI ordered the double home burger and a bottle of Sprite. Honestly I could've done with a single home burger, but I didn't know how big the burgers were at that time (as I said, my experience with burgers is generally lacking). Needless to say I was unable to finish the burger, but nevertheless the patty was so delicious and juicy! It felt like there was some sort of melted havarti or blue cheese inside, which wouldn't surprise me as this place is somewhat of a Greek restaurant as well (they have souvlakis and gyros). However it is not something you should have everyday (minus .5 stars), as you can really feel the saturated and transfats while eating the burger. Still, once every so often and it's excellent!\n\nFinally I took one star away due to the lack of a recycling procedure. Despite the fact the restaurant offers bottled pop, there's no recycling bin in here. Therefore you're either forced to take it out with you or put the bottle in the garbage can...something I vehemently hate.\n\nStill, I highly recommend this restaurant for the casual burger eater, or for a burger enthusiast!
