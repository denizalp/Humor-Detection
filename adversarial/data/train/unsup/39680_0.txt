UPDATE: Patricia, the owner personally reached out to me after reading my review from 2 weeks ago and apologized for what happened and my experience. She offered to come our next meal if we would give her another chance. \n\nI called last night to order 2 large pizzas and asked for Patricia. She remembered who I was and again sincerely apologized. She also better explained their computer system as to why she couldn't give me a refund and it made more sense. It's because they use GrubHub, a 3rd party transaction system. \n\nShe kept her word to comp our entire meal and we ordered a Margherita and Miko Miko, both larges. She apologized again and even rushed our order. It was 6:30 on a Friday night and the delivery driver was at our door by 7:15. \n\nI appreciate owners who own their business in more ways than one. She definitely did and I'm satisfied with calling our previous experience with Pizza Heaven a \"one off.\"
