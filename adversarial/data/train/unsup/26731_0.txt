I've waited for 1\/2 an hour to get in at Ramen Sora, so not having to wait at all at this restaurant is refreshing.  The ramen was just as good and full of veggies. We checked in on Yelp & received a free appetizer. Both my husband and I thought the service was excellent & the food quality exemplary. Cute deal - the Thai iced tea is BOGO - and our waitress was kind enough to give me my 2nd in a to-go cup with a straw. Very thoughtful!  I'll be back!
