new thai resto moved into the neighbourhood so def wanted to check it out. I have been so busy with business and family that i still didn't have the opportunity to go. My husband went for lunch today and brought me a tom yum soup.... and damn was it good. perfect amount of everything..... cant wait to actually go have dinner here  as the menu looks unique to what i am used to with thai.
