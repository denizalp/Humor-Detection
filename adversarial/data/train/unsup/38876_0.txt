Worst bowling alley I've ever been to. The lane was extremely greasy, way to much. The bowling balls were covered and grip of the ball was limited. It was about 90 degrees inside. I hit the help button after our lane froze up and nobody came. After 10 minutes we decided to leave when he then came 6 lanes down and asked people if they hit the help button which they didn't. (It was us). The nerdy concession guy got an attitude when I didn't give him a tip for pouring me a glass of mt dew. Bad experience all around. Bought the groupon for $15.00. They claim it's worth $28 but their prices were about 21. Saved $6 although that was false advertising. Won't be going back. The guy behind the counter was pretty cool and understanding of my complaints and said he's sweaty just sitting in there.
