Once a AAA member, always a AAA member. Debby White set me up with my membership about a month ago and boy am I glad she talked me into it! She's great. Not even a month after I got my AAA Plus membership....I ran over a huge nail, got a flat and had to use one of my service calls. Then I had to get my water pump replaced 2 weeks later and it was dirt cheap at AAA compared to other auto service shops. And I got a 10% member discount and a warranty! I have this involuntary compulsive impulse and I ask \"do you offer AAA discounts\" everywhere I go now. Debby is always really really really helpful when I come in. So far, as of today, the mechanics *seem* trustworthy and honest.  I love this location and I'm pleased with my membership. I will be renewing my membership every year because it is an absolute must have in my opinion. My membership has damn near paid for itself at this point. This place gets the ultimate stamp of approval!
