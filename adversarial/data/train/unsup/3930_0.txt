I walked in here, and within 5 minutes, filled a bag with $30 worth of gummy candy. That's got to be, what, like 2 lbs or more? I wish I could say that it took me longer than that to eat it. \n\nRUN AWAY, people. Unless you want to eat your weight in candy and then become constipated for days. Not speaking from experience or anything. Really.
