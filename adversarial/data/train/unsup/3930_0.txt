I love this place! I haven't been clubbing in Vegas for awhile now so when I went with my other two girlfriends I definitely needed to hit up the hottest nightclub! I was able to get all three of us on to a guest list and when we arrived at MGM Grand we headed straight for that line. The promoter Luis kindly showed up and introduced himself and let us know that the wait would be about 10 minutes. \n\nOnce inside it is typical in that its dark, you can't find a place to sit and yes the dance floor is small and crowded. So why do I give this place a FIVE star rating?! My girlfriends and I were able to snag a free table with bottle service! All free!!! I was able to dance my night away on top of a table and was so glad to have that space to just share with my girlfriends! I definitely will come back to Hakkasan again!
