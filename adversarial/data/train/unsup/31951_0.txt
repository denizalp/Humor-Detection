We love Vietnamese food but never had Pho.  It was really good here.  The nice woman cooking in back was making a new recipe and brought out samples for everyone in the dinning room.  Real food made by people who care about it.  Made with love I think.  Counter folk were really nice too.  Will definitely go back and try the Bahn mi next.
