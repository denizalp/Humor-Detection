So went to Smiths yesterday, You want to feel threaten when you get lunchmeat at deli, come here.\nSmall gangster looking hispanic guy behind meat counter cares less about his job or customers. Will make you wait until he is finished doing labels on lunchmeat or what ever and not help you until he feels like it. Then say well what you do you want dude!\nTold Manager, He looked like he cared less and said yea I will talk to them. Right.\nWhy do they hire folks that dont care about their job? Maybe the manager needs a  new job. \nI must say though the checkout clerks are great, need to put them behing the deli!\n\nAVOID the Deli meats if the young skinny hispanic kid is there, you will feel insulted!\nI will get his name and update, I was to upset and left store with no food.
