Another large chain and another meal that was just okay.   The perks were that our server was great, they make their own beer, root beer, and cream sodas, and they have a large menu so there's pretty much something for everyone.  However, service was also very slow and the food wasn't even piping hot when delivered.  We all ordered a version of their grilled cheese and all were pretty good.  Unfortunately, two of them were pretty soggy underneath.  We also shared an appetizer platter, which was full of typical bar food, also delivered on the not so hot side, and wasn't really anything to write home about.  So, if you aren't in a hurry and want something familiar along with a cold beer, this is your spot!
