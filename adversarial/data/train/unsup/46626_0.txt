My favorite summer spot! Once every summer I will be at Jardin Nelson without a fail. \n\nI simply enjoy the view inside... you go inside but you are actually outside. It's beautiful terrace, trees all around. I also love how plants are waved up on the stone wall. \n\nThe vibe is classy; the live jazz music is soothing and fine foot tapping. \n\nThe service is very amiable and helpful. Even though the place is always super busy; I am impressed with the patient service \n\nThe restaurant has amazing crepes and fine summer cocktails. \n\nIt's a super busy restaurant; there is always a line up; but the wait is worth. It's a perfect place to enjoy lunch or dinner with friends. Best part is the location is that it is in the heart of beautiful old Montreal.\n\nI can't wait till next summer!
