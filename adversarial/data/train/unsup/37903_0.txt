Landed here not by choice, but the first 2 places we went to weren't open on Sunday!!!  Well, we couldn't be happier!!  Like a previous review said...  Nothing fancy, no bells and whistles...  Just a place with chairs, tables and Sushi!  Prices are affordable, food is amazing, service couldn't be better!  The sushi chefs, who might even be the owner came out to our table at the end to make sure we enjoyed our food!  They have for sure gained 2 lifetime customers!  They have a great happy hour as well so we will be coming back for some of that!
