Went here on a Saturday with my gfs and surprisingly it was dead.  We were quickly prompted to sit by the table bar area. Decoration is a bit bland. Nothing too appealing. I ordered the Ahi tuna salad, which was really good! I forgot what my gfs ordered but they said their food was delicious.  Minus one star for limited parking spaces. Ughh we had to park by a garage that was a bit far of a walk but other than that service and food were great.
