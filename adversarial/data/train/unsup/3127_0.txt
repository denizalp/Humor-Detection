MUSIC SUCKS! Some gangster rap that you can't even dance too.  The mixes suck.  They need to get a better DJ for sure. Just when you think they're gonna play a good song they cut it off right in the middle. GRRR.  Then they play top 40 for like an hour and the music just fades like the radio!  They also have 80s hour, which gets old after like 2 songs. UGH.  Just never go to the same club 2x in the a row.  I should just establish that rule for myself right now.\n\nI would give it one star, but the I gave a star to the bathroom alone! OMG its gorgeous! Vanity forreal, perfectly fitting.  Everyone should see the bathroom! haha\n\nThe layout of the club is kind of small then the ones of I've been to.  Two bars and almost impossible to get a drink.  Its more of a rectangular shaped room.  Watch real world las vegas to get the complete feel.
