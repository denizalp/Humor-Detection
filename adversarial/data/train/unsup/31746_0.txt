Never again.. I think this was by far the worst Wild Wing I've been to. The service, food and restaurant itself was so bad.\n\nOur waitress was so clueless the entire time we were there. Whenever we asked her for something, she'd forget, then we would have to remind her. She would literally come back like 15-20 minutes later. When I said the restaurant was bad itself, the tables were SO sticky and an alarm went on for the last 30 minutes we were there, kept going on and off. We left because we couldn't stand it.\n\nI got spicy gar-par boneless wings w\/ regular fries, which also came with carrots. The boneless wings were OKAY, not the best. The fries were so soggy and gross. I hated the food.\n\nDef. will not be back.
