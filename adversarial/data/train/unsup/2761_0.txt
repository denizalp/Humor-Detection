When the BIGGEST part of the round-trip service is from the airport to the hotel in style, not the return trip to the airport to go home, a FULL refund or some other accommodation should have been made.  After bringing this up to Jeff, he refused them to refund ANYTHING at all, including the one way to the hotel.  \n\nSorry, you're not selling me on your rationale, and you won't sell anyone else for that matter.  I've been in many a stretch limo in the middle of summer with no problems.  If the trip to the hotel is 20 min, shouldn't the driver leave the car running or ensure the car is cozy before the client enters? If you offer a 1 hour trip, don't make the first 20 min unbearable.  Who wants champagne and a rose, when they're sweating and it's hard to breath.  Although, I can see now how that is a strategy useful for increasing your business in the short term (get them in and out as quick as possible).  HOWEVER, in the long run you will suffer, like my girls did in your limo.  \n\nGood luck!
