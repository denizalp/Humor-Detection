This is the first restaurant we came to on our recent trip to LV. \nHeard so many great reviews so I had to try it for myself. \nWe had a bigger (extremely hungry) group and it was a pretty busy Friday morning so they gave us the option to split our party into two tables. \n\nMy bf and cousin ordered the 1lb burger which looked and tasted amazing! All of our jaws dropped when we seen how humongous the burger was!  Just WOW! \nI couldn't decide what I want because everything they had to offer sounded great. \nI ended up getting the chorizo breakfast and OMG, it was SO delicious! Such wonderful blends of seasoning. However, I did not like the potatoes, even though they are pretty good, I'm just not a fan of chunky potatoes. I asked for a side of gravy for my biscuit and they charged me $3. Grrr. \nMy cousin ordered the basic breakfast w\/ grilled ham and he loved it! And all my other cousins enjoyed their food as well! \n\nThe portions here are huge! If you come here, I recommend splitting it with someone but beware it may be a little difficult since everything on the menu sounds amazing it may be hard to agree on one thing! This place was a hit for my family and we will definitely come back in the future. \n\nI hope you all will enjoy this place as much as we did! Enjoy! :D
