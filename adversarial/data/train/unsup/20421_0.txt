Rodney W. turned me on.  No, not like that.  His Yelp review made me stop at a gas station for a sandwich.  Without him, I wouldn't have done that.  I would be missing out. So thank you Rodney & Thank you Yelp. \n\nI've now been here about a dozen times.  Their selection, pricing, and quality of food keeps me coming back.  It's about time I bang out my own review:\n\nSo far, I have enjoyed their Gyro, Italian sub, Eggplant Parmesan sub, Yorktown burger, and their onion rings.  All 12\" regular subs are $3.99 - blows Subway away in price and quality. My favorites are the Gyro and the Hot Italian sub, both at $3.99\n\nI have not got around to trying their chicken but I hear it's cluckin' good!\n\nMenu uploaded in photos. Enjoy!
