I dread going to the DMV but I needed to renew my car registration so I came here this past Wednesday and used their convenient kiosk. The last time I was at this DMV was two years ago when I had to register a new car and I came early in the morning right when they opened so I was in and out in about 20 mins.\n\nWhen it comes to registration renewal, I would normally do it online but about four years I had an issue with the decal that was sent to me in the mail. When I tried to peel the decal off the paper, it started to tear apart in little pieces. So after that incident, I now feel I should go directly to the DMV and not worry about having to receive a defective decal in the mail.\n\nTry not to be late on your registration renewals. I was about a week late last year and I had to pay an additional $37 late penalty fee to the already $371 for the renewal. I was on time this year but still had to pay over $300. Ugh!\n\nThe kiosk is very simple and easy to use and they do charge $3.00 kiosk fee. It took less than two minutes to print the new decal, registration, and receipt. And there is an DMV clerk readily available if you need assistance.\n\nParking here sucks and the spaces are small!
