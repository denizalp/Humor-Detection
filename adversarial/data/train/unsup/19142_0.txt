Note: Cain's Saloon serves breakfast (!) from 8AM to 12PM on weekends. Yeah, breakfast at a saloon. That's a new concept, eh? Usually ya go get breakfast after ya hit the saloon. Anyway...\n\nI'm so thankful that the building where Jamie's Restaurant (our original destination the other night) was demolished or else I might not have ever stopped by this blustering bar\/restaurant that I keep forgetting exists. \n\nDisclaimer: Maaannnn, is this joint clamourous. It was so much so, that I asked Kay if she wanted to go somewhere else when we walked in, but she stuck it out, much to my relief. The food here is good enough to overcome the noise. Not that it was a rowdy place Nor were we subjected to any foul language, fights, or fatuous behavior. It's just LOUD but jovial nonetheless. There was a party going on in the dining room, which is where we were seated, and the folks didn't seem to mind at all despite not knowing us -- they were cool with it, so we were too. The people in the dining room and bar did not appear to be derelicts in any sense of the word. As a matter of fact, the clientele ranged widely in age. I saw an elderly couple, a middle-aged woman with her two teenagers, and of course many 20 and 30-somethings, all of them dressed casually without slumming it,  everyone seemingly enjoying themselves in a civil manner. To me Cain's did not come off as a dive or pick-up joint but rather appeared to be a friendly neighborhood watering hole and eatery. Bear in mind, however, that we stopped in between 8 and 9PM on a Friday night. Perhaps it gets a little wilder as the night moves along. The name Cain does have some Biblically ominous weight to it after all. Luckily, I wasn't named Abel! \n\nTwo appetizers lifted us off the runway: Honey BBQ Wings and Fried Oysters. \n\nThe supple wings had a mildly sweet, mildly rich sauce that coated them lavishly. The oysters were the culinary school example of apt deep frying, retaining their salty, seaborne flavor and juicy, slick constitution after a plunge into the hot fat, the crispy breading staying in place. \n\nCain's offerings include the usual sandwiches, burgers, wings and bar food, along with 14 different salads, all of which really sounded interesting (hello Watermelon Feta!). If that's not enough, they also have steak (T-Bone, New York Strip, aged sirloin tips) seafood (calamari, cod, crab legs, shrimp, the aforementioned oysters), pasta (fettuccine), hot turkey, and a Dessert of the Day, which we didn't partake in (we wanted to try nearby Carini's for ice cream). \n\nOnce I saw the Crab and Lobster Roll on the menu, all of the other choices before me were discarded. \n\nWhen freshly chopped lobster tail and legit jumbo-lump crab meat are chilled and married inside a toasted hoagie bun... alright, cue that insipid, forced Metallica ballad from the Black *hack* sell-out *hack* Album. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NcbAibPA2yY\n\nI've always HATED that song, but back to the hero at hand..\n\nUmmm...yeah, lettuce, tomato, and red onion are included to keep you regular. I asked for mayo since that's how I get down. There is something quite spectacular about a sandwich that bridges creamy, hot, and cold, especially when seafood is involved, even when it's just tuna salad on an English Muffin. Cain's roll of crab and lobster is the one to beat in my league thus far. \n\nThe Warm German Potato Salad I chose as my side could have easily passed for bacon-strewn, onion-laden, vinegary home fries; a deception I would find most welcome. Besides, french fries and onion rings do get tiresome. I still stand by my preferred creamy, cold, deli-style tater salad, but Cain's WGPS made for a fine culinary detour. \n\nKay's Ahi Tuna Salad was a sight to be seen. A grand cut of grilled Ahi tuna sat arrogantly atop a bed of baby greens, diced tomatoes, chopped red onion, avocado pieces, quarters of hard boiled egg. After tasting a chunk of the tuna, I got the impression that someone back in the kitchen knows their way around the fire. \n\nAnd the service was terrific. We were made to feel like long-time regulars despite never having been there before.\n\nI know, I know, but resist I cannot. Rock on...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b-BwXAGDfk8\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ESJgKkG-304
