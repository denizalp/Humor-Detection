We cancelled our subscription with the Arizona Republic several years ago because we would end up with an incomplete paper (missing ads, coupons, TV guide, etc) several times per week. We would call their customer service and be routed to some poor soul in Oklahoma who had no idea what was going on in Phoenix. \nTrust me, we never subscribed to this paper based on content (the reviewer who stated it looked like it was written by high school students was overly generous, I thought it looked like it was written by Jr High students). Fast forward and the only AZ Republic we buy now is the Sunday paper (for the ads, coupons, and comics) at a local store. Now even these papers are missing ads, coupons, TV guides, etc. Today was very frustrating. Not only were many of the ads that were in there torn, but THERE WERE NO SUNDAY COMICS! For a whopping $2 for a Sunday paper, at the very least we expect the comic section!!!
