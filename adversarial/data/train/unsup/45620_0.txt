Was so excited to eat here, as I visit Vegas a lot.\nFrom high end restaurants to dive restaurants. \nI've had it all!\n\nThis place was probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant I've visited Ever in Vegas. \n\nSat at our table for approx 15 minutes with no one approaching us to order at all. Tried to get the staffs attention but we kept getting walked by or over looked. We were not even approached for water as the girl pouring water at a few other tables around us didn't even acknowledge us. \n\nLeft after numerous staff members ignored us after 15-20 mins. \nWent to eat at Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips. \n\nWe realized if the service is this bad, how will the food be & how long will it take to receive.\n\nWill not go back. Rated a zero if I could.
