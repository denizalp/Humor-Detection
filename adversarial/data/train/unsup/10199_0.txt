It was a pleasant experience for what it was. I was to have all four wisdom teeth removed. \nBeautiful office. Dr. Letelier made me feel comfortable when explaining my procedure.  I very easily felt confident in his abilities. \nKaren thoroughly explained the breakdown of charges for me beforehand. Everyone kindly introduced themselves in the surgery room and made me feel at ease. Next thing I know I'm waking up to myself uncontrollably crying of laughter.. Thank you Jennifer for laughing along with me and explaining post-OP care to my boyfriend. \nDr. Letelier himself called me that night to check up which was very personable and very much appreciated. Dr. Letelier and Staff (Karen, Jasmine, Gary, Jennifer, & Kassidy(?)) all were very professional made me feel very comfortable. Glad I was referred to his office. Will be recommending others here.
