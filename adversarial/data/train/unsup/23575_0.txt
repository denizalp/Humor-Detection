I'm hesitant to bust out 5 stars for this place because they've only been open for 2 days but I can't help myself. I think i may have found a new haunt. \nThe bartender (possibly part owner) and what I can only assume was the other owner were extremely attentive and nice..... just plain nice, I miss nice alot, most people are assholes. Ya, ya, you're probably thinking \"well, it is day two, of course they're going to be overly attentive\"... and that may be so, I just hope it sticks. \n\nThings were still in a very preliminary stage in a lot of ways but you can see the potential when you walk up the stairs. Super cute \"ikea-ish\" decor, couch like seating area as well as high bar tables, low, very chill lighting, full bar..... that's right people!!! Full bar!! They even asked us our opinion on the music and if we had any recommendations. AWESOME!  The pour was good and strong and I'm told they are going to be \"married\" so to speak with Pei Wei to offer appetizers in the next couple weeks. \n\nThere were only a couple of other people there at the time, slightly older wine bar crowd. \nSo let's band together, get some sessy (younger)  mother F'krs together and turn this place into what it's meant to be.... a badass downtown drink spot.
