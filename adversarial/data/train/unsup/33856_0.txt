Great local spot that has been in town for 30+ years. I have been coming to Chapalas my whole life and it's the \"Cheers\" of restaurants. Everyone always remembers me and remembers what I get. Doesn't matter if I sit in the bar for a great margarita or out in the dinning room for dinner I am always comfortable and feel like I am at home. They also run a great brunch buffet on Sunday's that includes bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's. If you are looking for a great local spot for lunch and dinner or just a cool spot to grab a drink you will always feel welcome at Chapalas.
