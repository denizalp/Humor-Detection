Look for Tina, Lanie, and Peter for the best couple pedicures. \n\nWhere real men can feel relaxed and comfortable ;)\n\nOk, on a more serious note the service was excellent and professional. Recommend that anyone moving to the desert and find their feet\/skin adjusting to this climate then this is the place to go. Experienced the ice cream pedicure where Haagen Dazs ice cream was also served.
