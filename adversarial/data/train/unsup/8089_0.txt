Vibe is super cute and hip! \n\nStarted w the Papago orange blossom wheat and SO perfect for the Arizona heat - plus it makes me miss the San Diego beer scene so much! Followed w the lumberyard red which wasn't as good IMO, but still nice and refreshing!\n\nAppetizers:\n-Karaage was good but super tiny nugget like portions \n-Cucumber was also good but small non nugget like portions. Although more acceptable for a cucumber salad \n-Arugula was great! The pancetta was perfectly complemented by the cranberries and the portion size was good!\n\nRamen:\n-Spicy miso: broth was best of the 3 I sampled. The noodles and veggies were also the best of the ramen I tried. \n-Hakata: broth also pretty good and my friend seemed to enjoy it!\n-Sapporo.....Tbh I didn't love this. The broth itself was fine, but I don't think I like my chicken broths quite as much as pork. The butter noodles though.....really threw me off. I will not be getting this again. \n\nAnd now I'm here again on the same day waiting to try the pasta selection w my bottomless pit of a stomach, so I'd say...this place is pretty good!\n\nUPDATED MENU ITEMS (post symphony dinner):\n-Bolognese was delicious but I wish there was a little more sauce.\n-Cacciatore looked AMAZING. I wish I had as much sauce as this one...Majorly jealous and proceeded to eye this for dinner #2\n-Yaki soba was not my fav bc I personally like a little more vegetable\/meat in my dishes\n\nOVERALL after this MASSIVE review, I'd def come back!!! Not so much for the Italian noodles, but I want a bowl of my own spicy ramen!!!
