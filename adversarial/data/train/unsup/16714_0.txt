3 words: Free. Tennis. Courts. \n\nI love playing tennis out in the open air here with dogs running around and the occasional crazy person yelling nonsense, just to make things urban and interesting.\n\nThe courts aren't perfect (the ones in the rear have steel nets and potholes a plenty) and some players stay beyond their welcome but hey, there's no dress code and it's FREE!
