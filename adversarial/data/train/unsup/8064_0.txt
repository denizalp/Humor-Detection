Quick fast and good. \n\nI had the standard 2 eggs, toast and hash browns with a slab of Ham. \n\nEggs = Cooked perfectly\nToast = buttered well\nHash Browns = Not cooked as much as i prefer (and asked for) but were good\nSlab of Ham = nice huge hunk, cooked until caramelized a little on the slab nice!\n\nStaff was quick and service was on point.
