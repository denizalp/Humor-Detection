I have never had my hair cut at Cha Cha, and I am grateful for that.  I was with my mother a few years ago when she had her hair cut here, and it was the most uncomfortable salon experience i've ever had.  i actually feel a little bad because she only chose the place at my insistence, as I had wanted to try it myself.  \n\nAnyway, I don't know how you could make a simple bob look so bad, but I honestly think going to Cost Cutters would have done a better job.  The guy didn't listen to what she was saying, or else he was inexperienced and didn't know what he was doing, but either way, it was a terrible hair cut.  He also talked her into some \"streaks\" which were this hideous raspberry color, and looked like some 13 year old got into a bottle of miss clairol.  The whole time we kept giving each other worried\/uncomfortable looks, as Mr Cool Tattoo (the stylist) kept cutting hair obliviously.  \n\nLike a typical Midwesterner, my mom didn't say anything, but resolved to tell all her friends.
