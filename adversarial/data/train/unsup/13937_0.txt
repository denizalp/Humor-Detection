The husband and I went to Harumi a couple weekends ago on our self made 'food crawl.' We were going to go to Squid Ink (which I like very much), but decided to come here as they have such wonderful reviews. Now, this review isn't totally fair because we only tried one roll, so maybe other items are much better. Anyway, this place is set up kind of fast foodish, definitely set for the lunch crowd. This made it a little confusing at first whether we should line up at the counter or sit at a table. We were then directed to sit at a table by a young waitress who was friendly, but awkward. We ordered just a spicy tuna roll to see how this place did basic sushi. Then we proceeded to wait and wait and wait. After awhile. the waitress brought some edamame since we had to wait so long (guess they had a big party tray to make?), so that was nice of her. When we finally got the roll, I noticed there were no little dishes to put soy sauce\/wasabi..... and no one to be seen to ask for one. Oh well. The spicy tuna roll was kind of terrible.... I am no expert on spicy tuna rolls, but the ones I have had in the past were a slice of tuna or a minced tuna in the roll...this was like a tuna mush. There was absolutely no texture. Putting in my mouth was awful...it felt like fishy baby food. The purple rice was nothing special, not any better than regular rice. Anyway, after choking this roll down we then waited and waited and waited some more for our check. The place was not busy enough to warrant the ridiculous wait times. I won't be rushing back here for sure.
