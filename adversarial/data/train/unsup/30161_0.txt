Very nice atmosphere,  my dish disappointment.  I had the chicken and waffles. Very mushy and soggy not what you normally would expect. Took one bite and asked for something else...fish and chips light fluffy and good. The upside the deep fried cauliflower appetizer very very good....drinks good too.
