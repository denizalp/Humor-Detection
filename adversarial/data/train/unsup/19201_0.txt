Coming from San Francisco and having a plethora of really good fucking Mexican\/central and South American food to choose from....I was so disappointed upon arrival in Pittsburgh for the lack of anything decent in this food department that the only thing that kept me from hurling myself off a bridge was the difficulty I had trying to narrow down which bridge would be best to fall off of and during that tedious process I found las palmas and they made it so i didn't have to toss myself off a bridge anymore because their tacos were, are that fucking good!\n\nSimple, inexpensive, fast and tasty!\n\nI also like the big sidewalks and how close they are too the library and the ice cream shop.
