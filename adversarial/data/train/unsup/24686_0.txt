Awesome local fun thing to check out when you are in town where they make chocolate in front of you. It is a super cool touristy or local thing to do. I didn't realize how rare it is to actually find places that make chocolate in front of you, or offer classes that you are able to watch. \n\nDefinitely would add it to your bucket list. It's out of Vegas in Henderson so more suburban but definitely a super chill thing to do. You can do it with kids or without kids. They serve and sell lots of chocolate so definitely something I would check out.
