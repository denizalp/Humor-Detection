I think it's a good mall. Everything is so easy to find. Great selection and next time I'll go check out that Windsor I've never been into that store and one of the only Windsor stores in Ohio. Forever 21 store seems pretty decent. Charlotte Russe I will check out next time to.  Rue21 was small in the mall but good selection on the clothing.
