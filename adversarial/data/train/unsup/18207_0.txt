Do not stay here, upon walking in to what they call suites you smell dust and this awful musty smell to find very dated layout and kitchen. \n\nInitially thought it was just me but automatically felt itchy and the room just didn't feel comfortable and clean. I even hesitated to walk barefoot in the room because I felt the carpet was dirty and musty. The air conditioning is horrible, super noisy and super cold - don't even bother. \n\nWhat really did it for me was the fact that I found a bug in my sheets, something that looked like either bed bug or termite. Immediately called front desk packed my things and checked out. I was literally in the room for just a couple hours...don't know how I stayed so long to begin with.
