Stopped in after listening to a  \"you should try as a last resort\" type recommendation. \n\nWalked in with a friend and wasn't greeted, despite the fact two people were working, a younger dude and an older lady who, when she did finally speak, had the raspiest voice I had ever heard on a woman - I swear she sounded like the crypt keeper. I assume she had some position of authority based on her ranting to the younger dude. \n\nMy friend and I were both looking for Seahawks gear and found very little (even less than what you would typically find in in this city). Store was tiny, extremely dusty, and had really old merchandise that sat forever (you could tell by the discoloration of fabrics and yellowing of old price tags. It was pretty bad. \n\nWe located trinkets off to the corner. After making our way back there, we were barked at by the crypt keeper lady, no joke she practically yelled the words \"what do you want?\" My friend and I looked at each other in a WTF moment as we began to inform her of our intent to take a closer look at some merchandise. She seemed irritated and rudely informed us that we shouldnt be back there and questioned whether or not we knew that since there was a ladder was in the area. Yes folks, a ladder. As if to imply it was the universal sign for \"don't come back here\". After the obnoxious exchange, we immediately lost interest and spent a few moments trading WTF looks with raspy and ended up leaving. \n\nMy advice to the crypt keeper lady.....write a fuck√Æng sign! \n\nAdditional fortune cookie tips:\n\n-Ladders in an area do not imply off limits. \n-Greet and engage customers. \n-Purchase and vigilantly use a duster\n-Puchase and use a vacuum \n-Stock current product\n-Acquire a pen\n-Acquire a piece of paper\n-Write with said pen on said paper, messages that clearly communicate rules, instead of miserably failing at communicating with people due to fuzzy logic and faulty assumption. \n-Stop smoking\n-Learn people skills\n\nI think it goes without saying that I will never return to this joke of an establishment and have already spread the word to every single one of my friends who are in the market for sports memorabilia\/attire to follow suit. \n\nIm really shocked this place is located in boca park given the fact that most shops in this area are generally more upscale. \n\nThe horrendous service, lack of product (pathetic, really), and cleanliness issues really make it tough to believe this place is still in business. There are many options (great sports store in the south las vegas blvd outlet mall, as well as inside fashion show mall)\n\nThis place is a joke. I would have given this place negative stars but 1 star is the lowest it goes.
