I love this gym! I have been coming here for a year now and enjoy every minute!  The staff is friendly and helpful. I took advantage of an online deal for my first 5 classes.  I bought sessions to use now since I go to other gyms too.  I had a base of ballet as a kid and missed the structure of it as an adult.  I love the fitness classes because you benefit from form, posture, strength and stretching from the ballet and break a sweat with the added cardio. I recommend balletaerobica to start and ballet booty or ballet core for more focused areas.  Either way, you will leave here with a good workout...and a hot tea of the day!
