Awww Brett. Even when you tell me my hair feels like I was swimming in a chlorinated pool and that's it's just basically shitty and unhealthy ... I still love you. And even when you sell me products that I can't really afford (but I buy anyway)... yeah, still got love for ya.\n\nI always laugh my ass off when I'm in Brett's chair. He never fucks up my hair either!
