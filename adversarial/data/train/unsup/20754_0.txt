This new kid in town is definitely a welcome addition to the southwest valley.  For only $7.99, you can custom build your own pizza.  There are three different crusts to choose from - traditional, wheat and gluten free. Quite a few sauces and cheeses to pick from including their house blend cheese and a kale pesto sauce that I would have to try next time.  They have all the traditional types of meats such as meatball, italian sausage, bacon crumble and some not so traditional meats such as sweet sriracha chicken and some vegan meats too.  What I really love in their veggie section is the grilled zucchini.  Once your custom pizza is made, it is flashed cooked in under 5 minutes thru a conveyor belt.  It doesn't have the crispiness of a wood fired pizza, but I like it a lot because the crust is chewy and not too crispy. Their toppings are fresh and quite tasty.  \n\nI ordered their traditional crust pizza with pesto sauce.  Then I loaded it with house blend cheese, Italian sausage, meatball, chicken breast, ham, black olives, artichokes, grilled zucchini, mushroom, roasted garlic and spinach.  They actually put the spinach on top after cooking so the spinach doesn't get all crispy and all dried up. It was very appealing to look at and quite delicious.  The crust wasn't all dried up.  But when I got the pizza home it wasn't very hot at all.  It was actually only lukewarm.  I don't know if that was because there were too much toppings and it should have been cooked a little longer or because of the thin crust it cooled off real fast.  Maybe next time I would have to eat it there instead of asking for take out.\n\nI would definitely go back and try some other combinations.  I was a little surprised that they were not busy around supper time.  But bonus for me, because I did not have to wait in any line.
