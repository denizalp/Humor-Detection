Visited this restaurant twice during my 5 day stay.  Rhonda was our waitress the first time in and we requested her the second visit.  Pulled pork sandwhich was amazing as were the wings.  Rhonda was on top of everything and great with the recommendations as we are an indecisive group.  If you visit this location be sure to request her.
