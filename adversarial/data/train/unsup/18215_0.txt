Went here on a Saturday morning.\nThey take reservations on the phone but will only hold the table for you for 10 mins - so I suggest calling as you are on your way.\n\nWe had a big group (8 BABES) \n\nOnce we got there it was only a 15 min wait even if there was a ton of people waiting.\nNot sure if it was because we called in advanced.\n\nThis place is quite large on the inside with ample seating.\nA family environment.\n\nThey have this thing on the table similar to what I saw at Bubba Gumps where you can turn the sign to make it so that if a waiter sees it, they will help you. See pics!\n\nIf you check in VIA Yelp - you get a free Banana Walnut Muffin - but I got one anyways with my meal.\nI ordered the Sundance Special which was a veggie omelet with spinach, mushroom & artichoke hearts topped with tomatoes and feta cheese (which would lead to my later food poisoning - not through the fault of the restaurant but mine)\nIt was super yummy but it was a huge serving so I had to take it home.\nFYI; leaving feta cheese in a car for 5 hours is never a good idea.\n\nYou pay up front. FYI.\n\nI would recommend it as there are a ton of good choices for food and they all look good.\nThere are a ton of choices for vegetarians as well. Always a PLUS!
