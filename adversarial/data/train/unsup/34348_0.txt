This has to be my new Fav' spot in Phoenix! Came for Happy Hr & this place did NOT disappoint! Great Happy Hr food w\/awesome beer & cocktail selection! The staff & service were beyond exceptional! This bar in Chandler has IT all & can't wait to return for a game nite as this Tavern has TV's & best outdoor patio seating ever! Had some if the best wings I've ever had, along w\/awesome desserts too! 5stars from me
