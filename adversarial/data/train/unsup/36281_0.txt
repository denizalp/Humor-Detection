The taste is very good. \nrecommend：小笼包，台湾担担面，抄手燃面！\nThere are still lots of dishes I haven't tried yet. But I would definitely go there again and again. \nReally good place !\nI have been there twice. You have to wait to be seated. The taste is so good that so many people is waiting in line in the lunch or dinner time. \n\nSo bring your friends and come early to have a taste. You won't regret!
