This review is based on both customer service and coffee quality. We were not greeted by the two women working in the store when we came in. Since it was the first time in this place, started looking at the long menu on the wall. Younger woman barista did not offer to help or explain anything about their coffee. She looked disinterested and unfriendly. The other older sales woman just walked away after chatting with someone.  Again, no greeting to new customers. Ordered a latte, it did not even have a foam design, only white blob. Any place charging around $4 for a cup should have baristas trained to do pretty designs. Latte taste was average, expected much more from a store that roasts their coffee. \nWhen we were leaving it would have been nice of them to thank us for the business and wish to \"have a nice day\". \n\nThey have pleasant seating inside with funny pics on the walls. From the outside store looked dark and deserted, was not even sure they were open. Interestingly when you walk in there is no coffee smell at all.  \n\nOverall did not enjoy the experience. Was going to buy some coffee beans since I always want to support small business, but will look for a friendlier place to do that.  Thankfully there are many of those around.
