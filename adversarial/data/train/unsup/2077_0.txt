This is a huge cookie-cutter faux \"town square\" complete with chains.\n\nIt's a decent spot to meet folks due to its location, which provides easy access from the Strip and other points, plus copious parking.\n\nDining options are hit or miss, depending on how much you like places like Claim Jumper, Yard House, or Texas de Brazil. Plenty of places to drink, and plenty of places to shop.
