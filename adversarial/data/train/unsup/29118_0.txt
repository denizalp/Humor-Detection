Service was friendly, BUT I classify this as a modified fast food restaurant it should not have taken 20 minutes for a burger, fries and drink.  Then lets talk about the salt burger.  I ordered the Mooyah burger done the Mooyah way which means sauce, tomato, lettuce, pickle, grilled onion and American cheese on a whole wheat bun.  My first bite was with everything and it seemed salty so I scrapped off the extras and took off the bread and just tried the burger, turns out it was the burger itself that was overly salty, in fact so salty there was no other taste coming through.  Definitely NOT going back.
