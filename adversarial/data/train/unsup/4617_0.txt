This place wasted so much of my money. A few years ago (before online reviews were as easily accessible as they are nowadays), I started going to this place. I was amazed that it didn't really hurt all that much and that each hair seemed to be zapped so quickly. But the hairs would all grow back within a couple of weeks. They told me to come every two weeks and that it would take a year to get rid of all the hair. After about 8 visits, I started to feel like I was throwing my money down a hole, so I did some more research and realized that I really was throwing my money down a hole. You aren't supposed to get electrolysis every two weeks, because it takes longer than two weeks for the hair to actually grow back (if it's going to grow back). That, and they were just doing a deliberately crappy job so I would keep spending money on them\n\nI found a highly recommended electrologist in Toronto. I had one appointment with her and at least 50% of the hairs she zapped that one time never, ever grew back. I've seen her maybe four times in total for different parts of my body. There's been minimal regrowth, whereas with this stupid place there was total regrowth. The other thing I realized is that this place only uses thermolysis, which is NOT the same as electrolysis, and they keep the heat very low so it barely harms the hair follicle. \n\nDO NOT waste your time or money on this place. They are deliberately scamming people, in my opinion. You will spend far more money on them than if you just find a good electrologist and have fewer sessions.
