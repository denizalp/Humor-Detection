I was in the area for work and decided to see how the folks up here do poke.  I have had poke on several occasions in my home state of Florida.  The pros: friendly staff, fresh ingredients\nThe cons: pricey for the amount of food received, limited toppings -- with surcharges for adding additional items.\nIt was not the best poke experience I have had and I have no reference in the Charlotte area, but in Florida, this spot would be meh.\n\nProbably will not return.
