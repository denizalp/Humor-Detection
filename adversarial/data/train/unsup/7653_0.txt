3.5 STARS\n\nYay! It's hella Chinesey up in here!\n\nNormally you can judge how good an Asian restaurant is by the amount of native diners. Vegas is no exception.\n\nPing Pang Pong came as a recommendation from my friend who lives in Vegas but he did warn me it's not nearly as good as the dim sum in SF.. \n\nOn Sunday, 9.11.11, my friends and I came to PPP at 1 PM. It was about a 15 minute wait for a party of 7. The FIRST thing I noticed was the overwhelming amount of Mandarin and Cantonese speaking patrons; seemed promising.\n\nFOOD\nLadies push around dim sum carts and call out the dishes in Cantonese. They are more than happy to show you what's inside the steamers if you don't understand Cantonese.\n\nWe ordered the following (some in doubles):\n*Hai Gow (Steamed Shrimp Dumplings)\n*Siu Mai (Steamed Pork Dumplings)\n*Hai and Char Siu Cheung Fun (Steamed Shrimp and BBQ Pork Noodle Rolls)\n*Fung Zhao (Steamed Chicken Feet)\n*Ngau Yuk Mai (Steamed Beef Balls)\n*Jiaozi (Potstickers)\n*Deep Fried Shrimp Balls\n*Paai Gwaat (Steamed Spare Ribs)\n*Ngau Toa (Steamed Tripe)\n*Fu Pei Guen (Steamed Tofu Skin Roll)\n*Lo Mai Gai (Steamed Glutinous Rice w\/ Chicken in Lotus Leaf Wrap)\n*Jin Deui (Fried Sesame Balls)\n*Char Siu Chow Fan (BBQ Pork Fried Rice)\n\nThe only standout dishes was the steamed tripe which was melt-in-your-mouth soft and the fried rice which was al-dente which bits of rich fatty pieces of pork (albeit a bit greasy).  The rest of the dishes were mediocre; they either lacked quality ingredients, were tiny (dumplings) compared to the norm and\/or on the dry side. But when you're starving and there's a lack of good dim sum options, it sufficed just fine.\n\nS E R V I C E\nPerhaps, I'm so use to rude service at Asian restaurants that I didn't find the service at PPP even the slight bit rude. Our waiter brought things quickly when we asked for it and refilled our waters promptly. This in itself is already a rarity in most Chinese restaurants.\n \nA M B I A N C E \/ D E C O R\nWith a name like Ping Pang Pong, it's no wonder that it excudes the typical stereotypical d√©cor of Chinese village roof shingles, red paper lanterns and waitstaff in mandarin collared outfits. Most importantly, It was CLEAN!\n\nWith a plethora of dim sum restaurants in San Francisco, PPP would probably rank a 2.5-3 STARS in SF. However, considering Vegas has a scant amount of decent Asian restaurants and we left stuffed for only $15\/person (including tip) they do deserve a better than average rating.
