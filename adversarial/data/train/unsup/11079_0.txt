If you're from Australia or for that matter any other country outside or the USA I have a news flash..... They serve real coffee here!!!! It's not watered down, it doesn't come in a 24 ounce  bucket!\nI ordered a Flat White and that's exactly what I got... And without the sideways look you usually get from the cashier at other dishwater coffee stores in America.  \nThese people know their coffee and it shows ! You won't be disappointed skippy !
