Let's start by saying I've only gotten delivery from here, so I can't speak to the actual \"in-house\" experience.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, there is a holy trinity when it comes to delivery food, especially Chinese. Tasty, affordable and a quick arrival. China Lin comes with a hairs width of hitting all three.\n\nThe prices are fantastic. They do that thing that I love at Chinese places where they offer both a Pint option and a Quart option for most of their dishes. Solid. I was able to get a breathtaking amount of food for around $25 dollars, including Hot and Sour soup for $1.80, which seems joyfully illegal.\n\nAs for the delivery, I received my food a full 25 minutes before the estimated delivery time. The driver was friendly and professional. It was everything you could want from a delivery experience.\n\nNow, on to the food. The food was good! It wasn't great. It had it's issues. The chicken fried rice, for instance, lacked salt. When I say that, I mean there was no salt in it, an unusual problem for fried rice in my experience. The cheese wontons were good, if a bit chewy, and the General Tsos was straight up standard.\n\nNo socks were knocked off. No taste-buds set aflame with joy, it was just an evening of good, standard, serviceable Chinese food with world class service and an incredible price.
