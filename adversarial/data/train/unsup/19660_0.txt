Red Rice was good in a pinch - rating is more 3.5 but I rounded up. Definitely enjoyed the familiar flavors, especially when we were having it with a few of my friends from back home (Guam) at our 20th high school reunion.  As always, good or bad, Guam food is always comfort food to me. Red Rice was sort of in the middle of the pack for me.\n\nHubby got the chicken plate while I went full throttle and got the Fiesta Plate.  Favorite things on the plate:  grilled chicken and bbq beef.  Kelaguen was ok (mine's better) and the shrimp patty was kind of mushy in the middle.  I saved my rib for last but it was just too tough for me...lotsa gnawing! I would have liked the rice slightly more al dente (but it wasn't mushy).\n\nWe did nosh on the empanada - one of my fave foods from home - and ended up taking four of them to go.  Although I ate them later that day cold, they really are best when super hot.\n\nThis was good...otherwise, home-cooked Guam food is always best.
