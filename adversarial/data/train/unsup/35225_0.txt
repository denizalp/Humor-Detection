Just ate at Sam Woos and was so disappointed ....... the service was NON EXHISTANT and the wait staff rude and never checked on our food that was served COLD, we ordered the 3 meat appetizer ,all 3 meats were cold  and we also had BBQ pork lo mien the pork was just a bunch of burnt slivers dried out and tasteless the noodles were stuck together and lumped up. I have to say I ate here before and was pleased with the food but I will NOT come back again. With so may Chinese restaurants to choose from why would I ????
