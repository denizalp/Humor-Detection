Opening Day is alway confusing for most businesses, but la Madeleine was pretty good (for the most part). \n\nI ordered their CÃ¡fe Sampler (Quiche, Salad and Soup) To Go, and to my surprise it was BOGO.  Nice start!  For myself I tried their French Dip and because tomorrow is Ash Wednesday, ahhhh Valentines Day, I order a Dark Chocolate Heart (photo) shaped cake for the boss. \n\nEverything was very tasty and only ran me $32.60 after the discount. \n\nEven better, la Madeleine's is near my office, so I'll be back real soon.
