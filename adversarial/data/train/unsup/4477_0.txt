**\"Warning... this review has been copy and pasted from Facebook, and I HATE Yelp, but these guys deserve all the five stars in the world. Just doing my duty to spread the barcade love!!\"**\n\n\nI finally made it out to this place tonight and I'm truly in love with what these guys are doing for the community. They have a lot of heart and it really shows. We started out with a few craft cocktails that were expertly prepared and very impressive. The food prices are on the lower end, so we ordered a bunch and were not disappointed. The fresh veggies on the hummus plate were especially top notch! Rounding everything off with a few craft beers and some Galaga really made my night!\n\nThe best part about this place is that the owners are there and available. It's so nice to see a new business open and grow through the hard work and excitement of the guys at the very top. This is not a corporate hipster glam show, it's the real deal. A small business run by real dudes for the love of the gaming community. I'm excited to watch them learn and grow. Phoenix has a real gem in Bonus Round. Give them your money!!\n\n**Oh, and Becky is cool as shit. Tip the shit outta her!!**
