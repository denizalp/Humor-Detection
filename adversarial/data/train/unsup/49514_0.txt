I am so surprised! I live in the Blue Diamond area and usually have Don Tortaco because all of the Roberto's I have been to have treated me rudely. I literally just asked them to cut my burrito in half once and the cashier literally said \"we can't do that\" Really? I work on Spencer, so this location is fairly close. I thought \"hey, why not?\" I did not enter the Roberto's; I ordered off of Postmates. When my order was delivered to my work, I was seriously SO SURPRISED. I ordered a bean burrito with guac, pico de gallo, and rice (I'm vegan) and fries. The last time I ordered that from Roberto's the fries were soggy and they put waaay too much guacamole on the burrito. It was literally just beans and guacamole. This time was so different, my burrito was perfect and I am not even exaggerating. I NEVER eat out but I was hungry today. I even got a side of ketchup for my fries, as I have never seen happen before. I appreciate this, but I will not be eating here much just because of my own preferences. I just like the fact that this Roberto's is A-OK even for being on such a ghetto side of town. Thank you!
