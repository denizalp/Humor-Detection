Rubio's is the king of fast food.  No matter what Rubio's I go to, I always get Mexifood so good that I can hardly believe that it's fast food at all.\n\nThis location is no different. . .no scratch that, it IS different--the customer service is the absolute bomb.  With our vegetarian habits, sometimes it is difficult for us to find food that we can eat in certain places.  Kimmie, who was the employee who waited on us, really helped us construct our meal, and even brought us salsa samples to try.\n\nThe food at this Rubio's location was as good at always, and the service made it that much better.  Count on more service from us at this place--thank you very much!  You made a very long and tiring day end on a good note.
