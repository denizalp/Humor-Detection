The service was good, everyone was nice, even the bathrooms were nice, however the pizze wasn't so good. It barely had any sauce, it was just bread with cheese basically. I was a little disapointed since I've heard so many good things about their pizza. They also only had like 2 tvs in the whole place, so wouldn't recommend for awkward first dates if you're trying to space out while eating or something like that...
