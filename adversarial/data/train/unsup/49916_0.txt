Such a great experience. Went in late at night after a show. Wish I could remember our waiters name he was awesome. The food was fabulous, like so amazing! We had the ribeye (with the garlic butter enhancement) with coconut prawns, Caesar salad and baked potato. We weren't super hungry so decided to split our meal. Some places are so grumpy when you want to split, but our waiter was very kind and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. And the view is so great!
