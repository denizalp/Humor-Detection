We had a very good experience here, although it's a very weak 4 stars.  Unlike the Thrifty employees at the airport in Kauai, they didn't hold Alan hostage while he signed up for the car.  Even better, as the three of us walked through the parking lot in search of a car, a man, obviously an employee, possibly a manager, pointed to a silver Altima and told us it was \"the pick of the litter\".  So we took it.  Had it not been for the interminable wait to get out of the parking lot, the four stars would have been much stronger.  There were two lines to leave.  Unfortunately we got in the slow one.  It took 10 or 15 minutes while the man in the booth checked out the 2 or 3 cars in front of us for dings, dents and such.  He seemed to have difficulty w\/ the iPad\/computer technology involved.  Had we chosen the other line we would have been on the road much faster, but we didn't.\n\nThe car itself was comfortable, clean and reliable.  When we returned it the woman who checked us in was friendly and efficient.  We have no brand loyalty when it comes to rental car companies, figuring they're pretty much alike, aside from the off-brands.  Price is the determining factor, relatively speaking.  We were pleased w\/ our experience w\/ this Thrifty location, aside from the long wait to leave.
