McAdams Dental super-ceded the hype of the reviews of the fellow Yelpers. After recently relocating to Phoenix and not knowing anyone or anything about the city, you tend to start relying on Yelp to get in the know of where to go. I never thought i would need to resort to Yelp for Dentist since most people choose from their insurance network book, but finding a Great dentist is like trying to find an honest mechanic. \n\nMcAdams Dental is a friendly establishment with comfort and care as top priority. Everything is up front regarding cost and treatment so you aren't surprised with a bill at the end. Honestly with care like this I don't really care what they charge. They are efficient and quick despite being short a dental assistant for the day. And by quick they weren't short changing you on care, they were punctual with the appointment time and very little wait. Which is a rarity in the medical field. I would highly recommend this Dentist and his staff to everyone looking for a dentist.
