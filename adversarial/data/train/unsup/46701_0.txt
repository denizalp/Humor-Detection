Gonzales sewing machine is really the best and only place to go in clark county. they've fixed many of my machines (both home and industrial) and i have purchased a couple machines from them.  best prices on industrial machines i've found from any store (new or used) and service is really fast.  they can come to you for a small fee, but i usually just bring them in, and most of the time, i can get it back later on that day.  Chris really knows his stuff, and has taken care of sergers, coverstitch, auto backstitch, etc for me.\n\nreally, you cant beat the service, knowledge, or price.  they have a huge variety of machines (home & industrial) for sale as well, along with irons, cutters, and lots and lots of parts
