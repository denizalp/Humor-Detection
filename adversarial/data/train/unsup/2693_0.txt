I suppose this location isn't big on customer service. After reading all the reviews clearly management hasn't caught on to the things they should fix to ensure they stand out from the other fast food places around. They are pretty lucky they are the only taco bell in about a 5 mile radius.\n\nI'm sitting here in drive thru line, got in like at approximately 12:21 its 12:42 and I am still in like to get my good with one car in front of me. Its a good thing I don't have a 30 minute lunch.
