This is my absolute favorite mall in Vegas, its perfect for almost any occasion and time of day! You can enjoy shopping for just about anything, even groceries because they have a Whole foods grocery store. Very nice variety of shops and boutiques for all price ranges. \n         Time for lunch or dinner? Hungry? There is so many choices to chose from! My favorite places to dine at are California Pizza Kitchen or Brio! If im in the mood for a burger i go to I Love Burgers! Enjoy happy hour at some nice little bars like Blue Martini for instants. Time for a night out with the girls? Mc faddens is a ton of fun! \n         Do you have any kids? They have a little spot just for them! Wonderful playground, Maze and even a spot where they can cool down with some water splashing from under the ground! Make sure to grab them an extra shirt !! \n         In the mood for a movie? Go to Its Sugar and grab some of your favorite Goodies! Then head up stairs to the theater ! They play a nice variety of movies even late at night! They eve have a little bar inside aha! \n          Now do you see why this is the perfect  mall? (:
