When I walked in I thought to myself, this is the smallest Starbucks I have ever seen! Only two chairs at the back? I have just moved back to Toronto and did not realize that there was an upstairs until after I had ordered and moved to the back of the main floor. The person next to me said she was moving upstairs because of the draft. Upstairs?! Now that made much more sense.\n\nUp a very long staircase you will find at the top a beautiful long modern space with lots of tables and even some comfy chairs to offer refuge from the winter wind. \n\nOverall my server was super nice and remembered to ask if I wanted whipped cream on my cherry mocha which does not always happen and I end up with that fatty glob on top. The limited edition mocha was quite lovely but next time I will go for dark chocolate to make it more sophisticated.\n\nPlease note the staircase is quite a climb so those with mobility issues will have to make space for themselves in the small area at the back.\n\nOverall the location is great, the service was excellent, the decor attractive and there is tons of space upstairs. I would definitely go back.\n\nYou can read my full review here: http:\/\/www.suziethefoodie.com\/product-review-starbucks-cherry-mocha\/\n~ Suzie the Foodie
