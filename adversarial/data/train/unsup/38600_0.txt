Hadn't heard any buzz about the place, but was looking for good local (Green Valley) Italian entr√©es and pizza.  Went there for Sunday dinner, only to notice that the big cavernous bar and restaurant was dead.  I mean like 5 customers!  Ordered some appetizers:  garlic knots and calamari, but we're told they were out of the fried cheese stuffed with pepperoni. Surprising, since the waiter said everything was made from scratch and I knew those basic ingredients were in the kitchen. \"Scratch cooking\" was evident in how long it took for the food to come out of the kitchen!   Appetizers, which were pretty good, took 20 minutes and the chicken parm, lasagna and 3 pizzas took nearly a half hour more. \n\nThe lasagna was all right, but wasn't close to the best I've had. On the other hand, the chicken parm was excellent (tender and very good sauce). The pizzas were good, but not great.  We had the meat lovers (good flavor, but soggy crust), the marguerite, (somewhat on the dry side) and the four cheese, which was too heavy on the garlic and slightly burnt. \n\nThe servers were friendly and tried to be attentive. All in all a positive experience that I would consider trying again, but if Sunday's business was any indication of future success, they may not be there for long.
