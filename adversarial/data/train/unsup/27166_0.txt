1\/2 price apps and happy hour all day on Monday. SUCH a good deal.\n\nI came here yesterday for a quick early dinner with my boyfriend. We collectively decided that this was our new place.\n\nI love the atmosphere. Everything is clean and open. There are even a few arcade games in the back to play. It has the ambience of a sports bar without being as grimy as a typical sports bar. \n\nOur server, Sara, was attentive and friendly. I ordered the carnivore tots. Have you ever put something in your mouth and thought \"Wow, this is brilliant.\"? Yeah... this was that experience. Those tots are amazing. My boyfriend got pretzel sticks and cheese as well as buffalo dip. Both were amazing. Our food came quickly and was delicious. Our drinks were cold and refilled quickly! \n\nOn top of the above average service and delicious food, the Monday deal was unbeatable. The price is amazing and this is definitely going to need to be one of my go-to spots!
