Oh my goodness, terrible.\n\nWanted to try this new local business and throw it some love, so I ordered for takeout.\n\nI received the wrong meat in my tacos, not what I ordered.  Not a huge deal, I figured it'd be a good lunch anyway but dear god.  These tacos are SO DRY. Good lord.  No amount of taco sauce could fix this.  So much chewing.  It was so dry, I went out and bought a tub of sour cream to try to add a bit of moisture.  Even loading on the sauce and sour cream, the tacos were dry as hell.\n\nTastes\/looks like this meat is pre-cooked and sliced and then left out all day, then microwaved when you order.  So gross and pretty much inedible.  Do yourself a favour and go to one of the other local Mexican restaurants, which have WAY better quality for a comparable price.
