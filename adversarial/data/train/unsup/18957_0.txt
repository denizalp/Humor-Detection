I like that they have a variety of pizza slices - some have chicken, and one is even made with whole wheat crust.  The concept is simple - you order your slice and they slide it in to the giant oven to heat it up.  What I can't understand is how they manage to screw that up.  Sometimes they leave it in for 4 or 5 minutes and it comes out hot, and sometimes they leave it in for 2 minutes and it comes out slightly warm, without the cheese all melted.  \n\nOn a completely different note, there is an upstairs seating area here.  It is the most plain and sterile looking 'restaurant' I've ever seen, and it is always very quiet, because they don't play any music.  Once I went up there and saw a girl sleeping on a table. For a while I thought she might be dead, but then, half-way through my pizza, she woke up and went back to reading her book.
