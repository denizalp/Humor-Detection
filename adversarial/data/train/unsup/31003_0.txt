This US Bank location is inside the Smith's Grocery.\n\nWe first started coming here just every now and then to hit up the ATM after grocery shopping. We then had to take care of some bigger business that required assistance and we were very glad we came to this location. We had actually submitted paperwork at the Green Valley location (in the same parking lot) as we thought the grocery branch couldn't do what we needed. We had lukewarm service at the stand-alone branch and prefer to go into the store branch. \n\nThe ladies that work there are very friendly and professional. We have never had any issues with customer service or accounts. \n\nI recently had my wallet stolen and had to change everything over. First thing I did was call this branch to take care of my needs. Kristen is the one who answered my call and took care of all of my acocunts. I then had to go to the bank to sign some paperwork, which she did not delay on at all. I also got a follow up call from her once she was able to process some other paperwork and get some clarificaitons. \n\nThis branch is definitely our location of choice whenever we need something more than an ATM can offer.
