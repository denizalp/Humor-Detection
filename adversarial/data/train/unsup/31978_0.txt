well zero star is what it should be but I don't have that option\ndo not fall for the group on photos and advertisement\nthis place does not match it at all \nif you already purchased this on groupon deal you better off not using it and let it go to waste \n \nold, dark and poorly run place\nno staff just the wife and 2 guys working in the kitchen with dirty shirts and jeans \nserving the food \noh and forgot the husband, well he showed up late with wall mart bags and they got into a verbal argument \nvery expensive compared to what they offer or should say they don't offer much \nThe salad bar was cheap and looked like was left there for a long time with no cover \ndidn't look fresh \nuncooked meat with cold running blood \n$3.00 for can soda and no refill?????????? \nso she charged us $9.00 for 3 soda cans\n$27.00 in tips for the party of four (4) and up ???????????\nfor what service?????????? just couldn't believe it \nnever seen that anywhere in Vegas ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nwe called to make a reservation for 4:30 pm on Sunday evening \nshe responded 5:00 would be the earliest they have a table available, so we showed up a little early like 4:50 pm and there is absolutely no cars in the parking lot I mean nothing, just empty \nso we thought they are closed or moved to another location after looking for the front door we realized they were open, they just didn't have any customers \nwe were scared to walk in but we did, what a mistake\nso please don't believe the positive reviews or photos on yelp for this place as they don't match but all the one-star reviews are accurate to the \"t\"  now I can see some reviews from others as well that matches our experience, \n\nI normally don't like to leave a negative review but they deserve it, we really had a bad experience and I hope this will help other readers  \n\nby the way, we contacted the group on regarding this establishment  \nand they gave us our money back :) in form of credit to use on our future purchase\n\nSo I compared their prices to the other Brazilian Steakhouses around town and looks like they all charge very similar rates +\/- $40.00 - $45.00 per person \nwith a big difference, they don't charge 18% - 20% tip on top of your total and taxes \nI still can't believe she charged $27.00 in tips over our total including tax \nshe was the only one working there answering the phone and only attended to our table once \nand when it comes to service, food, and location there is no comparison\nPlease use Texa de Brazil in a town square \nor \nViva the Brazil on the west side
