Good happy hour.  Huge selection of martinis, along with a variety of apps, light meals, and a few desserts.  The martinis (normally $12 - $14 on the menu) are half-price during happy hour, although just so you know, they are all $7 which is not technically half price, depending which ones you order.  Still, this is a really good deal.  The martinis are served with the shaker and you really get about a martini and a half's worth.  \n\nThe food is also half price during happy hour.  The fruit and cheese plate was delicious -- huge portion of cheeses.  We ended up needing two refills of crackers.  The spinach and artichoke dip, served with pita triangles, was nothing special.  It was kind of soupy.  So I'd say go with the fruit and cheese plate, and order extra crackers to begin with.    \n\nMy first martini, the key lime, was not great.  It was half-filled with whipped cream, which I had to scoop out.  The martini itself isn't very lime-y and would have been better with vanilla vodka rather than plain.  I ordered the blue martini next, but honestly it was so disgusting I had to send it back.  \n\nThe service started out okay but got pretty pitiful as the place got more crowded.We sat on the patio, which was peaceful and nice but  I really wish they didn't allow cigars :(   Even with the fans going, you still get hit with a strong whiff if anyone is smoking one.  \n\nThe inside is  large, with several rooms and a huge bar area.  They have live music every night.  Very cool.  It's definitely an older crowd, which is kind of nice because it's more mellow. Even though I wasn't crazy about my martinis, I'd gladly go back for another happy hour and try some of the others.
