We had been wanting to go to the Block & Grinder since it opened and we heard some great things.  Overall the food was 4-5 stars, but the atmosphere and service was 2 stars.\n\nIn terms of service, we sat down in a cramped space next to a large table, and did not have a waiter assigned to us.  After 12 minutes, we finally had a waiter (who was very nice) notice that no one was assigned to us.  From there, he took over, but he also had other large tables, so the service was slow.\n\nOn to the positive aspects....for an appetizer, we got the jar of pimento cheese and crackers, which was delicious, and probably the best pimento cheese we have had in our short time being exposed to pimento cheese.  We decided to order the ribs for an entree, which was a great choice.  They were lean and tender, and rank up there as one of the best ribs we have ever had.\n\nI think we would come back here, but would attempt to go on a weeknight (or off-peak time), which would hopefully improve the service.  I would also love to try the cocktails.
