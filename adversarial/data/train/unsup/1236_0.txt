I've been there on two occasions - awhile back to check out their happy hour and another time to grab some lunch with some visiting friends.\n\nTheir happy hour didn't offer much in terms of food, mostly just alcohol.  (Which I guess is a good thing, depending on what you're looking for.)  We shared the Kahlua Pork Sliders (braised in plum sauce on Hawaiian sweet rolls) and they were okay, nothing special.  They tasted more like a char siu bao than Kahlua pork if that makes any sense to you.  The drinks we ordered ended up not being part of their happy hour special, we were disappointed when we saw the bill.  (Shouldn't they tell you what's included when you ask?)\n\nThe second time I went, I had the Hawaiian Poke for $11.50.  (Duo of Ahi and Hamachi Garnished with Avocado and Taro Chips.)  It was pretty good and a light meal.  My friends seem satisfied with their various dishes: Thai Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Wok Hay Shu ($17.95) and their Thai Red Curry with Tofu ($17.95).  They also had a couple of drinks too that they enjoyed, although they didn't think there was much alcohol in them.\n\nService was just okay both times I went.  Happy hour service was just average since the bartender mostly helped us as we were sitting at the bar.  It took awhile for our orders to be taken and the check to come when we came for lunch on that Friday afternoon.  (They had just opened, so you'd think they would be on top of it all.)\n\nOverall, Trader Vic's isn't the kind of place I would normally choose to eat at.  Their prime location overlooking the strip is what makes you want to grab a drink and hang out by the edge for some great people-watching.  But other than that, it's okay in the food department and depending on who is making your drink, it can be better.  \n\n(And can someone please tell me how to find the menu part on their website!  It's missing! Blah!)\n\n(Pics posted!)
