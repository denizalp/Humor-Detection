I've never been a fan of the whole \"buying in bulk\" thing...until I planned a self catered wedding.\n\nMy mom has a Sam's Club membership, and she, my fiance, and I went to Sam's last night to pick up the bulk items for our lunch wedding\/taco bar. \n\nFirst of all, this Sam's has a huge selection of food, alcohol, meat, cheese, and veggies...and all at incredible prices.  \n\nWe had EXCELLENT service in the meat department:  Custom cutting 21 pounds of angus flap meat excellent.  Searching for 15 pounds of chicken excellent.  This kid was on it, and SO nice!  I wish I would have gotten his name. \n\nLets talk price: \n21 pounds of steak, 15 pounds of chicken.  300 tortillas. Enough Cheese, sour cream, orange juice, salsa, and salad dressing to feed 80 people.  Tin foil and prep trays.  Wine, and cereal for mom.  $300.  \n\nHow incredible is that? \n\nWe'll be getting our own Sam's membership soon, so that we can continue to take advantage of the incredible sales and deals.
