We were headed to Bloor West Village\/High Park last week to buy some paper at the scrapbooking store, so decided to try out a few venues while were were there. \nThe boy was in The mood for wings, so we had already checked out the options on-line. we had narrowed it down to the Yellow Griffin, or Shakeys. \nThe atmosphere at the Yellow Griffin was super \"pub-by\" when we walked in, so we decided to stay there. \nThe main staple on their menu is their burgers. They have two pages of different topping combinations to choose from, with a list of different meats (and veggies) to form your burger. Apparently all the burger orders take 20 mins (a great ploy to get you to drink more!). \nI went for the \"Calypso\" burger, with avocado, cheese and mango. \nIt wasn't worth the wait. The meat was over cooked, and the avocado and mango had no flavour. The boy did get wings, which he said were \"ok\". \nThe beer was good though, so i would definitely go back for a drink!
