Huge and delicous homemade tamales can be purchased here for $1.50 each. This Lil mom and pop shop is located on Sahara and Nellis. Cash only, no cards here.\n\nThe menu is fairly basic, offering pork, chicken and cheese tamales as well as sweet corn and pineapple. They have red, green and mole sauces. As of 6\/10 they had shrimp tamales too.\n\nApparently they don't always have their full menu. I am not sure if they run out or what but it's best to go early. My friend went in on a Friday afternoon and placed an order of what we wanted, then picked them up and paid a few hours later. I ordered 2 jalapeño and cheese, 2 red pork, and 2 sweet corn and pineapple tamales. It was $9 for 6 HUGE tamales with plentiful fillings. You cannot beat this deal. \n\nMy friend got a couple mole and chicken tamales that I got to taste and it was so yummy. I love mole sauce and hadn't seen it offered in a tamale before, but what a great idea. I do have to say my favorite was the sweet corn and pineapple though. It was sweet and sinful like I was eating a dessert. The jalapeño and cheese were delicious but holy crap those are spicy. I had heartburn for hours after, but it was so worth it. I let my man eat the pork ones and he loved them. Probably the best tamales I've had in Vegas.
