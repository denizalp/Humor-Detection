I like the Abercrombie & Fitch in the Caesar's Forum shops and usually visit this store when I come to the Forum shops. \n\nThis past trip, I bought a sweater and a little dress both on sale. Even without the sale prices, the prices seemed more reasonable than they have been over the past couple years... I remember I used to shop here a LOT in high school when the prices were much less and A & F was more my style...\n\nThe whole store smells like their cologne and leaves everyone who walks in smelling like it too. I guess that's their version of the McD's grease smell to lure you in?!
