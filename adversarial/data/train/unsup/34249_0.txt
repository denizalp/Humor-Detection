I went to Fry's to buy a printer. I came in with a short list of four top-rated printers.  Of the four they do not sell the best-rated Epson WF-3620 at all. The other printers were not in stock either. The one I was most interested in was the Canon MX922 which they sell for $180- again not in stock. I found one on eBay for $109 and asked Frys if they would price match this item (as they claim to match Internet Prices) and was told no because it wasn't from an \"authorized reseller\". So their claim that they match Internet Prices is basically untrue because it has so many caveats. If they keep this up, they will go the way of Radio Shack...
