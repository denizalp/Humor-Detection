Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at the Tamarind on Greentree Rd. south of Pittsburgh.  I'll be the first to admit that I've never traveled to India, so I'm not qualified to judge whether this is authentic Indian cooking or not, but I do know delicious, tasty, fresh, well prepared food when it is served to me.  And this restaurant puts out some delicious food.  We had some appetizer sampler platters (both a vegetarian & non-vegetarian), as well as a curry dish, a biryani dish, a saag dish, and one other vegetarian dish.  All of the food was wonderful, bursting with fresh flavors.  We do not get Indian food very often, so it's a real treat when we do, and this place made it extra special.  All 4 of us enjoyed everything that we had.  Overall, it's a great place to go, and I'd highly recommend it.  When we dine out, I'm looking usually looking for really good food, good service & a nice ambiance, and that is the order of importance for us.  I can live with mediocre service & no ambiance, so long as the food is good.  But bad food cannot be compensated by service & ambiance.  This restaurant had really good food, and good service.  The ambiance is the weakest card in the deck for them, but it's a restaurant in a strip mall, and the food was so good, we'll be back there again any chance we get.
