Christopher and Bob were awesome! I liked the friendly banter since I'm a smart ass myself. Thank you for the great service and delicious food. \n\nThe Pan Roast lived up to the hype and so did the shrimp and lobster etouffee. And we only waited 30 min! Because we got there at 9AM. Breakfast of CHAMPS yo! The delectable sauce is made with brandy, cream and some kind of crack. I'm kidding, but you get the idea. They serve it with rolls and you dig in like a wild animal that hadn't been fed in a week.\n\nWhat we had:  Étouffée with shrimp, lobster and crab and the Palace Pan Roast with Shrimp, Crab and Lobster.\n\nBob whipped out all of our meals in record time, all while wise-cracking with all the diners feasted happily. I will gladly return to try the oysters and other fare. But ONLY at 9AM ;)
