Everything is organized by COLOR! Makes shopping a breeeeeeeze, since I have a pretty defined color palette. This is a bit more of a curated thrift store than St. Vinny's, Savers, etc.--you won't find a lot of broken or dirty items, so prices are a bit higher, but last time I went in I snagged a beautiful wool coat for $9.99, so it's still very much in the standard thrift store price range.
