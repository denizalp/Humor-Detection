Went here New Years day. Happy it was open but very disapointed with my wrap. Ceasar chicken Wrap was too crispy no chicken and the taste was not there . just bad very bad. Service was ok did not ask me for a refill drink only asked my fiancee.Stick with Smoke Meat if you go might be disapointed exploring anything else. Not impressed.
