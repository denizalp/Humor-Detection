I would NEVER recommend anyone staying here. You get what you pay for, reasonably priced, for a reasonably accommodating hotel. That was not my problem. I dont mind paying less and having less because that is expected. We weren't planning on staying the hotel all that much anyways so we didn't see the point in staying at an overpriced hotel. The problem was in the middle of the night, someone broke into our room and stole some of our possessions (about $1500 worth). We didn't feel safe there anymore. I have tried contacting the hotel to get this sorted out, but we can't seem to get a hold of anyone that can help us. Like I said, I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL FOR ANYONE. Unless you like getting robbed while you are sleeping in the room, this could pose dangerous for people staying there. \n\nKeep in mind, I am a reasonable person. I do understand that issues arise, and with proper handling of the situation, this could have been a less dissatisfied review, but we called the hotel (risk management) as they told us to do, left about 6 messages and haven't received one call back. This was about a month ago.
