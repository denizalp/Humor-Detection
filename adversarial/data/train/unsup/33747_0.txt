Starts out bad, Major Douchebag doorman, Who couldn't tell me from my Asian friend (I'm white by the way).  Then when I kinda laughed at him, he told me, \"With an attitude like that, you'll be in line all night.\"  I don't think so doorman, Doorman!  Once inside & escorted to our table by Ivan, my attitude changed because this place rules!!!    I came here with four girlfriends for our annual girl Vegas trip, and we had the best time.  Our table location was BOMB & the music was great too.  We didn't even bother going inside to dance at any time, b\/c being outside looking up at the sky partying rules!!  Aside from the loser doorman, who seriously would make me hesitate to come back b\/c comes on, there are so many places to party in Vegas without being scolded by some asshole, especially when you're paying a nice chunk of change to have a good night.  Rudeness will get you NO WHERE!
