I'm not a big sushi eater, but what I ate was delicious!  Got the california rolls (yes, I am not adventurous) and shrimp tempura. Yummmmm.  This place is kinda pricey, and this is the first time I've ever paid $5 for \"japanese long-grain rice\".  It's ok though, I was on vacation, so it was ok to splurge. I also had the tastiest lychee martini, complete with a liquor soaked lychee at the bottom!  \n\nI also heard some amazing house music being played here while we ate our dinner.  Probably the best I heard all weekend.
