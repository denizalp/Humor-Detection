Boar's Head Deli meat is where it's at!  That's the first thing I do is go to those order terminals next to the deli.  Chose my meat or cheese, amount, and size of thickness through the order screen (I'm on the Boars Cracked Pepper Milled Smoked Turkey thick slices).  After my submission a ticket will print out a number and a eta time will appear on the screen.  Usually about 5min wait time.\n\nBoars Head Nutrient Book right hur: http:\/\/www.boarshead.com\/pdf\/NutritionBook_Web_04_2012.pdf\n\nWhile that get going I'll either head over to the produces section or butcher's arena.  \nOne of today special was 2 head of cauliflower for $3.  There's always some blowout deal going on daily, so check frequently for must go fruits and vegs.  Just make sure you give it a really good, honest inspection before placing it in your cart.\n\nI've also picked up a Cajun chicken breast for $1.99 a breast which conclude a healthy, valued meal under $5 with veggies to spare for my NY Steak i selected at 11.99\/lb.   Everything is at a reasonable price, and clearly safe to say that the meat processing area is suitable for any handling of raw meat and fishes.  It's all performed out in the open!\n\nIf you don't have 30min to spare to cook everything yourself they also have an abundant of prepped food and sides in to-go containers made daily.   I never tried, but they look very tempting. Everytime!  \n\nThis is one of my go-to neighborhood store, that's not even in my hood.  I ride around  and i get it.\n\nNote: Free A\/C!
