This place *looks* like a nice hotel, but is full of what we called \"shitty little touches\" that belie the real story. All facade.\n\nOur bathmat had cigarette burns in it. There was candle wax dripped all over our table that no one had cleaned off. The \"luxurious\" spa menu was wet from the last guests in the room. Lotion in the shower instead of hair conditioner. (Found that out the hard way.)\n\nAnd my personal highlight? Raw sewage burbling up through the marble sink all morning yesterday. Yep. My suite literally smelled like shit and it was too late to do anything about it or move since we were packing up to leave. We just had to deal. Disgusting. And no, the front desk did nothing about it to make me feel better when we told them.
