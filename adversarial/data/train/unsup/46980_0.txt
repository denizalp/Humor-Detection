Fry's pharmacy continuously experiences \"computer problems\" resulting in slow\/no service. There are times when they can't even fulfill prescriptions because of this recurring issue. Get your food here, NOT your medications.  Yes, I know. Most pharmacies are slow as molasses, but this one should get an award for being so slow and incompetent. Let' start: \n\nTheir pharmacy people are super-nice and friendly, sort of like meandering cattle and just as useful. My hats off to them for coming up with all kinds of creative and polite ways of saying, \"Computer is offline, come back later\".  I know the technical issues aren't their fault, but apparently they have no shame working for an incompetent employer.\n\nSometimes they will just ask you to wait \"a few minutes\" and try the computer again. That turns into 15 minutes... or in my case 72 hours.\n\nNo excuse for this other than bad Fry's management and pure ignorance. I went to Frys THREE DAYS before surgery to make sure that everything is in order (insurance, meds, etc) because I knew AFTER surgery, I would be in severe pain. SO... Went in on Monday to set things up. \"Computer problems.... Come back tomorrow....\" SO they collected my info on post-it note and attached it to the computer. Came back the next day and my sticky note was still there.... \"Come back Wednesday \"they said (they day of my surgery). \n\nWell, it's Wednesday. My prescription was called in and it was supposed to be ready to pick up by 8am. Computer down.  \"Come back at noon\". It's 3:15 PM. I am in more pain now than I have ever been in my life and I hate Fry's with the same level of intensity. I'm STILL waiting for them to call me back.\n\nI will NEVER shop at Fry's for food or anything else for as long as I live. I will repeat this story to anyone who tells me they are taking medication.
