We searched\/contacted\/vetted numerous casinos and venues on and off the strip to find what worked best for us: Wedgewood was the answer. \n\nMy mom was visiting and first found Wedgewood on Yelp, we called and had an initial discussion with Lindsey who made us (and the groom) very excited about the whole process. We had considered almost every property on the strip and a few off, and never felt completely satisfied with our options and the information we were given (I refuse to pay $70 for a gallon of coffee). Wedgewood gave us and our guests an incredible party with lots of memories! \n\n\nCeremony: \nThe ceremony was simple (55 guests, but they could easily accomodate many more). We also had our rehearsal the same day due to scheduling, which actually worked out fine since we married on a weekday.\n\nReception: \nFor the reception, we tried to take as many photos with Stephen and Janelle as possible before the actual ceremony, so we wouldn't miss out on the cocktail hour. They were happy to answer any questions and help us make sure we covered all angles. \n\nThe bartender kept everyone happy with drinks, really awesome. \n\nWe brought in our own musicians (in addition to DJ Murphy who helped make sure we didn't miss any important steps). For example, the bass player arrived early and DJ Murphy took time out of his work to help our friend know where he needed to set up. The DJ is awesome, loves his job, and took time to ask all the questions we didn't even consider. Lindsey, Jacquelyn and the whole Wedgewood team (vendors included here) helped make every moment an easy transition and offered ideas when we needed them. \n\n\nPros (some of many):\n-Wedding\/Reception in the same venue (i.e., less costly for out of town guests)\n-Ease of service- planning did not stress us out and we had fun throughout the entire process \n-Photos (we went with Wedgewood's preferred vendor- awesome!)- you have complete control of all photos (not just 7 as some of the casinos offer)\n-Beautiful landscape with the mountains in the backdrop\n-Friendly, personable staff who made us feel like a client 110% of the time. No question was too bizarre -- even after the final payment was made, which is the way it should be. \n-Creative license allowed, and the staff help bring your ideas alike\n-Good food, enough drinks to make everyone feel happy\n-Laughter, there were no dull moments. DJ Murphy is amazing when it comes to being an MC. \n\n\nCons:\nWe wished it lasted longer! We had guests tell us that the 5 hours felt too short (what a good problem to have)!\n\n\n\nThank you Wedgewood for such a beautiful, and supportive team! You helped make our once in a life time event easy and truly memorable!!
