Loved the cute and communal atmosphere, disappointed in the coffee. \n\nArrived around 10 am on a Friday and the place was hopping. Every single seat was taken and it was raining outside, so the outdoor patio was a no-go. Like an idiot, I ordered my coffee to stay and then had to stand and drink it in the back of the shop.\n\nThe staff was aloof and cold and not exactly welcoming to an obvious out of towner. It's not the most friendly of places, but maybe they were just having an \"off\" day due to the yucky weather. \n\nThere was a general sense of chaos and unpleasantness behind the counter. Since it was so crowded and the baristas were on the slower side, there was a huge bottleneck of customers just standing around near the front register that made it difficult to order and to move about. \n\nI ordered a cappuccino and it was just okay, with a slightly burned and over-roasted flavor to the beans. I had to add chocolate powder to top it off to try to mask the taste (The Horror! The Horror!)! Maybe Phoenix residents don't know what a good coffee is, but this wasn't it. \n\nI hate to rag on a local business, but I don't want any first wave \/ hipster coffee lovers to waste their time because you will be disappointed. I certainly was.
