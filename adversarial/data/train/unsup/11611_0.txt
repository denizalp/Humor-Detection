Love Lola Rosa, and this location is my favorite of the two locations because it's much bigger and the atmosphere is superb (good for groups. Good for dates. Good for hanging out with a friend or two). The menu is a little different from Lola Rosa Milton and I prefer it (I mean... chick pea fries with vegan aioli. *Mic drop*). \n\nWhen I'm traveling and feel like I love restaurant, I go often (see: Aux Vivres). I hit up Lola Rosa Parc two times because the food is really good and their wine list is lengthier (including a sparkling). And yes, everyone talks about the nachos. They are *that* divine, but there's a whole lot of other wonderful things here (those fries! I die!) and their veg burgers (there's a hemp burger and often a second special. Among the world veggie burger hall of famers! Get this if you're really hungry. It comes with the chick pea fries). The only thing I don't recommend is the tagine, because I found the flavor to be bland and I really didn't like the flavor and consistency of the seitan (odd because the seitan in the tacos at Lola Rosa Milton is phenomenal!) \n\nFinally, there are vegan desserts, people. Extremely rich, decadent vegan desserts. Also GF options that I can't speak to but I always notice that they are there.\n\nSimilar to Lola Rosa Milton, service here is really just so very nice and lovely. We knew we had to try the vegan chocolate cake when our server dropped an F bomb to describe how incredible it is. This foul-mouthed New Yorker always appreciates a well-dropped F bomb.
