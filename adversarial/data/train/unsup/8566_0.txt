I stayed here on a combination 80th-and-21st birthday trip for my grandma and sister, respectively, and it was my first Vegas trip. Before I say anything, let me just say this entire building is breathtakingly beautiful... and it's barely 20 years old! Not only is the outside already iconic, but the inside truly looks like the streets of Paris. The paintings on the walls are so detailed and elaborate, and the little buildings in the shops area connecting to Bally's truly make for a European feel. And that's just the lobby and main floor! \n\nFull disclosure, a friend of mine from high school used to work here and informed the front desk before we got there, so when we arrived, my sister and grandma each received little cakes as a birthday treat, and the lady behind the front desk gave us a room overlooking the pool, Eiffel Tower, and Bellagio fountains. This made for an especially impressive nighttime view, and a great sanctuary for moments when we needed a break from the heat but still wanted to overlook the Strip. The beds were clean, and the size of the room was so impressive, especially since there were four of us. \n\nMy personal favorite part of the Paris, however, was the pool. Being right in the middle of the strip, we were in the middle of the madness, but the atmosphere here is just my style. I know a lot of pools in Vegas are known for being party pools with big DJs and such, but the Paris only does this on specific nights, so it was fairly calm -- that's more my style -- and even when it was very busy, there was plenty of room in the water for people to frolick about or sit on the edges with their cocktails. \n\nStaying at the Paris was a great first Vegas experience, and I know my little sister really felt special for her 21st birthday.
