Walking in this place, I was in love with their decor from the neon signs to the pineapple wall. It is a bit more upscale than I expected. I sat outside at the bar. The menu is innovative with brussel sprouts nachos, which had two kinds of cheeses. The nachos had tortilla chips as well but I went back and forth between those and the brussel sprouts for good measure (and health)! They also had a list of amazing tacos, which you can get with handmade flour or corn tortillas. \n\nI liked this place, but honestly, it's the only place (restaurant, bar, brewery) I went to on my weeklong trip to Arizona where I didn't talk to a single person. The people who come here reminded me of the Orange County (California) bunch at home.
