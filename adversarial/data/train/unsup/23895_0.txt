I don't know if I should be concerned about the fact that this is now my third review in a row about a dessert place (do I have a problem?), but I'm going to go with it. I was recently up in the McKnightmare Road area and stopped by here for a little post-shopping fro yo. This shop is clean and has a wide selection of yogurt flavors (I think at least 8 or so?) And most importantly, there are TONS of topping choices (because what is froyo after all if not just a vehicle for copious amounts of toppings?) So as far as froyo places go, it's definitely solid.\n\nThere are, however, a hilarious number of rules here. I wish I had taken pictures because it's almost comical how many signs are posted around the shop detailing all of the \"Do's and Don'ts\" of froyo-ing. \"One spoon per person.\" \"If you eat from the toppings bar, you'll be charged.\" \"Ask at the front if you want a sample.\" Side note about that last rule...it's super annoying! If you want to try something, you have to ask the cashier, and they won't just give you a sample cup, but they will physically come over and dole out the smallest, saddest amount of froyo for you to try. And if it's busy, forget it! It'll take a small lifetime to get your sample. I don't know if the managers of this joint have been burned by greedy over-samplers in the past, but how much money can they really be saving by doing it this way? Seems like way more trouble than it's worth (or maybe that's the point....it's so annoying and time-consuming to ask for a sample that most people won't bother to do it. Well played, cheap and clever Sincerely Yogurt owners).   \n\nAnyway, so I'm taking off a star for their ridiculous Soup Nazi-esque rules. But other than that, it's a decent froyo place.
