What's up with these tiny portions?! \n\nI've come here before but I didn't remember it so I decided to try it again. I got a $10 veggie plate and it was hardly any food in there! I got a lunch special and most soul food places give you a sweet tea but there was no drink included. They didn't even fill the plate and have the nerve to charge the same as other soul food places! I got the mac and cheese, cabbage and yams. The yams tasted like they were fresh out of the can and the mac and cheese had this weird flavor. The cabbage was alright but it wasn't enough. And cabbage does not save the whole meal. I also got the banana pudding and peach cobbler and both were bad. The banana pudding tasted like nothing but jell-o instant and the cobbler was greasy. They were $5 each for the tiniest of bowls. \n\nI remember when I came here before there were a lot of people. When I went this time I was the only customer in there. I don't know why businesses have a good thing then mess it up. \n\nI would never return!
