My husband and I visited when they very first opened. I wanted to try it another time before posting a review. During their opening they were raffling off a tv. I was really hoping I'd be drawn as the winner, but alas, I didn't end up getting the winning call. \n\nIt's a clean space, nice tables. They did a nice job decorating and tinting the windows. They even have a couple fragrant candles going right when you enter. It's a warm and cozy touch. If you are like me and wash your hands before every meal, they have an extra sink outside of the bathrooms...convenient!\n\nThe Singaporean noodles and Pad Thai were okay and a tad on the dry side during our first visit. However, they must have practiced making those a few extra times since then because when we ordered those dishes again, they were very good. Yes, yes, I know this is a Vietnamese place and we ended up ordering non-Vietnamese dishes...those noodle dishes were calling my name! Next time I promise to try the veggie pho. They also make a very spicy garlic chili sauce! Mmmm, your mouth and lips will be on fire. The servers came around quickly to refill our waters and laughed as we dabbed our foreheads with the napkins.\n\nNice addition to South Blvd! I like that I can choose from 3 different Vietnamese places all within a mile or so of one another. Variety is the spice to life, right?!
