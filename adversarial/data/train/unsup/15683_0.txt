With Red Rock in our backyards, there's no excuse not to go regularly. White Rock Loop is the most recent trail I've checked out and the difficulty rating is probably fairly accurate if you do the entire loop. \n\nPark at the first paved lot and walk to the trailhead, and take the one to the RIGHT (you'll return on the left). The trail is fairly well marked and has decent elevation gain, along with a variety of terrain from sandy and rocky to a more forested part of the trail around La Madre Spring- you can add on this steeper, rocky portion to amp up your calorie burn. The regular trail is a little over 6 miles, but with the walk to\/from parking, the springs, and checking out the petroglyphs and agave roasting pit area (by the picnic area), the pedometer clocked closer to 9. \n\nThe trail is easy enough but the while distance might be a bit much for kids or some dogs. Great views but lots of sun, so take a hat and sunscreen along with your water!
