It's rare to dine at a restaurant that truly is run like a well oiled machine. Everyone we encountered was genuine and embodied the true spirit of hospitality. Our server Ken was very well versed and provided truly friendly service our entire meal. He even had a nice dessert for my fianc√© put together that was very well received.  One of the young ladies bussing, Shaniqua was very sweet and attentive.  It truly felt that everyone we met was nice. The Restaurant Manager Sarah was also a delight to meet and speak with.  We had multiple quality conversations with her and our love for the restaurant only grew.  She has a great attitude and it's very clear that she knows how to run a restaurant; food is a huge factor but hiring and maintaining quality staff is key. It was refreshing to witness such a high level of professionalism with everyone and of course the menu delivered a unique experience we will without a doubt return to very soon.
