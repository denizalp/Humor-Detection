Great experience here! We planned our wedding in a month and were stressing on finding our dresses but this place had exactly what we wanted. I was worried that they wouldn't have my size but they have up to size 28 with several styles in stock. The staff was very helpful with suggestions and assisting with trying the dresses on. The prices were great. I found the dress right away and they made it even better with their accessories available. I loved it.
