I was raised in a family that supported the arts financially and attending events.  Either it be the orchestra, operas or the ballet, I attended many when I was a child.  And I learned very early on the proper etiquette when attending these events, including when to clap and how to dress.\n\nAt every single Ballet Arizona performance I have been to, I see people dressed in \"business casual\" and people clapping at inappropriate times.  I am extremely disappointed in the attendees and patronage, I am disappointed in Ballet Arizona not providing materials to educate people in proper etiquette.  I am also disappointed in Ballet Arizona not maintaining a strict dress code.  I literally saw a person walk in with a golf shirt and jeans.  If restaurants can have a dress code, why not the ballet?  It would be less of a stretch for the ballet to have a dress code than not having one at all.  Men should wear, at the bare minimum, a jacket and tie and women wear a cocktail dress.\n\nAnd finally, the behavior of children there is unacceptable and so is the Ballet's response to said poor behavior.  I am disappointed that Ballet Arizona did nothing to curb histrionics and outbursts.  The Company did not stop them from dancing in walkways.
