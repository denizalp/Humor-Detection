This is one of the older theaters in the Summerlin\/Summerlin adjacent area. Sure, Red Rock has the more stadium-style seating and the lively casino environment. Downtown Summerlin has the comfortable seats and alcohol. So why go to Village Square?\n\n1. You get to avoid bigger crowds\n2. A lot of limited-release movies get played here, as well as the bigger blockbusters\n3. There are a lot of great restaurants around and ample parking\n4. For an older theater, seats are still pretty comfortable\n5. When those other theaters only have 3D showings remaining, there are more non-3D showings here \n\nBuyer Beware: The box office line can get lengthy sometimes, so I'd sprint from your car to beat out the competition.
