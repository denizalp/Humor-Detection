What an absolutely fun experience!  I can't wait to come back and bring some friends.  I must admit that there was very little yoga, but playing with the baby goats easily made up for that fact.  I got some great pictures...and snuggles too with the goats.  The two ladies that run it are so welcoming and fun, the goats are so well trained and festively dressed too...definitely a must do activity in the Phoenix area even if you aren't a yogi.
