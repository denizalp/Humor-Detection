4.5* (half a star for the cheapness) . \nbetter (much much muchhh x100000 better) than pizza pizza . \n\nive had my first ever slice(s) from papa ceo's yesterday . after studying for hours at the depressing gray concrete walled school library where EVERYONE look like they want to start crying, this was the best study break comfort food i could possibly get .\n\nthese are HUMONGO pizza slices EVER . one slice is a quarter of the whole pizza . for $4 flat, i got TWO slices (the fancier slices), which means i got HALF of the pizza for $4 . do they usually give you 2 slices when you order one slice ? or did they just give me an extra slice ? :)\n\ni got mambo (i did, however, stand there for a while debating b\/w robert deniro & mambo) & why havent i known that spinach is absolutely delicious on pizza ? why was yesterday my first time here, what took me so long even tho i pass by it pretty often ? \n\nif you want cheap, huge, delicious pizza, go to papa ceo's . im craving for it as i type . i havent tried cora the next door yet so i need to go there next, but for next next time, i cant wait to come back & try the robert deniro or al pacino . or rambo . i dunno . maybe i'll get all 3 . :))
