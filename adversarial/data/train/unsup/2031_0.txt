I have always been a fan of Yoga Passage.\n\nWhen I practice here, I learn something with every class. The nuggets of advice sprinkled throughout the classes at Yoga Passage tend to stick with me and improve my practice overall; things like \"still hands means a still mind\"; \"acknowledge and observe your thoughts as they come, then accept them and move on\"; etc. This also seems to be the only studio where in shavasana, I can relax my eyeballs...\n\nI like that the practices focus on both the mental and physical aspects of yoga. Of course, one cannot squeeze all yoga philosophies into a 75 minute class; but I find if you go enough, you will learn a little more each time. \n\nThe studio is clean, it's staff friendly and the classes an good mix of challenging and relaxing. Each class offers alternates to the poses so you can push yourself further, making the practice as beginner or advanced as you like.\n\nYoga Passage looses a star because the meaning of \"hot\" in the hot yoga classes varies widely. I have been in hot classes that are everything from almost unbearably hot to just this side warm. This disparity seems to have no pattern. There is no common instructor or time of day that correspond to a certain temperature; so my advice would be to perhaps purchase a better thermometer for the hot room, decide on a temperature, and stick to it.\n\nTemperature disparities aside, I always come out of Yoga Passage feeling refreshed and revived.\n\nT.
