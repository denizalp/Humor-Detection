Interest rates are terrible, total rip off and they misquote your credit file to charge more interest. I switched to Capital One and my Interest rate cut in half. Monthly payments are significantly lower. The reason I went with them is that Wells Fargo is the only company the car dealer used. They are a horrible finance institution.
