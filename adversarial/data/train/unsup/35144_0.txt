Yo. This food is amazing! I meant to take a picture but I started eating it once I got home. I literally turned Netflix on and went in! Lol. I ordered the 12 rolled tacos for my kids...thinking they were going to be skimpy and they would need to eat 6 each. These were very nice sized and my kids left 6 in the box. The chicken was so good inside the taquitos! I'm weary with a lot of Mexican food places and their chicken. It always tastes weird but this was on point!!! So I ordered the carnitas chimichanga. When I tell you I got through 1\/3 of this thing before I felt like I was gonna pass out. This thing is HUGE!!!!!!  It is fillllllllllllllled with carnitas and beans and cheese...but mostly carnitas! HOOOOOOMYYYYYGAWD so good!!!!!!!!!  Please be aware... when I tell you its huge....its HUGE! So be prepared. I also ordered fries...and I shouldn't have but they were good too. Overall I spent about 30.00 but obviously this was worth it because I'm gonna pop that chimichanga in the toaster oven tomorrow for my lunch and be in heaven all over again. I met the Jefe, Ben, tonight and what a cool dude! I got a free drink because it was my first visit! The female cook and the younger guy at the register were soooooo nice and accommodating. Even though I live in Summerlin I'll definitely be back!
