I mean, they tried. I think. \nWith tasteless guacamole, wimpy fish tacos and a watery gin & tonic (sorry, not a margarita gal), the $25+ bill for this sad display was laughable but perfectly typical of an overpriced, underwhelming airport meal. Throw in some gruff service and my three time request for water, and I was happy to get out of there and hop on my connecting flight back to Connecticut. \nIf I have another future layover in the Charlotte airport, I'll stick to fast food. At least then I know what to expect.
