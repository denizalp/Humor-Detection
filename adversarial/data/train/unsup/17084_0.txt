After visiting Optic Gallery and speaking with colleagues from work, I realized the ridiculous amount I spent in services. The African-American lady who sales the frames was unpleased when I told her I had a budget.. Of course I have a budget, I'm a 21 year old paying for my college.. I left without buying anything. \nI would advise anyone to do research before visiting Optic Gallery. There are more reasonable centers only a street or two away.
