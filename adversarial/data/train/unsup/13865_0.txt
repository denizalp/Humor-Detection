I hate their high pressure sales tactics. All the bad things that people think about when they think \"used car dealer\" this is pretty much it. We were in the market for either a used car with very low miles or a new car, and we told them our budget, and not a penny more. The salesman told us about a used Veloster, and we asked the price. He said he didn't know and had to ask his manager. We told the manager the price we could work with and don't waste either of our time if the price is higher. He came back, told us the price, which was higher, but that it was negotiable, so we understood that what our budget was could be doable for them. However, the manager had to go and speak with his manager about it.\n\nTwenty minutes later.....\n\nHe comes back with a piece of paper, and the price is lower by get this...$200! WTF. Not only that, but they tacked on about $900 in \"add ons\", custom rims, blah blah blah. I'm sorry, but you guys are selling a used car. All those extras that got tacked on when the first person bought it brand new shouldn't be added on again. You guys bought the car with those things on them already. It's not like you added them on there. I guess they know those add ons are such BS bc they took those off right then and there. But still we reminded them of our budget and not to waste both of our time. Now the manager asks us what are we trying to prove, like what? We walked out and of course, they run after us and tell us they will talk to the other manager. Stupid us we wait more and same crap again. Walk out again, and the original sales guy comes running after us. We straight up told him we don't like how they do business and took off. With so many dealerships doing low pressure and up front pricing, I'm surprised there are still dealerships like this left.\n\nBTW we ended up buying a new car from ABC Hyundai.
