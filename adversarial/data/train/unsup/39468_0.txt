Yay I love this place especially for Monday or Thursday night football. Awesome happy hour from 3-7 and a separate football specials menu. The table side guacamole is awesome as is the shrimp Jalisco Plato con nopales mmmmm!!!! \n\nI've also had the fish tacos which are grilled fish and are delicious. Ceviche is a favorite as well. \n\nService is always fast and friendly. Huge projector tv in the bar area. Rolando is a great server, my friend and I usually sit in the bar area and get great service. Friendly owner. The place is nonsmoking (yay!!) and they also have outdoor patio seating.
