Ok, so all I wanted was a clean quiet room, dinner, shower and some sleep. This is NOT the place for that. Yikes! Then the bathtub was clogged and wouldn't drain. They had music blasting at the pool area so loudly it shook the windows. When I asked if it could be turned down, I was informed that 10p was their \"quiet hour.\" The room had no menus for room service, I had to call down twice to get them. (I needed the dinner menu, and they sent breakfast - twice.) The shower ceiling has mold. The fire sprinklers look like they are rusted all the way though. The door to my bathroom had holes and missing paint. The toilet leaked water on the floor (at least I'm guessing that's where the water came from.) Oh! And let's not forget the parking where you have to walk a city block to get to your room - with no offer to help with bags. NOT what I needed after a long day. I will not be coming back - ever. Sorry to be negative, but I'd hate for anyone else to have to go through this again!
