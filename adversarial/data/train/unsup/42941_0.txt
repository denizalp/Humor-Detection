This is my second trip to this place (first time was lunch) and I was very pleased. I tried the corned beef and eggs per a recommendation on Yelp. It was not like any corned beef hash I have ever had. It was kinda like breakfast fajitas without the tortillas, super good! I am surprised this place isn't busier. They have a huge breakfast menu with all kinds of options, and their lunch is great too. Definitely check this local gem out!
