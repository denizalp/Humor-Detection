LOLOL!!!!!! of all the hotels to get stuck in in Vegas, we were stuck inside Imperial Palace. Don't get me wrong, as I've mentioned I love this place. We drove here and gambled and lost all of our money. So the first universal reaction is.. LETS GET THE FCK OUT OF HERE. Then the funniest thing happens. It was pouring rain outside and a little mini katrina happened and they prohibited everyone from leaving. It was basically a smack in the face \" oh you lost money? well you are stuck here so go in there and lose some more!\"\n\nSeriously, there is a limit. Imperial Palace may be slow to renovate their hotel physically to match the rest of the modernized Vegas but you guys have to at least improve the water drainage system for the safety of visitors right? There was literally no way out of that damned parking lot because a river filled with garbage was flooding the entire 1st floor. Luckily we were only trapped here for about an hour and slipped out when they suddenly decided to let folks out. It was quite a ride. It was like one of the rides in universal studios. As we drove out there was masses of water and debris beside us just flowing. \n\nI'm telling you, Imperial Palace is where ALL of the action is. Even the rainwater concentrate here.
