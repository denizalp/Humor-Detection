This part of the country mandates that a restaurant serving BBQ produce a quality product.  Otherwise, the owner is liable to get shot.  The standard is maintained even in the airport concession shops.  What I like most about this place isn't the BBQ which is good, but its the vegetables that sing out to me every time I pass this spot.  The veggies are fresh and cooked to perfection and oh so yummy.  \n\nThe service is quick and the food is hot. There are plenty of tables to sit and consume your food before hopping on that interminable flight back west.  Yet again I think I overdosed on the sweet tea.
