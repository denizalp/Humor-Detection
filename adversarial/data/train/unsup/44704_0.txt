I've been coming here for a while now and just wanted to update my review. I've never had better service than this place and I've been to a lot. I always get the cold shoulder but when I come here they're always inviting and willing to help me find new flavors. They're actually the reason I quit smoking. 2 thumbs up. Ask for drew and Sarah, you won't be disappointed.
