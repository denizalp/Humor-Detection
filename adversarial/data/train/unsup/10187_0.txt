YASSS!!  This was the best find of the night! We landed really late and were scouring the strip for food. We had to resist the urge to run in when we saw this ON THE STRIP. This location is really new and just opened a few days ago. \n\nI ordered a double double with grilled onions, animal style fries (gotta have that) and a Neapolitan shake. Delicious!  \n\nSorry Shake Shack, In-N-Out will always win in my book!
