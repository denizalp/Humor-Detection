I can't believe I hadn't been to this restaurant sooner. Lively crowd, tasty food, active bar, good music  - all in all a great place to hang out on a Friday night. Only problem - it seems to empty out around 11ish, a bit early in my opinion. \n\nThe Italian menu doesn't disappoint; the food is on par with several other good Italian restaurants in the city. Butternut squash crespelle appetizer is a must-have.
