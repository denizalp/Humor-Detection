Absolutely one of the best nail salons. Moved to Arizona a year and half ago and tried many different salons until I found this place. Made an appointment based on other Yelp reviews. My daughter and I love Mirage nail salon. Very talented, artistic, and extremely nice staff. Would highly recommend this place to all.
