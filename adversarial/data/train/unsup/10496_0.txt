I'm no pizza expert by any means but I have probably eaten hundreds, possibly thousands, of pizzas in my lifetime and this one definitely made an impression on me!\n\nMy friend and I have been in search of a good deep dish pizzas in the Phoenix area for quite some time now and one that embodies what Chicago style truly is. This pizza was really, really, really good. As I learned from Chicago pizza eating experts, the crust should be light, flaky and almost biscuit like. The crust did not have that texture. It was denser. The slices are indeed thick as expected.  It was my first time eating a pizza with the sauce over the cheese, and I was told, \"this is as it should be.\" It didn't matter to me how it should be though because I loved every bite of it! I don't care if it's in a not so great part of town! I am coming back for more and I am recommending it to people looking for extra good deep dish pizza!
