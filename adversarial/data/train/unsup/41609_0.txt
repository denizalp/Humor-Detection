Do not go here! I had an appt scheduled and after sitting there for almost 30 min (on my lunch break) I asked how much longer it would be and he said an hour! It would have been nice if he would have told me that upon arrival. So frustrated. Will not go back due to poor customer service. I was just there the day before for a pedi, so much for my repeat business. I also work on the street and will NOT suggest this place. The price is right but not the service.
