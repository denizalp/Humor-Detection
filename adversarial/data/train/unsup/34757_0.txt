My office staff of 24 ordered our food from Gadzooks today and I'm so impressed by their attention to detail for each individual order! One of the owners delivered our meals and he was nice enough to lay out each person's order with the name and receipt, as well as pairing them with a bag of chips and salsa of choice. A few of our people didn't specify what type of salsa they wanted, so the owner brought all three types!\nI must say their execution of our order was outstanding along with the food. We've gone out to Gadzooks before and service was excellent then, and this just shows excellence is in everything they do!
