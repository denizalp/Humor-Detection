I did not enjoy my sushi dinner here. Their sushi was poorly cut. The toro was not fresh and when i asked for a salmon belly cut i received a regular mid bod cut. We spent about $1,000.00 on dinner here between 4 people. And for that amount you'd think we really enjoyed our meal... \n\nI will say that their steak is delicious and perhaps this is better off a steak restaurant.
