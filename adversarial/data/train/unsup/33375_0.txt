I'm a sucker for great breakfast, & it's rare I find a place that can make breaky better than me :) But man, eggslut does it UP! I highly recommend the classic \"slut\". I am definitely going to try to recreate this at home. A poached egg floating inside of the creamiest whipped potatoes I've ever laid tongue on. Served with baguette. The line moves fast, & this seems to be pretty unanimous opinion among other yelpers. The coffee is actually outstanding, and dont skip the cookie or the biscuit with honey butter either. The breakfast sandwich was also baller. I recommend to a friend. :)
