I'm giving this place a very generous one star. Service is sub par at best. Layout is horrible. The food was not even close to representative of Chicago. They would be better off calling it Jimmy's of Somalia. \nI needed a tetnis shot after going to the bathroom, it was gross. \nThe entire place just feels dirty. The baked clams tasted like they were made a week ago, no way they were fresh. \nMy wife order baked ziti and the sauce was something a kindergartener could have made better. \nI had the Italian beef sandwich which the waitress said was the most popular menu item. I could understand that if most of the clientele was actually starving and hadn't eaten in months. I will never be back here.
