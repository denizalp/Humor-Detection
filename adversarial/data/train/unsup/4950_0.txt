Customer service-3\nFood-2\nDecor-1\nRecommendation-No\n\nThis place is nice and big. The lady taking the order was nice. The food wasn't that great. I ordered the 2piece fish and 3 shrimp. The batter on their fried food is thick and was not seasoned at all. If u drunk and need grease this is the place to be. Other than that it's just a heart attack waiting to happen. Will I go back probably not.
