Still an amazing buffet and the selection......holy Batman is the selection ever huge! \nDuring Chinese New Year weekend I was amazed at how busy this buffet was. I don't think I've ever seen more people waiting in line during peak times! Also most food stations were well stocked up. There are other buffets I've been to where they just can't handle the mass volume of people. Not here. I avoided the seafood area because the lineups were too long however there seemed to be a never ending amount of crab legs , shrimp and crab claws. \n\nI ended up sticking with my Asian food.\n\nHere is what I had: \n\nCrispy fried fish- nice seasoned flavour and still crispy and crunchy with some hot peppers and salt. \n\nCrispy pork- similar to the fish but a bit more spicy and well seasoned\n\nBeef Pho- wow.....my friend is Vietnamese who takes me here and their pho on the buffet is amazing. Not too salty and the broth is amazingly rich\n\nBraised eggplant with beans - perfectly cooked with beans in a rich sauce and not too salty\n\nDim sum- a bit dry but decent nine the less. I wouldn't consider it fresh dim sum (probably frozen but not bad for a buffet)\n\nPad thai- not the most flavourful but a good amount of shrimp and sauce and freshness was decent\n\nAssorted sushi- not my favourite. A bit flavourless so I didn't finish my portions. \n\nCreme brûlée- very nicely done and up to Montreal- Quebec standards\n\nStrawberries- fresh and a nice way to finish off after 2 big plate fulls \n\nIf you are a person who deeply appreciates good food come here. You won't be disappointed!
