This is a new location..... located in Blakeney.\n\nThis is a smaller store than most, but it has everything a man would need for business.  From casual shirts and pants to suits, ties, leather goods and shoes it has it all.\n\nThe staff is always friendly, and willing to assist in your purchase.  I love the specials they offer and it is always nice to take advantage of the buy one get one free sales.\n\nI have added a few pictures of this location\n\nThis is my go to store for clothes.\n\nNCFoodGuy
