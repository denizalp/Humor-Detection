Gets a one stat bump because the manager stepped up and comped our entire meal and drinks.\n\nIt was a Saturday night at dinner time and place was half full should have been the warning. We ordered salmon which was served to us raw and Chopped salad with extra chicken came with no chicken. \n\nOrdered ballast point pale ale which tasted like a Heineken. Two very distinctly different tasting and looking beers. She insisted it was the pale ale. \n\n45 minutes to bring food and never checked in on us as we wanted a refill.
