Last chance because this Bi-Lo is closing soon. Grocery is marked down significantly and the meats are way discounted. As they say, \"It's all gotta go!\"\n\nSomething else will probably be here soon enough but until then, grab some inexpensive stuff while it lasts.\n\nThe store is clean and well lit but the shelves are emptying quickly. I got a couple of good steaks at half off the usual price and a bunch of canned goods that I would ordinarily buy anyway!
