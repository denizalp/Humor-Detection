My friend said that I had to go to Sidewalk Citizen Bakery for their delicious pastries and she was right! She sent me the link to their other location, but I visited this one to check out the Simmons Mattress Building that the bakery is located in. The staff said the bread pudding is a staff favorite so I got that and asked if they could heat it up, and she said yes. I also got an almond croissant, and she asked if I'd like that heated up too so I said yes. Both were delicious and heated up perfectly! Their salads looked good too but we were in our way to have lunch elsewhere.
