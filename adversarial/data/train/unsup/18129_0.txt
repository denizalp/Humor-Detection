Outstanding show, opulent theater, outrageously talented performers: that's O!\nI've been wanting to see this show since my first visit to Vegas and the wait was well worth it. Show itself was amazing, the characters and scenes made me think of a Dali panting brought to life. \n\nAs at other Cirque shows, there is little to no story line- this show seems to be more of a dreamlike world and I enjoyed the mostly instrumental music. \nThe introductory scene is always a can't-miss moment: from the oddball characters interacting with the audience prior to start, to the way the opaque red curtains are removed to show the unique stage. The various stage transitions were by far the most unique aspect of this show specifically- I now have much more respect for my former college roommate, who was a synchronized swimmer.\n\nFavorite performances were the girl balanced on her head (you'll know her when you see her), the endless ladder going up to the ceiling, and the black-and-white-striped dancers with the metal rack- think Jabbawockeez on steroids, in midair, over water.\n\nIf you ever have the opportunity to see this show with VIP tickets, it is quite a luxe experience with a great view that allows you to see the entire stage without the constant neck-swiveling to make sure you don't miss anything.
