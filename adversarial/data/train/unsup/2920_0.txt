This is the first time here and for brunch no less. Surprisingly it was good. Especially their crab legs.  Their crab legs was sweet and not salty but just perfect.  The only complaint I have was they don't offer wet napkin but other than that brunch here is way better than dinner at Bacchanal Buffet last night
