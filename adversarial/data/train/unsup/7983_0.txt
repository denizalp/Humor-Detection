I walked my lame ass from the Bellagio where I was staying to this tattoo place. It said it would be a 40 minute walk so I thought \"Screw it, I need to burn off all the booze I've been ingesting.\"\n\nWrong move.\n\nI open the door thirsty and sweaty and it was 8:15 PM. Holly told me they were closed but before that we talked about what I wanted to get and planned it out. She invited me to come back tomorrow.\n\nSo the next day I go in and get my tattoo. It was a fun experience and she was talkative, which is tough to say for other tattoo artists who seem to be deaf mutes sometimes.\n\nOh, and they have a fridge full of free Rockstars?!?!? Yeah, I was sold with that one. They also have a chill pool table while you wait.\n\nThe Voodoo theme is also pretty neat.
