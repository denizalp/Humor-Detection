My The Market reviews are not for the Elizabeth Street location, where they have been transferred apparently. They are intended for the Imperial Plaza location on st Clair ave west. I updated the business page to add the Imperial Plaza location, which yelp added. Somehow all of a sudden my reviews have gotten logged under another The Market in the downtown core. So this is my disclaimer for the reviews set out below!
