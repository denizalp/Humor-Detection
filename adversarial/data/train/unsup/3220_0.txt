When most white people go to eat dimsum at a Chinese restaurant, they are usually clueless and have no idea what anything is and what to order.  I am Asian, and this is how I felt my first time at Cracker Barrel.  Note to self: chicken and dumplings does NOT equal chicken dumplings.\n\nAlthough I had a great time here because of the fun decor, games at the table, and the overall \"whiteness\" of the place, I found the food to be really heavy.  I left feeling like the food I had just eaten would sit in my colon for days.  I would come back, just not too often.
