Adorable cafe\/patisserie where you can order hot meals, salads, sandwiches and of course desserts of all sorts. \n\nStanding in single file line (cafeteria style) as you wait your turn. There was quite a bit of customers tonight, and seemed not enough help. \n\nTheir croissant was flaky, buttery and incredibly good. Their strawberry\/lemon eclair delightful and a must get. \n\nDefinitely a great one stop shop for any cafe type needs.
