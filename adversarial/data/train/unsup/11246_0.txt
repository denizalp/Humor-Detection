\"TOURIST TRAP!\" \n\nThats what my out of town visiting friend said when we went there. I said to him \"DUH! What place on the strip isnt a tourist trap?\"  When you live in Vegas, the only time we go to the strip is because of friends and family from out of town. \n\nTo me, I think this place is decent. You have several different levels with all sorts of overpriced merchandise. You have to be wise with what you want to buy unless you print your own money. \n\nBesides the default merchandise, there are only two things that are really considered an \"attraction\" here. Pictures with the giant Polar Bear (that is, if the person working the suit is not taking a break), and the soda cafe that is I think on the top floor. \n\nObviously, if you are from out of town and have never done the coke flavors around the world taste sampling then I suggest you do it at least once. For 8 bucks they will give you 16 cups of different flavored coke from other countries all over the world. I for one will not give away any info here for sampling it is the only way you can truly understand how it is described. Forget about what other people are saying here. It's better if you find out on your own. I guarantee you will have fun. \n\nOnce you're done, dont forget to check out the M and M's store next door. Might as well stay with the junk food theme and use Vegas as an excuse. LOL.
