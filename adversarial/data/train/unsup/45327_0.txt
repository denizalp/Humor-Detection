This is a great family owned place. I have been coming here for a few years. They have always been very friendly and their prices are great. The lady also does alterations and is really good at it. She fixed a dress for me that was too long and took off a strap for only 40 bucks. I take my comforter here because unfortunately it's dry clean only. They take great care of it and always do the job right. A+
