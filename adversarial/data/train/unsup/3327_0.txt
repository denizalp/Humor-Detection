Came here for the first time to meet some friends for lunch.\nIt is located in Tempe Market place but, has its own parking lot,which makes going here much easier than a lot of other places here.\nWe sat on the back patio which was so nice. It is a nicely decorated place, Very Southern. It reminds me of a place in Florida or in the South.\nWell ,it was a lovely day outside,not too hot or cool so it was great for sitting outside.\n\nWe got fried green tomatoes for appetizer, which was really good and the first time I had ever had them.\nI had the BBQ chicken Salad, Sue got the breaded and fried cat fish with shrimp ,it also came with Sweet potatoes fries. She said it was fantastic, my other friend Alan got the fried Chicken and he is from Mississippi and it was very true to how they do it there.\nBathrooms are nice and clean.Nice Hot water to wash off all the sticky BBQ.\nStaff is a little frazzled at times, there seems to be a bit of disorganization going on.\n2 of us received our food and Sue waited quite a while to get hers as well.\nShe did have the Strawberry Lemonade which she thought was Heaven.
