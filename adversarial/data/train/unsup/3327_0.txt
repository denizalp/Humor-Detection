I really like this place they have great deserts. It's kind of expensive, but it's worth it. The positions are very big. CrÃªpe  are a dollar cheaper than waffles.  \n \nThis location has easy parking. It's very loud and busy. You have to wait a little to get your table, but you can call in and reserve a table.
