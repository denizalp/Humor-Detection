Meh.  Grabbed a couple drinks at the Fireside Lounge after walking through the Sahara (one last time) with a friend.  I guess we were making it a cheesy old Vegas kind of night.  \n\nWeird mix in that the lounge feels like it used to be a strip club, while the diner looked slightly nicer than your typical Denny's.  At least the 2 are separated by a glass door.  The couches in the lounge are cool and it one of those places were you could relax with your girl around the faux fire for a couple hours with drinks and just veg out.  Drinks were nothing to write home about.\n\nNot sure I'll be back anytime soon tho; this place was just a bit too cheesy.
