I used to like WinCo. I used to go to it all the time for my grocery needs. Then like a cheap hooker, she abruptly betrayed me. \n\nAll the certified organic food was gone. *Poof*. It was gone. Overnight. No longer there. I might have seen a handful of products (Red Mill's, some basil maybe) in the whole fucking store (and it is a big one) that was certified organic. Serious? Alright. \n\nHave not been back since. Maybe the people that patronise this establishment are not apt to purpose certified organic. Maybe they want GMOs and pinky slime in their 'food'. \n\nHard to believe they cannot see organic these days with even Smith's featuring a growing selection of organic; Fresh & Easy practically offering everything, including but not limited to fucking chocolate bars and fresh cookies from their bakery, as organic. \n\nThe Peanut Butter, pressed from the machine was very good, certified organic or otherwise, so I'll give them an extra star for that. And they give you small discounts (5 cents?) for bringing reusable bags, but that is not enough for an extra star because I cannot buy anything there now they have seemingly thrown all of their chips into out-WalMarting-WalMart with their cheap-as-it-gets, forget-everyone-else-who-would-like-QUALITY-over-penny-savings model. - E
