This place is expensive.  They are even more expensive than Hobby Lobby. They do have nice fabric but not nice enough to spend $22 to $35 dollars a yard.  When I walked in, not one employee acknowledged me.  I will buy my fabric elsewhere. I'm giving 3 stars because they do have nice fabrics. I just wasn't expecting those kind of prices for a shop on the west side.  I will head back to Home Fabrics. They have reasonable prices with a huge selection as well. I just wanted to try this place because everyone gave it 5 stars.
