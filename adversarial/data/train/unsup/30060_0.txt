My first and only visit so far...my child wanted a pair of Vans that are only available online, so we went to the store to try the sizing on to make sure we ordered the right pair.  They helped us with the sizing, did the online order for us, and had it shipped Express to our home for no charge!  Bazinga!  Thanks for the awesome customer service!!
