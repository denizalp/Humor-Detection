So this is how the 1% live!!! What a great experience. I was in Vegas for my little sister's birthday. Just went up for the night. I booked my massage at the spa at Mandalay bay online. It was a really easy and quick process. After a night of killing my soul a little, it felt good to wake up the next day and go to the spa.\n\n     The spa is located down stairs on the way to the pools.  It seems out of the way, but once you're there it feels nice and secluded.  The check in process was equally as easy as the online booking.\n\n     This spa has a men's side, and a women's side. No comingling, unless you book a couples massage.\n\n     Right when you enter your correct side, you are greeted by super friendly staff. They give you a mini orientation. Then walk you back to the spa area.\n\n     Inside is a dry sauna, a fully tiled steam room (with a quick rinse shower), 2 hot water pools, 1 warm water pool, and 1 cold plunge pool. There are lots of patio style reclining chairs to veg out in too.\n\n     The main area, with all the pools, you'd think would smell like chlorine, but it doesn't. And the steam room is refreshing eucalyptus!!\n\n     There are lockers, and showers, private restrooms, and vanity sinks with full amenities.\n\n     If you're ever at the mandalay bay, I highly recommend spending a few hours at the spa. You do not need  massage in order to get in, you can pay just for the spa.\n\n    Until next time...
