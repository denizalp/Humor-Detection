Since my last review, I have only been here 2 more times. Once was for a large graduation dinner\/party, where I thought the food was pretty good. We came again tonight because I had a gift card and we were in the area. \nMy opinion of the food dropped tremendously since the prior visits. The restaurant was half empty but we had to wait about 15minutes for a table. We decided to get a drink at the bar, which is also a smoking area (yuck), the bartender was too worried about the TV's in the bar than to wait on us, well we finally ordered 2 Ginger and Bulleit, so either the ginger ale was flat or he added water to our drinks because they tasted watered down.\nWe got seated, right behind the waiters station (annoying) even though there were many other tables open (whatever). We both decided to get the specials of the night. He got the New York Strip and I got the Crab stuffed Dover Sole (the waiter raved about it). They both tasted like bad diner meals, I was supposed to have Spinach risotto on the side, it was more like old cold rice with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese mashed into a lump (Gordon Ramsey would have a cow!) I found a shell, I think\/I hope in my crab stuffing on top of my fish. Nothing tasted good, it was sad what they did to that food. Our wait staff and hostess were nice and friendly but that doesn't make my tummy happy.\n I don't want to go back.
