Not bad, not great, but given we were staying at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, they get an extra star for the convenience.\n\nIt's self serve yogurt at Vegas strip prices.  They had a decent amount of flavors...heavy on the fruity, tart ones.  My son decided to make himself a smoothie, which was a nice change.  You grab a cup, put any flavor yogurt in (my kiddo chose 3), add your choice of fruit\/toppings, and then pay.  The gal at the register then puts all your goodies in a blender and voila...smoothie a la 7 year old kiddo.  All this for the low, low price of $8. (I kid, I kid).  I did notice she added milk to make it more of a creamy smoothie, so for those lactose intolerant friends like me, let them know to skip the milk. \n\nI had a nutella crepe, and while it came with a ton of nutella, it ended up being a tad bit soggy.  Tasty nonetheless, but with a steep price tag of $8 as well.  \n\nSo, a solid 3, with 1 star being for location.
