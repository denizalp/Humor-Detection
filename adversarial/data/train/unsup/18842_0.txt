As Peter Piper Pizzas go, this is a pretty nice one.\n\nLarge dining room, with large round tables, long tables and booths, a seating arrangement for any need. Despite some comments to the contrary in other reviews, the staff seems to do a good job keeping the facility clean.\n\nThere is an extensive play area, with a variety of games appropriate for a wide range of ages. Most everything was functioning on this visit. A heads up. You'll only receive half the tickets indicated on many of the games, but will then receive twice the credit for your tickets when you feed them into the automated ticket counters. Works out in the end. \n\nYou'll see televisions at all angles, playing cartoons for the kids and sports for the parents.\n\nThe problems every Peter Piper Pizza has persist here. The pizza is of marginal quality, suitable for kids, but a disappointment for most adults. There may be lots of aggressive kids and parents at peak times, with little staff supervision evident. While the pizza is reasonably priced, a visit can become expensive for a family when you factor in beverages and especially tokens for the games. And it's amazing how little you will receive at the prize counter in exchange for hundreds of tickets.\n\nIn summary, your kids will love it and you should be able to tolerate it. Not a bad outing.
