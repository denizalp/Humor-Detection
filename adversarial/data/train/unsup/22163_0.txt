This is going to be a short review since I only ordered one thing LOL.\n\n\n  I was craving something sweet after our sushi lunch  and Nielsen's popped up. It's within a center with a lot of food options to be had. So I'd say good location for an after dinner stop.  Came in with my mom and the interior has a 50s 60s vibe and I'd have to say they could restore some of the seating. A tad bit ran down and awkward.\n\n   I looked over the menu and you have many options you can do with your custard. I went with one of their popular custards and that was the Strawberry cheesecake. The service was nice by the way. I placed my order and waited a few minutes for it to be freshly made. Took it to-go and I was on my way. Got home and started tasting with a nice long spoon.  This custard is good and having it as strawberry cheesecake made it very rich for my blood. Nice chunks of cheesecake bits and strawberry bits as well.  I enjoyed this and I'd like to try it without any toppers, that way I can gauge how I really feel about the custard especially compared to places like Ritas and Freddy's. I'd totally comeback when the mood strikes :)
