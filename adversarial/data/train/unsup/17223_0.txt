My review is only of the experience I received when I went to Camille Flawless. The sales person was in the back and popped out and scared the shit out of my friend. She did not say hello, how are you, nothing ... just watched us as if we were Julia Roberts in a hooker's outfit looking at stuff we cannot afford.  Um, big mistake, huge!  (LOL, like Julia Roberts said in Pretty Woman).\n\nI buy gowns every year for our annual RE\/MAX Gala in Vegas so I wanted to see what they had.  Their gowns are gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous, and maybe if the sales person would have removed the stick from their ass I would have bought one.  But if you cannot even take the time to say hello or how may I help you, I will not spend the money on one of your gowns. Next.
