In regards to their brunch.\nLate start at 11am and staff still wasn't ready for guests.\nLive music band set up but no music (or band).\nStaff wear pajamas as their uniform which looks unsanitary, lazy, and unprofessional. \nMy brunch (king crab quiche) seemed like it was baked in an Easy-Bake Oven by a 5 year old. Dry, tasteless, over cooked and imitation crab was used and way over priced for the quality (I understand it is the Strip, I'm a local).\nNever returning.\nBardot Brasserie brunch is fantastic (French restaurant in the Aria) and they start at 10.
