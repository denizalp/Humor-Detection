Sampled chili cheese (surprisingly pretty spicy) and plain cheddar popcorn.  Popcorn was fresh and wasn't the cheap sprinkle on stuff, which I appreciated.  I love to try new popcorn shops so I drove 45 min to get here.  It was on my upper limit for pricing but I did buy some.  Flavor was good but the cheese could have used a bit more sharpness, but still very good.  I still prefer \"My Popcorn Kitchen\" (in Scottsdale) though.
