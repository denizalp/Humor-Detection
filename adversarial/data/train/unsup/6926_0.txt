Pearson--all your fancy bells and whistles are wasted on the International travellers!  Regular schlubs like myself have to snore away the time in your rather utilitarian--albeit adequate--domestic gates.  What happened to the excitement of air travel?\nAlso--you change your mind about gates as often as I change my mind about which of my cats I love most (hint: it's whichever one sits in my lap).\n\nPearson--in short, you're a place I don't mind visiting, but I'm always happy to leave.
