I'm a big fan of good tortilla soup & fish tacos, so I ordered both here.\n\nThey were mediocre.  If I was here again I'd try something else.\n\nIf you're in LV and want a good fish taco go to Border Food Juarez\/El Paso at 412 N. Eastern.  You get real fish (not some rectangular deep fried hunk), lightly floured\/fried & served with all fresh ingredients.  I would eat here every day if it were closer to my house.\n\nIf you're in LV and want good tortilla soup get in a car and drive 8 hours to the bay area of CA and go to Una Mas.  They take a delicious broth, add chunks of GRILLED chicken, SPOON IN fresh pieces of avocado, and sprinkle it with grated cheese & fresh strips of tortillas.  They assemble each bowl to order.  Best tortilla soup EVER.  \n\nOne thing I'd definitely get if I went back to Border Grill is a drink that went past me on a tray.  I have no idea what it was but the glass was trimmed with toasted coconut and it looked great.\n\nUPDATE 2016:\nI went back the spring of 2016 & ordered fish tacos again.  They came with grapefruit on them!  GRAPEFRUIT?!? And not just any kind, but the sweet pink kind.  FYI grapefruit on a fish taco is awful :(
