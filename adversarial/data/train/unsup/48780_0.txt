Taco Bell has really improved over the years as they are simply the cheapest fast food option.  Most locations are serving up bigger portions such as their bean burritos.\n\nFew years ago you buy a burrito and would get very little beans and taste mostly tortilla.  However, today you buy a burrito and you can enjoy your beans and sauce from the first bite to the last for just 99 cents.\n\nI love their tostadas and even those are loaded now !
