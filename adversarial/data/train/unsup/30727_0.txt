Yes, the store is a little small, but I see that everyday. Yes, some of the stuff is overpriced, but, again...So, yeah, Propaganda is one of those fun, sassy kind of gift stores I speak so affectionately about, carrying with it certain truths like yes, I am being pandered to based on my demographic's stereotypes, and no, I never thought I would pay $12 dollars for a stuffed mustache (to borrow from Mike S' experience, if I may). \n\nSo yes, a lot of the usual suspects are there. Quirky stationary and greeting cards you could never give your parents. Kitsch galore. Add to that some pretty nice and locally designed clothes, a relatively big selection of tote and handbags and some beautiful and unique handmade jewelry. New York designer Michael Michaud has a number of pieces for sale here inspired by nature's jewelery, that being berries, flowers and plants, of course. Chains of clover, sprigs of ginkgo and wreaths of berries are a hippy girl's dream, made delicate silver reality. I bought my sister some blueberries last Christmas and all their matching  pieces still taunt me in the display case.\n\nThe kin of my beloved David Bowie glass-bubble belt (not the technical name, I imagine...too many \"B\"s) is also still there, about 3 years after I received mine as a gift. I imagine that this longevity reflects the success of the store itself.
