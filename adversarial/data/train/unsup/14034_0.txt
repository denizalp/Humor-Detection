Nice looking shop, however if you are looking for a professional cut, keep looking.  Save your money and go to a chain.  I stopped in on a slow weekday and the barber sitting on his chair was texting on his phone and took more than enough time to notice a customer, I felt like apologizing and leaving.  There were two other employees who came out of the back and started chatting about their weekend and didn't have any problems with vulgar language, including a female employee, so heads up if you want to bring your kids here.  One of the barbers even took the opportunity to trim his own hair while he was cutting the hair of a customer.  This place is close to my house but I will drive further for a more professional and deserving shop for my business.  If you just need a simple cut, without concern of your look and want to pay more than what it's worth and feel like a burden to the employees, this is your shop.
