Bad catch, not good catch. \n\nCame here twice, second time for lobster take out as it was extremely loud there.  Upon bringing the lobster home and eating, I noticed the meat was quite hard and difficult to eat, knew it probably wasn't fresh.  Later I had stomach discomfort and immediately knew it was the lobster.\n\nMy guess is because they knew it was for take out they gave me a dead lobster thinking I wouldn't go back and complain about it.  Seafood especially lobster\/crab needs to be fresh and alive before cooking as it goes bad quickly.\n\nAlso the Cajun and Good Catch Blend sauces tasted very similar, like soy sauce\/Szechuan flavour.  I guess because it's Asian owned.\n\nLesson learned.  Stay away counterfeit Captain's Boil and stick to the original.  Waste of $65.
