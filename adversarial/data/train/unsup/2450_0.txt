I had previously given Groggy's 4 stars, but sadly need to update it tonight. \n\nSince the new owners came in and began making changes, my husband and I have been coming here less and less often. These changes that have been made have had us going to other places for a few beers. For instance, no more free pool on Sundays (and they raised the pool pricing). Came in tonight to find it dead in the place, unlike the last few months when it's been packed. Also, the newer chef stinks or the quality of food has significantly gone down. Yes, it's bar food, but it used to be some damn good bar food. Finally, the beer pricing has skyrocketed compared to what we were paying 6 months ago. Sure, the new TVs you put in are nice, but we have definitely noticed it's meant you've had to cut some serious corners!\n\nNeedless to say, I will likely only ever frequent Groggy's again because I know we can walk there from our house. But honestly, I'd rather get a 12 pack and go home than stay at Groggy's now.
