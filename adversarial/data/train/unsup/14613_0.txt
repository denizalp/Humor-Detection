We love a good dive bar. The atmosphere is unique. When you walk in thus place you are instantly confused. Pranksters Too can't make it's mind on what is wants to be. \n\nA live music venue? The Jester Room is a cramped little area to watch live music. Cool. But 'tis a dump. A sports bar? Yeah, TV's are everywhere, but I think they were purchased in 1995. HD...ever heard of it? A dive bar? Normally dive bars make up for bad music and out dated TV's with service. Not Pranksters Too. I finished my beer, asked for another round, and waited 45 minutes. Did I get a teeth cracking cold brew? No. My check. Easy to tip on that service. It was a Tuesday night.\n\nIf you have options, venture down to Dukes. Don't bother with Pranksters Too.
