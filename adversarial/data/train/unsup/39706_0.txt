I've been searching for a nail technician that is just as particular and obsessive about my nails as I am. I've gone to an absurd amount of nails salons and for the last few months I've been seeing Bryan at Aloha Nails and Spa and he has been getting my nails perfect everytime.\nNot only are all of the spa's nail technicians great at their jobs, but particularly Bryan. Plus the place is clean, staffs are professional and friendly. Highly recommended.
