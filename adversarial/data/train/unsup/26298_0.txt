Attended the Grand Opening of the new North Scottsdale location. Had a great time, food was great (especially the jalapeno cheese crisp) and Mariachi band was on point. Staff was great. Alexa handled our party (which stared with 4 then later expanded) with ease and especially since we were on separate checks. \nThe rest of the staff didn't looked phased at all with all the people coming in\/out for the opening. Great to see Santa (aka Harry) made an appearance for the kids.\nLocation is right next to the movie theatre which is even better. \nI may live in the East valley but, would definitely be back (with pics)
