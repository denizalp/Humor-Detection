Surprising good...the machaca burrito was good my wife had I believe country steak and eggs...don't remember exactly...but what do remember was the ricotta lemon pancake...but not in a good way sorry that was the only thing not crazy for...the Raider waitress was AWESOME!!!  Not just because she is Raider family but she was on point with the service...\nThe only thing I would add...put some hash browns in the breakfast burrito
