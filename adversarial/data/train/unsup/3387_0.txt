A great little place. I love their produce, fruits, meats and spices. They carry alot of very hard to find skin care products that I love. They were even the first place in Pittsburgh that carried Carol's Daughter products. \n\nThey also carry pre made salads, sandwiches and wraps. Sure it's not as big as I would like but it's still a great place. If you like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's you will like this place as well.
