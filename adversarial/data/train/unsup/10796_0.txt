My friends and I shopped here for some alcohol to take back to our hotel room.  I was in the middle of shopping, and I had to take a shit.  You see, I'm not shit shy.  I'll take one anywhere.  Anyway, I had to go so I gave my friends money for my portion of the liquor and headed for the restrooms.  \n\nI have to say, the restrooms were actually very clean for a grocery store.  I did my do, or doo doo (shall I say) and left.  I was pleasantly surprised by my bathroom experience there.\n\nGreat place to shop and shit.  :)
