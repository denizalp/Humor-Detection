This is nothing to compare with real Serbian food. The service is beyond terrible, the food is as well terrible. For there shopska salad, they use the cheapest roma tomatoes, and while you pay $5.50 for a plate, you have about 3 soup spoons of salad, seriously??!!\nThe chevape who ever says are out of this world or best in there life, those people probably never ever tried authentic chevape!! They have no taste, they were over cocked, they did not even smell on chevape. Same as the pljeskavica... Tasteless rubbery ground meat. Veshalica was acceptable but again not even close to how should be. Big plater with meat for at least 3 people to eat but fries for one person...what s joke.\nNobody cares if u enter it or not, very unwelcome atmosphere, very dark, have to use phone light to read the menu. \nService was unbelievable terrible, the owner was there but he dose not care for customers, the only thing this person cares is to put money in his pocket. \nWe asked for bread 3 times and ketchup as well... On the end waitress asks if everything was OK???! Seriously???\nDon't waste your money.., and it's a lot of money as this place is very very OVERPRICED !!!!'
