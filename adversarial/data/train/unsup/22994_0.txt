We went to Le Thai about a month ago when we were in vegas. Our server was fast, kind, knowledgeable about the menu and offered great suggestions. The tom-yum soup we had was amazing. I had the nightly special and my fiance had the three different kinds of curry dish. This place is trendy while being laid back and the price point is great (10-12 for most dishes). \n\nThat hostess is a fire breather. Hence my three stars. Not nice. No. Not at all.
