I really like this place. \n\nIt is a sports bar first and foremost.  Many locals come and see Coach.   I have talked to Coach a couple of times - he is a very social cat.\n\nThis is a place where you can watch any Pittsburgh Sporting event, have good food, and drinks.  It is usually crowded.\n\nThe prices are reasonable.    The vibe is really good.   One of the reasons why I go back.\n\nThey have weekly food specials (Thursday $3 burgers). \n\nIf you are in the area, you should check it out if you are looking for a place to watch the game.  \n\nService - Excellent - whether you are at a table or at the bar - the service has been great.\n\nPrice - very reasonable - Food and Drinks prices will keep me coming back if I want to watch a game and pay realistic prices (compare to a bottleshop).\n\nFood - It is okay - I would not come here to specifically dine.  I would come here to meet friends share some wings and be social.\n\nEnvironment - The vibe is great.   The bar area reminds me of a public house.  I just think everyone either knows each other or knows Coach.
