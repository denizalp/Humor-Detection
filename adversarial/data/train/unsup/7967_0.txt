UPDATE 2\/28\/10: \n\nYelp has \"released\" my review after ten weeks in limbo, so that now it appears mixed-in with other reviews for l'Étoile. Interestingly, l'Étoile is no longer just a bevy of 4 and 5 stars; there are a handful of 2 and 3 stars... Yelp has been getting a lot of negative press about \"pay-for-play\" -- in other words, businesses are \"encouraged\" to pay for advertising in exchange for scrubbed (positive) reviews. It's the businesses that have been pushing back (in the Bay Area, anyway). Kudos to l'Étoile for not giving in and allowing for a range of reviews -- if indeed that is what happened (see my intro below from Dec).\n\nI still think Yelp should indicate the \"age\" of a Yelper (Yelping since 2004!) similar to what American Express does (member since XXXX). My argument was that it would show readers that a reviewer didn't just sign-up to inflict bile or award unexamined praise on a business.\n\nJust my two cents.\n\n- - - \n\nThis review will likely be deleted within 48 hours. I posted the below on 12\/14\/09 and it was summarily removed two days later... (I wonder what will happen to this posting?).\n\nI thought I was providing fair and honest feedback. Yelp's motto is: Yelp is the fun and easy way to find, review and talk about what's great -- and not so great -- in your area.\n\nI guess they ultimately get to decide (I think I'm being \"scrubbed\"). Honest, huh?\n\nMy original posting:\n\n3 star rating   12\/14\/2009  \n\nBEST OF MADISON?\n\nA late seating time (after 8pm) is not a guaranteed table, so when my wife and I arrived on time for our reservation, the table was not ready. That's understandable. It's a busy night.\n\nAll seats at the bar are occupied. We are asked to sit in two clunky desk chairs next to an overflowing coat rack by the entrance stairway... ooookay. The chairs are positioned in such a way that force my wife and I to tuck our feet in and lean out of the way to let people by.\n\nWe are asked if we would like a drink while waiting (I pass). Upon handing my wife her drink the maitre d' makes the casual observation \"here's a napkin, not that you can put your drink anywhere.\" Wow, that's classy.\n\nWe're feeling \"really comfortable\" by this point, with blasts of cold air coming up the stairwell as people are leaving the restaurant pushing past us -- oh wait, there are chairs at the bar! The maitre d' shoves two menus at us \"if you'd care to look the menu while you wait...\" . Is the kitchen closing? What about the open seats at the bar? I don't mind waiting -- that's not the issue -- it's the manner.\n\nI ask the hostess if we offended the maitre d' and why were being made to feel rushed and not shown to the bar instead of being left in the hallway.\n\nAt this point the maitre d' slithers over and says that they are just finishing getting our table ready. How am I supposed to know that? Even if the table is one minute away from being ready, patrons should not be left in such an uncomfortable, exposed location when an alternative is available.\n\nHe is \"sorry I feel that way -- would I care to wait for another table to be cleared?\" The condescension was a bit out of proportion, it seemed.\n\nAnd so, our first impression of l'Étoile....\n\nWHY THREE ETOILES?\n\nI would have been happy to rate them two stars (my so-so rating), if I was rating the front of the house alone, since their hospitality appears to suffer from the hubris of having received too many accolades.\n\nThe additional star is for a combined effort from:\n\n1. The kitchen -- which created good and presentable plates (amuse-bouches, risotto with shaved black truffles, a mixed-greens with tomato salad as appetizers; the breast of duck with baby brussel sprouts and cranberry coulis, plus tri-tip steak with Bordelaise as entrées; cheese plate to finish, accompanied by a bottle of Duckhorn Vineyards Merlot).\n\nA demerit: the steak was a disappointment in presentation. The escarole, as stated on the menu, was substituted with spinach (this substitution was not mentioned at time of ordering, even though we expressly asked if any substitutions to the menu had been made) and there was a paucity of onion coulis; the meat presentation was rustic \"à plat\" and not sliced in the \"stepped\" manner. All-in-all, a bit more \"bistro\" than \"resto\".\n\n2. Our server Michael -- who was congenial and professional (without being obsequious), and who clearly would have heard about what transpired between myself and the maitre d', produced two complimentary glasses of Talley Pinot Noir that helped ease the tension of the evening for us. Since I understand he is, or was, the sommelier I will credit him for the excellent selection.\n\nWOULD WE GO BACK?\n\nNot really. They are starting to believe their own hype -- a sure sign of decline. And when the veal daube that I had at Sardine leaves more of an impression on me, I have to wonder out loud if the twinkle on l\"Étoile has faded.
