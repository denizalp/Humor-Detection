This place is pretty good for those looking to check out a NASCAR or other racing event.  I had a few problems though...\n\n1. For newbies (like my group) it's difficult to find the main enterance.  There wasn't any difficulty finding the parking areas, but finding Will-Call was a totally different beast.  I should've bought the tickets and printed them instead of going to Will-Call\n2. People do not respect your seating arrangements and there is very little staff managing seats.  I had an obnoxious guy and his drunk lady friend give me attitude when I told them they were sitting in our seats.\n3. Noise level is high!  Do NOT forget to wear earplugs while sitting in the lower portion of the stands!\n\nOther than that, there are great views of the whole track from every angle.  Clearly displayed signs to indicate racer's positions, and lots of food\/beverage vendors.
