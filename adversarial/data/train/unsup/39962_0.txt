Do not be deceived by the picture. Not a good experience. Many girls were staying here. The rooms were dirty and our check in experience was awful. I had an awful room and needed it exchanged. I waited in someone else's room and we ordered room service. We were told it would be 20 minutes. It took an hour and a half for our food and it was inedible. The buns of burgers were so hard you couldn't eat them. I had a salad that for some reason was just a head of romaine not even cut up and put on a plate. I had to leave for work and then they said they would keep my room key for the new room and when I came back at 10 pm they said the hotel was sold out and I had no room. An hour later they upgraded me to a suite (which previously they said I had no options and would only get one nights money back). There was junk on counters and couches and thank goodness we had Clorox wipes with us because we could wipe off surfaces. The wipes were brown when we wiped off the counter and couches. Housekeeping came into my room at 3 am unexpectedly. There was one thin sheet on the bed and the closet had hangers on the shelf but no rod to hang clothes with. Other girls rooms were filthy and had strips of eyelashes all over their room and dirty sheets. Some girls moved to another hotel for their second night. My first time in Vegas would've been much better at a different hotel. I can't think of anything I liked other than the fact Hard Rock was across the street and we got to hangout there.
