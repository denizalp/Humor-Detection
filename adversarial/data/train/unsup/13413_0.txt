I want to salute and commend Bianca who works in the  Cosmetic Department!  She is extremely knowledgeable and she has such a wonderful personality.  She is the most helpful and cheerful employee over there by a mile.  Walgreens is extremely lucky to have her and personally as a customer, I love  how she treats everyone and how she generously shares her expertise and great smile!  Again l was there this morning waiting for my turn to ask Bianca a question.  The lady in front of me couldn't thank Bianca enough for all her advice and kindness, she left saying with a huge smile \"Thank you so very much, you made my day a very special one.\"
