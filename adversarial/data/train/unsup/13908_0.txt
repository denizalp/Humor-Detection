Don't go here on Halloween. They will trick you. They tricked me. I ordered two medium pizzas and the lady said it would be 15 minutes. I soon found out that she told all 14 people in the waiting area the same thing. Every single one of them had been there over an hour.\n\nIt gets worse. At 6 p.m. on Halloween night, that lady tells the manager she's leaving and to call her if he needs help. Well ... he needed help right then. For the next 15 minutes, there was no one at the front counter, we were all standing there like dumbasses, and the phone didn't stop ringing. At the same time, I watched the pizza-makers use their bare hands for toppings, looked at the garbage all over the floor, and asked myself what kind of life decisions I was making. \n\nOne customer was so fed up that she said, \"Keep the pizza\" and left even though she had already paid. After a while, some dude who finally came to the front counter. I asked if he could give her pizzas to someone else to speed things up. He said no. I asked for my money back and left. No pizza on this night. I would usually be sad about that, but it's Pizza Hut.
