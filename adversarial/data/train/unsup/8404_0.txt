Are you looking for Hispanic goods? Well this place is your one stop shop! I mean really, it's got it all from brand name to some obscure Hispanic brand that only a Latino would know about. Also it's pretty big and smells kind of funky from all the spices in here if that's your thing.\n\nWhat did I go here for? I came here for a big ass hunk of flan. Yes you read that right, they have a cool pastry section and flan is one of my favorite desserts. Smooth creamy, and sugary this flan is just as good as anywhere else and a few bucks gets you a huge slice! Everything else? I have no idea since this is pretty much just a giant flan stand to me, but the selection for people who actually do groceries here looks quite expansive.\n\nSo uh come here if you're looking to make some Hispanic cuisine and can't find some obscure ingredient, or if you're like me and love flan. As a bonus you can play a game and take a shot every time I mention flan in this review, can you reach the last flan (this one) without being drunk? If so then you may be an alcoholic, let's be friends?
