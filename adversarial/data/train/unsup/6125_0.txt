After being constantly barraged by radio and television commercials and forever having \"...at the DUMP!\" burned into my subconcious memory I finally paid this furniture store a visit... I was excited to shop for some \"discounted\" furniture, as my wife and I are in the process of redecorating and getting all new funiture. Imagine my disappointment then, when I found out that the discount is taken after highly inflating the original cost of the item! Sure there are some quality pieces of furniture here, but I doubt if they're really being discounted much at all! Only good thing I can say about this place is that we were able to get some great ideas for the look we are going for... The customer service was a little too overbearing. A salesperson followed us all over the store like a stalker waiting to pounce...\n\nBottom line: do your research before purchasing an item here to make sure you are really getting a good deal
