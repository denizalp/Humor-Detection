First off, I would like to start by saying I have a great respect for anyone who serves, as a Military Veteran and someone with family who are law enforcement I find it very profound.  With that being said, the North Las Vegas motorcycle officers are rude, short, and unforgiving.  I have been pulled over twice since arriving in Las Vegas a year ago.  Both of those were for speeding, admittedly my fault.  In both cases the motorcycle officer walked up, asked for my info, stated I was speeding, walked back to his bike, and then proceeded to hand me a ticket.  Not once did either ask why I was speeding, have any sort of common courtesy as humans, or exchange any pleasantries.  They just come off as ticket writing thugs.  I even asked if they were in the business of EVER writing a warning, he stated NO, not when they are trying to slow speeders in a certain area.  This is where it becomes a bit douchey.  The area he speaks of just so happens to the \"main\" pipeline for all military, veterans, and government employees working at Nellis AFB.  They sit just south of 215 on Lamb before you get to the 15.  They sit there all morning and afternoon writing tickets, I have witnessed this go on the entire year I have been here, not protecting anyone or serving any purpose other than piling in money for North Las Vegas.  It's pathetic and pretty horrible overall.  Why are they not out doing something useful that our taxes pay for, other than generating more revenue for them to justify their jobs?  Time for NLVPD motorcycle cops to get a real job or start doing theirs better than they currently are.   Ticket warnings are allowed, I've seen it happen before.  It is just as effective in slowing speeders, your presence is felt either way.
