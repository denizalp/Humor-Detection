I've been here twice- once for lunch and once for \"Rockstar Karaoke\" on a Monday night.  Lunch was ok. I had some grilled shrimp and rice- the shrimp was far too spicy. It killed any other flavor in my meal. The three salsas that are served with the chips and salsa were great. I especially liked the green tomatillo salsa.  Hubby had tacos and mom had tortilla soup and empanadas. All were good. We also got giant cocktails in take home plastic cups which made me feel like I was at a frat party. We did meet some crazy Canadian guys who fit the frat party mold as well.\n\nOur second visit was for a Monday night event called \"Rockstar Karaoke\". People sang karaoke songs with a live band backing them up. This was a blast- although I didn't sing on stage, I definitely lost my voice screaming the words to everything from \"Smells Like Team Spirit\" to \"Since You've Been Gone\". Great times- I will come back here!
