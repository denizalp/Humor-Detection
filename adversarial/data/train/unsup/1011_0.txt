Stay away from this crap service poor excuse for a hotel. Loyal for years then they put us in a $500\/night room in the \"new Julius Caesar palace\" with hammering, drilling and construction happening all night. No Lie. And they want to refund the $35 Resort fee. Are you KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW????????  Never again.  Mandarin Oriental SAVES the day and is taking us at 6am!!! Now that's class. SUCK IT, Caesars. What ever happened to CUSTOMER SERVICE anyway??\n\nUPDATE: My husband wrote them a letter when we got home. All we got was a defensive response defending themselves saying they have warned contractors and yada yada excuses. You are the WORST excuse of an establishment for customer service ever!! Who does that? Just admit you should not have opened that floor for paying customers when you did and say you're sorry. All we got is 'hope you give us another try'.  REALLY?? You haven't given us ONE reason to. Idiots. It's not like we were even looking for a \"deal\"-just a good experience. We were ready to pay for it too. Double IDIOTS. Take a lesson in service at The Mandarin Oriental.
