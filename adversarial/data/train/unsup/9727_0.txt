My friends started a bike gang this past spring, and while we might temporarily be restrained from roaming the streets a la Sons of Anarchy as it is 100ยบ out... we aren't messing around.  \n\nAfter I passed my initiation test, I wanted to bike to spring training games too, I realized I was missing some vital equipment... a bike.  Wait a minute, Dirty Harry was still sitting in my mom's backyard since I graduated college.  Boom.\n\nAfter 3 years of sun and rain, Dirty Harry (who I never owned in pristine condition as it is) was hanging on by a thread.  I searched Yelp for bike repair near my work and found Old Town Beach Cruisers.  I called 'em up and they stayed open late on a Friday eve for me to bring him by and asses the damage, was he salvageable?\n\nYou betcha: 2 tire tubes, basket wire bending, a chain, some oil, and some new rubber handle grips later... he was back in working-wicked-fast-order, rusted out fenders still included (so vintage).  This bike just does not know when to quit, that's all that needed replacing after years of neglect?  The nice(r) part was they didn't try to upsell me, were very friendly, and had everything done and ready to go by 10 am the next morning.  They even called to let me know he was ready to roll.\n\nI'm thinking about adding a better seat for the upcoming Easy Rider season, and this place seemed to have a nice variety of well priced options to choose from... so I will be back.  They also do renting along with repairs and bike sales; it looks to be a pretty nice set up for those visiting for Spring Training.
