I'm a Vegas local and I go to Revolver all the time and always have fun. They have a great ladies night, fun themed nights and cool giveaways. The dj rocks and always plays great country, mixed with a bit of hip-hop and pop, just to give you a little bit of a break. Personally I've never had a problem with the bartenders. They are always really nice and helpful to me. I'd rather go to Revolver than any bar or club on the strip anyday.
