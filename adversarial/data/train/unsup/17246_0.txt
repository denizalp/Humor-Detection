I'll say the food wasn't worth the money. We dropped over $60.00 for 2 adults and 3 kids (2 of which shared a meal). The food was smoked nicely but it wasn't anything I couldn't do in my own backyard. We had a smorgasbord of different meats that were unfortunately dry. I will admit the pizza crust had rosemary in it and that was good. The iced tea tasted like water and the bbq sauce was served in ketchup bottles. The spicy bbq sauce was chunky (apparently homemade) so when you tried to get it out of the ketchup bottle tip it exploded everywhere. The interior was DATED and there were maybe 4 cars in the parking lot, 3 probably belonging to employees. 2 stars is simply because the staff was soo nice and helpful.\n\nUpdate: After receiving a back handed apology from the business's social media clown, it's obvious this business has no shame. I looked at other reviews for this business and the business got into a back and forth \"argument\" with another customer who didn't approve! Grow up! You can't talk to customers like that and be successful. You reply to reviews for shameless advertisement and then invite people back to eat your crappy food. You guys couldnt pack a parking lot if your business depended on it. And remember \"Jesus loves you!\"
