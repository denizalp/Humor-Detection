Dear Gordon f*cking Ramsay, Esq.\n\nDude, you need to chill.  You have like 275 shows on TV, most of which consist of you screaming your balls off at some poor sap because \"the soup was dry\".  I only ever watch Master Chef, and that's because you dispense earnest, humanizing advice that gives the impression that somewhere deep inside, you still kind of give a sh*t, which your image desperately needs.  But seriously, Master Chef Junior?  What's next?  Master Chef 'n Da Hood?  Master Chef in Space?\n\nAnd no, I'm not brainstorming for you.\n\nAnyway, the point is, we get it, you're a \"brand\", but we are so bombarded with your visage that it almost makes it seem like your place as culinary alpha-and-omega is maybe not arbitrary (no one can deny you are an accomplished chef) but seemingly self-appointed.  So, because of this, I went to BurGR (the only one of your Vegas restaurants I can consistently afford) with the firm predisposition to hate it.\n\nAnd based on the decor alone, at the beginning I totally did.  Your face is all over the damn place, your hostesses looked plucked out of a Hooters calendar, and the flames-and-metal decor is over-the-top and uninviting.  But, I have to say, once I sat my ass down and started stuffing my face, my mind changed quickly.  Been three times already, and it wasn't some kind of fluke.  The garden burger with the duck bacon and fried egg is as good a burger as I've ever had.  Definitely top three.  The fries with the fancy ketchup are absolutely delicious and the service was quick, effective and infallibly polite.\n\nI also have to give you kudos for keeping prices reasonable, at least comparatively speaking for a Vegas strip restaurant.  Fries are not included with the burgers but one order can easily feed two people, which is nice to know in advance.  You have an awesome beer selection and I was pleasantly surprised to see that for $6, I get a tall pilsner glass filled to the top.  The Innis & Gunn is a particularly awesome pairing with any of the burgers.\n\nAnyway, I still find you kind of odious, but food-wise, BurGR is firing on all cylinders, and ultimately that's what's important.\n\nThe water was a bit raw, though.
