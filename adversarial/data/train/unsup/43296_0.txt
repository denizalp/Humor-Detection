Food was good, but OH MY LARD was it SLOOOOWW. This was on mother's day 2013 and the place was full and there was 1 server, 1 busser, and I bet 1 cook. We were there 2 hours! :( The server was nice and felt bad and gave us this dried up homany looking thing while we waited an hour for our food. At least when the food finally came it was good. But we will not return, which is too bad because we live close to here.
