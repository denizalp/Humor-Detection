Went to Border Grill Sunday night using a Travelzoo voucher. We were given very limited options not listed on the original voucher. The food was very sub par. I ordered the \"spicy\" grilled shrimp and received what appeared to be bland, boiled shrimp atop a bed of watery rice. Literally. The rice was floating in broth and greens. My friend was given the suggestion of the seasonal fish, so he ordered it. The waitress failed to mention it was resting in a bowl of soup, despite the 100+ degree weather. The dessert, chocolate pie, was obviously premade thawed, and the drinks were overpriced and boring. The strawberry sangria tastes like Franzia. Overall, the food lacked any substance, as did our waitress, who kept telling us yes, then no, and blaming it on her manager for the night. Not worth even the Travelzoo prices.
