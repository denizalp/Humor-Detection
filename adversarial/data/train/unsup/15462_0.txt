To be honest, everyone overhyped this club for me!!!! I was so excited to go after half a year of not visiting Vegas.  I mean I was impressed and loved it still but I had imagine something more GRANDIOSE!\n\nIt has to be one of the nicest clubs on the strip though.  Since some of us were girls, we had free admission passes to XS that night.  Luckily i still have some leftovers for my next trip!  It is located inside Encore by the pool.  The pool is also open during the day though.. but turns into part of the nightclub by NIGHT!  We arrived in line by 10pm.  The line was pretty long already even with guestlist.  THe entrance is beautiful with the gold decor.  Thankfully, our group got bottle service which was located in the cabanas.  I liked the cabanas for the privacy you get!  Cabanas unfortunately are located all the way in the back on 2 levels.  It is too far from the dance floor!!  They make you drink your butt off then make you run all the way to the dance floor!  This screams out drunken falls which I believe I had an incident!!  We definitely had a discount on our bottle service but I don't think it was worth it at all.  We only had a bottle of Jack, Southern comfort, and Absolut Vodka.  Chasers included orange juice, redbull, and cranberry.  Shot glasses and cups were provided.  It was nice to be right next to the bathroom though!\n\nMusic was great.. The open air was great!  The pool was great especially to take off your heels and just put your feet in there!  Be careful though!  ( I wonder if they have lifeguards around to think of it... )  Great lighting!  I wouldn't mind coming back here!
