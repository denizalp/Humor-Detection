I spend a lot of time at Graze these days, so I'm going to share with you my 6-step program for doing Graze like a pro:   \n\n1. Order The Retox (cacha√ßa, maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne - what? what?) \n2. Graze from a basket of warm, salty, truffley popcorn. \n3. Enjoy that I'm-feeling-classy-even-though-I'm-wearing-snow-boots ambiance.\n4. Order another Retox (heads up, two Retoxes and you are totally toxed)\n5. Dine on any number of spectacular meals.\n6. Indulge your voyeuristic tendencies by staring out the walls of windows to crazy, crazy Madison. \n\nI know this formula works.  Last night, as I piled the bibimbap onto my chopsticks and into my face, a protest for Tibetan freedom marched around the Capitol.  And in the moment, as much as I wanted to free Tibet, I wanted another bite of that marinated tofu more.
