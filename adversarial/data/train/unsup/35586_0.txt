I visited here twice with my girlfriend. The first time, we had a decent experience and I don't remember having any complaints.\n\nWe revisited this place on July 2nd, 2016 at around 7 pm.. We wanted an outside table and were told there was a 15 minute wait and they would text us when the table was ready. They finally texted us around 20 minutes later and we were seated outside. At first, the hostess tried to seat us at the only table with a broken fan when it was over 100 degrees outside! After bringing that to her attention we were seated at a table with a working fan.\n\nWe sat at the table for 20 minutes. No one came to take our drink orders. No one asked us if we needed help. One waitress made eye contact with me 3 times and didn't say anything. \n\nWe ended up leaving and going to Wolfgang Puck next door which was excellent by the way.\n\nI would not recommend this place based on the non-existent service.
