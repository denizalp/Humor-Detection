Stopped her for brunch on a Mon before my drive back to Tucson. Honestly, I wasnt too impressed. I ordered the Classic Eggs Bene & a strawberry banana smoothie. The smoothie was average & the eggs bene took forever to come. When my food did finally come. it was a bit cold. The potatoes were bland and my eggs bene were average at best. The egg was poached well and the yolk was runny, but the english muffin & ham were a bit tough.
