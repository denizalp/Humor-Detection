What more can you ask for in a local ale house? The ambiance is great inside and out as well as the servers and bartenders are attentive and knowledgeable. You can have a drink at the bar then go eat outside with no problem. $5 pints, can't beat that. There food is reasonably priced as well and served in great portions. Not too filling but just enough.\nMy favorite meal is the RB&C. It's a hot roast beef sandwich with havarti cheese ( I believe ) with a horseradish sauce on a nice crusty roll and toasted to perfection. I myself, always, ALWAYS, get extra horseradish sauce on the side to dunk my sandwich  and chips. The sandwich is by far one of my favorite foods in AZ.\nThey even allow dogs on the patio which is great as I love to take my dog places with me.
