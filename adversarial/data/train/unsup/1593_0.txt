I came here for my daughter's cheer competition and I've never felt like I've been taken and  taking advantage of before in my life customer service really isn't customer service here when you're dime a dozen I have no other choice but to stay here 12\/16\/16   \n\n\nWhat a poor ass response from ur hotel. It's not about keeping customers anymore Lori. !  Back in the day u guys would have done something to make my stay alittle better and gave or comped  alittle something to make ur customer feel as they were first priority. ! Thanks again ! For a poor ass response !
