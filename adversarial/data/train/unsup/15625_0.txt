Since it was my first visit to Toronto, I definitely wanted to visit the CN Tower.  We found a parking garage practically across the street, which was convenient.  Walked over and purchased our tickets, which yes - are a bit pricey - but we figured it was a once in a lifetime experience.  We purchased the ticket that would allow us to visit the observation deck and the glass floor.  \n\nThe elevator ride up was quick (58 seconds) and then wow, what a view of the city - Toronto, in all her glory, from 1,136 feet in the air!  It was pretty cool seeing all the buildings from that perspective... and the water of Lake Ontario, too.  We also had a great view looking down into Rogers Centre where the Toronto Blue Jays play.\n\nAlso, when you're on the observation deck - check out the bathroom.  It's actually super cool!  ;-P\n\nWe then ventured down a short flight of stairs to the level with the glass floor.  Kind of crazy to be standing on the glass and looking at the long drop below you!  That would be a 1,122 foot fall!  On this same level, you can walk out onto an outside observation area that is caged in - and SUPER windy... wow!  Got a bit chilly out there, haha.  \n\nWhen you take the elevator ride down, the doors open up right into the gift shop.  Sneaky, sneaky.  So, we walked around and bought a few souvenirs, of course.  It was a cool experience.
