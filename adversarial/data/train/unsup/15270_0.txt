Hmm this place didn't stand out too much for me. \n\n1. The people were okay. I don't agree that most women they let in were HOT. Cause man... I saw some grenades. I honestly felt a bit overdressed next to some of the women. However, I did see some very pretty ladies. \n2. The guys were not the best looking either. Maybe it's just me but I'm not really into the super douche look. You know, glittery shirts, too-tight designer jeans, and receding hairline. Not all the guys were gross though, there were a few good ones.\n3. The bartenders were really sweet and very good-looking. Tip them well because they make some good drinks.\n4. The set up alone for the club was really nice - there was a pole you can dance on, where I watched some ladies work it, and a really cool waterfall-like deal. \n5. This place was PACKED! There were spots where you could breathe a bit, so it wasn't too bad. \n6. Pretty decent mix of music - I'm a hip hop fan myself but I shook my booty here too. They were rocking more electro-hip hop music. \n\nI had a pretty good time here, not the best but not bad at all. Would I go here again? Yes if I had another VIP pass, probably not if I didn't. The line was so ridiculous and big mama's were pushing through.
