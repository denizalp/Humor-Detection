This place is LEGIT.\n\nI wanted some real Mexican food and this place delivered. Order at the counter, grab your salsa from the salsa bar and wait for your tastebuds to thank you. I ordered a variety of tacos and sampled my friend's burrito. The tortilla was fresh and ALL of the meats (we ordered 4 different kinds) were delicious. Tripe was clean and flavorful. Agua fescas also didn't disappoint. We went right before the lunch hour and was able to grab a seat.\n\nHands down one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to.
