A couple of years later and I'm finally back here! I suggested this as a breakfast option with some friends who both live in Tempe but have never been here. Thankfully, they got here before me and were able to get in the long line to order. It was busy but didn't seem to take that long to move through the line and place our orders. We ordered a variety of food; one got the brioche toast, another got the eggs and poached fruit, and I ordered the vanilla bean crepé. We also ordered tea (earl grey and mint) and the Moroccan spiced latte).\n\nAfter we paid, we found a table in the corner and grabbed another chair from a table that wasn't using it. I love the remodel, they expanded the restaurant which allowed for twice as much seating. There was even a table outside, which was cute. Despite the amount of people ordering and in the place, our orders didn't seem to take too long. The teas came out very quick of course but the latte did take time. My friends and I enjoyed our dishes; I absolutely loved mine and how it was caramelized to give it a marshmallowy flavor. Service was good and the atmosphere was fun yet intimate enough for our conversation. My friends gave this place positive feedback. \n\nYay crepé bar!
