This is the kind of place that seems clubby and old school by its name and decor, but it really lacks the intimate qualities and cozy feel of a lot of other upscale restaurants in the area.\n\nThe decor is a little heavy and shopworn. Clientele is mostly 55+ and I get the impression that the menu hasn't changed in the last 20 years.\n\nFood is OK - we had steaks, tuna and salmon and from the looks of the sauce, I suspect that the entrees all got started at the same time and then the fish sat while the steak finished cooking.\n\nOverpriced for what you get and the service, while OK, is not outstanding.
