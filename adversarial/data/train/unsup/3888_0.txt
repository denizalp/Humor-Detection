Growing up in Brooklyn, I was no stranger to stories of the mob and organized crime. Like most from the tristate area, I had\/have a fascination with organized crime, those involved with it, to include those on the \"right\" and \"wrong\" side of the law. \n\nThe Mob Museum is the national museum of organized crime and law enforcement, and dedicated to providing museum guests with the history of organized crime in America. Run solely by volunteers (at least the day of our visit), each museum employee is a plethora of knowledge and passionate about their job. \n\nThe museum itself is broken up into three floors which each offering interactive exhibits, films and other displays which allows visitors to get a full understanding of the true reach of organized crime in America as well as law enforcement's response. From its early beginnings to present day operations no piece of information is left uncovered and everything is done in a tasteful manner. \n\nIf you're an organized crime buff, involved in law enforcement, or have other ties this place is definitely worth a visit.
