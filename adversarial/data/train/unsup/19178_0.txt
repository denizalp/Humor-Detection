Durants is a great option for a nice dinner or to celebrate a special occasion. I have to say that I enjoyed the look and vibe of this old school, romantic, mobster-ish joint a tad more than I enjoyed the actual food.  Had to go with the prime rib, which was good and large so come with an appetite!  You definitely want to make a reservation but luckily I was able to get in same day (during spring training) So that was much appreciated. \n\nTip-have a martini!
