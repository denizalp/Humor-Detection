I have to say I have not been to a Sears in a very long time.\nHowever, this one has been here for a long time and it is not too bad actually.\nMy boyfriend buys tools and other things that he needs from Sears. They carry a lot of items that he needs. So they are very good with that. \nThey do have a really good return policy and you have to love that if you get something you really cannot use.\nI myself went in to the Watch repair Dept. I got a new battery for my watch. They changed the battery and give you a one year guarantee on the battery.\nWhich is great for me because, I use a lot of batteries on watches.\nThey also give you a punch card so that for every 3 batteries you get, the fourth is free.
