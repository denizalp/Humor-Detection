The thin crust pizza is your typical New York thin style, and was pretty tasty.  The crust has a garlic-buttery taste to it, which was a nice surprise.\n\nThe pizza is good, but it's NOT what I come back for time and time again.  Their \"New York Cheesesteak\" is FANTASTIC!  I'm a big fan of all forms of meat\/cheese subs from various places, and this one is pretty unique.  A french rolled filled with very tasty meat, onions, mushrooms, and an alfredo\/gravy sauce...all sealed in the bread by some provolone baked on top.\n\nThe place is big and clean, and the location is easy to get to(only a block off the 202).  I've only been there during lunch hours, so I can't comment on the dinner experience.
