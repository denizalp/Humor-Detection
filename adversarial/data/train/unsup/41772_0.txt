Our party of eight came in to an empty place to celebrate my birthday.  We sat outside to enjoy the live music which consisted of a guy playing a guitar.  We ordered food and drinks and were enjoying ourselves until the resident street people came around ...along with the owners.  As the woman owner walked in she appeared to try and become confrontational with us but then went inside.  Just after that, our party was told we wouldn't be served anymore and were cut off.  After we explained that none of us were driving they graciously let us stay for a brownie with a candle in it. We were then told we had to leave after I went in to talk to the waitress and the male owner tried to stop and listen to what I was saying to her which made me stop talking until he walked away.  That's when we were cut off.  It was a clear and vulgar display of power. It seemed as though the owners bought a bar so that they and their friends could drink.  I can see now why it was empty.  Good luck with that.
