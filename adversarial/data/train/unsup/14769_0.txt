One star for the pizza being good.\n\nOne star for the drinks being strong.\n\nThe rest is very controversial. The price is overpriced, the service was young and unskilled or not well trained. It had been opened for a month or two. I wait a year before everything is right. Manager should be more receptive to customers wants and needs. They should not charge for bread and birthday cake, after-all, we spent over $200 for all of us on drinks and a few pizzas. \n\nI would not recommend this place although the place is nice and has potential, it's really not all that great. I would suggest changing the menu, no pizzas, no sandwiches, just some fusion \/ gourmet food. Maybe hire a sommelier or a master \/ executive chef???
