I work at a call center and we often order out. A lot of times we use Grub Hub or Eat 24, but today we found a El Taco Feliz menu and ordered over the phone. The gentleman who took our order was kind, professional and accomodating to special requests. The food came quickly, cleanly and arranged beautifully. Beyond that, the driver was courteous and had smiles for days.\n I can tell you that in a call center people are like wild animals when it comes to food...we could barely keep them off of our gorgeous taco salads. The smell filled the call center floor and like a pack of ravenous hyenas they circled our desks...we seriously thought we might have to go to blows to defend our food. \nHaving customer service as a profession you learn that most people regard customer service reps as human toilets, it was a nice reward to be treated kindly by somebody in the service industry and it feels better to let them know that we appreciate their service. Thank you El Taco Feliz for giving us more than just a great lunch!
