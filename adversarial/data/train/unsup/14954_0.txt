Another thing I love about Phoenix is their low gas prices contrasted to the prices here in LA. I have not seen gas prices under $2 in a long time, so it took a little getting used to ;-)\nI had half a tank, so I dropped twenty cash to fill it to the top. Well, it turns out I only needed half of that to fill the rest of the tank. So I went back inside to get the change.\nSince I paid with credit card, I just needed a receipt indicating the true charge. It took a while for the employee to print it for me, but she did it.\nThe convenience store is ok, but not as meticulous as other stations in the area. It served its purpose adequately.
