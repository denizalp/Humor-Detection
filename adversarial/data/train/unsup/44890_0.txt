This place is so, so good with my cats. Just absolutely stellar. My male cat is prone to blockages, particularly when he's under stress (and this can sometimes be sparked when I go out of town). I now take advantage of the boarding facilities with him and I haven't had an issue since! (Before I made the decision to board him, I had relied on having trusted loved ones check in on him at home, but he still seemed stressed and I feared they wouldn't know what to do or even recognize his symptoms if he got sick). VCA even allows me to call and check in on him during their business hours. I leave him with his favorite toy, blanket, and food, and now we can both have stress-free vacations! Thank you VCA!
