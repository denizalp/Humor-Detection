I've had experience with acupuncture in the past. It was nothing like the care I receive from Ashlee. She is compassionate and caring. Most importantly she is a master of her healing art. I have been receiving chemo treatments and the side effects have been horrible. One treatment with Ashlee and I can tell almost immediately the difference. I can't express it enough, Ashlee knows what she is doing, does it exceptionally well, and cares immensely about her patients.
