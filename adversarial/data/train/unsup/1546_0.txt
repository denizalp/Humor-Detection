It's Mandarin Part Deux.  I find the food slightly better than Mandarin but not by much.  Don't know if that means anything though.  Its standard mass produced food and you can expect Manchu Wok quality.  On a plus side, they have a chocolate fountain for all you chocolate lovers.  I'm neither a fan of chocolate or Manchu Wok, hence the low rating.\n\nService: limited as it's a \"get your own buffet\" 2\/5\nAmbiance: same as Mandarin 2.5\/5\nFood: 2.5\/5 (extra star for chocolate fountain)
