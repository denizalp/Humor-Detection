For future visits, I will only be about the \"Chicken Curry Noodle Soup\" (CCNS).  I tried being a good husband and getting other items for variety's sake on past visits; it's my wife's favorite as well...that's over now.  \n\nThe CCNS consists of a thick, rich, hearty broth that touches my soul like Louis Armstrong singing \"What a Wonderful World\".  It's easy to taste upon the first spoonful of this glorious curryness that it's not something that can just be whipped up.  Those chickens have been simmering in broth for hours, if not days.  The generous amount of meat in the bowl makes me love it even more.  \n\nNot that there's anything wrong with their rare beef pho or those meat entrees where the grains of rice looks all cute and snuggled up under the canopy of a perfectly fried egg, but that's all vice president\/runner up type stuff.  Next time I order, I plan on just saying \"Call me Obama and bring me that fucking awesome stuff in a bowl.\"
