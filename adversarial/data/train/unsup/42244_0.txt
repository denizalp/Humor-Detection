Rebekha Sushi 2 go is s small restaurant that offers takeout suishi meals. The place is not very busy due to the LRT construction nearby. Foot traffic has dropped a lot for the restaurant.\n\nThe staff was very nice. I ordered a black dragon roll for dinner. It was pretty good.\n\nI will probably return since it is close to where I live.
