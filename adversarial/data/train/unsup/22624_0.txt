I have been to Sake Rok multiple times whether with business colleagues or even my mother, and every time was fun delicious and consistent!\n\nMy favorite bites, in no particular order:\n\n-salmon sashimi\n-tuna belly toro sashimi\n-mushroom side dish (I can't remember the name, but it's amazing)\n-tuna tacos\n-HONEY. TOAST.\n\nI used to always get honey toast from Ichiza, but Sake Rok's really is better. The cubed brioche inside with butter, cinnamon and honey, with their vanilla custard is unreal. Save room for it.\n\nAnd, having grown up on N'sync and Backstreet Boys, I personally love the throwback performances the staff does. *Pro tip* Park in the parking garage of the Monte Carlo and scan Nevada ID (or borrow a friend's!) to get free parking! I'm going to try to limit myself this week, but head over there soon!
