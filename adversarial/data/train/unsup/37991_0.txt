Had dinner here and it was fantastic! We ordered the chicken coconut special and the butter chicken special. Both dishes were aromatic and delicious! The chef\/owner came out to visit and check on us during or meal. All the entrees are naturally  gluten free. I also have some other dietary restrictions and they were very accommodating! We will definitely be back! The atmosphere, service, and food were all excellent!
