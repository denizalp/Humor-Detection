Words cannot describe. The people who own this place are really kind and support our troops avidly. The cookies make you speechless. The chic chip are warm and perfect, but the snickerdoodles and peanut butter are just as good. When i come home to pittsburgh, this is a must. They will deliver via mail too. They are worth any cost.  Nancy B is a beautiful kind and generous person and I'm glad that people like her exist...
