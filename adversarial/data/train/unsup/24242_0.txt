Ruth's Chris Steak House never fails to deliver-- its also right by the ice rink and Christmas tree so you can check that out while waiting for a table! Service is incredible. Waitress was super attentive. I was super thrilled to head downtown for a break from the hustle and bustle for a night of steak, beers, whiskey, lobster mac and cheese, and potatos of some form. \n\nI have given up red meat as a result of a recent health-care related scare, so I opted for the lobster mac and cheese, and a side of the potatos au gratin to bring home for a friend to sample. My friend's (lets call him Sam) rib-eye was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and my friend Zeke who is vegan (I don't know why we invited him) ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna. I tried some of this and it was some of the best Seared Ahi Tuna I have ever eaten. It came sitting atop a bed of colorful veggies! Idk what veggies they were but damn sis. They were thicc! \n\nThe night was going great.\n\nMy only complaint, is that the potatos that I was so excited about, were unfortunately burned while the staff was making them in the kitchen. My friend Zeke and I had some really pressing plans afterward and we had already waited a long time for the food, so waiting for more potatos was not an option. I opted to remove the potatos from the check. I was so thankful that I wasn't charged for the burned potatos. Thank you to the entire staff of Ruth's Chris, especially the waitress who removed the potatos from the check!\n\nIf anybody knows how good the potatos from Ruth's Chris Steak House taste, please let me know so I can update this yelp review to make it more accurate to the culinary\/food quality element of Ruth's Chris...\nThanks in advance and thanks again to the staff at Ruths Chris---
