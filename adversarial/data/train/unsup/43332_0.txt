I wanted to try somewhere new, BJ said okay!  We picked Avenue B together.  Since they were not on Open Table, I was thinking that maybe they didn't take reservations.  I guess I should have called....\n\nTurns out, we had no problem table getting a table on a Saturday night.  This restaurant is small.  Probably only seats about 50 people.  We got a table along the wall.  The server was nice, but not overly helpful.  I mean it's like he was showing up for work, but not all that interested in it.  That's okay, we didn't really need his help with the menu..\n\nWe started with a chalkboard special - beet salad.  It was great.  Yummy butter lettuce, golden beets, granny smith apples and candied walnuts.  The bread basket was also great, we were especially in love with the nutty bread.  For our meals, I got the Wagyu beef meatloaf.  So good, especially loved the goat cheese & chive whipped potatoes and huge pile of crispy onions.  What I didn't love was the raw spot in the middle.  BJ got a rustic portobello & grilled pepper lasagna.  He really liked it, I thought that the flavors were awesome.  \n\nFor dessert, we shared a french toast bread pudding with popcorn and ice cream.  I am a lover of dessert, but this one was really a fail.  Our meal was good, minus a couple hick-ups.  We will try them, again in the future.  Also, don't forget - BYOB!
