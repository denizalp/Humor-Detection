I took my parents to the market one night to experience what I consider to be an amazing part of Charlotte. While we were there we decided we would grab a pizza to snack on. It was the first time I had ordered pizza from them, as there are so many choices in the market! I have to tell you we all loved it! Loved loved loved! It truly was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Between the crisp crust and the fresh toppings, it was amazing. It's been about three weeks now and we still talk about that pizza like we had just eaten it today! My parents said it's one of the best they've ever had. Without a doubt we will be back soon!!
