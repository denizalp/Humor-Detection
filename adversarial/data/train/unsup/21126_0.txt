They have decent residents leaving when their leases are up and are not vetting the replacements! Decent residents cannot use the pool area on weekends because of the thuggish behavior of a relatively few people! Management is not interested in controlling this behavior and seem to be friendly with the trouble makers! when they have to fill the new building when it opens the place will be an overpriced housing project!
