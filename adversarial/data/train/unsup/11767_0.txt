This Lee's Discount Liquor is better kept than most other ones. It is also conveniently located close to my house. The cashier's and workers here are super nice. I have to admit that I love buying all my wines and beers here because they have the best prices in town! They also have really good sales where you can get half off some of their wines. I love it. Other than wishing they were opened later, I cannot complain about anything else. Will always be my preferred liquor store.
