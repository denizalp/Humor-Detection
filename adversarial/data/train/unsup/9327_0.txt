One thing I could say about this outlet was, SPYDER!!! I don't see many outlet that has SPYDER outlet. During this visit, I don't really need anything from them, but it's nice to see their items were on DISCOUNT! Yes, I'm a snowboarder and SPYDER is so expensive on retail, at least $350 and above, except kids size. This outlet has shown me that I can have it for about $200 or less, sweet deals! \n\nLoved the outdoor shopping and the watermist. For the first time, I see no lines at Coach store either. The parking structure is a bonus, plenty enough for those Vegas visitors. Located just right by the freeway, you can't miss it! It was my first time coming here 2 weekends ago and I'd say, I'll be back in the near future!!!
