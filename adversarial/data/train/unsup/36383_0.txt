The service can sometimes be lacking and the quality is not quite up there with other sushi places in the area, but for this thrifty lover of sushi you cannot beat Sushi Ken!\n\nMy wife and I can order miso soup, edamame and three plates of sushi and walk out playing around $25 with tip.  Best deal in Ahwatukee IMHO!
