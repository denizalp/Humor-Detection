Two words.. HOW rude .. I usually go to Nordies to stock up on my Chanel makeup.. but staying out at Marks lately.. I opted to try the Macys makeup department at Paradise Village.. The Clarins lady walked up to me and wanted to seat me for a small makeover.. I politely told her , 'no thanks, but is there a Chanel counter here'.. I snootily got the 'Umm, NO..' with the roll of the eye.. alrighty then.. I will give it a 2 star.. because I loved the fact that the jeans department had more of a selection then the Joes Jeans selection at my beloved Nordies at Fashion Square.. but rudeness doesnt warrant anything more than 2 no matter how great the selection is... boo on you, Macys Clarins lady..
