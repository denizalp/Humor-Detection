really cool hookah spot! It's not trendy or pretentious and you don't have to call 3 days ahead to get a table... which is handy because we're usually downtown in cute shoes before we figure out exactly what to do and where we're going. \n\nanyway, there's happy hour & cool people & and the food smelled DELICIOUS\n\ni vote go, early - late - & often
