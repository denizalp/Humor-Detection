Liverpool House provided one of the best meals of my life.  I came to Montreal for my bachelor party and we were lucky to get a reservation at Liverpool House for seven on a Saturday night.  Awesome table on the back patio, and we could not ask for a more perfect setting.  The waiter was awesome, and provided great service.  He pretty much ordered everything for us, and everything he brought out was amazing.  I liked everything I tasted but their beef dishes and their lobster spaghetti were out of this world.  Thank you Liverpool house for being a highlight of our weekend in Montreal. Cheers!
