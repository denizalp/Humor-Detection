I wanted to update my review because I think a lot of people's complaints with Melt can be so easily helped if they just knew a little bit more about how to do this right! \n\nThe wait is long.. DUH. The wait is long because they have a great product and a really fun vibe. Here's an easy solution for you that I have found really helps me out: Go with one or two other people max and sit at the bar. Hover around for maybe 20 minutes and I know for a fact that you can snag a spot at that bar. Full menu is served up there and it cuts your wait time in at least half, if not way more! \n\nCan't cut the group down? Go there early, put your name in and wander around the neighborhood. There are plenty of shops. If it's nice out, you can even take a quick drive over to Lakewood Park. They are pretty good at estimating the wait time here. Wander around a bit then grab a beer and the wait won't bother you at all. \n\nMy last suggestion for wait time: Put in a to go order, head across the street to World of Beer and wait for them to call you when it's ready. Pick it up, bring it back to WOB! You can bring outside food there and this will cut down the time waiitng for food by a LOT! \n\nThe food might seem expensive but I have literally not eaten the whole thing since I was younger and never seemed to get full. I now eat half and save the rest. Almost every sandwich here heats up easily the next day. I use the oven so it's nice and crunchy still. The fries re-heat well, too! The $10 price for a sandwich seems way more reasonable when you stretch it out for two meals. \n\nThe amazing beer selection is still a huge plus. The spinach and artichoke dip is my favorite ever, hands down. Spicy and amazing. The service is always great. It may be a bit slow but the kitchen is small and the staff is so friendly and fun that they make up for it every time. \n\nJust know that you are not getting health food and plan ahead for the wait. You'll have a great time!
