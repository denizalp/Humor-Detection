I tried the fish tacos and a bean and cheese enchilada style burrito for the kid. \n\nThe fish was perfectly cooked and tasted good. The extra toppings were fresh as usual. The salsa bar was a perfect complement to the tacos. \n\nThe burrito was a small football filled with beans and cheese. Topped with enchilada sauce. The sauce seemed a bit salty and the kid said it was gross. I liked it. \nShe ate the insides out and picked the tortilla apart to get the \"dry\" sections. \n\nStaff was awesome as usual. The building was a tad bit warm on the seating side.
