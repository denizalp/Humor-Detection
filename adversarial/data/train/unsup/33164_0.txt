This place kinda sucks. Food sucked, tiny portions too. Moscow mule sucked, was really a vodka soda. White whine sangria sucked, was pure white wine only. Ice cream \"Sunday\" sucked, it was scoop of ice cream with syrup on top. Food comes or at weird times, meals came before appetizers. \n\nOh and the 3 hour wait to play golf didn't help\n\nSeems to be a hype about this place not sure why\n\nWaiter was great that's about it
