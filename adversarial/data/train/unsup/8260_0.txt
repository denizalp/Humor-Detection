Came here late on a weekend night needing to grub. No other restaurants seemed to be open in the MB so we were directed here. Found a late night menu that was a bit pricey but whatevs...we wanted fries, wings, sandwiches...they seemed to have all the things even tho late night menu was limited. Overall not a bad place. Food was decent but nothing out of the normal fare ( wings, fries etc) just had an issue with service as server seemed hurried and made a snarky comment when\nMy friend was trying to pick a beer...mos def not my first choice...but if you're in MB late night not a bad option...
