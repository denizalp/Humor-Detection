I will never return...\n\nI had a simple warranty repair that needed to be done so I called ahead to verify I would be ok to bring in the vehicle. Once there, it was a surprise that I showed up and it could take several hours. My daughter and I sat in the waiting room for several minutes where we were regaled with stories about how drunk the staff got the night before and their child custody issues. I left to go look at some the cars and was shocked to see that this dealership charges several thousand dollars above MSRP for \"regional demand\". I didn't know there was such a demand for a Ford Escape. We used true car on an f-150 to find out they would be willing to sell it for almost 10k less than what they were offering. Amazing.\n\nIf I were the owner I would do three things quickly:\n\nTrain your staff on the basics of customer service\n\nRealize that shoppers are more savvy than you think and create an environment based on modern sales tactics.\n\nStop charging ridiculous sticker prices that scream \"stupid tax\" \n\nYou may ride a giant cow on your commercials for Earnhardt Ford, but it doesn't mean that your customers want to be treated like cattle.
