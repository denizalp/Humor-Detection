Oh my gosh these sandwiches are out of this world delicious.  I'm ashamed that it took me so long to try this place.  It's not just the sandwiches that are good but the salads and desserts, too!  Everything, is delicious.  You can tell this place is the real deal because they make food like the love doing it.  My favorite sandwich is the proscuitto, yum!
