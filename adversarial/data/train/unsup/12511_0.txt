I can't believe no one has written a review here yet on the good ol' Smithfield Cafe!  Maybe it's because it's been around so long and has been such a good ol' reliable that everyone just takes it for granted.  I guess I'm guilty of that too.  It's been a long while since I've eaten here.\n\nBut this place has been here many years.  It looks like it's still caught in some kind of time-warp.  They have maroon bar stools, yellow walls, wood paneling, red drop-down ceiling, green floor tiles.  Its menu is strictly the beef sandwich-n-beer type and they still serve their traditional Cobb Salad or Devonshire Sandwich.\n\nI was here last night with some co-workers.  We were celebrating someone's birthday.  As I said, I haven't eaten here in awhile and I don't drink.  So I don't know how the alky-holic beverages are.  But everyone else seemed to be enjoying the booze.  And the atmosphere here is still old-school great.  Well next week I'll have to hit it up for lunch.
