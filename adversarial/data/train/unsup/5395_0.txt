I have a bad habit of going to work out and then stopping to get really horrible food to regain my strength. Donuts it is! And these ones are amazing. It's kind of hidden in the Smith's parking lot but definitely worth it. Donuts are cheap cheap cheap here and tasty. I usually don't even get all the way out of the parking lot before I have devoured my cake donut with sprinkles (I'm still a kid and I still like sprinkles). \n\nGet there early--I got there around 10am yesterday and they were out of donut holes, glazed, and many many other varieties. Cash only, so don't forget or else you won't get your donut sugar high.
