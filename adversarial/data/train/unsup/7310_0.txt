I love In-N-Out (What Californian doesn't like this place???)! If you seriously never had one of their burgers then you gotta find one ASAP! I hardly ever rate fast food places with 4 stars.\n\nI usually order the double double with grilled onions and I get the bun extra toasted. For fries I get them \"well-done\" which basically means they are cooked a bit longer so they are extra crispy (just like how all fries should be!). The food is just addicting. I literally stuffed my face yesterday and couldn't stop eating my meal until everything was gone :(, I also tried their shake, but I am not really a fan since it is pretty thick and I couldn't even drink it with my straw xD.\n\nOverall, this place has cheap, good quality, and tasty food. The establishment is pretty clean and the staff is really nice and friendly. The fact that this place has a bunch of cars in the drive-through even at night is a clear indication of how awesome this place is! I even prefer this place over Shake Shack (not really sure why that place is so hyped up).
