Really hit or miss.\n\nOne day there was nothing but crap,\nanother day,\nI found a gorgeous formal gown with some beading and threading flaws for 11 bucks!\nI fixed it up and hemmed it for 30 bucks and now its a top tier prom gown.\n\nI also found a variety of size 4 shoes on different occasions.\nBeing a super petite size, its difficult to find my size,\nbut this store has it for women with itty bitty feet.\nHeels, wedges, you name it.\n\ndownside: Some of the merchandise is dirty, damaged, or ugly,\nmerchandise display is messy,\nbut if you look hard enough you'll find something for a steal on a lucky day.\n\nDownside: lines are LONG, no returns, crowded on weekends,\nchallenging to find parking.
