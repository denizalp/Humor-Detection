This is a great little local boutique with awesome handmade house items, jewelry, and tchotchkes. I definitely am keen on the fact that their items are locally made, which isn't the easiest thing to find or get while near the Strip. \n\nI would consider a lot of the stuff vintage\/retro, but their selection goes beyond that simple classification. Their prices on certain things can seem a little high, but most things are fair to greatly priced, especially considering what you are buying! Check out their collection of camera lights! (And not your typical camera lights...lol)\n\nWould I come back here? Yes. I will be back next time I'm at the centre.\nWould I recommend to others? You betchya.
