So I have not been to this store but did go to the kiosk in the PV mall. I was not impressed. The only reason I was there is because my fiance had bought some tire caps for her air valves on her BMW. \n\nThey did not fit. So the next day when we went to return them, the girl would not give her cash back for her purchase and explained that she could only refund the money on the credit card used for the transaction. We left this at home.\n\nThe girl then proceeded to tell me that the caps should fit her car. I tried to explain to the girl that they were not real BMW caps, and she argued with me and said that they were and they came right from the BMW dealership. Since I have owned two BMW's I knew this was not true...especially since the box they came in said MADE IN CHINA...you idiot!!!!!\n\n I did not know that BMW made its parts out of sub standard metal out of China. I thought they were a German company and they used high shine chrome for there caps. \n\nThis girl tried to insult my intelligence. This girl was ridiculous, this girl looked like she had just come from a two day drinking binge, a wrinkled shirt, messed up hair and was in general beat. Not very convincing or professional by any means.\n\n I understand that you hate your life cause you work at a Kiosk in the mall but seriously try just a little bit. Worse service I have ever experienced. Total fail at customer service, and at product knowledge.\n\nI was extremely pissed off at this point, so I am YELPING ABOUT IT!!! AVOID AVOID AVOID this company!
