Worst Ulta I've ever been to. The person working at benefits brow is racist! She knew I had an appointment and was waiting right by the counter for almost an hour, I did not get any greeting or even acknowledgement for my presence. She continued on chatting with the girl she had on the chair and taking her time. It was clear she did not want to serve me. I've been going to benefits brow for two years now and go every month. This is by far the worst I've experienced. It's like they opened up another branch and put the worst staff in there! I doubt this branch will make much money given their service level now
