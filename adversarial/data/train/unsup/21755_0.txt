Food was okay, but service was absolutely abysmal!  Worst I have ever seen in America.  Our server seemed like a 15 yr old kid, and he didn't shy away from making us feel unwelcome.  I got there several minutes after my friend did, and soon after sitting down, got asked my this juvenile if I was ready to order.  I wasn't and he was displeased.  He rarely came to our table the whole night, and completely lacked patience and manners.\n\nEven worse, a second much more chubbier shorter round faced balding waiter got into a fight with an older middle-aged customer.  This customer was mad that his party had already waited for an hour or so to be served dinner and were never told to expect that kind of wait.  The chubby waiter got mad at him in return and said he would call the police if this customer did not pay up for what he had eaten so far (I assume the customer already got his appetizers).  Customer and his wife then got into an argument with each other.  The now stammering customer got mad at the waiter and at his wife.  Customer got up to leave, but his chair fell down with the jacket on it.  Customer attempted to pick up his jacket, but it fell down and he had to redo the pickup.  I forgot to say that this customer was very tall, but he was clearly not co-ordinated.  The chubby shorter rude waiter was somewhat scary looking, but still not Mike Tyson scary.  I was on the customer's side, but not because he had to wait for the food.  More so because both the waiters were terrible.  The only other waiter was quite nice, but they clearly needed more waiters on this busy night.\n\nAll in all, an entertaining change of pace in my generally safe suburban life, but not fun for many customers who were there.  Some left because they realized that dinner would be served an hour after they ordered, while others felt uncomfortable after the scene.
