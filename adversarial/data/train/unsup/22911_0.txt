Got in for free with line cuts after going through a promoter for my friend's bachelorette party. \n\nDrinks are typically priced for Vegas.... $15 for a shot of goose.\n\nThe pool area at this club is so gorgeous. Best i've seen in Vegas. \n\nMusic is mostly house, but there is a floor with hip hop.  \n\nMy only gripe is the insane amount of stairs you have to go up and down when you're trying to navigate your way around the club. Also, we got lost trying to find the exit. It's like a maze in there when you're not completely sober.
