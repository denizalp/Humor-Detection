It is great to now have some many choices for Ethiopian food. We used to only go to Ehiopian house, but now there are so many more restaurants. Lalibela is definitely one of the more reasonably priced. \n\nWe went on a Friday night and definitely come before 7pm because for some reason there were a few couples waiting for a table around 7:30pm. \n\nThere were three of us, very hungry, so we ended up ordering a meat combination and a vegetarian platter. There were two dishes that we liked on the meat combination, but everything on the vegetarian platter was amazing. We also ordered two ginger tea, basically yellow label tea with slices of ginger. We liked it.\n\nDefinitely going back, with or without groupon. Make sure you wash your hands really good before leaving the restaurant, or else your fingers will smell (their spices are delicious, except when it lingers on your fingers for two days)
