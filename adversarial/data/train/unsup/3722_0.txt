This is a review for the inpatient facility, which I had not visited until Thanksgiving week when I found out an old friend was there. Not the type of place you want to have a reunion, but this was a special man who whose health began to deteriorate upon admission. Rather than leave words unsaid or hugs missed: I smiled through tears and went. He was in end stage cirrohsis and our talk was poignant, loving and healing. \n\nIt is a lovely facility, the staff all had the same welcoming attitudes and compassion demonstrated by the home hospice care part of this organization a family friend had used. Some folks (like my sweet friend) don't have family to care for them and others choose the inpatient facility. Both are outstanding. \n\nVisitors were allowed to come and go and some were able to make it from out of town. It was such a difficult time seeing such a young man I hadn't seen in a while under these circumstances; it was also beautifu to see so many friends come by in his last hours. Though he had been away from Vegas for several years, he was a beloved member of our community. His Pastor was there to offer spritual support and he was never alone. It was a just few short hours after I left that the call he'd passed came from another long time friend. \n\n\nI'd like to think that once he passed from this world, he was reunited at the Rainbow Bridge with his beloved Jordan before being greeted by family who went before him. RIP JF: you were a good man!\n\n\"Hernt!!!\" \n\nYelp 100 Challenge
