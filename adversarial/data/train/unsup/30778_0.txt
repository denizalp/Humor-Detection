This was my first time ever in the side of a Hobby Lobby. I had to pick up a few things and thought this place might have them. It did.\n\nVery large store they have everything here.  The store was clean and the staff was friendly.\n\nI'll definitely keep this place in mind for next time I need something they might carry.
