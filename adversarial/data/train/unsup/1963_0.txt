I took my car into this shop for a brake job.  And the guy who ran it told me that I needed rotors and pads all the way around.  Now remember, this is a \"discount auto repair\".  He informs me that this is going to cost me $599, which includes an oil change.  Wow, I can get the parts for less than $100 at penny pincher auto.  \n\nSo I told him that I couldn't afford $600 for a brake job, and just do the oil change and put it back together.  I go pick up the car, and what do you know, he charges me $75!  That's just for an oil change.  Once again, this is \"DISCOUNT AUTO REPAIR\".  I have never paid more than $40 for an oil change, never.  \n\nSo this weekend I had a friend look at my car (he is an ASE certified master mechanic) and what do you know?  All I need are pads on the front of my car.   Basically a $30 part.  And lucky me, I almost get ripped off for $600.  \n\nNow I'm sure that I probably would have had new parts all the way around.  Basically a parts change.  For no apparent reason.  He must have thought he saw \"stupid female\" tattooed on my forehead.  Lucky me,  I am not a stupid female, and when I heard that outrageous price, I was smart enough to have it checked out.  Sure, I had to drive to Tucson for it, but it was certainly worth a $30 tank of gas.  And a $30 part.  \n\nBasically, if you go here, notwithstanding all the 5 star reviews, this guy may try to rip you off.  Because, without a doubt, he tried to do that with me.  I'm lucky I just walked away with my $75 oil change.
