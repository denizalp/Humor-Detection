One of my favorite places to shop. Located in the Fourm Shops on The Strip, it has a very \"boutique\" feel to it. The last time I was in here Lauren Conrad was shopping as well. You know a place is good if this fashionista is here. A lot of the tops are very blousy, which I love. \nYou can find an outfit for any occasion here. The staff is always very accommodating and helpful. It almost like they're personal shoppers, they really help you put together outfits. 5 stars!
