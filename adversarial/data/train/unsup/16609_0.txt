You are definately paying for the atmosphere and location as other poeple have said. This is a great hang out spot. Specially for someone who enjoys tequila's because they have a ton of tequila's. The food I found to be a little off for the most part. At first I thought maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, then other people said their food was not very good either. I would give their guac a 5 our of 5. The queso a 1 out of 5. It was horrible. Out of a group of about 10 it was barely touched. Usually queso get demolished at any mexican restaurant and your asking for more chips to finish it off. Not the case here unfortunately. I had their barbacoa for my entree. Im not really sure how the barbocoa actually is because it was drenched in their barbeque sauce. The sauce was not very good unfortunately. I did think that the servers and the drinks were real good.
