A group of us stopped in here for dinner and I really enjoyed the meal. The service however was a bit surly, nothing that was too crazy, but I've rarely had such a disdainful server. I was almost afraid to ask for things, you know, like a drink because of her scorn when we tried to order.\n\nThey have great oyster specials if you like them raw. I think from Sunday to Thursday they are $1 each. Our table shared a few items and so I was able to try the Steak Frites, the roasted cauliflower, the Brussels sprouts, and the pork belly. All of it was pretty good and while I enjoyed the meal I'm not sure I would go back. The price of a meal is pretty high considering the service and for me that's kind of a deal breaker.
