I was recommended to this shop from the owner of 'Southwest Classics'. \n\nI only went in for my annual oil change. I had made an appointment a few days in advance as it seems they are a very busy shop! Which is a good thing. I usually go to the local pep boys or one of those mini oil change locations. Things have changed. I now give my business to T&M.\n\nThe guys are all super nice and efficient. I was in at 1pm and out by 2pm. I usually pay a higher price elsewhere and Im not that happy, I paid a few dollars less and Im super happy! My car always runs like a dream car and I take care of it as it always will be. \n\nDefinitely recommend. They work on all GM cars, some imports and I think Ford.\n\nCheck them out
