Meh, not that impressed. First time here and I had to mortgage my house to finance a cup of soup. $3.75 for an 8 oz cup of soup is a rip-off, in my opinion. I'd probably have to donate a kidney for a full bowl! \n\nFor my entree I ordered the half Panini and side salad. They do give a generous portion of greens, along with nice chunks of avocado, which was nice, considering it was just a side salad. The grape tomatoes were fresh and super sweet. The dressing, while there was plenty of it, I found to be a little on the bland side. I believe it was a vinaigrette, but it could've used more vinegar. It was missing some zing. On to the panini. I got the MAD Cuban. The cashier indicated it was a good choice with his nod of approval. It was just ok. It could have used a little more ham and dijon. \n\nOverall, I'm not sure whether I'll be back or not. I think I could go either way. One thing is for sure: I won't be ordering soup again from here. I'd like to keep my house. \n\n\nPS -  A note to all Scottsdale lunch eateries: Not everyone who spends time in Scottsdale is wealthy. The prices some of you charge is ridiculous for the amount of food given,  and sometimes even the quality of the food\/service. Thank you, and now back to your regularly, scheduled review.
