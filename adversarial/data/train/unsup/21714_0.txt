Okay, before I start I am not racist. My favorite type of food is Mexican Food and I am Mexican, so this is not influenced by racism. I got food here for both breakfast and dinner and both were not pleasant. For breakfast my family and I ordered some burritos at the Drive-Thru, but the star of this story was the bacon and egg burrito. We specified that the burrito be bacon and egg, yet when we got burritos they were STEAK and egg(!). My mom told the lady their mistake and she said that they would fix it. We were given back the burritos and headed home. Once home I took a bite of the burrito and it was STEAK(!)(Again). We went back and had them fix the order and they did. However, the burritos were FILLED with bacon as if they were thinking \"You want bacon; here's bacon!\"\nAs for dinner we ate inside the restaurant and ordered some shredded beef tacos. The tacos were okay, but they were overflowing with cheese and lettuce, while there was barely any meat at all. (One taco only had meat in the middle). Also the shell had air bubbles. Lastly, the TV's have Mexican channels that rated X. I am not going to go into to detail, but most of the things have to do with not age appropriate things. Overall this was not a good experience and if I want Mexican Food I am going somewhere else.
