Fun atmosphere and location open patio overlooking the Las Vegas strip near New York New York.  Kitchen open late like 1A.M. On a Wednesday night.  Cool alternative\/pop music bumping, misters, lots of beer on tap, menus has a good selection like breakfast all day, appetizers, pot stickers, tacos.  I had the sin city burger with garlic fries and it tasted wonderful!  Staff is friendly and have personality.  Good out of kitchen took a little long, but I had an overall happy experience.  I will definitely come back!
