This is a fun place!  I love vegan food, my husband loves not vegan food.  Here we can have a great, tasty breakfast with good coffee and friendly people together.  I was starving and asked which was better-the vegan French toast or the vegan burrito.  Was told since I was hungry to go with the burrito that comes w\/ a side of sweet potato hash.  Loved the tofu\/pepper and soyizo filling.  just a bit of a kick and the salsa was great.  think my hash needed a bit more time on the grill though.  My hubby had the CA omelet w\/ a side of pancakes and he ate every bite.\nCoffee was good too!
