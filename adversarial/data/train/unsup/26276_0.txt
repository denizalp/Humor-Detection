This place can get pretty crowded during peak hours.  Okay option for late night dining but I wouldn't say for anything else.  I got their Hot and Sour Soup and was not pleased.  It was very watered down, you could tell from just looking at it that the color was a bit off.  The ingredients inside like the pork was a little more slimy than what I would prefer.  I would definitely pass on this soup.   I also got the Chinese Broccoli, which was quickly blanched and topped with oyster sauce.  This was okay, I was glad it wasn't oily.  It was nice and crunchy...not the best, but it was decent.
