ICED NUTELLA LATTE.\n\nSo what if we already had a caffeine buzz from Jimmy's down the street?  Rick's iced Nutella latte really hit the spot on a hot day.  The employees are super friendly too.\n\nThis coffee shop is pretty small, but we perched ourselves on two stools by the window.  The window looks out onto the street, perfect for people watching.  \n\nAnd trust me, with that sedan flower planter parked in the street, you will see some interesting passersby.  Most will stop and take photos by the car, but I was entertained by the two dudes who looked like Biggie standing on the car and rapping.
