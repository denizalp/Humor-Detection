We love the food here. We eat there about 1-2 times a weeks.  It's great that they have their app and you get tons of offers emailed to you. And they now Deliver. The price is a bit steep for me but on those busy days where you just can't step away I wouldn't mind paying the extra $. Just beware if you order online you can't make major substitutions online. Since we usually do take out we like the rice on the side and not in the same container and the entree and there used to be an option to do that but not anymore. The food is always good and fresh.
