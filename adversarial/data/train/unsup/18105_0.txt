Being from Louisiana and have been cooking and eating Cajun food since I could walk. I can easily say this is not good. They should hire a new chef, or take a class from an actual Cajun who cooks pretty decent Cajun food. The food was dry, the flavors were okay but definitely not \"Cajun\". Half the food ordered was burnt..
