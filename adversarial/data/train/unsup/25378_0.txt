This place is both relaxing and fun at the same time. One of the best Irish pubs in the city. You never get bored of the interior design of the place with many things you discover every time you go there. Staff are friendly and on top of their job. The food has a good quality. You can find a very good selection of beers, whiskeys and other drinks. Later in the evening specially on weekends you can enjoy live music as well.
