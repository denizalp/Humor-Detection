I was lucky enough to attend the Sneak Peek a few days before the official opening.  I must say it was amazing! I had the smashed chips which are spicy but in a very flavorful delicious way! The punch that was the special of the night was spectacular.  Service was amazing and I love the booths!!  I can't wait to visit them again in the future and try more cocktails and food!!
