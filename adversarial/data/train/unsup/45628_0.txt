What an interesting and wonderful place to stop for a drink!  We weren't even in the door yet when we encountered our first friendly employee, who was washing down the outdoor patio.  Sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender who could not have been better at her job.  She very carefully crafted the cocktails we'd chosen from the menu:  a Whiskey Sour for me and a Main Street for my BF, both made with their sorghum whiskey.  Excellent choices.  Go.  If you appreciate good drinks in tasteful, unique, and friendly surroundings, you won't be disappointed.
