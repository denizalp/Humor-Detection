I went on a Sunday afternoon with my son so we could both get our hair cut. There was one Barber that was just finishing up her last client.  We waited about 15 minutes and were never acknowledged by the barber.  Right when her last patron was finished? She called my son up.  Right then, another person came in and she said she told him he was next and that she would hurry with my son.  She never told me she had an appointment coming in and wasted both of our time.   This was the second time in the last month that we tried this barber.  The prior visit, there was two ladies cutting hair, we were next To go and right before we were called up, two people with appointments showed up.  At no time were we told their was a wait either occasion or that they had appointments next.\n\nThis is a Barber as advertised, not a Beauty Salon.  Barbers historically are walk in.  This is not a \"friendly barber\" as the name indicates. \n\nThe service and communication at this shop I horrible.  Don't waste your time.  Go across the street to Mr. D's or down the street to Anthem Barbers near Smiths.  Way more professional and always have ample staff to cut hair.
