Biker Party Las Vegas Style! \n\nWe attended BikeFest in 2014 at the Cashman Center and there were tons of vendor booths selling goods such as: food, clothing, jewelry, biker gear, gadgets, & hobby items; the list is extensive. There were freebies, samples and also live music. We also had the opportunity to demo (test drive) some motorcycles (Indian & Victory) and admired a variety of cool motorcycle displays. We had a great time and even ended up purchasing a beautiful 2015 Indian Scout from the test drive!\n\nAs if Vegas isn't already hot enough, why not heat things up a little bit more and cruise down on your 2 wheels or 4 wheels and hang out with some of the baddest men and women around! This is a family friendly event and children under 5 have free admission. You don't have to be a biker to join in on the fun. The fest goes on for 4 days and there will be plenty of things to see and do. Admission is $15 per day - but if you purchase your ticket online, you save $3. Weekend pass is $25 (save $3 on website), Thursday will offer a 2 for 1 local's discount (with valid Clark County ID) and Sunday will be discounted to a $5 entry.\n\nThis year, BikeFest 2015 is located in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas on Fremont Street East - blocks away from the Fremont Street Experience and historic hotels. Get ready to walk and enjoy the biker sights and sounds. There's cold brew, food, music, live bands, competitions, girls in bikinis, wet t-shirt contest, demo rides, art, $10,000 Poker Run, raffles, celebrity appearances (Sons of Anarchy) - to name a few. Top manufacturers will be bringing their latest models for you to test ride; bring your helmet (they have loner helmets but those are typically nasty) and motorcycle license, but wait until after you ride to enjoy some brews! See you and the crew!
