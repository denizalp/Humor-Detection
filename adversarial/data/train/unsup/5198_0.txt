A nice, spacious location on Main Street Unionville with tons of Parking in the back! We walked in and were greeted by a friendly staff as she was making the crepes. \n\nYou can decide if you want a savoury or sweet crepe, with three toppings included in two of the lists and another list of unlimited toppings. They serve ice cream for $3.99 a scoop plus tax, though it is marble slab ice cream. \n\nWe had a Groupon, and it was $13 for two crepes and coffees, not including tips and tax. If you don't want coffee, tea upgrades are $0.50 and hot chocolate upgrades were $1. Groupon does not charge taxes, which you have to pay the original price of, so with one cup of hot chocolate, we paid an extra $6. I believe there was a \"sitting fee\" or included tips for it to cost $5 extra.\n\nWe decided to get one savoury crepe and one sweet crepe. The hot chocolate and coffee were served in a massive cup, though it was only half full, making it a regular size. I wish they could give smaller cups. The crepes took about 35 minutes to make, considering four people were in front of us.\n\nThe crepes were created nice and thin, slightly crunchy on the edges. The toppings slash fillings were delicious, though for the savoury crepe, it was a little empty of fillings, I had more crepe than filling. The sweet crepe was covered with nutella, though fresh strawberries were not used. I know that these crepes costed less than what they would charge usually and the crepe might have less filling, but I feel like this makes me not want to go back for the normal priced crepes if the ingredients werent fresh and it wasn't filled with enough ingredients.
