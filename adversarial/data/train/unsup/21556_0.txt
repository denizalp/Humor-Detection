HOLY YES!!! This HUGE store really WOWED us!!! We have been searching through every furniture store throughout the entire Valley, and it seems that we keep seeing the SAME stuff in different stores to the point of giving up finding what we are looking to find. THIS place has some UNIQUE and AWESOME GOOD QUALITY STUFF!!! \n\nWe found TWO different amazing dining table and chair options that we had not seen anywhere else!! We haven't decided which one to buy, but we will for sure buy one of them!! They are both so awesome, it is such a hard decision!! No where else did we find ANYTHING that fit our criteria as far as a dining room set goes!!\n\nTheir prices are on target, and in some cases quite cheap!! We saw a fridge (yes, they even offer appliances) that was SO AMAZING yet priced RIGHT!! We don't need a fridge, but it was hard for us to walk away from the deal!!! But, we did because we have other priorities...BUT we'll be back when we decide to upgrade!!!\n\nWe LOVE this store and will stop every time when looking for any household item!!!! We SCORED!!! \n\nCustomer service was a SCORE too!! Darren was very helpful and is not at all high pressure!!! Ignore the bashers!!!!! GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!!!
