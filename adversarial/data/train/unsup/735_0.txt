3 1\/2 stars. Located in the same strip center as Raku and Monta Ramen I arrived for lunch and was surprised how small but cute the place is. There was only one other patron besides myself. \n\nMy order the pork cutlet curry. My dish arrived promptly and the curry sauce was flavorful but I added medium spicy seasoning for additional spiciness. I thought the pork was on the tough side and was a little difficult to even cut. \n\nI thought Japanese Curry Zen was pretty average and prefer Coco Ichiban due to they have a larger variety and offer combinations.\n\nDon't get me wrong, if I'm craving Japanese Curry in LV I would return to Japanese Curry Zen.
