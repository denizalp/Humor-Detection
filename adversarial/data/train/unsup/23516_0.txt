*** This review is for the performance section of the Scullery only ***\n\nThanks to Ty W. and his excellent review, I was able to go from the Neonopolis garage directly to the Scullery for my first screening of the Las Vegas Film Festival.  \n\nI think the room sign says 79 people capacity if I rememebr correctly.  For the film festival, they have plush sofas in the front reserved for film makers and other VIPs.  They then have several rows of standard metal chairs--not folding ones--for the audience.\n\nThere was some difficulty with the sound last night and the movie had to be restarted and they still tinkered with it after the movie was going.  Also, there were only a handful at this screening so we were told to move up.  The sofa seats are quite comfortable.  It's good the movie was good.  I could have been asleep easily with the comfort I enjoyed.\n\nThe room has another entrance, but access was controlled for the public through the Scullery's main entrance at 6th and Ogden.  When leaving to go to the Inspire Theatre for the next screening, the narrow aisle by the booths and the people standing, talking, and drinking in the bar area made for some fine people dodging to get to the next venue two blocks away.\n\nIt's an OK venue but not one you'd write home about.
