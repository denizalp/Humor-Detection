Sorry but my food was not good. I order Meatloaf dinner ... Not good... Meatloaf taste old and tasteless with tons of gravy??? I knew something was not right.. and mash potato with the same gravy all over .. No flavor, my plate was cover in grease from under.. i have to clean my plate with the napkins. I hear this place is great for breakfast .. i guess i have to try again but this time for breakfast. \nFor meatloaf i can make it better, i done before .. and for some reason taste many times better.
