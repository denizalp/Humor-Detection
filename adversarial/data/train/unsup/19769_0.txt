Very average Thai meal - if i lived down across the street i'm not sure if i would frequent this place.   I feel you can pay cheaper, go to an Archi's and get better.\n\nWe ordered a Thai BBQ chicken which was was dry and lacked flavor.  I think if i google'd a Thai BBQ chicken recipe and attempted to cook it myself, it would turn out better.....and i don't cook......at all\n\nThe rest of the dishes were decent.   It was edible.  But with so many other options in this area, you're better off somewhere else or if you're really craving Thai you can do much better.
