Kristen here. Let me preface by saying that the food is absolutely 5 star worthy. I have only had the teppanyaki experience, so my review is for only that. The fried rice is to die for, and I usually get the filet. It is so so so very good. Since you are seated 8 to a table, regardless of how many you came with, the wait between ordering your food and actually receiving it after the show can take up to an hour. If you are hungry right now, don't go here. However, if you can wait it out, it is absolutely worth it. The show\/presentation is hit or miss. Usually it's pretty good, though. They do the same tricks each time, but it is always so fun to have kids at the table and watch their expressions. It is an overall fun experience, as long as you come when it is lively and full. It's no fun if you're the only ones in the establishment. Also, my sister used to work here, and they were a little bit shady with her pay and her boss drove her to a different location on her first day... weird. Hon Machi only gets a high review from us because the food is killer. I would come here over Benihana any day of the week. However if you are looking for the better *experience* then I think Benihana may be a better choice for you.
