The review is for the Tires department and especially for Richard (dont know last name cause store manager said \"I dont know it, he is the only Richard hahaha) and John (dont know last name same reason).\nFirst of all you guys have no idea how to fix or replace tires, and i dont know who hire you both to work for sams club??? - well probably nobody else would..\n\nok so i brought my car to them at 12:30pm, so they could check what is wrong with my front left tire. An hour later the diagnostic of course was \"you need a new tire, we cannot fix it\" . Good enough , change it no problem. \nAnd so they did.. On my way home same tire \"already brand new\" started loosing air again..\nWell i said maybe i got super lucky and got it flat.. But noooo, i went back to sams club and i said wth? \nThey said \"well will take a look at it\" - take a look at what ? \"brand new tire???\n............\n3 hours later i got it \"fixed\" or whatever they call brand new tire to be fixed of what? hahaha\n\nWell lets see On my way to my house and dont know if i will make it, knowing that my tire was \"fixed\" at Sams club - Store 6382 - rainbow and spring mnt.\n\nStay away from their Tires department until sams club Head quarters read my complain that i filed with them, so they could get rid of - unprofessional Richard and John! \nGood luck you guys i hope you both end up with no job right before Christmas  :) Peace  and happy new year
