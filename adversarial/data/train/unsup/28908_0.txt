Every neighbourhood deserves a place like this\nWhen I come to Montreal, I always stay with my friend Ross, who lives a block from here and it's always nice to wake up early and head over here for some great coffee and a loaf of fresh bread. \nThe coffee is fair trade, which starts the day off right, with a blessing of all that we enjoy and our responsibility to help others.\nThere are many things to-go, including sandwiches, salads. And fresh bread has a taste no packaged bread can compete with --one reason for the \"french paradox--less is more--less quantity, more quality.\nIn my e-book, Food for City Building, I talk about the centrality of such \"butchers and bakers and candlestick makers\" to neighborhood cohesion and health, and that exists on many levels -- from the nutrition of the food to the ability to navigate a neighborhood and have a sense of place and belonging. That's why every neighborhood needs a bakery like this.
