I did not taste anything that I didn't like.\nWe had reservations on a Friday night, table of 6.  \nMost of our table did the Summer Prix Fixe menu.  \nI selected the Tomato Soup, Halibut, and Banana Fosters cake.  \nTomato Soup is served with the small grilled cheese in the bowl first, then at the table the soup is delicately served in the bowl.  If you don't eat the grilled cheese first, it will get soggy.  This soup tasted and smelled delicious!\nThe Halibut was perfectly cooked and had \"cucumber noodles\".  The \"noodles\" were long strands of cucumber.  This went nicely with the watermelon soup?  Such a nice summer entree - very refreshing!\nThe banana fosters cake was more like a muffin\/cupcake and was served with a creamy cream cheese ice cream.\n\nAt our table we also had a pork loin - YUM! and Maytag blue cheese souffle.  I was really surprised to how much I liked the blue cheese souffle! Make sure you eat it with the other items because all the flavors complement each other really well (it is really rich though - should go nice with a wine).\n\nIf you want to have a nice fancy dinner, try Bradley Ogden.\n\nNote:  Our server was only okay - not very attentive.  When we wanted to pay, he was no where to be found.\n\nOH WAIT!! How could I forget  THE BLUE CORN MUFFINS?  They are the best for when then bring the bread around.
