I love Olimpico. It hands down my favourite coffee shop in the city for multiple reasons:\n\n1. Sexy, Italian baristas\n\n2. No bullshit coffee -- get your filtered coffee, soy lattes, tea etc. elsewhere. \n\n3. You're always bound to see a friendly face.\n\n4. Fast service\n\n5. It's affordable... I enjoy third wave coffee shops as much as the next person but my wallet dislikes forking $5 each time I want a latte. Here, it's $2.50\n\n6. It rules St. Viateur in the summer time (and all those other seasons).\n\n7. Their ice coffee is *muah* delicious.\n\n8. Everyone that goes here is good looking. I'm not kidding! I never see any ugly people here. \n\n9. That terrace! It's where all the sun dwellers go. \n\n10. Their coffee is laced with the tears of Pope Francis.
