Atmosphere: upscale shabby chic home-y American decor was a fun backdrop for tasty nibbles\n\nFood: we tried the ahi tuna poke appetizer, grilled cheese and bacon sandwich, and Caesar salad with salmon.  Everything was served fresh and tidy. Great tastes--nothing revolutionary, but their aim was true to what was promised, and they kept it simple and good.\n\nService: prompt, attentive, friendly.
