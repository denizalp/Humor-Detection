Food was decent but service was lacking.\n\nMy wife & I went to Azarias two years ago and had a deliciously memorable meal. Unfortunately our return visit was memorable for a different reason.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers and 2 mains. Starting with Spicy Shrimp Tacos for me and Crab Cakes for my better half. the 3 tacos were decent if a little bland, the only spice seemed to be one line of hot sauce. The Crab Cakes were okay, but tasted like a combination of crab and tater tots.\n\nNow before we could finish a single appetizer, our mains were brought out. We were at a tiny table with barely any room to place them. Not an apology or comment from our server, they were just placed on the table for us to watch cool down as we continued eating our apps. I know the place was busy and the kitchen needs to keep things moving, but this was ridiculous. \n\n\nThese were not sharable tapas plates, they were main course meals. The Curry Goat special was delicious, just wish it had come out after my appetizer. The Short Ribs with Glazed Carrots is exactly what you get, a hunk of overly sweet beef and a few tiny carrots. No mention was made of the mostly untouched short ribs besides asking if we wanted them wrapped up. We did not, and probably won't return. Three stars for some of the food, two stars for the service.
