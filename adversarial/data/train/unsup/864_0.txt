HORRIBLE customer service.  I went through the drive through at lunch and literally sat there an stared at my food for close to ten minutes before they opened the window.  Mexican food gets soggy relatively quickly so I said something.  I said \"is that my food, because I have been staring at it for ten minutes\"  The guy said \"no you have not\".  Actually, I HAD.  It was exactly 9 minutes.  He then told me \"I don't need your complaining, if you don't like it go eat somewhere else\"  I was pretty stunned as this is company that claims it takes pride in its restaurant since 1974.  So I went in to talk to the manager, and she actually defended his rudeness.  When I told her I was going to post a negative review, she told me to \"Go For it\"\n\nSo here it is, for all the world to read.  This place does not value their customers and clearly hire management not fit to handle upset customers.
