Tonight (Tuesday) I went to Dora Keogh for drinks.  \n\nFRUIT FLIES\nThis was the one thing I couldn't stand. There were fruit flies all over the place. I was swatting them every couple of minutes.  They were even at the bar and at the tables next to us.  What was worse was one flew into my drink.  I bet I ate some too.\n\nWASHROOMS\nok I had no idea which washrooms were for male or female b\/c they used some different language which I don't think has german roots.  The only reason I knew which one to go to was b\/c someone wrote in little letters \"men\" on the man's door.  So that was a bit annoying.\n\nAlso they don't have a hook for your purse\/coat.  They only have a counter next to the toilet which can get really dirty. So I didn't really like that.\n\nSERVICE\nGreat! everyone was really nice, the prices were reasonable.\n\nThe flies really bugged me (pun intended....i'm corny i know) and I don't think i'll go there again by choice b\/c of it. Just imagine the cleanliness at the back.  But if a group of friends wanted to go, then ya...i'd go. That's why I gave it a 3.
