I had a flight delay and wandered around until the pastry case caught my eye. I ordered the smoked salmon salad. It was pre arranged. I was shocked at how amazingly delicious it was. I want to fly back just to eat it again.\n\nI got two cupcakes for dessert (because that's how I roll) and they were not as impressive. I had red velvet and coconut and both were bland and dry.\n\nNext time I will try a scoop of gelato. I miss you salad....
