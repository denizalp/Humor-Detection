Made our first visit to Wong's today for lunch.  We were cheerfully greeted and seated. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  After looking over the lunch menu my wife decided on the Kung Pao Chicken mild spice (#1) and I ordered the Sun Devil Chicken spicy (#3).  Our waitress asked how we found this place (Yelp search of local Chinese restaurants) and mentioned they offered free egg rolls with Yelp Check In, very nice gesture!  Our meals arrived quickly. They were both very tasty with generous portions.  Our food was spiced perfectly. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Service was top notch with multiple table checks and refills of our beverages.  We found our new Chinese place and will return!
