Last week I ate at Cousins Subs for the first time.  There was a stash of buy 1 get 1 coupons at work.  I nabbed one and went to check 'em out.  \n\nI ordered the meatball sub and the Italian Special sub.  Both were delicious.  My only complaint was the restaurant itself was a bit on the grimy side.  The floors were in need of sweeping and mopping.  But if I can let that slide in a Mexican joint then I should let it slide for a sub joint.  The service was good and my sandwiches were made in timely order.\n\nIt was good eating.  So much so I went back the next day for lunch and then ordered again for dinner.  A coworker called in our order for delivery because we can't leave.  My sub was a-ok but his was royally butchered.  When he called they were not eager to bring him a new sub.  He let it slide but they shouldn't have given him any trouble about it especially since we're a 5 minute drive away.  If it wasn't for that I'd give this place 4 stars because I really liked my food but they should have made the order right for my coworker.
