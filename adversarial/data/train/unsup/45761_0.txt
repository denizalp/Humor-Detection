Looking for home cooked feel and price worthy plates? You get what you pay for at the Best Argentinian place in Vegas, originally tried it with some work friends and loved it since! It's small interior makes it feel extra special, they definitely cater to you.  I go here to get really good bbq meat, they have yummy empanadas to go, and everything else from salads to dinner, hot\/cold sandwiches, and yummy desserts! And the deli is pretty savvy for also being a restaurant\/store! The service is always great, they really make you feel at home.
