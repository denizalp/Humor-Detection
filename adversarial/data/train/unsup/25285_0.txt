This place was pretty good. My only issue is that there were more beans and rice than there was tacos and I'm not a huge fan of beans even though the beans were pretty tasty. The tacos themselves were really delicious. The workers were nice and the food came out quick. The environment is a chill one. I'll definitely be coming here to try some other stuff!
