Stopped by here for lunch one day and had the Kaya burger with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger was gigantic (I couldn't physically eat it with my hands, rather, I had to dissect it with my fork and knife) and it came with a fried egg, avocado, their Kaya Special Sauce, chihuahua cheese, tomato, bacon, and pickles. I ordered my burger medium rare and I found it cooked a little too much for my tastes. The burger was alright - not mind-blowing, but pretty decent. The fries were a disappointment. I had read such rave reviews about the sweet potato fries, but I found them a bit stale, dry, and bland. \n\nAmbience of the place was very nice - eclectic blend of modern furniture and artwork. Service was very mediocre.
