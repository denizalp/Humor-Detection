Had a fantastic time at this little theater watching The Toxic Avenger as part of a Yelp elite event. Stage was around two of the walls and performers would sing and appear from all angles. You never knew what was coming next!\n\nTables of four were great to chill at and made it less awkward than shuffling in and out of typical theater rows. Cast was engaging and the five people cast looked like they were having an absolute BLAST. We laughed and enjoyed each scene. Great venue for a play and the talent was top notch. Excited to see other shows that come through the CLO!
