My boy friend and I love to come to this place for take-out. It never disappoints us: the food is above decent and taste healthy. I love the lamb shank, fasenjun, and ehmeh( I call it the orange stew). The best part is that they give out free tattik soaked with yummy source. They don't always have what you though. Bf always calls before we go to pick the food up. A very non-fancy and tasty choice.
