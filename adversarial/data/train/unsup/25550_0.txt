This is what you would expect. Very Nice accommodation. I asked for a room with a view and instead got one that sits between two buildings with a small glimpse of the strip. Not what I expected. The type of guest here upscale (or try to be). There is many options for food and entertaining. Over all a nice, expensive and busy place to stay..
