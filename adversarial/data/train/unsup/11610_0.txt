Don't get me wrong, this is NOT the best Chinese place in town, but this is a great lunch spot on a day when I crave bad Chinese food (bad as in super unhealthy). For $7.29, it's a sizable buffet. My favorite is the hibachi area that's included in the price. They don't skim out at lunch and offer seafood items (squid, bay scallop and shrimp). One dish at the hibachi grill honestly is enough to get your money's worth (Here is my secret to the hibachi: hibachi sauce with a little hot sauce and with garlic).\n\nThe sushi on the salad bar are scary looking... so please skip it. Instead, just eat the other goodies. The honorable mentions: hot & sour soup, steamed fish, baked mussels, pan friend dumplings, wings etc. All of them are solid.\n\nI swear everytime I ate there I left with a miserable feeling of overstuffing myself. So consider yourself warned... you may enjoy the meal at the moment, but you will likely hate yourself afterward for making such a bad lunch choice.
