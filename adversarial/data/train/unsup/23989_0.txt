Dr Sharma by far was the best primary doctor I have ever seen. I went to 3 doctors before I saw him and he is extremely knowledgable and doesnt just throw a script at you in 3min. He really cares and wants to see you get well. He asked me so many questions and got to the root of everything. Im incredibly happy to know that I have found a primary doctor for life. Im beyond grateful. $100 office visit. $200 general check up. Worth it. I spent close to $1000 before seeing him on doctors that prescribed me antibiotics that nearly killed me because they didnt take the time to know my condition.
