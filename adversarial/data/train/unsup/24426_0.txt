I hate pain, and I'm ok with that. But when the desire for self expression out weighs the desire to be free of pain, Capitol City is the place for you. \n\nI got my first tat here, and I was so thrilled with the work. Brian was cool with me being a complete wuss. And he tried to make me feel better about my howls of agony by telling me that the top of the foot is the second most painful part of the body for a tat. So when it was time to get a second tat years later, I decided to return, even though I had moved to Milwaukee and there were plenty of places to get one done there. When I went back, he told me he remembered me, and even if he really didn't, it was pretty cool to hear. Brian has done some really amazing and detailed work, and I almost felt bad bringing him something so simple to work on (my first was way more detailed than the second). But he again tolerated my wussy behavior and did another fantastic job. That was about two years ago, and if \/when I decide to get a third I will go back there, even though now I am in Chicago. \n\nThanks Brian and Capitol City you guys rock.
