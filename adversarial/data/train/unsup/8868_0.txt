This is probably THE biggest and \"you NEED to come here\" club in Vegas as of June 2011.  They usually host a lot of the world's best DJ's - Kaskade, ATB, Laidback Luke, Armin van Buuren, etc.  We saw ATB here and it was TOTALLY worth the $50\/girl and $100\/guy admission :)  I'm kind of sad I didn't see Laidback Luke that same night.. ATB started at 1:30 and he was still going at 4am!  I was getting way too tired.. I know... weak sauce!!  :(  \n\nFYI, ****THIS IS PRIMARILY A HOUSE\/ELECTRO CLUB*****\n\nThey have a hip hop floor too, but that's old news.  Electro is the future!  \n\nThree floors of awesome music and beautiful decor.  I'm definitely a fan!  The floors are big but small enough that you can get up close and personal with the DJs.  I was right in the front when ATB played and I yelled out \"MIAMI ULTRA!!!!!!!!!\" and he pointed at me and said \"YEAH!!!!! ULTRA!!!!!!\"  Yes, that made me VERY happy :) \n\nHowever, I must comment, the stairs are a HUGE flub!  You have to climb 1000000000+ (ok I'm exaggerating.. but it's a LOT) steps to get to the club.. and for all the ladies out there, you know how much your feet hurt after a long night of dancing.   \n\nAlso, come early!  Admission is usually expensive anyway, so just avoid the long lines (I've heard some people waited for 2+ hrs).  I think they're opened until the wee hours of the morning.. so you can still get in at 2 or 3am.
