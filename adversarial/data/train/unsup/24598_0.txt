Pros:\n\n-Probably the best and largest rave in the west coast, comparable to UMF.  Except it's better cause it's from dusk to dawn.\n\n-awesome stages and huge venue, they pump a lot of money into how the stages look and decorations.  Right when you walk down from the entrance, if you enter through the main entrances that take you down the bleachers.  It's breathtaking how massive this massive is.\n\n-free water, just buy a water bottle for $5 or an insomniac bottle and keep refilling, only downside is that the refilling stations are kind of inconvenient to get to.\n\n-best selection of dj's!  There's really almost something for everyone.\n\nCons:\n\n-parking, holy crap parking is ridiculous.  It's so unpredictable, 2013 parking was fine.  2014, on the other hand, was ridiculous.  No organization what so ever, imagine an acre large parking lot full of cars trying to exit out of what, three exit.  Thousands of pissed off and irritated drivers trying to leave, it took over an hour just to get out.  Ridiculous!  It was a car accident waiting to happen, but at least it was free.\n\n-$5 for a dinky little cup of ice....really??!!  Might as well buy a bottle of water for that rate.\n\n-porta potty bathrooms, it's disgusting how gross these things get and good luck trying to find one with toilet paper towards the end of the rave.\n\n-water refill station is no where near the larger stages, kinetic field or circuit grounds, however they have plenty of tents where you can buy water from.  It's all about the money.\n\n-long entry and search lines, you've been warned, plan ahead.\n\nTips:\n\n-bring a small tissue pack or baby wipes and hand sanitizer.  The bathrooms are horrible and disgusting and chances are they won't have toilet paper by the end of the night.  Finding a porta potty with toilet paper is like finding gold.\n\n-everything has to be sealed and even then it depends on who is checking you, if you can even bring them in.  Some checks allow sealed water bottles, chapstick, etc and some don't so it's really the luck of the draw sometimes. \n\n-bring cash\n\n-bring a towel or something to sit on when you get tired unless you don't mind your pants getting super dirty from sitting on the floor.\n\nIt's Vegas which means it's super hot even during the night so expect to see shirtless guys and girls who think that pasties and a thong are appropriate attire.  They sell a variety of foods, drinks (both alcoholic and non) and merchandise.\n\nI feel like EDC gets more expensive with each passing year and it gets more and more crowded.  However, despite all the things that go wrong, EDC is something that you will definitely remember for the rest of your life, whether it be good memories or bad.  There really is no beating that feeling of first walking into EDC and looking down at the sheer massiveness of it.
