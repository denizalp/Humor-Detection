Okay, seriously... Everything I had here was awesome. This place made me enjoy eggplant and asparagus! These are 2 things i do not typically enjoy... Either my taste buds are growing up or Timo is an evil genius.  The eggplant dip is served with fantastic crostini, tomatoes, mixed olives and goat cheese for toppings. Tried 3 of their bruschettas and they were maybe the best i've had, right up there with Postino's delicious concoctions. Two of us at the table had flatbreads, the Margherita and Pancetta. Both were amazing. They manage to make the perfect crust that is crispy but soft and dough-like. I even reheated the 2nd half of mine the next day and it was still delicious. Oh, lets not forget the cocktails! I had a Day-drinker... It was like a mojito with grapefruit juice. Incredibly refreshing and very drinkable. I sampled martinis and sangria around the table and they were all top-notch. \nMy only issue was the floors are a bit slippery with the type of slate-like flooring. My girlfriend almost slipped and apparently the week before had witnessed a server go down pretty hard after slipping on the floor here. \nAnywho, I am super excited to get back here for round two... I need to try those lamb chops and cheese plate while burying my face in a couple glasses of wine. I'll be back and i'll tread carefully!
