Always Good\n\nI have visited famous Daves a few times and I've never been disappointed. The food is always good, service is always great, and the restaurant  is always clean.\n\nOn this visit we shared one of the Combo Platters that were designed for 2-3 people and fed 3 with enough for a take home box that served one more.  The Combo Platter had a nice variety of smoked chicken, ribs, brisket, corn on the cob, baked beans, fries, cold slaw, and corn bread muffins. \n\nFamous Dave is a little bit on what some might consider the expensive side, but it was a good price for what you get.
