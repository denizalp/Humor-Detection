Ugh. Downtown hotels. I don't know any other sentiment is good for this place. I'm sure if you come here to gamble or have cheap eats, you would enjoy this place a lot with their $4.99 late night steak specials and $1 minimum black jack tables, but as far as the quality of your stay goes, it goes without saying that this is not your Vegas.\n\nAlthough I agree with some reviewers that this place is one of the classier places in Las Vegas, if you're seeking out a cheap room during CES, you should be prepared to pay $$$ for a * location, * bed, * shower and swimming in smoke in your short trip from the elevator to the exit. \n\nThe rooms have this nice moldy stench, and kind of leaves you feeling icky like you stayed at a really random Motel 6 middle of nowhere and you're not too sure if the black stain in the floor was a stale piece of gum left there for years. Bleh.
