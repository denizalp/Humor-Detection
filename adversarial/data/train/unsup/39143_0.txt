I've eaten here twice, on weekdays for lunch. The first time I got the buffet and the second time I ordered an entrée. Both times the food was fresh, hot and delicious. The portion size of the entrée was generous enough to take leftovers home for a second meal. The service was excellent. There have only been a handful of other customers both times so the server (who I suspect might be the owner) had time to answer questions about the food and give suggestions. The food arrived promptly and our glasses of water were refilled regularly. The restaurant was clean, including the bathroom. I will be back for sure!
