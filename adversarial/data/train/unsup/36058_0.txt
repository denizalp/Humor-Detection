We came here for an early dinner during our trip to Las Vegas.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, the hostess ushered us in.  We sat in front of the sushi counter.\n\nOur friend told us to try the omakase, so we ordered two.\n\nThe food was good.  Nothing really special.  I honestly thought the place was kind of overrated...  \n\nThe omokase menu wasn't enough for us, so we had to order 3 more small plates.
