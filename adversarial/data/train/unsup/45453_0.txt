This visit was a take out order, so a friend and I sat at the bar waiting for our food to come out. The bartender was a friendly lady, she took our order and brought us some water while we waited.\n\nIt took a little while for our food to come out, once it did, I asked for a side of sauce for the fries. She said she'd be right back with the 1,000 island. It took FOREVER for her to come back with a small container of dressing. We joked that she had to go collect all 1,000 islands for us.\n\nWe got back to the house after a while and we were all finally able to eat.\n\nWe normally have good experiences at this location, as we eat there semi-regularly. The bartender was not busy making drinks while we waited, it seemed almost as if she took her break, then remembered to bring us the side so we could leave.
