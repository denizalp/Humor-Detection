The food was decent. Service was good. Huge portions of food but way overpriced. \n\nI ordered The Kokomo.  It was decent. Fries I didn't like though.  The sandwich was a meatloaf sandwich with fried mozzarella and tomatoes. The mozzarella and tomatoes were good but the meat was dry.  Not enough flavor to the meatloaf.
