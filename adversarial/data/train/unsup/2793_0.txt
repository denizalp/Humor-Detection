The service here is terrible. I hate how people can smoke here (doesn't make sense to have physical activities and smokers in the same spot). My mother had her 50th birthday party here. I had a lot of fun playing the bean bag toss, horse shoes, ping pong, and sand volleyball. On a November night, it is freezing! The band was terrible and could only play 1 genre- undanceable rock music. Plus there were like these floozy 40 year olds trying to dance sexy and it just made the place look trashy. So a waitress takes orders on our food and she brought it out 30 minutes later and still uncooked. She only brought out the chicken tacos cooked. I would have cooked my food sooner had I known that she was just bringing it out and going to take half an hour. Never came to check out on us and didn't really let us know what we could order. The bartender was great, but the service is not. The food is ok. NOT vegetarian friendly in terms of cooking your food on a meat cooked grill. They have a veggie burger and foil, but no veggie thongs to turn over the veggie burger and no clear definitions of what sauces have meat products in them. I'd never come back here unless my mom paid for me again.
