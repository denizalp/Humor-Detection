A friend of mine hosted an amazing Halloween party here a few years ago, and it was a great party venue.  Today, I went there with my son, who somehow managed to not learn to ride a bike until he was way too big for training wheels.  We went to rent a bike, and all of the employees worked so hard to help him.  They went out of their way to modify a bike for him, suggest places to ride, and offer him coaching and encouragement.  Afterward, my son loved visiting the museum!  It was an amazing experience.  Don't miss this place.
