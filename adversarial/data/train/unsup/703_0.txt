New owners make all the difference!\n\nI used to live over on Oak and 64th street, so my Rosati's location was on Thomas and 40th St. I always thought the best Chicago style deep dish pizza came out of their kitchen. I've had Lou Malnati's and Gino's East while in Chicago, and I felt like this place was better. \n\nI was pretty disappointed when I moved to Roosevelt and Granite Reef and discovered the nearest Rosati's had bad reviews. I ordered anyway, and was just as let down as reviews would have me expect to be. It wasn't just sub-par, it was almost inedible. So for the last 2 years, I haven't ordered Rosati's delivery (though I have gone across town to the Thomas location to pick up a few times). I've really missed it.\n\nI was excited when I recently found out this location was getting new ownership. Nothing against the previous owner, but I just don't think their heart was quite in it. Anyway, tonight I picked up a 16\" Chicago deep dish. It was perfect! Fucking magical! Absolutely delicious! \n\nAs I sit here filled with cheese and dough and meat and tomatoes and sauce, I contemplate the universe and both appreciate and lament the alignment of the stars to provide me with such a close proximity to a quality Rosati's again. Appreciate for obvious reasons, and lament because this is going to be trouble for my waistline. \n\nTalked to the owner over the phone - he seemed super nice and enthusiastic. I mean - he gives a shit. That alone means you're going to enjoy the food more. He claims to make the best wings in the Valley... challenge accepted. I recommend trying them again if you haven't in awhile. Also - seems like the prices have come down a bit. \n\nWe're regulars startiiiiiiiing... NOW.
