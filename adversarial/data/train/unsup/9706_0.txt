LOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEE 777.\nEverytime I come to Las Vegas, I stop by here at least 3 times in 5 days.\nThe Blackchip Ale is the bomb and it's so refreshing. It better be, it's made right there. Give me 3 of these and i'm set for the evening. I have tried the other house brews but I'll stick to the Blackchip.\nThe prices are really decent but so is everything in Downtown. I can order a philly cheesesteak, 3 beers for under $16.00. I f I could only live here.\nTriple 7 also takes vacations hawaii meal coupons. I have actually used 2 meal coupons and got my dinner for free. The waiter hooked me up so I had to hook him up with a nice tip. \nMy wife loves their pizza but I'll stick to the oily foods. Taste so much better.\nLove you 777........
