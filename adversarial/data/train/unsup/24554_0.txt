Las Vegas is a desert when it comes to buying quality groceries- whereas there is a megamart every 5 feet in Summerlin there are not really any high quality produce stores or butchers. Enter Whole Foods. We all know Whole Foods is absurdly over priced, we all know the quality of the produce is not what you would expect from a 3 dollar banana, but really what choice do we have here? Answer: not much.\n\nThusly, I find myself shopping at Whole Foods way more than I have in any other city I have lived in. This requires certain adjustments- you have to wear anti D spray,get hipster immunizations, and get ready for women in yoga pants to shove your cart out of the way as they power walk through the store picking up brown rice and vegetables. Here is a quick buying guide of things to try\n\nBone in Ribeyes- grass fed, pretty high quality steaks- great for the grill\n\nChorizo- turkey and beef also god, but pork is the classic\n\nBlack bean salsa- very addicting\n\nPotato leek soup- by far the best soup. BY FAR
