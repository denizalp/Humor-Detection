Smaller beer list but a few good local choices.\n\nFried dumpling appetizer. Interesting... It was deep fried instead of pan fried. Good but a little dry.\n\nI got bibimbap. First time I ever had it and it was pretty tasty. No frame of reference but I enjoyed it.\n\nWife got pad ke mow aka drunken noodles which we both enjoyed.\n\nOverall very good and we'll probably be back
