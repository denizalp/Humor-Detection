We took our brand new comforter to the Carousel Cleaners on Higley and Elliot Rd. to be cleaned.  We were told it would be ready in a week.  Went back after a week and was told it wasn't ready, to come back the next day.  This went on for 3 days.  Every time we went back, we were told to come back the next day.\n\nFinally, on the 4th day when it wasn't ready, my husband demanded to know what was going on and we were told that they ruined the comforter.  Why they didn't tell us that from the beginning, I have no idea.  The owner (JoAnn) was supposed to call us to talk about the situation, but has not.  The manager has not talked to us about it either.  One of the workers called to tell us that Carousel Cleaners were not going to pay for the damage and we could come pick it up.  They tried to say it was a manufacturing defect, but after we saw how completely destroyed the comforter is, it is very obvious that the cleaner is at fault.  They have refused to reimburse us for the cost of the brand new comforter and to add insult to injury, expected us to actually pay for the cleaning.  We finally were able to get our destroyed comforter back without paying for the cleaning, but we are completely out the cost of the comforter.\n\nDo not use this cleaners unless you want to take the gamble that if they ruin your items, you have no recourse. They could care less about their customers.
