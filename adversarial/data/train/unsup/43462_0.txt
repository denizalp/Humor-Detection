I worked with Amanda Young to rent a property from one of her clients and I have had nothing but trouble. It makes me feel uneasy that a realtor who can ignore a water heater leakage into a unit below unti the water damage is so severe it is coming through the electrical sockets still sells houses. Between her and her client that I rent from nothing is ever accomplished. I wouldnt work with a company that employs such people. She is very unprofessional and does not follow through on anything!
