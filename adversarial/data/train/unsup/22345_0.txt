I was visiting Pittsburgh and was excited about getting some ink.  Researched the area and In the Blood kept popping up.  Decided to check the place out.  The gentleman that initially spoke to me was great.  He seemed interested in what I wanted and was responsive to what I was describing. (If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say this was Justun... just basing that off of his professionalism which I greatly appreciated)  Then I got passed on to this other guy.  When he walked over, he appeared to be hung over.  While I was describing what I wanted, my friends noticed that he wasn't paying one bit of attention because he was apparently staring at some girls that walked in.  When he finally started speaking back, he told me what he \"Couldn't\" do and what he \"Wouldn't\" do.  Fine... great.  I appreciate hearing that you're not comfortable with doing something.  What really sucked was that he didn't bother to offer up any of his own words of wisdom.  Fine... you can't do something, OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE.  I got the typical, \"It's your body, dude..\" response to a question I asked.  I was up front about not being an artist and would need some guidance. Based solely on this encounter, I'd have to question his artistic ability.  I guess he expected me to go to the wall and pick some simple stencil work him.  Sorry, but I'm looking for someone with talent.  In the Blood, you lost a sale because of this guy.  Had he taken even a minute interest, might have stuck around.\n\nEDIT - Oh, forgot the best part.  After he sensed that I was over him, he started to draw something on a piece of paper to show me, but threw the pen on the table after  a few seconds and said, \"I don't know.\"  No joke! So disappointing.
