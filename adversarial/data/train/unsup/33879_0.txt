I've been to this place twice now and it's still as good as I remembered. The first time I went I ordered the cotton snow. It was pretty good and it had mochi and boba with condensed milk on it. The second time I ordered the green tea wizard. It had grass jelly and red bean at the bottom. It came with tapioca and condensed milk on the side so you could pour it yourself. My niece and nephew wanted the strawberry panna cotta so we also got that. I personally don't like strawberry flavoured food so I didn't like it but my niece and nephew did.
