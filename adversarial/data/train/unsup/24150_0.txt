Its pretty sad, just opened and they already have to receive this kind of rating..\n20min wait, expected amazing food, id rather eat at ajisan and that plce is pretty bad. The ramen was way too salty. Got the spicy tantan\nMy waitress can't even speak english, i don't have a clue what shes saying to me. Absolute garbage..
