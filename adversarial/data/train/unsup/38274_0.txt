This is a great place for relaxation!  It started off with being picked up by their own transportation.  Then I got the most relaxing massage, followed by a mani and pedi.  This was all included in one package which is such a great deal!\n\nI would only suggest a couple of things:\n1) Make the logo bigger on the vehicle you are using.  I was waiting outside for at least 15 minutes and I didn't know they were there the whole time.  It was hard to make out the car since they match every other vehicle.\n\n2) Use no chip nail polish.  Once I left the spa, I noticed my nails smushed a bit.  I was getting married that day and I was a bit disappointed by that.  Within a day, the polish broke off.  If I spend over $100 to get nails done, I expected them to last a lot longer than just a day or two.\n\nOther than that, I would highly recommend this place!  It is very confinement by not being too far from the strip and everyone there is super nice.
