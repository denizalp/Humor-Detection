Whenever I'm in the mood for a little pool and a little hookah, this is where I go...plenty of tables, plenty of hashish flavors(I'm partial to pomegranate, myself), and an internet jukebox(I tend to pick \"Master of Puppets\" by Metallica, \"Don't Stop Believin\" by Journey, and we LOVE to torment everyone with the 19-minute long 'Goodbye, Sky Harbor' by Jimmy Eat World, haha!)...
