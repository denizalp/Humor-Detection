The most awful dining experience I have ever had. I don't know how they stay in business their food is run of the mill fried nasty crap.. The service is horrendous ... We asked for bottled water they looked at us like we were crazy then brought out some old ass half crumpled up cheap crap in the bottle with no glass... We are always nice to servers but this chick was awful she was rude , inattentive and she brought out  the check as soon as she dropped off our entree it was ridiculous ... After being in the service industry for many years I was appalled by this place.... If I could rate it a negative star I would.....\nI never tip less than at least around 25% as I know what it's like to live on a low salary like that , but this was the first shitty tip I have left in my life and it was well deserved....  DONT GO THERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE VERY DISAPPOINTED...
