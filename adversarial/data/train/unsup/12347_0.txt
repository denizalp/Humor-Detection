This place deserves a 0 star rating. I was here at 10:15 am for a appt. and STILL waiting in the F@@@ing waiting room at 11:50am. Complete BS and they couldn't give any reason other than it's slow today. BS! Don't book 5 people for a appointment slot. It is way obvious that your time as the paying patient means NOTHING!!
