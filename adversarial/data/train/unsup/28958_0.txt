LOVE LOVE \nOne of my favorites!! Best Chicken Pita I have ever had!! The Greek salad is very delish as well! And i dont really even like fries and they have some of the best fries ever!! I always get a side of pita bread because its that good and fresh.. Highly recommend!! Love the owners as well very nice!
