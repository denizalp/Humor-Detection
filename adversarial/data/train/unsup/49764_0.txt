Don't let the boring name or dark decor scare you away! We were actually going to the sandwich shop next door, but they were having their floor cleaned. The guy cleaning the floor came out as we were deciding where to go instead and suggested this place. \n\nThe menu didn't seem to appeal to my family, so we all reluctantly ordered a safe choice of a cheeseburger. Oh my... I have been craving their burger since we walked out! They use grass fed beef from Iowa, part chuck and part brisket and you can order it cooked medium or even rare if that's how you like it! I may have to do medium well next time as the medium rare was a bit too red and juicy and my bottom bun got soggy. But seriously, is a juicy burger something to complain about? I'll be back next time I have a hankering for some red meat. \n\nThanks Sidewinders for cleaning your floors! (Don't worry, we will still patronize your establishment for sandwiches).
