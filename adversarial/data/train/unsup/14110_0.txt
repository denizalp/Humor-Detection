Just landed in Vegas and Herringbone was our first stop - was super convenient since we could walk to it from our hotel. It was also Super Bowl Sunday. This review is for the 'ALL YOU CAN EAT, BIG GAME EATS' menu that went on that day. \n\nFor $75 each, we had access to AYCE for the duration of the game. \n\nFood included:\nUnlimited poke bar (with all the extras)\nPeel & eat prawns - Mexican white prawns, sambal cocktail sauce\nNachos - chicken, queso, tortilla chips, black beans, tomato salsa, guacamole, scallions\nPigs in a blanket (with house ketchup & mustard)\nWings - pickled cucumber & carrots, chili, cilantro, garlic, peanut sauce\nMeatballs - Nana's pork gravy, whipped ricotta, parsley\nBobby's sliders - kobe beef, aged cheddar, grilled onions\nBoardwalk fries - old bay, malt vinegar aioli, ketchup, herbs\nMexican street corn - chipotle aioli, scallions, cotija, cilantro\n\nBoyfriend really wanted to see the game and eat, so I went along with his choice of restaurant and the menu had food I was fine with. There was no wait as we walked in and got seated. The atmosphere was loud with tons of guys chattering and drinking. Dozens of flat screen tvs were all over the walls. I guess Vegas has these AYCE buffets specifically during the big game cause it makes the whole event really fun\/exciting. There was a deal for drinks going on and since my bf ordered one - he got put into some lottery and the hostesses kept giving him free Jack Daniels stuff lol that was cool I guess. He got some stickers, lip balm, and a necklace.\n\nI liked the idea of the poke bar, and there were tortilla chips too! They had the raw seafood all laid out in the back of the restaurant. The tako (octopus) tasted a lil better than the poke (fish). Poke was mushy and soft - like it wasn't fresh or it was just sitting\/marinating in sauce for too long. The shrimps were awesome though. Good size, crunchy, and tasted great dipped with ketchup. I also enjoyed the tomatoes and cucumbers - definitely helped to clear that fishy taste in my mouth in preparation for the rest of food on the menu. \n\nI did not care for the corn, fries, nor the wings. The corn was covered in a lot of stuff and had waaay too much going on. Expected it to have tons of flavor but it just tasted dry with NO taste. Fries were okay. The wings were too spicy for me. My boyfriend liked the wings the most, and he also ended up eating the rest of the food. \n\nMy favorites were the pigs in a blanket and the sliders for sure. I think I was so hungry that I just really craved meat at the moment and all the other appetizers were not cutting it for me. Pigs in a blanket was nothing special...but it was filling. That's all I wanted. Tasted like regular mini hotdogs with ketchup and mustard. The sliders were AMAZING. Don't know what sauce the patty was covered in, but it was delicious. Wanted to eat more sliders but I couldn't..was too stuffed from just one. #smallstomachproblems \n\nWish we didn't order the nachos cause I wasn't expecting them to come in a large bowl. Honestly we just wanted to try a little bit of everything and went crazy ordering. Couldn't finish that along with the meatballs. The meatballs were gooOod, and we ended up taking that and the wings back to the hotel. The nachos were different and not to our liking. They didn't use regular melted cheddar cheese and the chicken was cold while everything else was kind of warm? It just didn't mix well together. I enjoyed a couple first bites of the nachos, but then I got tired of the taste later. \n\nIf we were more hungry, I think the AYCE deal would have been worth it. But my boyfriend and I agreed that for what we paid, we did not get our money's worth. That always seems like the case for these types of situations regarding buffets\/AYCE. We just came for the convenience, fast service and the game.... not for the price or food. Probably should have came to Herringbone for their regular breakfast\/lunch\/dinner hours and maybe then we'd feel like we actually got what we paid for.
