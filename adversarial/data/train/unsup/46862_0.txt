ok first off I would like to say to the idiots at the grandview who respond to bad reviews that you are idiots. I was told 2-3 hours of a presentation it turned into 4 1\/2 hours. To the woman who will respond to this my girl and I laughed at the fact you said because of the food the time was extended. If I could curse I would call you a dumb female dog. it took us 5 min to eat the 2 week old bagels and the nasty coffee. it took long because when we said no they dicked us around. and the fat asian dude who was our salesperson was nice until he knew we werent going to buy. then he was a ash whole. his manager (god bless him) told us a story of how he got shot to try to make us feel bad for not buying the timeshare. he was also a dick. then after we said no again they dicked us around even more and we had to wait in a dumb waiting room for an hour to leave the place. we just said F it and we got a cab. however out of everything There was a guy named Jerry we got to talk to. Probibly the nicest person I've met in vegas. but all in all the experience was dumb. the only good thing we got out of it was the free tickets and meeting jerry. other than that if anyone goes there for the free tickets just tell the person that you are only there for the tickets before hand and just keep asking when the presentation will be over. for all them being rude I think everyone should just use them for what they are good for. free tickets. ps the food consisted of sandwhiches and pastries. all of which tasted like it was left out for a few weeks.
