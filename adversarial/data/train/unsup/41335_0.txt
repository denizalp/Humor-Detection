I stayed for a week in this Hotel and this was my favorite place to have a good breakfast. You pay around $20 for a breakfast (all you can eat and drink) They have EVERYTHING! Donuts, fruit, omelets, French toast, Mexican, frozen yogurt, pancakes, bacon, sausage, grits, omg I can continue. I'm giving 5 starts because is very clean, they have good service, they have high chairs for kids. And I think that is a great price. I'm gonna miss it. \nRemember that breakfast is the main meal of the day :)
