Don't get me wrong I am a fan of Dutch Bros Coffee, but dang the waits are horrible. I love the staff and their outgoing personality but they need to cut back the chatting when the lines are 10+ deep.  I do not mind waiting for staff to acknowledge each customer that buys product, but do they have to take 3 minutes with each? I no joke waited over twenty minutes for a coffee. That to me is ridiculous and I do not think I will be stopping by the Goodyear location anymore during the morning rush. Coffee is still great but if I get laid off for being late to the office, I won't be able to afford any coffee. :)
