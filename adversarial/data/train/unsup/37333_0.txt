I've heard good things about this spot but let me just say that I did not have a great experience. The menu had plenty of options. I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich. It was done within 5 minutes, which I am happy about, however I was not happy with the taste. The sandwich was smothered in sauce, and was overwhelming my mouth with flavor to the point where I had to wipe off excess sauce. The patty was limp and tiny and although it was vegan, it could never compare to a real chicken patty. Overall, I was completely dissatisfied with my overly priced sandwich. The only good thing about this place was quick service and clean bathrooms.
