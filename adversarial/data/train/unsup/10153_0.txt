(Updated 10\/25\/07) We need a 6th star for this place.  Forget about Capital Grill, this is the place to go if you call yourself a foodie or want to be one.  \n\nThe tasting menu at Binkley's is the way to go.  It starts off at $60 for 4 courses, $65-72 for 5 courses and $77 for 6 courses.  A steal, I tell you, compared to French Laundry's (where Kevin Binkley used to work) $200+ tasting menu and it's almost just as good plus you get to pick your dishes and you don't have to deal with 2 month advance reservations.  The drive to Cave Creek is so worth it!\n\nEven more amazing is that they give you a ton of really creative amuse bouche (little morsels to amuse your mouth) before your first course even hits the table and then more throughout the meal.  We got at least ten tonight.  What a deal!  Just to give you an idea of the amuse bouche craziness, this is some of what we got in the last two meals (check out the pixs above if you wanna see what tasty looks like):\n- parsnip soup\n- baby zucchini with organic tomato-caper relish\n- tomato water with sriracha jelly & celery salt (on strobe light)\n- romeseco with Parmesan foam & eggplant chips\n- house pulled mozzarella with golden raisins & almond\n- sausage with artichoke chip\n- green apple sorbet & grapefruit sorbet\n- puffed wild rice crispy treat\n\nWine pairing is available and highly recommended.  Dan the sommelier is super cool and used to be a humanitarian photographer traveling all over 3rd world countries.  The staff here have really interesting backgrounds and manage to strike the balance between being professional and friendly.\n\nMake sure to ask for the tasty potato chips (usually just served at the bar). If you can imagine those colorful Terra Chips reaching \"be all that they can be\" level of goodness, then you'd know what I mean.  \n\nMenu changes daily to keep with seasonality and what's fresh.  Hope they keep the divine Burgundy Truffle Pumpkin Agnolotti for a little longer so that I can have it at least one more time.
