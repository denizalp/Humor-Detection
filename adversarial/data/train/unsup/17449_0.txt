Davisville's hidden gem (albeit zirconium)\n\nWhen my original plans for the evening were called on account of illness, Shari \"pizza guru\" M. took me up on a last-minute suggestion that she finally introduce me to the Red Lantern she had been talking about since she FTR'd it a month ago.\n\nTwo entrances to this place (front and rear, surprisingly) make it an ideal spot to grab a bite and a pint if you're running from somebody.  Ceilings are high, and they've left the concrete-and-truss canopy in place for a modern feel that grew on me after the fact while I wrote this review.  A dark wood floor with some character and new dark tables offset the off-white ceiling and bar nicely. The most distinctive feature was definitely the public-facing hand-washing area between the men's and ladies' rooms.  I'm a big advocate of public hand-washing sinks -people are more likely to wash (and to do a good job of it) if they know they're being watched.  \n\nShari strongly suggested a pizza or calzone; notwithstanding my preference for getting something different from my company, the Classic pizza (pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms and red peppers) was so strongly recommended that I went for it despite the fact that Shari had ordered the same thing in folded format.  Delicious and filling!  Crust was a bit soggy in the center, probably from all the chunky tomatoes and peppers.  Ordering the calzone will no doubt aid in avoiding this problem, and I'll go that way in future.\n\nDeduct one point for a lame beer selection.  They have Steamwhistle (which I refuse to spell as two words) and a bunch of big-brand stuff like Bud and Canadian (ugh).  I think Toronto's beer drinker is a bit more sophisticated these days, and it's a shame that some restaurants haven't caught up.  If you're not a beer drinker, please do adjust your set, until my rating reads four stars.
