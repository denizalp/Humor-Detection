Nice airport!  Everything from the washrooms to the baggage claim to the seating areas were very clean!\n\nThought it would be very busy because we arrived close to 5pm!  Got into Customs, and there was absolutely no lines.  Talk about great timing!\n\nWould gladly fly into this airport again in the future based on this one experience.
