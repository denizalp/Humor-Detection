Update: my gel mani didn't event last 10 days before the polish started to peel. I have consistently gotten 3 weeks out of gel manis at my regular place.\n\nInsanity is repeating the same action and expecting a different result. I knew when I came here today that I was going to leave unhappy, yet here I am. \n\nI didn't have time to go to my normal place today, and I won't be making this mistake again.\n\nI had a powder dip manicure and wanted to get gel. I should have known to just cut my losses and go when the technician tried to file them down with the drimmel type tool instead of soaking. I insisted she soak them and she started pouting like a toddler and stomping around. \n\nIn the manicure process she ended up ripping one of my nail tips and had to patch it (just picked a big glob of acrylic out from under my nail), but a second one she couldn't patch, so that nail is just shorter than the others. \n\nShe was really rough and it was obvious she was annoyed throughout that I had her soak my nails. She also hovered around the counter when I checked out, to see if I left a tip. Awkward!
