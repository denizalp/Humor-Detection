I love the meat shop and the bakery makes great cakes.   This is a review for and warning about the restaurant. \n\nThe service is extremely slow.  The food is just ok, not great.   My husband ordered a Monte Cristo and said it was good.  I ordered the banana cream pie.  It was basically a thick banana pudding with whipped cream on top.\n\nHere's what really drives the one star rating.   They allow dogs inside the restaurant at the tables.  Not just service dogs but house pets and on this occasion there was a lady hand feeding her dog from her plate!  The dog was actually better behaved than the lady.  I have pets myself and I love to frequent dog friendly places but I stay on the patio with my dogs & don't hand feed them from my plate.  Gross.   I was not the only diner who found this upsetting. \n\nI'll stick with the meat shop & bakery from now on.
