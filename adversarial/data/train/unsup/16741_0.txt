This place was great! I was interested in taking adult lessons, but wasn't too keen on taking huge group lessons with 10 other people, and didn't have the money to get private lessons. Making Waves offers adult classes with max 4 students per class. There are mainly beginners there, but I was in one intermediate-ish class so was able to challenge myself further with new techniques rather than re-learning basic floats and strokes. My teacher was great and helpful and gave us (the other students and I) a good balance of learning new techniques vs practice time, and review vs challenges. They have classes for kids too, but not at the same time. During adult class time, there are only adults in the pool. I liked how my teacher was a bit older (university student), I have to admit. Most of the others looked like high school kids.
