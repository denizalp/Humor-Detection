We called for a free estimate to repair water damage in a bathroom wall\/floor.  Nick came out and answered all of our (many, many) questions in an unhurried, professional way.  He really took his time giving us a thorough evaluation of the extent of the damage, the repair options, etc.  I appreciated that he didn't try to sell us on anything, and that he seemed to really know his stuff.  I'd recommend him to a friend without any reservations.
