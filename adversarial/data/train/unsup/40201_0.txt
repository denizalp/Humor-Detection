It was my first time visit of this Persian restaurant. It is located on restaurants district on Eglinton West and Avenue road area which is a trendy and nice area. Once I entered the place I found it more upscale, spacious and odor free than I imagined.  The host and the waiters were extremely polite and careful. We ordered \"Mirza GHasemi\" for appetizer (a famous Persian appetizer made of smokey egg plant and dried yugurt). It was well smoked and appetizing. For the main course we ordered a Kebob Koobideh and a Kabob Barg and both of them came with the customary mountains of saffron rice. Both Kebobs were delicious, tasteful and flavorful. The meat perfectly spiced, even the tomatoes were good. The host told us that they only use top and bottom sirloin for their Kebobs. The rice was cooked perfectly, but it was served a bit cold. I would loved to see some  \"Tah- Deek\" (crunchy rice chip like shape) with my rice or as a separate house complimentary! Maybe the \"Next time\" !  I am definitely going to put this place in my seamless rotation! This place filled my craving for Persian food for a Monday night!
