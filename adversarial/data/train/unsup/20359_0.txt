I was trudging through this particular Walmart looking for camping provisions and I came upon this unicorn in a sea of centaurs.  My first thought was, \"OH MY GAWD BECKY LOOK AT HER BUTT!.......  I like big butts and I cannot lie!\"\n\nFUNYUNS FOR LESS THAN $3.49?  HOLY CRAP?!!  DOUBLE RAINBOW WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!  FUNYUNS as far as I've known have never been on sale.\n\nSomeone over at Big Oil probably spoke to someone over at Big Funyun to let the peasants have a day in the sun.\n\nI don't know what to say that would add any appreciable nugget of information.
