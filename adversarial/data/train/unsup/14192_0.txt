After hearing about this place from a friend and DDD, I finally went there to check it out! needless to say, it is a pizza joint in a bar or vice versa! Let's get that straight, it is not going to be the cleanest, fanciest, nor is it going to appeal everybody! What it lacks in these things, is the character of the bar and FOOD! \n\nLike everybody says, the Stromboli here is one of the better ones around! Even better is that it's 50% off after midnight! Beers are ice cold! The Boli's are hot, crispy, flavorful! And the staff is pretty cool! \n\nThe downside is, it is in BFE in terms of people who don't live around in immediate area! But oh well! A small price to pay for a damn good Stromboli! \n\nCheers!
