I was very happy with brakes plus the first  two times I went in. But then I went in to get my brakes checked and they said they were fine but I did need my struts, shocks and a transmission flush for $900. So I figured I could trust them. Well I later found out the shocks in the front were changed and not the struts. I had already done a transmission flush just a few months before and couldn't remember until I was looking for all my receipts  from them. The worse thing was when I told them there was something wrong with whatever they had done a few weeks before because my brakes were getting hard or loose. The gentleman stated they checked the brakes and nothing was wrong with them. Two days later I lose full use of my brakes and had to get a tow truck to take my truck to the dealership. It was my master cylinder and it had been leaking into my brake booster and now I had a new bill for 2100 dollars. What if I would have crashed or hurt someone, because they didn't pay attention or care about what I had stated. I will never go there or any other brakes plus. If there professionals they would have known.
