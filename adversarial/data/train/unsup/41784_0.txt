I go here once every three or four weeks to get my eyebrows and upper lip threaded, and I'm never disappointed! There are often quite a few people there before me, so I have to wait a bit sometimes, but it's well worth it. Once I'm sitting down, it takes less than ten minutes for gorgeous results! Their prices are just as good as their services, coming out to a total of $14. And, while I have yet to take advantage of it, there are a number of considerable discounts and freebies through their rewards program on Fivestars. Overall, I highly recommend this establishment!
