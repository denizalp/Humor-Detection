This used to be a couple of different bars, but the new ownership has a hit here! I work right down the street so this place has been the \"after work with friends\" place for quite a while.\n\nI had to get to a TV lately right after work to watch my favorite BB team. This time however, the bartenders were very friendly. The beer selection is very good with all the national pours, a few local taps and 2 rotating taps. I have always found an IPA I loved!\n\nSo, I got hungry. They have a happy-hour menu that includes the usual items so I got some 'skins and wings. They have like a hundred wing combinations so I got a dry rub spicy. So they come out and the 'skins were just awesome! Loaded with some pulled pork and their own spicy BBQ sauce. I was surprised and impressed. The wings were crisp and tasty. \n\nI'm not sure what upped the ante here but I have been back regularly since. I think they must have an experienced chef making the tasty treats. For a sports bar with good well-lit seating and 20 some odd Tvs (with two patio eating\/viewing areas) the quality of the food is surprising and welcome.\n\nI think you should go there!
