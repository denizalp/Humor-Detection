The very idea behind this sort of business is awesome, essentially it's like the Salvation Army or goodwill where you leave your unwanted clothing except they are willing to offer some money....\n\nUnless you are bringing items that are currently in store at aritzia or brandy Melville, don't even bother wasting your time driving here.\n\nI was turned away after waiting an hour for them to look at my stuff and then another hour while they had my items, only to be told that NONE of my DESIGNER items were trendy enough. \n\nThis would have been a reasonable response if I had walked through a consignment store with Louis Vuitton and Prada but when I walk through a store that has forever 21 used and abused tanks and tees.... being told my items don't measure up is pretty lame.
