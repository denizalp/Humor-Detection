Saturday date night and we left Cornish Pasty Co not really sure of where to hit next, until we glanced a little sign across the street directing us to a wine tasting. Hey, I like wine! There was a cute front patio with twinkle lights and the weather was gorgeous, making our decision even easier. \n\nWe tasted four wines and got an extra taste of our favorite of the four (they were down by one white from their regular menu). We ended up taking home a bottle of the viognier. We really enjoyed the patio. Apparently, they were recently requested to host a bridal shower, which is pretty genius. They also have some wine pairing events going on for Thursdays with a food truck that sounded pretty great too.  \n\nIf we're in the area with some friends, we might hit this place up again.
