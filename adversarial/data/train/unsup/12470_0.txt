Aside from the insane line up, bad service and the cheap table\/chairs the food is really THAT good. \n\nIt's traditional Afghan food with most of the traditional choices of rice and meat. Halal Chicken, lamb and beef. Limited veggie options.\n\nI came here for take out and for $13, got a hefty container of rice, 2 beef Kabab strips, salad and yogurt sauce. \n\nWhat you should try, coming here:\nBouglanee - think quesadilla but softer pan fried bread stuffed with potatoes, spring onions and herbs. \n\nKofta Kabab - 2 skewers of ground beef . The meat is perfectly tender and the spices are JUST right. I cannot explain how hard it is to find the just right mix for the perfect Kabab. This place, they definitely nailed it. \n\nSultani Kabab - the 2 different types of Kabab - this is heaven for meat lovers. 1 skewer of a rougher type of Kabab (think - steak) and 1 skewer of a tender beef Kabab.\n\nQaubolee rice - Traditional Afghan rice. Cooked with chicken broth. Made with thin carrot shreds, raisins and almonds (sometimes cashews).  - Delicious. \n*fun fact: This type of rice is made specifically for meat. \n*The white rice is made for chicken. \n\nTip: call ahead of time and order. Since this is the only decent Afghan restaurant around Mississauga, you'll see mostly Afghan,persian,pakistani  families.  Be prepared , you will have kids running around, uncles, fathers, cousins, nephews, aunts, brothers in law- all socializing whilst waiting in line for food. \nYou are pretty much witnessing a family gathering.\n\nIt's a small space so the tables are all cramped together. I highly suggest take out. The staff are pretty monotone - which is always amusing. Service is next to nil ch here. Don't bother expecting it. Expect what it does offer, authentic Afghan food and nothing else. \n\nxoxox\nM.
