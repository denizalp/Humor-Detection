Went to this location tonight. Where our food was cold and took forever to come out. I couldn't even eat my wings the medium was too hot and the wings and fries were literally ice cold. This isn't the first bad experience I've at this location but it is definitely the last. Thanks for wasting my time and $35 bucks.
