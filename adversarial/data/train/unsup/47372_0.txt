I heard about Firkin a few weeks ago.  I finally was afforded the opportunity to check it out.  I was in the area waiting to pick up a friend from nearby McCarran Airport.  I stopped in for a quick pint.  It was a Monday night.  The first Monday night of the NFL season meaning a Monday Night Football game.  Local radio station X 107.5 was there.  Beer was only $3.00.  Some food was priced lower for the game also.  I started with just a pint of New Castle.  I came back after hitting the airport.  I then ordered another pint and the fish and chiplets ($5.00 special).  The service was good.  The staff are willing to talk to you and aren't just going through the motions.  I found the experience to be rather enjoyable.  From the service to the good food.  The fries are battered and crispy.  The fish was in the form of nuggets (small pieces).  Battered, fried, hot and crispy.  The tartar sauce was delicious.  I believe it had green onion in it.  A squeez of the grilled lemon and a drizzle of the malt vinegar across the plate made for a dinner worthy of the British beer and atmoshpere that firkin provides.  \n\nSome other points to note are:\n1. The self-serve beer wall with 10 beers to choose from \n2. The game room with billiards, darts, and shuffle board\n3. The large and clean restaurant area\n4. The lack of annoying slot machines at the bar.\nand one for the guys (or some gals, I don't judge)...\n5. The waitresses are wearing short plaid \"kilts\" and low cut tops.\n\nI had a good time during the couple of hours I spent at Firkin.  I plan to go back several times.  Maybe it wont be frequently but this is certainly a place I can see myself for a beer or two after work perhaps a couple times a month.
