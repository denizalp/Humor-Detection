This is my first yelp review.  I use the site often, but decided to finally register for the sole purpose of reviewing The Covered Window.  \n\nWe first met Brian from The Covered Window at one of the home & garden shows at the fair grounds.  The show itself was a miserable experience.  The whole day was full of brochure collecting, niceties, and trying to dodge the countless vendors trying to get our contact information or \"make an appointment for consultation.\"  It was hot, crowded, and overall a terrible way to spend our Saturday afternoon.  After hours upon hours of walking and talking, the only vendor who stood out in our mind was The Covered Window.  Brian was very approachable, down-to-earth, and (I felt) honest about his business.  When we took his flyer, I put it in a separate bag so that we wouldn't forget him.\n\nFast foward to a few months later.  We're finally ready to buy blinds for our windows and I decide to call Brian for an in-home estimate.  Kelly (Brian's sister-in-law I think?) made an appointment for him to come out and he was on time.  He behaved in our home just as he had at the home show, which I really appreciate.  He gave us his honest opinions, tons of options, and the best price we'd seen.  We covered every window in our new home with REAL wood blinds (including free upgraded valances, cord tilt, and light-tight slats) for $300 LESS than what JC Penney quoted us for FAUX WOOD at their \"70% off\" sale!  I couldn't believe it.  He even helped us choose which color we wanted.  We were torn between white and natural wood.  He offered to put up natural wood in our living room only so that we could live with them a few weeks before deciding if we wanted it in the whole house.  He never charged us for extra trips or estimates.  \n\nBottom Line:\n\n1) Customer service is EXCELLENT (quick appointments, no pressure sales, quick delivery\/installation)\n\n2) We love supporting local family-owned businesses!!!\n\n3) Prices beat even JC Penney (so good we didn't haggle at all - they were fair already!)\n\n4) Quality of product and installation are OUTSTANDING!!!  Our blinds look beautiful, work smoothly, and look like the custom work that they are.\n\n\nThanks Brian and Kelly!!!
