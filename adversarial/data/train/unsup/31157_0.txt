By far the worst airline I've ever flown. The flight and check in crews were rude. There were multiple delays in my flight home, which ended up leaving 2 hours later than the last posted delayed time. After paying baggage (both checked and carry on) fees as well as a fee for an upgraded seat (which offered little to no additional room) their prices aren't any cheaper than the major airlines.
