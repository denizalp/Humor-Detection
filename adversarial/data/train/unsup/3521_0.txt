I did a lot of homework in my search for a great deal on a 75 and a 65 inch TV. Best Deal In Town simply can't be beat.  I went to all the big box stores, searched the internet for reviews and watched the ads for several months. You may find a better price in some dark corner of the internet, but you shouldn't be buying big TV's on the internet. Buy it local so you can deal with someone (Mason) in person if there is an issue. \n\nMason is a straight shooter and easy to work with. I came back four times to look at the TV's I ultimately purchased from him. He was helpful each time. He even gave me a recommendation for media shelf idea that saved me $500 aside from the $500 or so that I saved buying TV's at his store. I am totally satisfied that I actually got the Best Deal in Town. Now I just have to decide what I'm going to watch first. Pacific Rim, Jurassic World or Avatar !?!\n\nIf you want a huge TV at the best price go here immediately. Also there is a great accounting office next door in case you need that sort of thing.
