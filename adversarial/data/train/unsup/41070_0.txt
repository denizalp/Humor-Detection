I visited Top Golf Gilbert, AZ location on September 30th, 2017. We made a reservation event ahead of time for our friends bachelor party. There were 8 of us gents and we had a corner booth to the far left, facing the range, on the same level as the bar. Azia was our server that day and she was excellent. We had also received catered food for our event which included brisket, cowboy baked beans, macroni and cheese, sweet rolls, and salad with two dressings. Sodas and waters were also included in this package. The food was very good. Not over the top but it was just what a couple of guys at the range were looking for in a meal. We watched college football and spent 3 hours in our booth. Aside from the main event bill, Azia was able to give those of us who wanted to drink some adult beverages all separate tabs, which was very helpful. I had several different draft beers, their selection was a great mix of domestics, imports, and even featured some craft brews such as Four Peaks Kilt Lifter(the brewery is located there in Tempe which is where we went after Top Golf). I live in Las Vegas, NV and work on the Strip but I have yet to go to our Top Golf location. After my visit to Top Golf in Gilbert, Azia's fantastic service and participation with our group, I will definitely recommend this location to friends and family who habe not been yet.
