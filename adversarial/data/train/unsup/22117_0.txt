We stopped here as part of the Yelp French Fry Crawl 2. I say stopped, because we didn't actually get to sit. Apparently a party of 25 had booked a reservation for 7. We were there... 7:15?\n\nOkay, so we're not happy about not being able to sit, fine. Kat gets take-out fries... and winds up having the bill thrown at her. Excuse us for partaking of your establishment.\n\nAs for the food... I'm sorry, but if your fries aren't as good as McDonald's - and these ones looked the same but tasted like McDonald's fries that had gone slightly off - I find it hard to believe you can handle anything more complicated than dipping potatoes in hot oil.
