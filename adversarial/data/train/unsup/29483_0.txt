Never never never go to Paul Mitchell school. They refused service today because I have eczema which I have had for many years.  I drove 20 miles to go to there , and then they refused service. At no time was I ever advised there was any possibility that they would not do the service. The young man named Fabian was extremely arrogant about the whole situation. Never go to that school.
