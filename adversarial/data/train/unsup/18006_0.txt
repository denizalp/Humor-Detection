This is for the 30 day non-food Yelp Challenge but I can't seem to have it on hold until then b\/c it's a FTR and New Business. \n\nBefore you think this is the children's line for the sultry Bebe's women fashion line, it is NOT. Back to your search before you start dressing your child like one of those Bratz dolls. \n\nAnd in most RANDOM stores I've found in Toronto, it's gotta be this one. \nBebe is located just north of Pape Station and specializes in baptism and first communion clothing. It's Greek obvs. \nI know it's been around for over 20 years. I also know the window display just changed in 2010. \nIt is the store that won't die. \n\nVIBE\nSo for fun, I decided to go in here with a friend and it was so awkward because 1. we had to knock on the door to get in and 2. the lady didn't speak English. \nSo naturally, we pretended we were married looking for a christening gown for our child. \nIt didn't go over so well. The lady could hardly understand us. That said, man, there are a LOT of white mini-gowns in here. \nI'm not sure of the price points. We didn't get that far. \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nBring a Greek friend with you. It may help if you're making a serious purchase. Otherwise, are you us? Do you pretend to have a husband so you can peep into a store you've wondered about for 20 years? Yeah...
