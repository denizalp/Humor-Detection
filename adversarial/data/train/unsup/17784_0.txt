BLUF: You get the Madness when you get the total.\n\nI like to think of this as haole style oriental food.  The problem I have with it is that it's way too expensive.  The g\/f and I got a combo plate with spicy chicken and teriyaki chicken with white rice, some stir fry veggies (which was 80% cabbage) and one small soda.  Some how that came out to over $11.  I guess that's where it gets the \"madness\" in it's name.  The food was good, but not so great that I would call it 'addicting' or justify the price.  The portions were small for what we ended up getting.  My g\/f said that it was about 2\/3's the size of the portion that she got when she came here before.  \n\nThe food was like going to Panda Express, except the chicken was cooked fresh.  So in my opinion, it was not worth the Madness of the cost.
