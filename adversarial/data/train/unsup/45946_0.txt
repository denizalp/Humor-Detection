Friends took us here since we were in the neighborhood already.  They doted on the mole so of course I had to try one of those enchiladas as well as a chile verde one and a carnitas taco..,yeah I was overstuffed.  We al shared the funduta (sp) with chorizo and it was really good.  Our meals were great (they were right about the mole).  My only negative was the chips and salsa...I prefer my chips thin and these were thicker, almost like the bagged kind, and I thought the salsa really needed some salt.  Overall, very good place.
