I love this gym! It is always clean, very spacious and has a lot of equipment. I rarely, if ever, have to wait for equipment. I honestly don't know why it isn't busier. It's incredibly reasonable and works out to about $20\/month for the first year, and the maintenance fee after the first year is $30-40 I believe. I will say that the one thing about going to a smaller gym is the lack of professionalism with the staff. One morning, I got to the gym at 6:30 am, and it was CLOSED (it is supposed to open at 6:00 am). No one was there. I have no idea what happened. I sent an email to raise my concerns about this, and all I got was a \"sorry it's open now\". That is completely unacceptable - nothing irks me more than getting up to go to the gym at 6:30 am, to find it's closed. \n\nDespite that, I still love the gym and the clientele.
