I honestly didn't have high expectations for this show but we got two free tickets to attend so why not?  We normally wouldn't waste our time going to a show or restaurant just because it was cheap or free but this show had great Yelp reviews so we went in with open minds.   An hour later, we left with minds BLOWN!  \n\nIn my opinion, this show was much better than Penn & Teller and David Copperfield shows that I've seen, where I also paid a lot of money.  I walked out of those shows thinking, \"did I miss something?\" or \"that last trick was cool but lots of lame and cheesy lead up\".  Paranormal is set in an intimate small venue where everyone is fairly close to the stage.  Although Paranormal isn't the same type of visual magic, there definitely is a visual element and lots of astonishment and moments of \"how did he do that???!!!\"  Is this magic or mind reading or some other trickery?  I don't know but I was truly amazed from start to finish and highly recommend this show!
