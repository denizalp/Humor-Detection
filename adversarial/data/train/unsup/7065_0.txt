Absolutely disgusting! \n\nI got the worst food poisoning from their disgusting fucking fish and they charged my credit card twice! Their prices are high for shitty sushi, and the ambience is depressing on top of that.\n\nIf you like fishy underhanded staff and fish that will make you vomit, eat here. Otherwise I suggest you don't touch it with a 10 foot pole.
