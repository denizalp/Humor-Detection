Horrible service. We are never going back there again. It was an absolute nightmare all the mistakes the server kept making and when we finally got our meal it was cold and tasted disgusting. Because of all the delays when we finally left we were late arriving at the Royal Alexandra Theatre.\n\nWe paid in cash and left a note on the napkin asking the manager to fire the waiter.
