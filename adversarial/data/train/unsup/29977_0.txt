Delicious and affordable! \n\nFlank steak wrap and the curried apricot soup were fantastic. \n\nGood value for the combo at $10.99 for decent portions of soup and wrap.\n\nVery busy during lunch hours on weekdays but worth it.\n\nNote: Every dish is somewhat spicy, not overwhelmingly so but if you can't have any spice this is not the place for you.\n\nOverall highly recommended.
