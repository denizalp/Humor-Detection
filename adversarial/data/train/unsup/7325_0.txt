L&L always brings me memories of being crammed in a hotel room while working on costumes --- eating those spam musubis while ironing pretty lacy dresses.  Wait, what?\n\nL&L is a wondrous place.  Prices are great, the portions are abundant, and the food is tasty.    This place is just as good as the one in Lancaster, California.  Actually, it's a million times better!\n\nWhen I sit at the table, inside this amazing eatery, I like staring at the fake sky.  \"AH... so that's how high my cholesterol is now.\"\n\nGood times.
