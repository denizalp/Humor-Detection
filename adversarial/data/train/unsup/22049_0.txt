Who are the people in your neighbourhood? Well, Sesame Street tells us a postman or fireman are people in my neighbourhood and though I whole-heartedly agree with both their message and method at which to teach children, they fail to mention the butcher!\n\nI heart meat. \n\nI can't begin to tell you what's considered a good price for a hefty cut of top sirloin or ribeye steak and if this place fits the bill. What I can tell you is they have fresh cuts of meat, lamb burgers, these ridiculously addictive pepperettes (who knew I was a fan, huh?), panchetta, garlic aioli with herbs and lemon (among other flavours), pot pies (the steak and mushroom one is fantastic), homemade cannolis and biscottis, fresh bread and the friendliest staff wielding a knife.\n\nThose living in this area? Use the grocery store to buy your cereal and frozen dinners. But for your meats, bread, pasta (oh yes, they gots pasta here too), Royal Beef is your carnivorous weapon of choice.
