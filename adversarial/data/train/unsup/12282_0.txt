Gotta admit... the first impression is below average. Pulled into a strip mall in a sketch part of Vegas to find a doorbell type device that you push to be allowed access to the first part of the store. Pushed it once...waited...pushed it again...waited some more...pushed it a third time and got ready to bail right before the door clicked open. Meanwhile, the chain smoking female security guard outside shot me a suspicious look.\n\nOnce inside, everything was the polar opposite of the exterior. Friendly owner\/manager(?), fun employees and terrific and reasonably priced product. The interior is really nice and the prices are projected on a big screen.... Found out that you can't actually touch the herb before purchasing it, per Nevada laws.\n\nKind of like strip clubs, I guess.
