I got a haircut with Matsumi yesterday and couldn't be happier! I told her what I wanted and she understood right away, and showed me various pictures from the hairstyle magazines to make sure we are on the same page. She washed my hair first before proceeding to cut it, and checked up with me the entire time to make sure I liked it. She was very detail-oriented and I was very satisfied with the end result.\n\nI previously had a haircut with Jina a few years ago due to all the rave reviews of her, but I liked my haircut by Matsumi much better. Like I mentioned before, she was extremely dedicated to details.\n\nBe sure to make an appointment before going. It's $35 wash + cut, plus additional tip. I've tried more expensive cuts before and they were either the same or not even as good as the cut I got yesterday.\n\nThey give out juice boxes at the beginning!
