The galley boy is the BEST! The food is always consistent and service is excellent. However there are unsavory characters walking through the parking lot. One approach my car and proceeded to say terribly mean & vulgar things to me. Due to having a food tray position on my window I couldn't drive away or put my window up. I was held hostage and forced to listen to this guy while the employees just watched. I will continue to patronize Swensons but not this location until the staff can secure the parking lot and keep the customer safe.
