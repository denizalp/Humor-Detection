3 stars for dim sum + 0.5 star for services and deco + 0.5 star for Early Bird Special.\n\nMy experience of Crown Princess Fine Dining is based on the $3.10 Early Bird Dim Sum Special. I am quite value driven so I am happy to pay $3.10 for the dim sums S\/M\/L sizes but if I would have pay full prices then it will be a much harsher review.\n\nI have to say that the deco and the services here are both excellent! The waitstaffs are everywhere. There are even at least 4 managers working on the floor to make sure everything run smoothly. \n\nHot water always refilled for the teapot, dishes always cleared right after we finish eating, the waitstaffs are all nice\/young\/polite.\n\nThe dim sums we ordered are all good (comparable to the dim sum quality at Richmond Hill\/Markham) and nicely presented. We enjoyed everything we ordered, except the Deep Fried Fresh Fruit Dumplings - Not only it is way too oily (dripping in oil, we have to use our napkins to soak it up before we dare to eat that) and it is stuffed with bananna, apple and mayo.. hmmm yuck!\n\nI would suggest making a reservations if you do come and it is so nice to able to make a reservations instead of waiting in line for a table.\n\nParking are free on Sundays, just bring your parking slips they will stamp it for you!\n\nIf you want the dim sum specials, you need to order before 11:00 AM Monday-Sunday and is Cash only!\n\nIf you are in the area, I would suggest you drop by but making a special trip from the Suburbs may not be worth it!
