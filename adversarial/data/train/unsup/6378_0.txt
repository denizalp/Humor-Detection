I would like to preface this review by saying I'm not a Superfan of Costco. (I am under the belief that you either shrug at the idea of Costco, or you are part of their massive cult of followers who find ways to inject their favorite place into every conversation. \"Oh, yes, I got mine at Costco for just 25 dollars! Can you believe it?\" \"I was at Costco this weekend and ...\" \"You know who has the best pitas? No, not Haji Babas, whatever that is, but COSTCO!\" God, you people freak me out.)\n\nAnyway, I will say they get huge accolades from me with their tire center. I am a Costco member now, but I was not in 2006 when I needed 4 new tires. So my sister went with me to get the good deal and that was that. Cut to yesterday, when my rear tire disintegrated during my morning commute. The same sister brought to my attention their 5-year warranty (this is a Costco warranty, not the manufacturer's, which sounds exceedingly less headache inducing to deal with). So I call and the guy on the phone surprisingly answers in less than 15 rings, is very helpful and does not rush me like every other car service phone conversation I've ever had. (Am I the only person who does not have their car's tire size committed to memory?) Plus they're open until 8p. \n\nI feared they would come up with a reason not to cover the damage under warranty (I expected to have to answer some 8-page questionnaire on car maintenance and provide documentation or something), but the service guy was incredibly casual about the whole thing, and in the end pro-rated the $70 replacement tire (new) to less than $20! He said the tire was \"about a year old.\" I don't where he got that from, but I didn't argue. They also waived the installation\/mounting fee, just 'cause. \n\nKudos to you, Costco. Now I'm running around like one of them Superfans telling everyone how great you are. Oh, you are good, aren't you?
