Eh, it was ok. Menu is kind of all over the place. Entrees consist of a steak, a pasta dish, mac & cheese, tacos, etc. It seems more like a club than a restaurant. The food wasn't bad. The cocktails are $15 apiece for a cocktail. I know it's downtown Scottsdale, but that felt way overpriced to me. No big urgency to go back.
