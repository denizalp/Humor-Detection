It's as if a Greek family invited me over to their house  for some home-cooked food. As a plus, the family has a classy place. It's in the financial district with easy access from the downtown hotels. Reminds me of that trip years ago to Santorini or Mykanos sans the big Pelican, without the windmills, without the rocky beaches, without backpackers and in fact without the whole country of Greece. I just like my Greek meal simple: Moussaka and ouzo. Maybe meatballs and ouzo. Maybe keftedakia me ouzo. Maybe kataifi, baklava and amygdalopita....OK, I'd give it that extra star only if this place was in the Aegean with me lying on some beach looking up at the *****.
