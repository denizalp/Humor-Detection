Amazingly refined and delicious pastries. The care, complexity and depth of flavors in each pastry are hands down better than Nadege or my previous favorite Rahier (although I still have a thing for Amadeus in Vaughan despite their surly service). The owner here on the other hand was very friendly and down-to-earth and you can tell every pastry is a labour of love.\n\nThe banana eclair was amazing. The extra care made to caramelize the bananas w rum shows and the pastry in this amazingly light creation was unlike any of the banal choux pastries you get elsewhere. The turtle tart was great too though I liked the eclair better (and I'm not even normally a fan of bananas). You try something here vs the abomination that is Dufflet (heavy, no subtlety that just drowns you in fat and sugar) and your taste buds will thank you! Tad pricey but I totally get it for the quality and time required for each creation.
