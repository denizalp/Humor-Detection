We chose to have dinner at Morels on Wed. night because my husband and I are both fans of French and being that he is on this steak kick \"French Steak House\" seemed to fit the bill. As you walk through the entrance of the restaurant you can smell all the delicious cheeses that are displayed in the cheese case. Our waiter was Chandler. He was \"awesome!\"  Upon his suggestion I ordered a glass of \"Sin Quan\" . He informed me that it is a hard to find wine that was opened by mistake and not normally served by the glass. The wine and beer list is impressive and that always makes for a good night! My husband had several different rare beers after starting with his favorite \"go to beer\" (Chimay) That was served in the correct glass. (Thank you!) \n\nShrimp Cocktail : Fabulous! Really fresh; Chilled to perfection; Beautifully presented. The only thing that could have made it slightly better for me is a lemon wedge.\n\n French Onion Soup : Jeff loved it! \n\nBaby Iceberg salad : I ordered with no bacon. Really crisp and tasty. I really liked the sun dried tomatoes. \nAsked for salt and was presented with a variety of three. I have never seen this before and thought it was a great touch.\n\nFilet: Cooked perfectly rare; Juicy\n\nMushrooms: Nice size portion for two; So tasty; One of my favorite things! \n\nMac and Cheese: None for me but my husband said it was good. Not to rich; not to cheesy; Again nice size portion\n\nFor our Cheese course we chose a variety of three after telling our server what we liked in our cheeses he did very well with suggestions. The cheese monger presented the cheeses and was very nice. We had a Mimolette\/cows milk from france, Cashel Blue\/cows milk from Ireland and the \"most stinky but interesting cheese I have yet to experience The Grayson\/cows milk from Virgina US. My husband and I were impressed and pleased with the selection. \n\nOverall I would say this was a wonderful experience. I haven't had such impeccable service in way to long. I could say that the service was 5 star all the way! The managers were warm and friendly even serving us our entrees. The staff was knowledgeable and fun and encouraged us to take our time and enjoy!!! \nThe decor of Morels is a little dull. I could see how it would fly in LA but in Las Vegas you expect a bit more due to the fact that everything is on a  grander scale here. I think sitting on the patio on a warm night would be a whole different story but as far the inside it just lacked that \"little extra something\" I hate to even say a negative thing about this place because I would most certainly  recommend Morels to anyone. We loved it and had a fantastic evening It was memorably fabulous!!!
