I have been coming to this place for over 10-15 years. The ownership has changed as has the decor, but the food quality has remained. Fair heads-up: I've never ordered food to go, always had sit-down meals. \n\nOver the years I've been coming here, I've brought family and friends, and everyone has always walked away satisfied. \n\nThe place use-to have a much more friendly staff, the current waiters are still friendly, but definitely not what it use to be 5 years ago. \n\nThe sweet and sour tofu is great, as is the yellow curry. Make sure to come for lunch, the specials are superb and you get a soup + spring roll. Most of the choices available can be made vegetarian. I've never been a fan of pad thai (in any Thai place), and no surprise, don't love it here either. \n\nDefinitely a great place to have Thai, that has food on par with (if not better than) may of the other standard Toronto Thai places.
