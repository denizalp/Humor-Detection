LOOK NO FURTHER for an AC company!  Seriously I wish every company, AC or otherwise had the strong customer service that this company has. When you are taken on such a huge expense  it nice when things go flawless. Alaskan Air personal were professional, kind, & timely .  I have to say I did have an issue, product related not company or service related.    My AC stopped working at 9:30 pm and by 10 am it was up and running.Alaskan Air stood by the product and also compensated me for me the few hours I missed from work. Like really!!!  I love this company! More than fairly priced and outstanding customer service. I tell this story to everyone whether they are in the market for a new AC or not.  It's so nice that a business like this exists and they should be recognized!
