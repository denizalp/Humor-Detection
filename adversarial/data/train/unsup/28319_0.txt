I was looking for a traditional bacon and eggs breakfast and found this. There was none of the usual western breakfast stuff but it was an egg based crepe. I found it quite flavourful but greasy. The coffee was ok but didn't taste freshly brewed. Reminded my of breakfasts in Kuala Lumpur - quite authentic.
