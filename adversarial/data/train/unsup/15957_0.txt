I've had a gift certificate burning a hole in my pocket since February.  Summer is just about over so I went looking for a store.  Seems 3 of the ones near me have closed up in the past few years.  I found this one on the North side of MetroCenter in the same strip mall as Fatburger and a bunch of other stuff.  There was plenty of parking.\n\nThe store was clean.  Plenty of parking.  Not very busy.  I am definitely showing my age when it bothers me having the young man making my creation with a two day old growth and several pieces of \"art\" in his nose and other parts of his face.  Getting past that, he was efficient and pleasant to deal with.  It was slow so we had a brief conversation about the number of remaining stores in the West side.\n\nI had a cheesecake signature creation, med.  It was good but I have been spoiled by Sweet Republic.  I still have some money left on the gift card so I know I will be back again to some location.
