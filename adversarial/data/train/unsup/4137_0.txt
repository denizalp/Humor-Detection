Wines intimidate me as much as lion, tigers, and bears; that is to say, a lot.  My palate for wine is as refined as oil from the oil sands; that is, not at all. (It's analogy day!) Add in the pretentiousness that sometimes comes with wine tastings, airings, and you have me running the opposite way when I hear \"wine\".\n\nEnter Mavrik wine bar. This little wine bar on Queen west opened up fairly recently and is as cozy as your favorite pajamas (ok, i'll stop).  It's a small space, but one that makes for an intimate, friendly atmosphere. No dress code, pleasant servers, friendly owners, no pretentiousness, just (mostly) wine.  \n\nAs the owner explained to me, they carry \"artisinal\" vintages of wine, which is something along the lines of micro brewed beer, or wines made in smaller batches.  They have about 30 different wines and the owners and servers took the time to help me understand what the heck I was drinking.  Not to say I'm the Einstein of wine now, but I think it did help, at least now I'm like the young apprentice (is that an analogy?) \n\nThe friendliness and atmosphere take away some of the intimidation of wine tasting and lets you have some fun without looking like an idiot.  All in all, it's a great spot for both wine lovers and those less wine-refined individuals as me, and a nice meet up spot for friends to hang out (face it, once you hit your late 20s, sports and dive bars just can't be an every-outting thing anymore. Dive bars get old like... oh wait, I said I'd stop).\n\nThe best part is, if I give up on wine while my friends keep on trying new ones, i can always opt for a beer :)
