Boooo!!! Bad service, cheesy salesmen, lack of car selection. Why did I buy from here? Desperation, I guess.\n\nThe repair service is so ridiculously overpriced you'd think they were selling you gold plated car parts. Plus, every person who works at the service center is very rude. \n\nI hate Midway, and I hate myself for buying from them. Don't make the same mistake I did!
