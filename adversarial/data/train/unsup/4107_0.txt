King taps is a fairly new restaurant\/bar in the financial district. It's pretty busy inside and without a reservation we sat at the bar. \n\nThe place itself is very modern but fairly generic with lots of tvs. Food was okay but not the best. I had steak frites and the steak was quite chewy and not the medium rare I had requested. The fries were pretty good though. Would not recommend this place for the food but the drinks selection is pretty good for an after works drink spot.
