Solid Three Star!\n\nI'd have given it a fourth star, but the service was a little spotty. Maybe it was an off-night, who knows, who cares? \n\nWoo-Che is a nice spot for AYCE Korean BBQ. My bff was in town with her boyfriend, so a friend and I all met up here for dinner one night before hitting the strip. I suggested AYCE Korean BBQ, so we hopped on my fancy Yelp app and saw a Yelp Deal. Sold.\n\nFair warning: bring both, a change of clothes and a bottle of febreze for later. You will smell like Seoul.\n\nAnyway, you walk in, and there are plenty of tables. You pick one, the server asks you what you want to drink (I suggest Hite), then they turn on your grill at the table.\n\nAll the meat is buffet style, so there are rows of all kinds of great uncooked meats. Shortrib, pork belly, seafood, chicken, top round, bottom round, etc. Grab it, throw it on your grill, and enjoy!\n\nThe Banchan selection is quite good too. I can say that I've had a much better experience at Tofu Hut, because I didn't have to worry about picking from a buffet. It's easier for me to go off  a menu. But that's just me. You may feel otherwise.\n\nThe ventilation system here is pretty good too, but like I said, make sure you bring a change of clothes, and\/or febreze.\n\nLastly, this place is priced well. About 20 bucks all in. Late night, they drop the price a few bucks too. Awesome! PLUS, there is a Yelp Deal!
