Dr Gregory T Bigler is excellent and highly recommend him for surgery.  I had surgery for bone spurs in my left shoulder and now I can actually use my left arm again!  Very professional and the staff is outstanding.  The surgery went great and during recovery Dr Bigler visits each patient to review the results of the surgery.  I spent 6 weeks in physical therapy and the staff again was excellent and the environment with the other patients was friendly.  I found Dr Bigler after researching many doctors in Las Vegas, always start with educational background and work experience and I found a great doctor.  He can speak Mandarin Chinese which he did with my wife during recovery.\nGreat job and thank you so much for your excellent service.
