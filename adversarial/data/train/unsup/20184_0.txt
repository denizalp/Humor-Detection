Went for Happy hour on a rainy Monday night!\nWhat a perfect place to be! As the rain came down, enjoying the company o friends in a cozy, chandelier lit, couch filled bar of friendly people. It was awesome!\n\nEven though I was there for the company, everyone said the drinks were really cheap. Great place, cheap drinks, friendly staff. How can you go wrong??\n\nRain not required! LOL\nCan't wait to go back.
