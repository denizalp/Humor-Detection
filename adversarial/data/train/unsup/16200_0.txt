First let me start by saying I have been here many times, however not for breakfast until this time. \nThis time was special, I had one of the best breakfasts I have had in a restaurant in months. \nThe eggs Benedict with chorizo was fantastic!!\nThe eggs were poached perfectly, the chorizo was tender and flavorful without being greasy. The hollandaise sauce was smooth and creamy. The portion size was very generous and left me more than satisfied. John the manager, Eric the bartender, and Daniel the busboy  were on point and I never had to ask for a thing.
