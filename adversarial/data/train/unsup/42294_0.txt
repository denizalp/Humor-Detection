Ok so the inside looks like it could be your creepy aunts 1950's house---and when I say kitchy I mean that there are tons of tchotckes!  When I heard there was unlimited wine how could I pass up at least trying this place.  The service was very tentative and efficient.  Food wasn't too bad---there is just a lot of it--which depending on your appetite can be a good or a bad thing.  All dinners come with the unlimited house red and white wine, soup or salad, a side of pasta, and a cappuccino at the end of your meal.  \n\nHubby had the steak pizziola and I had the chicken rio---both were pretty tasty.  The garlic bread nothing to get excited over.  The cappuccino that came after dinner had fluffy whipped cream on top and was delightful. Ample parking in the parking lot.  My experience was pretty good.  Probably a fun place to eat with a big group.
