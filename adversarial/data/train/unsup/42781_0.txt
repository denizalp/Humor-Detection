this truck comes to my job and ive tried it several times hoping for a great experience and ive yet to get it the fried chicken and mac and cheese are ok but thats it. The potato salad is the worst ive ever had in my life the BBQ is ok ive had better, alot better but the reason i gave to stars is the smell of the grease !!!! i think they fry everything fish and chicken in the same grease yuck!!!!
