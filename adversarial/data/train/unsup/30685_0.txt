The place is quite small but ulplthe service is fast and accurate. We were seated within 15mins of arrival for a weekend lunch. You can watch the noodles being made\/pulled while waiting for seats\n\nThe menu is small but tastes great! We got their jellyfish and beef shin apps - both were very good. The jellyfish had a crunch and did not taste fishy.\n\nI ordered the noodles with homemade pork sauce (dry) with thick noodles. To be honest, I didn't taste any difference between these hand pulled noodles and other kinds of noodles. The portions were also huge
