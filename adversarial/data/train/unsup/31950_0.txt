Great place! Came here on a random Wednesday morning around 11. Management is top notch. We ordered our breakfast which included a free coffee from Yelp. Upon getting our coffee, we noticed it wasn't very hot. The manager\/supervisor on duty said she'd much rather us have a fresh one so she brewed an entire new pot of coffee and even got us new cups. We also noticed her go out of her way to get another guest jelly, even though the jelly is self serve across the restaurant. Overall great experience and the food was good too!
