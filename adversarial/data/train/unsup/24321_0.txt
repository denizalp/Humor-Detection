It's been a while for a review but I was scrolling thru my foodie pics and started salivating over these blue corn pancakes and tiger shrimp tamales from Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. Not to be mistaken the also nonpareil lobster tacos are foogasmic as well! Just on my usual pescatarian diet lifestyle, if you're ever in Caesars, do yourself a favor skip the main dishes and pig out over the MG apps, you won't be disappointed. Flavor town extraordinare!
