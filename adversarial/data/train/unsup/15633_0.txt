What a disappointment.  My Hungarian waiter informed me that \"We have no stone crab, but we *may* have some at five.\"  I ordered scallops, only to see a neighboring table be served a pile of stone crab claws.  So thereafter, I called my waiter back over, only to be informed, \"It is now five, and we have them.  We never know before hand.\"\n\nIf you have \"stone crab\" in your restaurant's name, I suggest you get on top of the availability of primary menu items.  I felt like a character in the Monty Python cheese shop skit.\n\nMy waiter informed me he would comp me for the scallops (which were pretty meh... 15 or more on the plate, too tough, too salty).  When the bill arrived, I was comped instead for a slice of pie (Marie Callander style frozen pie with cardboard crust) and a cup of coffee.\n\nI hope my experience was out of the ordinary, but I paid $80 for dinner for one, and felt like I could have had a better experience for that price at a dozen other places in Vegas.  If you enjoy eating salty scallops, 10 feet from people eating the stone crab claws you were not allowed to order, Joe's is your place.
