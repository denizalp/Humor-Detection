From the outside, it doesn't look like much, and based on that, I haven't been able to drag my husband in there ever.  Finally, after driving all day from Utah, I succeeded!  He was just too tired to drive any further, and this place is about 1 block from the RV resort.  \n\nLooks can be deceiving !  Although it was very dark inside, like so many other LV bars, it was surprisingly clean, cool, and most important, well ventilated.  Plenty of people were smoking in there, and at first I was put off by that, but after a few moments I noticed the lack of smoke. Bonus!  \n\nThe food was A-OK!  I had the fish and chips, and they were just fine.  Not greasy, decent coleslaw, and crisp fries.  There is a lack of breakfast restaurants in this area, and since Steiners is a 24 hour joint, I will stop by for breakfast next time I'm in town.
