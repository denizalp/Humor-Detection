Amazing food! I've been here multiple times.   It's my go to for special occasions.     We always get the board : in house breaksticks, selection of meats and yummy  cheeses, homemade meatball,  liver pate etc.    Amazing way to start.    The gnocci are just like my nonna's...with the addition of truffles if your lucky.   Menu does change but there are always some variations of the items.   Gourmet Italian food.   I highly recommend it.   Plus the owner is absolutely fantastic.   All wait staff are kind courteous and knowledgeable.
