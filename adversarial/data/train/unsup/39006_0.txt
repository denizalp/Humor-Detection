Located in shady side, it's hard to miss this place. The check in offer should be in English , it can be confusing to customers who don't speak Chinese in Pittsburgh. They offer hot pot and boba drinks , but it's confusing because I simply thought judging by the name of the place, that it's a boba tea shop only. \n\nI'm thoroughly annoyed that the drinks are cash only. Really????????? I get you're trying to evade taxes but like get with the program. You could charge a minimum instead at least , like $10 to use card or something. I rarely carry cash so it wasn't ideal for me. So many boba places in LA take card payment for milk tea so maybe it's a different approach on the east coast here. Idk. Expectations shattered. \n\nThe drinks are a small selection of flavors. But I did come across some flavors I don't normally see. Caramel milk tea caught my eye. The drinks are good but I think I'm just too spoilt from all the high competition in LA, that this place is hard to judge from my previous experiences at other tea shops. I mean, bonus points for having a combo of hot pot and tea shop in one, I don't think I've seen that before. Where a shop specializes in milk tea and hot pot simultaneously. I've yet to try their hot pot before I can judge. \n\nInside the shop was kinda small but cozy. The decor is nice and the staff seems attentive.
