I was very impressed with Green.  I only came here because the people I worked with on a recent program had ridiculous food restrictions of the vegan variety.  I try to just cover my ears and not listen to them when they talk, because it's like listening to bubble boy.  Have we rebelled against our very nature?\n\nPutting that aside, the good news is that I ended up at Green, and it was delicious.  The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious-  great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles.  The \"mock\" chicken was whatever, the texture always gives it away for me.  \n\nThey also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety, and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious.  \n\nI would actually come back here, even if other options were present.  That's saying a lot.\n\n5 Stars
