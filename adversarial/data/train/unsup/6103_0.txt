Suburban Express is one of the most convienient ways to travel to and from U of I. If you live in the suburbs, there really isn't anything better unless you can get someone to pick you up from Union Station downtown. The only problem I have ever had with SE is that they never seem to have the friendliest staff at the ticket center. Hopefully, they are better since last time I took the bus.
