They told me they were going to \"look at the car and will call me back.\" They ended up replacing the parts without giving me a heads up or price quote. In the end they were asking an amount that was probably not reasonable...which I was not happy about, but was willing to pay (got no choice man). They gave a slight discount, then opened the door say \"we don't want you to come back.\" Crazy attitude. And yes I don't want to go back either.
