Place pretty much looks like every other franchised hair salon. Nothing special, just plain and simple. Came here with my two boys to get our trim on. My youngest finished first, while i was getting mine done, and it was soo bad that another stylist had to sit him down to finish the haircut. Not cool. I'm not the kind to make a scene or embarrass anyone, its just hair and it'll grow back. Our first and last time here though, thanks to Beth
