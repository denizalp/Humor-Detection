If you are interested in buy a dog or cat, stop here first. A lot of people will start at mall pet shops, not thinking about where the animals come from, or how they could save a shelter animal. While this shop is at the mall, the animals are rescues. Best of both worlds!\n\nThe adoption fees are really cheap: $17 dogs and free cats over 3 months.\n\nThink before bringing home a pet. Your home should be a new forever home. If you are committed to caring for an animal for the rest of its life, shop here (or another rescue organization) first. The animals will thank you!
