I have been here before and had a burger and fries, so this time I wanted to try the Quinoa onion rings, a drink, and possibly a bowl.\n\nThe quinoa onion rings were delicious. Bomb-tastic and out of this world. Probably the best part of these onion rings was that they were well cut, full onions; they weren't the pitiful, stringy types that tear straight out of the dough. Crispy dough, really fantastic. I had it with the garlic mayo too (which lead to fantastic breath, am I right?) and this was a really good, truly garlicky dip as well. To drink, I had their \"Liver cleanse\" juice or whatever it was, and it made beet juice surprisingly palatable by adding orange juice that gave it the tanginess it needed.\n\nFor the entree, I got the Buddha bowl and boy, was I disappointed. Frankly, I was let down by all of the positive reviews of Fresh's bowls (and all the people I see ordering them). The peanut sauce it came with was far too overpowering, as was the marinated tofu that came along with it. I felt like they had literally taken soba noodles and poured pure peanut butter all over it; there was nothing else but the peanut sauce's texture that almost made my throat close up from its sheer heaviness. I understood the purpose of the little sliced cucumber\/tomatoes and the bean sprouts on top was to alleviate it; but frankly, it did little to disguise how simply overpowering it just was. Even my friend (who is a health freak) found my bowl difficult to consume.\n\nOther than that, service was fast and attentive, if amazingly hipster. The staff are the textbook definition of hipster for sure. Would come back here again, but not for a bowl.
