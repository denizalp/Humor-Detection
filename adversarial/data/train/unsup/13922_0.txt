Had the spelt pasta and absolutely loved it!  They usually only make it if someone called in a large order and they may have extra.  So, if you want fresh spelt, you have to call in ahead to make sure they have it.  I also bought the ricotta gnocchi...Will try it later this week.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place and will definitely return!
