How can I not love the place where I adopted two of my babies, so many years ago? I was lucky enough at the time for there to be a deal, adopt one cat and get the second one free, or something like that! I laugh, because it's like going to a grocery store with deals like that!\n\nBut at the time it was perfect. I adopted two little orange tabby cats, little brothers! They were so great about making sure I knew what was involved and I was set up for my new babies.\n\nI think the aspect I loved the most was the fact that you got one free Vet appointment. Being new to AZ I had no idea what Vet to take my boys to, so it was great to get a list provided by the Humane Society. I was really pleased with the adoption process!\n\nThen a few years later I was blessed with a beautiful chocolate lab puppy, but not a ton of money. I was able to schedule her spaying, drop her off before work and pick her back up after work for a very inexpensive price. I think it is great and extremely convenient. They make it affordable and easy for everyone to spay\/neuter their pet, so there are no excuses!\n\nWhat a great Humane Society AZ!
