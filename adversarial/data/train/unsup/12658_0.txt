I HATE YOU!  I HATE YOU EDELWEISS VILLAGE! I HATE YOUR DELICIOUS CLASSIC EUROPEAN PASTRIES WITH DEEP NOTES OF CHOCOLATE AND FRUIT AND LADEN WITH FRESH RICH WHIPPED CREAM!  I HATE THE ABSOLUTELY YUMMY EUROPEAN HOT DISHES LIKE SCHNITZEL AVAILABLE AT YOUR DELI!  AND WHAT I HATE YOU MOST OF ALL?  THAT YOU'RE CLOSED ON SUNDAYS AND STAT HOLIDAYS!!!!!\n\nPhew... now that I got that rant out of my system.. one more quick addendum to my hatred....they're open on hours that gives me only a 1 hour overlap with my work hours. (Which gives me very little time when taking into account I would have to leave 15 min. into that time as I need to get to work!!)\n\nWhy do I hate Edelweiss Village with such a passion?  Because this place is simply a Bavarian Oom Pah Pah of awesomness and wonder!  If I could go here daily for a coffee (incidentally also awesome) and lunch a few times a week, I would!    \n\nThe Village is a quaint jaunt into a classic Germany and eastern European land of delicacies and knick knacks of all sorts!  If you're looking for hard to find Polish cabbage rolls, Hungarian goulash, Czech sauces or unusual dried and frozen foods from the many regions of Deutschland, it's the best place in the city to find it.  \n\nBest of all, if you're actually FROM the old country, it's one of the best ways to keep in touch with it as well!  Plenty of tabloids, household tools and decor and touristy knick knacks are all over the place.  \n\nNow if they could also do something about the parking situation as well....\n\n#53 of Yelp's 30-Day Review Challenge
