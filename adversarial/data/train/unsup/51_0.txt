I'm still pretty new to the area, but so far this is one of my favorite places ive been to.  But then again, theres few things I enjoy more than laying out, having some pool fun and drinks with friends. Personally, I found this place very chill- especially in comparison to the crazy Vegas pool clubs. I kept hearing that is Douchebag central, but no one bothered me, I drank my Bud Light Limes in peace. I went Sat. No hassle or line getting in, bar was open and never had to wait long for a drink- so I was one happy lil camper. Love the concept- nice job Spanish Fly! I'll be back again soon.
