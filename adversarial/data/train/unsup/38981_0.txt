Like most chinese spots, customer service is not their number 1 priority...some of the servers are a bit friendly but theres a huge language barrier. Sometimes i ask for extra sauce or ice and theyll roll their eyes n chuck it on the table when they bring it...if they didnt auto grat every single table, they prolly wouldnt get tips at all!! But anyways, the food!! Ive never had their dinner, only dimsum! Happy hoir is from opening til 11am $3.50 per s\/m\/l dishes. Used yo be $3, but inflation...i love their fried taro dumplings and steam egg yolk buns!! Bbq steam buns are good too. The ratio of filling to dough is spot on. Unlike some places...tiny filling and all dough! They have a really good turnip patty fried w.xo sauce! You can find on the back of the order sheet, but its only available after 11am. I find their portions and pricing to be pretty decent and the taste too! Another dish i loved was the snowpea leaves and mushroom steam dumplings but its been discontinued :( wompwomp.. Been her dozens of times, so here are my pictures...
