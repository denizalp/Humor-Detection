I'm going to have to give this place 4 stars.\n\nYes, it took about 2 hours to get my driver's license, but I had a place to sit and once I received my license and found that I didn't need to renew it for about 20 years... well, heck yeah!\n\nAnd while I waited I sure did get a good show, presented by the good ole folks of northern phoenix.  I saw every type of person that you could imagine.  I especially like the grandma, her meek daughter, and the hideously ugly baby-child.  There was this B movie back in the 70's called \"It's Alive\".  It was 'that' baby.  I'm sure it was beautiful on the inside, though.\n\nJamie Lynn was having a serious conversation with her mother.  Evidently she had found the wrong man in her life:\n\n\"Mom, I know he loves me. He really does.\"\n\n\"You don't know shit.  Dump that son of a bitch or I swear I'll kick your ass out on the street and this baby along with you.  Don't think I won't.\"\n\n\"But momma..\"\n\n\"Don't but me, kick that bastard out or I swear I'll get someone to kill the bastard.\"\n\nI stuck my tongue out at the baby, thinking 'it' would laugh at me, but it only screamed.  I looked up just in time to see 'grandma' giving me the evil eye, but I never minded her none.  The baby though... man, just thinking about it still gives me the creeps.
