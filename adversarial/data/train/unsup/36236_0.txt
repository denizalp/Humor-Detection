Great place to get your eyebrows threaded. I'm always pleased with the results! I always go to susan, so I can't speak on the other girls. But Susan is amazing she really makes the experience enjoyable for me. With her there is no pain which we all know is hard to find when it comes to threading. And the prices ate great. Also they have really pretty jewelry and they do henna! Look no further this is the best place to get your brows done!!!
