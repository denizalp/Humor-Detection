I have been coming to this Swiss Chalet's location for years. \n\nGood for a quick meal. Nothing too fancy. Service is a little stiff but quite attentive.\n\nI would stay away from the ribs though, the last few times it had been really dry. The chicken though never disappointed. \n\nOver the years, I can see the size of my chicken growing smaller...... Maybe one day I can eat a whole chicken by myself.
