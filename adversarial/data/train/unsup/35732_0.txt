In many ways the uniqueness of this restaurant merits a visit, \"endless\" wine with quaint nostalgia on the walls. But for some this can be a trip to one of Dante's levels; to start, by sitting at the table you become part of a factory-style service with explanations coming at you like an auctioneer, the food is served with efficient repetition and the quality is on par with chain Italian restaurants. That is you can understand and taste the concept of the dish made long ago, but the shortcuts have eviscerated the essence. If you are lactose intolerant--sucks for you. The included wine, garlic bread and cappuccino while nice for some make it too expensive to buy a nice bottle of wine or other sides. Love the pics of the famous on the wall.
