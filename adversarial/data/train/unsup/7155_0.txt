Pretty disappointing, but maybe half a dozen straight guys reluctantly dragged there for the drag show is not their targrt market.\n\nLast time I was in Vegas - about 10 years ago - our group went to see a big Drag Show that was at the Rio, we had a great time. This time, I wanted the same experience and I thoigh this was the place we went to 10 years ago. It was not.\n\nWe got there an hour before the show began, there was no-one there, the bouncer got a bit stroppy with us, so we hung around for a little bit and then decided nope, not for us, we're off....if we had shown up later in the evening it might have had a different vibe and the end result might have been better. Ah well.
