I tried their cauliflower crust pizza, great flavor, although I later learned it's moderate and not low carb, which is still positive. The 2 stars are based on service. I showed up by myself, and it took a while for them to come and help. I wasn't dirty or dressed badly, but I was in my sports outfit. The lady who first came says: \"Can I ...help you?\" But like saying, \"who are you and what do you want?\" Like she was suspicious of me being there, I even have to ask: \"This is a restaurant, right?\" I had already had a bad day, she didn't help at all. Would I go back? Probably, but it's sad that they're super nice to some, and don't give a rat's rear end about others.
