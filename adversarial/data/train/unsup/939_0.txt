This review was started years ago, and all I wrote was \"I loooove\"\n\nIts my go-to brunch spot, every time I stay at the Wynn tower suites.  And thats where I've stayed the past 4-5 Vegas trips!  I loooove Wynn tower suites, coming out of the elevator to Tableu, getting seated right away, cute striped cushions, fine dining service without the stiffness.. just the entire experience.  \n\nThen.. delish food:). Everything I had was immaculate, and simply so yumm.  Don't forget to get fries, they serve it with homemade ketchup.  Its a bit more tomatoey, some tartness, and absolutely divine.  I love my waffles there, French toast, the pancakes, crab cakes, the potatoes, homemade jam.. I can go on & on.  And freshly \"squeezed\" Watermelon juice!  Trust, splurge on it!\n\nI usually sit indoors, but you'll find me outside when the weather is warm with a slight breeze.  Plus, its nice seeing the private pool area for those (me included!) with a tower suite key\n\nPs. I'm the 100th review for Tableu, yay!
