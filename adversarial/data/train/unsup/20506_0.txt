I've been here quite a few times before and I am definitely a fan... so much so that I am very tempted to give a perfect 5!!\n\nMy most recent visit about a week ago, I brought someone who has never been here before for a quick pick-up and go meal.  I told him it was Mexican AAAANNNDD Chinese AAANNNDD Burritos!! How can you go wrong?! They have 6 main burritos all priced at $6.99, and then sometimes 1 or 2 featured items such as Kung Pao chicken and.or general tao chicken.  Their regulars include; fish, rib eye, bean, vegan, chicken, and roast pork.  Each one is also filled with your choice of rice or chow mein and  your preference of spice and other toppings.  Unfortunately, there is only a seat along the window to eat, and barely any waiting space when it's busy.  \n\nDa Finest! Fish Burrito: $6.99 (4\/5 stars)\nI got it mild with chow mein, but it still had a little kick to it from the sauce. The delicate fish flavour was slightly overwhelmed by the array of other flavours exploding... but who cares?! It was good anyway!!\n\nRibeye Steak is Off Da Hook: $6.99(4\/5 stars)\nMedium spiced with chow mein... oh me oh myyyy!! A juicy bite into the savoury beef, followed by a kick of tartness from some crazy sauce, then the spice hits you, but it's all mellowed out by the sweetness of who-knows-what!  Yea, I'm lost for words to describe these burritos... can you tell?\n\nService: 5\/5\nThese guys are awesome!! Everything from scratch, plus you really taste AND hear the care they put into the food.  The open kitchen allows me to listen to the dude calling out orders and ensuring quality.  \n\nI will continue to come here!  I only wish they served some sides and had more seating!!  It will definitely make them a 5-star joint!!  Any of you burrito lovers out there reading this, you gotta check this place out!
