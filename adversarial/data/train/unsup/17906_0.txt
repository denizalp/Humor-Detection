I was driving down Melrose District when I saw that America's Taco Shop served breakfast. I needed something to eat, so I pulled over and went inside. They do not have a big vegetarian menu, so I just ordered a breakfast burro without meat and potatoes. It was decent, but this place is probably not my first choice for breakfast. They also should not advertise it as a Burro. A breakfast burro is pretty huge and the one that I got was the size of a breakfast burrito.
