I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. \n\nAt lunch. \nNo cover charge. \nNo two minimum drink.\n\nFREE ENTERTAINMENT\nIt wasn't just me either. Side splitting laughs from the service provided by our server, Rizzo were heard throughout the restaurant. I wish I had caught the other fellas names who were singing and putting on a show. (Listing to Bon Jovi, Bruce Springstein and whatnot takes on a whole new meaning when someone else is passionately belting it out.)\n\nI said singing, but, no. That does not quite describe the action that was going. I really wish I had a photo. Think Elvis. Arms swinging, legs shaking, THAT.\n\nI've photographed everything in the world, but not this. I've failed you.\n\nFOOD\nI wasn't sure what my stomach was in the mood for, so I ordered the soup | 1\/2 sandwich lunch special. Sweet deal for $8.95! \n\nThe Creamy Butternut Squash soup greeted my with the cutest sour cream detail. (see photo!) It was also incredibly rich. In private I'd probably lick the bowl. (Sorry Mom!)\n\nThe Grilled Caprese Sandwich surprised me a bit. (Mozzarella, pesto, roasted grape tomatoes.) Grilled cheese sandwiches are meant to be buttered. This one was definitely buttered!  \n\nSEATING\nThe bar area provides a nice view of the pizza hearth. There is additional high top seating in the bar area. In the back of the restaurant there are low top, four top tables that can be pushed together to accommodate groups.\n\nSIDE STORY\nWe heard Rizzo taking photos of another group.\n\"Will you take our picture?\"\n\"Sure!\"\n[Takes pictures using everyone's camera]\n\"Can I take a picture with MY camera?\"\n\nThere is a cute outdoor patio area as well. I asked Tracy J. to take photos of this area and some others for us. (These walking sticks will be the death of me!)\n\nGREAT SERVICE\nI joked about the show. But we were checked on constantly. Our drinks were never empty. Our plates were cleared as we nibbled away. I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch and appreciated the great customer service.\n\nLove it!
