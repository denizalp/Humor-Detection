Brought our dog here.  Doc seemed to know the problem with our dogs leg without having to take x-rays.  Our dog needs surgery.  It will cost a lot, and they do take Care Credit to help with paying for expenses such as this.  We were not approved for the financing, so unfortunately have to go somewhere that will take payments.  Otherwise, everyone was nice and they got us in right away.
