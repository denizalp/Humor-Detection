Came here on a Friday night for a date night. We had a fabulous time. The view and ambiance is so great. Their fish display is so great. It was a wonderful experience. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and provided great food recommendations. The wine list is so long but they provide recommendations as well that will fit your budget. The fish was amazing! It melted in our mouths. The calamari appetizer was delicious! We definitely enjoyed it and will come back!
