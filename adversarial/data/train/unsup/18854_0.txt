Man, can you believe Paris Hilton can walk into any Hilton in the entire world and stay in their best room like it's no big deal? It's what I think about every time I see a Hilton haha. Not only that, but they will likely let her bring in her 3K tiny cute little black pig pets she carries in her purse, but no one else can bring in piglets! I bet she also gets free and fast room service!\n\nThis hotel is .8 mile from the convention center, which means you can walk if you are going to a trade show (parking at the CC is waaay too expensive, so you walk). Though there are half a dozen hotels even closer to the CC, this one was the best option for us for overall value + full kitchen option! The room was decent sized at 600+ sq feet. Also the parking is free at this hotel, most strip hotels now charge parking, can you believe it!?!? Resort fee plus parking fee is way too much fee's. We had a view of the pool, next time may choose the golf course because it's also pretty. Sorry forgot to take pic of the view from the room.\n\nBut, next time I think the Hilton Grand Vaca on the blvd will be our choice. It's a 3.5 star while this is 3 stars and I can see how it's a little fancier. My other friends were staying there and while the room layout for the full kitchen 1 bedroom was the same, the furniture was more modern. Also, the pool was considerably nicer in shape with pretty landscaping. It's next to Circus Circus on the north strip, not a great hotel but they have water slides :) Also, they charge $12 parking before taxes, but otherwise the prices of the 2 Hiltons on the North strip were comparable. There is also Hilton Elara on the south strip, with full kitchen as well (there are like 4 Hiltons on the strip!). There is no resort fee at Elara, but they clearly included it in the total price lol. Half a dozen of one, 12 of the other!
