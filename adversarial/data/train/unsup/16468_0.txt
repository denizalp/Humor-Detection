Merci Beaucoup Patisserie Manon for the 15% Military discount! Next time you're driving down Charleston passed the Whole Foods you'll see a guy waving an arrow sign that says, \"French Bakery\" turn in and check it out and least for the Macaroons.  \n\nI had been dying to try this place out and finally got a chance to on a Sunday afternoon.  They get 5-stars for quality and taste of the pastries but I had to only give them four for lack of friendly service and lack of signage once inside the bakery-which is ironic since they hired a guy just to get you in!  Maybe by the time you read this review, they will have made a few improvements.\n\nYou walk in you'll see one counter with pastries and cookies and some tables but  I wasn't sure if someone seats you, or if you can just sit wherever? \n \nThen towards the back, there's another counter (savory treats are here...sandwiches, soups, etc.) with another cash register, but you can't see the counter as you walk in. You have to walk all the way to the back while asking yourself, \"can I go back here\"?  Where's the sign? Can I sit anywhere?  etc. so very confusing for the customer. People just cut in line too, so if you're trying to read the menu, they just get right in front of you so stand next to the counter so they can't get passed you, regulars have radar for rookies.\n\nThe array of pastries seemed limited but it was late in the day so I'm sure they had already sold many? Macaroons looked homemade-not like they were made at a factory and they were so delightful just a rainbow of colors. \n\nThe cakes in the fridge are absolutely gorgeous!! I've never seen a cake like it before, decorated with gorgeous macaroons and strawberries, my hubby was nice enough to buy me one of these cakes for my birthday and -OMG DELICIOUS & BEAUTIFUL!  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=w3LLAst_f8jGPYwqOrXnog&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ\n\nI picked up two macaroons and a Tiramasu and wow all fabulous.  Tiramasu was creamy, light, full of flavor and the macaroons were also full of flavor. The orange one tasted like a fruit loop.\n\nNow that I know the lay of the land I may be back to try other items, but I will be back for more pastries and my military discount too.
