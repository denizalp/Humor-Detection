This is my all time favorite place to get a sandwich. Best Italian sandwiches in town. I love the fact that it's a no frills small convenient store but don't let that fool you. It's quality food. I also love the Mac salad. The employees are always friendly here and most of the people walking in and out seem to be regulars since they talk to the employees like long time friends. Really enjoy this place. Try it. You'll be hooked too!
