Bought the Groupon and it was not worth it at all. They try to tell you what you can and can not do to your vehicle, and charge extra for it. Went for an oil change and both times ended up spending over 2 hours there. They argued with me about my vehicle and basically refused service if I didn't do what they say. 2 hours later they are tell me the other 15 things they want to scam me on. Please don't go here, plenty of other options next door and in the area.
