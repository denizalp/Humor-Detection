I would not come back here again. They say one thing and it's another. They give you the run around. They're more than happy to take your money but they have no idea what they're doing. Check your bill because they do know how to add charges on to it. If they didn't provide the service, they don't know how to remove it.\n------\nThank you Patient Care Team but it should have been taken care of the first 3 times it was brought to your attention.
