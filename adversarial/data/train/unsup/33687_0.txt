Novas is a cute little bakery in Plaza Midwood with other locations around the city as well. The environment and displays are rustic.\n\nWhat I've had:\n\nCoffee - Good quality, hot, but they charge for a 2nd refill (Amelie's does not). \nDanishes - pretty tasty, I've had a pastry cream filled one and it was good. \nApple Turnover- The filling was good, but I could tell the dough was made with shortening, instead of butter,which for me killed the flavor. \nCroissant- Good, but the flakiness is not up to par. \n\nSeating is limited, and I can't recall there being music.\n\nFree wifi, but it wasn't great last time I went. \n\nOverall, they have good products and friendly staff.
