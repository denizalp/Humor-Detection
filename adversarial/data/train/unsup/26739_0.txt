Came here with my family for brunch! We got unlimited mimosas for $22 a little pricy but well worth it, a majority of the menu is $20+ so be prepared to drop come cash ! Our waiter was pretty rude. . . Not the best service, we had to flag the waiter down a couple times to refill our mimosas. When we ordered the mimosa he was like \"show me some ID\" like a straight up cop, like relax homie we're just ordering mimosas ? I ordered the steak and eggs they were really good! We got seated and no one came to check on us for like 10 minuteS? I could see myself coming back with my family but the service really does need improvement and the food is good !
