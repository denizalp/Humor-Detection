We got seating at a booth for four people right when we got in. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and we got our water very quickly. I ordered the roast turkey platter, which came with turkey breast, cranberry applesauce, broccoli, mashed potatoes, a dinner roll and gravy. The meal was okay, the gravy was extremely over powering. But the friends I ate with really enjoyed their meals. One thing I did like about this place was that they had and entire vegan menu - - and their vegan brownie was really good! We'll come back here soon for either breakfast or late night dinner to check out the breakfast food!
