So they have a deal that first time customers get 50% their first Brazilian wax so I decided to get that done, the armpits, and a full leg done as well, so I made an appointment. When I went in the waxer Char said my hair was a little too short, but she did my armpits because the hair was long enough in those areas. This made me ineligible for the 50% of the brazilian wax which would have saved me more money. I spoke with the manager and rescheduled with the understanding that I would still get the 50% off discount. A week later I arrived for my appointment 10 minutes early, and waited.... and waited, and waited, 40 minutes later I simply had to leave, if we had started waxing then I would have been late for something else I had going that day. The receptionist had no explanation for me, and I ended up having to run home and shave as fast as I could. I would love to rate their Brazilian  services but I never was able to get it done. The armpit wax was sub par, I was waxed by Char and I left with hair still growing, hair that was waxed was growing back in 3 days. Rating the wax: Meh, totally not worth it. Rating the service: don't make appointments unless you pretty much have the whole day open I guess. But the staff is friendly.
