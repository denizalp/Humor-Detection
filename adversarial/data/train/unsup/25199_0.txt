When the restaurant had a soft opening way back in April (and only one item on their menu), I went to try it out. The noodles were very normal, the broth greasy, and there were only a few slices of meat and vegetables. I thought it was because they were just opening. In the past few months, I saw people lining up a long time at this restaurant so I thought it got better and decided to try it out again today. I ordered the same thing and it was literally the same as what I got in April: greasy broth, very little meat and veggies, and, even worse, hard noodles. At least they have three items (and side dishes) now! \n\nI don't understand what the hype is about. This restaurant is similar to other Lanzhou noodle houses in Toronto (Lan Zhou ramen on Dundas, Magic Noodle, etc) but more expensive. The staff were super friendly though so kudos for that.
