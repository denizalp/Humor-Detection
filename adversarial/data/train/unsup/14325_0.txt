Simply put...I've went to A TON of hair places in Madison...I was fickle for sure. Until I found Thorps. That was 3 years ago; I became an instant regular.\n\nI've had many of Thorp's stylists cut my hair, all with good results. However, Stephen and Gabriel are my go-to's....I've got short, very thick hair, and I always leave with a great cut. They help me find something fun, balancing edgy with professional (enough). I feel they always hear me out and create something that works for me. The diverse clientele of the shop from retirees, toddlers, hipsters, and everything in between speaks to the breadth of their stylist skills.\n\nBeyond great haircuts, there is always thoughtful conversation accompanying your time in the chair...this may sound simple, but there is something to be said about **not** having an awkward, surfacey conversation that you cannot escape for 45+ minutes (been there, done that at many other salons).\n\nOther perks...\n\n-Online appointments\n-Reasonable prices\n-Pac-Man in the shop\n-Complimentary drinks\n-Great atmosphere
