Broke a nail on the plane as usual and used yelp to find this shop. Walked in and it was empty. No one waiting and I told the last I needed a nail fixed (would have taken maybe  10 mins at most). Was them told they don't have anyone to helps. They are all booked for the night. It's 4pm. I find it hard to believe they were booked. Oh well on to the next
