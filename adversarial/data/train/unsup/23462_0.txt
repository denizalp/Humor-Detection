I Highly Do Not Recommend MoB Customs.\nI had my radio system replaced by them and it just went downhill from there. After purchasing my system, I noticed that it wasn't working properly so I was told to bring it back. \nOnce there, they stated they'll order a new radio.\nI followed up and my calls weren't returned, so I went back and they relocated. \nI continued to follow up and seemed I got the run around.\nThey kept stating that they will put an order in, after a few months has passed.\nThey also stated that they couldn't find the order form or the request form. \nI brought it in again and they stated it was the antenna after two hours so I left without any resolution. \nI went back again to check antenna, but it was the connection. I left and it was still the same so I went back. They decided to finally replace the radio which was promised in the beginning. Please Beware...You were warned. Hence the name MoB.
