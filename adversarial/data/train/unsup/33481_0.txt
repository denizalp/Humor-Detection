Great service and delicious noodles. They only have a few things on the menu, but all of them are delicious. Their chilli oil esp is the best chili oil I've ever tasted.  The broth is delicious, and the noodles have hood texture. They got a nice range of noodles too - from hair thin, to thick, to flat. Watch out for the sizes though. Their large is huge, and the extra large is bucket sized.  All that said, the servers were really sweet and the prices were pretty reasonable. I definitely recommend.
