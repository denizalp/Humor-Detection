Great furniture but absolutely horrid customer service. Bought a living room set there. Chatty sales person made several errors since she was talking and typing at the same time while she put in the the order. First wrong delivery address then attempted delivery way outside the delivery window. Every time I call I'm on hold forever with their contact center. Sometimes those calls end in a hang up and sometimes they flip to the store in Glendale which is no help. Called the Scottsdale store directly to speak to the manager who apparently doesn't return phone calls. Dont go here.
