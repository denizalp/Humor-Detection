Had my hair cut and made highlights for a reasonable price. The hairdresser, unfortunately I forgot her name but she had Russian origins, was very friendly and did an excellent job. This was on Friday night a couple of weeks ago when the thunderstorm hit Vegas. Because of the weather, there was a very annoying loud alarm at the mall, but despite that hairdresser continued cutting my hair perfectly well, which really impressed me. I was a bit stressed though, as we were leaving Vegas the same night, so I totally forgot to tip her (not customary to tip hairdresser where I come from) :(
