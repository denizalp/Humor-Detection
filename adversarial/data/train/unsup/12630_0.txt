Sooooo I have been hopping from hair salon to hair salon trying to find a hair wizard to handle my non-conformist have-a-mind-of-it's-own naturally curly hair. Color wise my hair is very very resistant to change. It's frequently gives me the proverbial middle finger. \n\nHaving such dark hair usually what happens is my hair soaks up the color and then just turns dark again instead of the color I want. \n\nI decided to give The hair standard a try. I saw some of Amy Mowat's colorings and really thought she could do the trick. \nFirst impression the salon was cool and trendy. I liked the old school Chicago vibe. Played great music and had very helpful staff.  \n\nAmy was awesome. Not only is she the cutest thing ever with great hair herself -but she discussed what I wanted and made it happen. She discussed colors and skin tones (which no one does) and we had good conversation to boot. \nAlso- we had to bleach some hair which everyone hates to do because it can leave your hair feeling dry and unhealthy however my hair felt just as healthy when I went in as when I went out. It had bounce and was super soft. I have had a ton of compliments on how my hair was colored because it looked natural yet had a pop of color. \n\nI definitely plan on going back to her as much as I can. I plan on trying a bunch of different colors and ideas until I find what I really want. Can't wait to keep playing around with my new hair!
