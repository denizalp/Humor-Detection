People don't put the weights back in the right places? In a public gym?? Say it ain't so! \n\nWhat's that? The staff wasn't available at 11 AM on a Sunday without an appointment? Isn't it intolerable when the entire business world doesn't cater to your every whim?\n\nReading these other reviews, I'm reminded that the world is populated by children masquerading as adults. This is a 24\/hr key-card access gym that has limited staffed hours of operation. Calling ahead to find out what those staffed hours are, or to set appointments for training or tanning, is how life outside of your mother's uterus works.\n\nI've been a member since they opened this location and have used the personal training services for 4 months or so (Nikki was great, supportive, and enthusiastic at 3x per week). \n\nClientele leaves you alone unless you engage, and even then I've seen nothing but polite focus on their own workouts. Likewise, the staff is friendly if you engage them, but will leave you to your own devices otherwise.
