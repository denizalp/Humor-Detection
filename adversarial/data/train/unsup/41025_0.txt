This is a great restaurant to grab a quick hot meal with family. Service was kind and attentive, you can tell it's a family place. Prices are very reasonable. It's kept clean.  \n\nThe salad bar was fresh. I had steak with rice and veggies, it tasted fine and it was hot and filled me up. \n\nI have to give this restaurant 3 stars because the food is not any better than I could make at home.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want to feed your family, but I would not recommend it for an exciting or super tasty meal.
