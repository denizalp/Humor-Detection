I did not experience the poor service or food poisoning or the inability to communicate in English that others have written about.\n\n\nThe food is indeed cheap, cheap for Yorkville and, yes, subpar\nThis is 'sushi' for people who feed their children a Big Mac and chicken nuggets as a 'treat' or book birthdays for the kids at Chuck E Cheese's and unleash themselves on their local Chinese buffet.\nSushi Inn has as much to do with Japanese food as Domino's Pizza has to do with Italy.\nRather, this is a place people go to have tasteless. something called, Sushi Pizza, an approximation of tempura and spicy roll this and spicy roll that... you know, all the fake stuff Chinese and Korean-Canadians deliver to people who don't know any better and don't care to...\n\nWith all that said, I was invited to meet friends here and had a miso soup, which was fine and a agetofu, which was blah... I did not taste anything else, but did not want to. People around me were happily placing orders for shrimp skewers and teriyaki this and that served by Chinese waiters who had picked it up from the Chinese cook who was also making spring rolls. \n\nThe prices are a definite bargain and especially so for the street and the tables are too close for comfort. They do have a good ratio of servers to tables however so the service is fast, they happily split the bill and they keep refilling the tea and water so no problems there either.\n\nWhatever this place's secret is the 'inn' has been around for years and judging by the jam packed Friday night will be here for many more years.
