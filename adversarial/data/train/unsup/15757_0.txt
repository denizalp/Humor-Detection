Sadly, I didn't get to try their bun rieu. We came late, close to when they were closing, so they ran out of noodles. Instead, we ordered their spring rolls. We were having a bad day so we were a little grumpy when we were told that they didn't have much to offer. They said they could sub pho noodles in the bun rieu but I knew it wouldn't be the same. They probably sensed our irritation and felt bad for not having much to offer, so they tried to comp our meal. That was a very kind gesture, but it wasn't their fault so we insisted to pay. Five stars for this genuine establishment that cares about their customers. Next time, I'll make sure to come early!
