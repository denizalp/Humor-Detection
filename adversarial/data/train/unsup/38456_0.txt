Like a few others I was selling my home and had some serious gremlins after a kitchen remodel (missing grounds, GFCI's not working) and Mike was outstanding to work with.  \n\nI thought he was going to have to tear into drywall to make the repairs, but he was able to work it all through, ahead of time and under budget.  Finished project is outstanding and everything works as it was designed.\n\nFinally when the original guys did the backsplash in the kitchen they didn't use extenders on the electrical boxes, so fit and finish was sloppy. That has also been resolved professionally.  \n\nOn a side note he drove all the way from N Phx into Gilbert to complete this job on a tough time frame.  I've found my electrician and so have you....
