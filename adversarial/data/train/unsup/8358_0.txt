Come here if you're not a fan of those Barbie mimosas. Here you are served a PINT of mimosas like a proper tavern. Pro Tip: get it with no ice = more mimosas. The OJ tasted fresh and not from concentrate, the champagne was a little more dry than I expected, but nonetheless delicious (who complains about a mimosa?!).\n\nOh the Bloodys. $6.50 with lime and lemon wedge, a pickle, and pickled Brussels sprout, onion bulb and a radish. You can choose a craft beer back, we decided on a PBR back that ended up almost as big as a pint.\n\nThey are busy busy busy, tables are first come first serve. Grab a mug and fill it with Joe or order some drinks from the bar while you stalk a table.\n\nEggs Benedict - Light Hollandaise sauce. Canadian bacon with perfectly poached eggs. The crusty, saltiness of the meat paired well with the quintessential eggs. Arrived with skillet, skin-on potatoes.\n\nMickey's Burger - one of the best burgers I've had around Madison. 1\/3 of punch-you-in-your-face meaty goodness with spicy giardiniera and onions strings. House made slaw and kettle chips on the side.
