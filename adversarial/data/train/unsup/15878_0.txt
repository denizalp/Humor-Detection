I expected a lot more from the cosmopolitan. I think I'm just being a brat because I didn't get an upgrade. I was told that because I'm a marriott gold member, I am eligible for an upgrade (yay!) ...for an extra 50 bucks...(HAYL NO.) we got there 11pm and had an early start so I was not going to pay 50 bucks more just to sleep in an upgraded room. And as a gold member I usually get free upgrades (turns up nose in disdain). So even though we had a standard room (shudders with disgust), I expect at least some basic cleanliness; especially for a hotel with a good reputation.  Instead there was someone's mascara stuck on the mirror, tape and leftover construction paper on top of the doorway (I assume it said something like Last Fling Before the Ring or some other celebratory message), the tile on the bathroom was cracked like the previous vacationers had a WWE match in there, but worst of all, the shower flooded, and oddly enough, the carpet right outside the door got wet even though the tile by the entrance of the bathroom stayed dry. It was a curious thing.\n\nThe gym is like a Las Vegas club--dark, crowded, and there's always that one person who got the body odor. I didn't have to wait for a treadmill, though, so I'm not upset. If you bring in someone who is staying in your room, but who is not on your account, you must add them to your account, or you will get charged an extra 20 bucks in addition to the 28 dollar resort charge you've already paid.\n\nNext time in picking a newer hotel to stay in. The people who used this room before us over the years partied HORD. For once, I want to be the one to devirginize a hotel room.
