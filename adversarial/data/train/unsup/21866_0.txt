Congratulations to this crew that decipher the mind of the \"want to be healthy\" people working around. \n\nOne day passing by the street I saw a beautiful girl through the window making me arm signs all happy, when I focused thinking what tha, I saw my Mexican partner in crime!!! It was like those moments money can't buy (for everything else pay in cash, don't put yourself on debt). I went inside, we hugged each other girly-happily style (it's awesome to finally run into someone I know) and proceed to gossip (which means I know names with real faces).\n\nApparently, the lentil soup is the best option when you need a quick fix before the gym. It's really earthy, warm, comforting.  \n\nThey have a good variety of salad combinations. All the ingredients seemed fresh. I salivated while looking how they fixed my salad.\n\nThe small salad size is plenty, it was cheerful for my stomach to watch that they do not measure the amounts of ingredients (no son cuenta chiles!).  \n\nWatching the line up, the speed, accuracy, smile&vibe of the crew, made me realize that they are succeeding. Maybe giving good portions might be their way to say thanks to their costumers (their small salad fed me 2 times this day). \n\nMy pick so far has been the pear and spinach with feta cheese. They put corn, some tomato, cucumber and feta cheese. I find it filling, refreshing, crunchy and exotic.\n\nI want to taste more of their creations.
