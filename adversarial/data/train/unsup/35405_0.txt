Towards the end of our meal, the fire alarm went off. The alarm is super loud it made my head hurt. I can tell by the other guests' faces that they are also expecting the staff to do something to stop the alarm. However after 10 minutes, they don't know the code to stop the alarm. I don't think they know the procedure. I don't think I'll come back to this location when an emergency like this happens and no one seems responsible enough to handle it.
