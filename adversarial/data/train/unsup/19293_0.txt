Same as other reviewer.  I scheduled my FIRST appoint over two months ago.  So after I take a day off of work to meet for an estimate (yes, a day off of work, so one would think I was very serious about this..) the guy never showed up.  I phoned and was told that my file was apparently lost, amongst laughter and a no big deal attitude from the business.  So we schedule a second that takes over a week to occur.  That goes ok, and the guy tells me that I'll be contacted with final estimate.  I let a month go by and phone yet again.  Guess what, yep, file lost, again!  So the agent speaks to that and says that he'd really like another chance and would like to phone back to re-schedule.  I give in since I've gone this far and understand mistakes and think that now maybe they'll give extra effort, well, that was now over two weeks ago.  I don't know how these people are in business, or if they even are a legitimate business.  I'm going to look elsewhere now for sure.
