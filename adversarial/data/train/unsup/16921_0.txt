The first thing that greats you when you are about to walk in the front door is a sign welcoming smokers. After walking out I smelled like I had been smoking for years. My coat, cloths, and hair smelled of cigarettes.\nI was originally drawn here because they have $.20 wings on Wednesday nights. The wings were good but on the small side. Bottom line, it's just too smokey for me, and I probably wont return.
