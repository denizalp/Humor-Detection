From 5:21pm Sign In. 5:30 pm is appointment. I was out at 7:42pm. BS! Facility closes 7pm \n\nI wrote a bad review here about my experience coming to this facility.\nAfter my post, someone called me from the facility and asked me to take down my bad review post. \n\n\nIf you do not like bad reviews , please acknowledge every patient in the building whether it is your patient or not! Even if you share a space. Acknowledge EVERY patient\/client that comes in to the door and waiting. \nThe receptionist sitting in the front desk messed up big time! \n\nI am not the only person who hates to wait for long hours. Its like you guys don't even care if other people have other appointments or business to attend to. All of the patients in there that day, Were all pissed off! They may not say it to you, but I have been observing them and they hate waiting for that long. \n\nIf I have a great experience here. I would give you 5 stars. But I didn't. \n\nHire more receptionist to make the appointments go faster and Better. Receptionist who said to sign my name. Must ask if patient have already filled out paperwork prior to seeing the doctor. \n\nTo make a facility be better, Help each other. Don't ignore patients. \n\nOh and one more thing. I am not the only person here who posted a bad review there are several other people who had bad reviews. I wonder if you called them too. \n\nYes I was upset I waited too long but it made me furious for someone to have the nerve to call me and say to take down my post. No one has ever done that. If you would like to say something. Send me a message, Do Not Ever Call Me Again because of a post!
