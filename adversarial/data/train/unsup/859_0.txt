Great burgers at great prices! It's hard to find good food that doesn't break the bank, but this is the real deal. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because I had to wait about 20 minutes for my burger--but it was worth the wait! I had the small one with onion rings and a chocolate shake and ate every last bit. I would highly recommend this burger joint because of the yummy food and fun atmosphere. I am already planning on returning and bringing more friends!
