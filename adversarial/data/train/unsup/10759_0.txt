My experience at this store is horrible. Customer service is terrible. I purchased a $1000 TV. When you pay at the register they tell you to ask the warehouse workers to show you the item is the correct and functioning item you purchased. I asked them to take it out the box twice and they refused. Said item was working fine. After taking it home and waiting for the the cable company to set it up when the TV came on the screen was broken. I called the store and they refused to honor the warranty and replace the TV. This store is cero stars if that option was available.
