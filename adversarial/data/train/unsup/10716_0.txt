This show has ended as of April 30, 2016. Aria has decided to turn the venue space into a convention center instead.\n\nWe were lucky enough to catch the show before it ended. They allow photos, unlike some other Cirque shows - just no flash.\n\nI've read many reviews on how people complain that there's no story to follow, or obvious plot. If you want a story and plot, go read a book. This is the Cirque du Soleil, you come here to be wowed and dazzled in amazing, high-wire acrobatic feats and visually stunning costumes and special effects.\n\nIt was truly something amazing. We've seen Love, Zumanity, and Ka, and while you can't compare each Cirque show (they are all so unique!), Zarkana was one of my favorites. There's so much detail in the show that you could probably watch it multiple times and catch a glimpse of something new.
