...I'm generally a Walmart supporter, but this location was a test of my peopleofwalmart.com identification skills.  Terrible layout, small and cramped, and far too few lanes open to accommodate 1\/2 of the people in attendance.  Convenient to one of my two offices it will suffice, but future stops will be few and far between.
