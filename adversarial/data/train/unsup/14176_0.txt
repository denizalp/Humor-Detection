Wow...this has to be one of my worst dining experiences. \n\nService was awful. The waiter barely checked on us. As someone who works at a very busy restaurant, I understand how stressful things can be on a server. But to not check on us until we have been finished for over 20mins is unacceptable. \nUpon being seated, we had another server, who made a weird face upon greeting us...probably because we had a faint smell of herb. I'm guessing he didn't want to serve African Americans that smelled of herb (he most likely made some general stereotypes about us). So instead of following through with us, he decided we were a waste of his time. So he sent another server to assist us instead. \n\nThis other amateur server immediately came out of character after taking our order. He wasn't professional as he was with all of his other Caucasian tables. He even said \"fuck\" a few times while conversing with us. Also very unacceptable. \n\nChicken Tikka wasn't authentic at all. When I asked for a side of the Tikka masala sauce it was bland and not spicy at all (level 5). \n\nBy the looks of it this is NOT an authentic Indian place. I saw no Indian staff members. This is place probably where white people go to enjoy Indian food in the comfort of their own kind. \n\nSave yourself a trip and don't go!!
