Always on the hunt for new varieties and styles of craft beer, we headed over to the Toringdon Circle Shopping Center in Ballantyne to visit with Matt Cohen about Growler USA and to get the scoop on one of the Queen City's newest hot spots. \n\nWith over 100 craft beers available at any given time, the taproom \/ restaurant opened in January and has already secured its place as a must visit attraction for craft beer adventurers and novices alike.\n\nA steady flow of kegs from the Carolina's and beyond keeps their state of the art fridge packed; their draft beer chilled at 37Â°; and the taps constantly flowing.\n\nIn fact, so much beer is flowing through their lines, the digital menu board is frequently updating.  Fortunately each keg change immediately updates on the TapHunter App, so their menu is always up-to-the-second and just a notification away.\n\nWith so many new craft breweries opening  throughout the U.S., Matt, who is also the Managing partner of the Ballantyne location, says the menu and varieties their Cicerone trained servers are introducing to Charlotte is encyclopedic.  They are arguably pouring some of the most unique brews from sea to shining sea.\n\nIf you're new to the craft beer phenomenon, don't fret. The Growler USA menu may seem overwhelming, but beer is about individual taste preferences. Their offerings are there to ensure that they have something for everyone. \n\nP.S. Don't forget to download the TapHunter, soon to be followed by Untapped, for the latest and greatest Growler USA in Ballantyne has on tap.
