Maybe we came on an off day but this was really nothing special. Margherita pizza was just shredded cheese pizza with little flavour, and the salad was just ok - nice toppings but iceburg lettuce made it a bit bland. Everything was meh. I had high hopes... the prices were way too high for what we got.
