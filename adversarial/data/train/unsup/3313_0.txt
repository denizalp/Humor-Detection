Okay big deal.. who cares if this place was featured on Food Network?! \n\nI was super excited to try this place especially because this place is known for their oxtail pho. Honestly, their oxtail pho is okay, just okay. I've had better. I enjoyed the shrimp fried rice more than I did the pho. Like other yelpers, I also agree that prices are a little high. \n\nThe owner served us. She's really funny but aggressive at the same time. She kept bragging that their pho was the best in town & prices are high because they cook good food. Honestly, it was a little overwhelming, like please let us be the judge of that...
