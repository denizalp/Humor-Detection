Steve gave me confidence and peace of mind during an incredibly hectic time in my life. He came highly recommended by another attorney and it was the best decision I could have made. Steve did such a wonderful job handling the case that he was the first person I thought of again 4 years later to handle an additional case. He made sure that I understood every little detail that was going on and always made me feel well prepared. I couldn't have made it through that stressful time in my life without his experience and reassurance.
