Just when I thought I knew what the highest possible level of customer service was, Chenin Orthodontics blew it away. Everyone that works here seems incredibly happy. The Chenin brothers themselves are both upbeat and loaded with a great deal of positive energy. \n\nThey have amenities like free coffee, water, wifi, games in the waiting room for the children to play, and a fun \"Chenin change program\". \n\nI've been there for several appointments (for myself and my son) and every time the wait time was minimal with everything running like clock work.
