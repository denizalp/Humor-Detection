What did I say? NO nightclubs for me! My friend told me it was OK, no lines for me, this wristband got me by pass all the lines and free champagne, I was like OK.... I was relaxing at my table at Ainsworth lounge, why would I go to a super loud and crowded nightclub? Just to check out the recently reopened Body English, this after hour hot spot till 7 in the morning? Excuse me, we would be at a strip club after 5 in the morning... Oh well.... Whatever, I was buzzed already... \n\nThis place was actually pretty relaxing and chill, club goers were very friendly and fun, many people greeted us the minute we went in, maybe because people were drunk \nalready, and we were skinny cute Asian and Russian girls? Anyways, we got a few free drinks from the bar and some other people there. Nice vibe, music and crowd, very friendly staffs too. We walked around a bit, a few drunk cute European white men chased after us a bit, we had to run to get away from them.... The main reason why I DO NOT like nightclubs! \n\nOk, we have had checked out the entire club, had a few drinks, and encountered quite a few drunk people, not just guys, some old white ladies were trying to hit on us.... Oh... Seriously.... ????...... WTH.... Enough is enough!\n\nIt was an interesting experience, if it wasn't too loud or too many drunk \" too friendly\" people, I might want to ask hubby to get a bottle there instead of Ainsworth lounge next time.... We will see...:)
