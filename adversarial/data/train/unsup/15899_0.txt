Not great service (Slow) or food (pricey), but not as bad as some places in North Scottsdale.\n\nThe wings came out an odd yellowish color, but they tasted OK. The wife had the Nachos, which she enjoyed, but the Salsa they had was much better, I thought.\n\nPlenty of TV's in the place (should be considering it used to be a Buffalo Wild Wings) but the server's seemed inexperienced and not really interested in going the little extra that sets mediocre service apart from above average...so to sum it up,  if you're not in a hurry (and we were to catch a movie) and like overpriced food, stop here. You definitely won't be disappointed.
