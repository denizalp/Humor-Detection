chef ramsay is one of my fave chefs EVER but i am pretty disappointed with the burgers here. it hurts that i have to give this place 3 stars because i respect chef ramsay as a chef and i watch all of his tv shows. i couldn't believe how DRY the burgers came out for my boyfriend and i. it was crazy because we both ordered medium rare and the patty was a bit hard. i ordererd the farm house burger and the egg complimented the burger very well i just wish the patty as well as the buns weren't so hard to bite into. my boyfriend got the hell's kitchen burger and it was pretty good but we weren't too happy with the texture of the burger. i want to go back just to give it another try but each burger came out to be $15 each.\n\nour fave on the menu was the TRUFFLE FRIES! the aioli sauce was to die for! it was SOOO good! it went very well with the fries. usually i love ketchup but i did't touch the ketchup at all! the restaurant was decorated with a fun fire theme. they have the nicest staff and they also send you a text when your table is ready! the menus are cool looking and very inviting. \n\noverall just pretty sad about the dry burgers. hopefully it won't be so dry for other customers.
