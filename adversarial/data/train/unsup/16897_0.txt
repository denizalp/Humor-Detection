Dynamex handled our delivery order from IKEA. Our window for delivery was from 9 A.M to 1 P.M. and they arrived around 9:30. They called us ahead of time to let us know when they were getting close to the house. \n\nThe delivery person in charge was a bit rough with our boxes, dumping them on the floor with reverberating thuds rather than lowering them onto the floor. The other delivery person was a lot more gentle and treated our items with more care.\n\nThey were in and out in no time even though we had quite a few boxes to deliver. Overall an OK experience, especially since our delivery fee was $59, not bad! \n\n3.5\/5
