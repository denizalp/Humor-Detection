Maybe I'm just spoiled or accustom to a certain level of medical care from having an amazing family doctor growing up.\n\nI feel like the doctors here just want to get you in and get you out and not really spend any time actually listening to what's wrong or diagnosing your symptoms.\n\nI'm sure they are busy and probably overworked, but this is your job. If I wanted a five second diagnosis and a doctors note with prescriptions that I'm not even sure if I should be taking based in the fact that you haven't listened to any of my symptoms, I would go to a Walgreens clinic.\n\nEveryone I felt with from the receptionist to the actual Dr was very nice and they did make me feel very comfortable. The waiting room was very spacious and clean.\n\nI just really think I need to look into a primary care dr so I don't have to come here again.
