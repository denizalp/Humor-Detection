So first of all, I want to say that I really (want to) love this shop, despite a couple of flaws (in staffing).The selection of body jewelry is amazing, prices are good, they run sales, I got 15% off the other day on my whole purchase. The wait can be long at peak times, I think they should try to staff 2 people up front, because it can become very disorganized quickly. The piercer, I think her name is Diana, is so great! She is super knowledgeable and nice. They have the best nose rings and stretched ear jewelry, really cool stuff. \nBuuuuuuuuuut.....the guy that works up front it THE WORST. Every time I have been in there, he has been so so so rude, completely unhelpful. He acts like he doesn't have time to deal with customers or answer their questions, which by the way, he can never answer my questions correctly, sometimes he just won't. He sold me some jewelry the other day that he measured (haphazardly and wrongly) with this metal thingy for sizing stretched lobe jewelry, my soft plugs\/tunnels now don't fit because he measured the outer DIA of the flare. $10 wasted. I needed 4g and he sold me 6g. It was so hectic in there, I felt rushed and pushed out the door.\nI really like this shop, its the only place I ever want to go for my body jewelry. But this male staff member makes me not want to shop there, sometimes I decide not to make the drive up there because I wonder if he will be working and I will have to deal with him.\nNow I am stuck with plugs I cant use after driving an hour to get there, and he was ugly to me the whole time I was there.\nSADU needs to have him trained on how to measure plugs properly and he needs to be told how to give good customer service and not be so rude and such a grouch, or replace him with someone who can.\nThat being said, ALL of the women who work there ROCK and are great every time I have shopped with them behind the counter\/been fitted with a new nose ring, etc.
