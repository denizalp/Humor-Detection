Went Saturday night.  Ordered three Starters.  Maytag blue cheese Potato Chips, Coconut Curry Mussels, and Crispy Seafood.\n\n1. The Chips.  Don't know what kind of blue cheese was on them, but it sure wasn't Maytag.  Other than that, they were ok.\n\n2. Coconut Curry Mussels.  First bowl came out, second mussel in is broken.  Proceeded to pull out 10 broken mussels in a row.  Sent back.  New bowl comes out, first, second, third mussels broken.  Needless to say, sent back.  (If it was my restaurant, I'd fire whoever sent those mussels out.  You  NEVER serve broken mussels!  They should have never even made it into the cooking pot!!)\n\n3. Crispy Seafood.  SUPER!
