Only go on Friday nites, for their \"seafood\" buffet. Overall is pretty good. Salad's are fresh, w\/ the standard selection of stuff. Lots of  peelable shrimp\/oysters and cold crab!! Highlight is the steamed crab. You can eat as much as you want. By the looks of platters from other diners you'd think their was no crab left in the ocean. In addition to the \"seafood\", asian, mexican offerings are available, along with either prime rib, ham, turkey  and the usual accompaniments. Food is fresh and well seasoned. Deserts are pretty standard, all pretty much pre made and sliced up. Bread pudding is pretty good. Staff is very attenative. They keep your glasses refilled and clear your table on a regular basis. They are one of the cheaper \"seafood\" buffets in town and certainly a better deal than some local chain restaurants. If you find yourself filled to the brim, a nice walk down fremont st will help. Enjoy..................
