Most romantic restaurant in TO my A$$! From the photos you get an impression that it will be a beautiful and warm Parisian restaurant, walking in it is ANYTHING but! \nIt was cold and not welcoming at all, particularly from the Serve staff. The music was all Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z, which I don't mind but it didn't quite fit the place. \n\nOur waiter was a thin straight haired brunette, she nice but extremely inattentive and unprofessional (you would find more professionalism at The Fox and The Fiddle or Kelsey's). She greeted us as if it we were someone she was passing in the street. She had no warmth or caring in anything she did. From greeting to clearing and wiping off a table. \n\nThen there was the food. To say it was mediocre at best would be an understatement; it is truly terrible, even at its low cost. \n\nWe ordered a \"Scroll\" which came out looking like soggy mushy naan bread mess. The flavour, I kid you not, was the way a dirty wet cloths smells after a few days of use and its never quite dried. We also ordered 2 pastas which were OK in comparison and a muscle bowl. When we ordered the Mussels bowl there is 2 options of sizes Small and Large. We asked the difference and the response was 20-30 and 30-40. We got the large there was 18 pieces.\n\nBottom line if you are looking for a romantic spot grab a 7\/11 burrito a box of wine and head to the lake front or nearest park for a picnic as it will be 100x more romantic and worth while.\n\nThis place gives restaurants a bad name!
