Gorgeous location - the gardens, grounds & house are simply devine!\n\nWe went for a tea & crumpets event - saw so many mothers with their little girls all dressed up for a tea time, it was fabulous!!\n\nThe food was heavenly and the options of tea were exquisite! \n\nBest tip about this place: drive around the neighborhood, the houses surrounding this mansion are amazing!! and there is valet here!!
