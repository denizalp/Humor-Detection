Took my brother & son for a nice dinner on their patio & Joe's did not disappoint. We walked on & were promptly greeted & seated. The service was great, the food was perfect. I will say if you order the B.I.G. burger, go for regular fries as the ones with gravy etc., are overkill for that dish. Try the black rice appetizer, absolutely delicious. It's unfortunate that the only drawback are patrons who feel entitled to act foolish & make their misery part of the outside world, but no one can control that other than the ones who act out their childish needs. . Otherwise, a wonderful experience.
