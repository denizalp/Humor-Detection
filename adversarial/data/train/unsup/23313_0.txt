Thrifty.\nI love thrift stores and I had no idea that this was even here. Now I am not going to sit here and lie to you. I had to do some community service here this past weekend. The thrift store is so cute.\n\nThe warehouse manager (Tony) is so freaking nice. The to cashiers Candace and Des are super friendly as well, It was like I was already an employee there. \n\nThe merchandise is actually OK.  I found alot of good stuff plus the prices are super cheap. REALLY CHEAP\n\nI really want to keep coming on Saturdays they get so busy plus I could help the Hispanics trying to communicate but don't know how to speak English.\n\nThis is a great way to help out. Plus it is super fun.\n\np.s.\nOn any debit\/credit card purchase it is a minimum of $10.00
