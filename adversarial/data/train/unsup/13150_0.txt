We had a long wait for a table at Matt's Big Breakfast recently, but the food and service were worth it.  I had the Skinny, which is made with four egg whites and chicken apple sausage and comes with a small side salad.  My guy had the Chop & Chick, which is made with eggs and pork chops.\n\nThe food was really tasty, and the price was very reasonable.\n\nWe shall return!
