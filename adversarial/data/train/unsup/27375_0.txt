Wow - arcane bolts and nuts, pulleys, and piano hinges that would make a lowes cringe - yeah we got those.\n\nMan store is correct, this place has whatever you can think over crammed in ceiling to floor aisle after aisle.  \n\nLittle bit confusing on pricing - not marked on a lot of items.\n\nWhile quite a distance drive for me, I make it a point to swing by here often (plus the breakfast\/lunch restaurant next door is good).
