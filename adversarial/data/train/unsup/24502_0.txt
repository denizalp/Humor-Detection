I had heard good things about StorageWorks, so I decided to head over and give them a shot.\n\nThey do carry a helluvah lot of storage gear - Everything you'd need to organize your closet, your kitchen, your office, or basically any room in your house. I especially love their option to custom design closets for you - that's a nice touch.\n\nI do have to say though, their pricing is noticeably high. I didn't end up leaving with anything because I knew I could find the same things elsewhere for half, if not one third of the price!\n\nA good store to find out exactly what you  need to get your space liveable again, but I'd suggest going elsewhere to purchase the actual goods.
