Most people come to Vegas to gamble, to party and to sin.\n\nTruth be told, I don't gamble and I can party much harder and sin far worse in my hometown of Los Angeles than I can in Vegas.\n\nMy sin in Vegas is gluttony. Add to that worshipping at the temple of Michelin, whose bright stars cast a long shadow over Vegas, and idolizing the three French gods of cuisine who have set up outposts here (Robuchon, Savoy and Gagnaire), I'd say I have my fair share of penance to pay.\n\nSo it's surprising, then, that the best meal of my recent trip was neither Michelin starred nor devised in France.\n\nIt was at Sage, Shawn McClain's contemporary American ode to the farm-to-table\/artisanal\/sustainable\/seasonal ethos.\n\nNow, let me be clear, those terms hold no particular draw for me. I'm just as happy for my produce to be exotic, my fish to be endangered, and my truffles to be out of season. And this is Vegas, a neon outpost in the desert, a place where money trumps ideology and possibly the least sustainable city in America.\n\nNo, what brought me to Sage was that, after the buzz had quietened and the dust had settled on the new CityCenter's more talked about restaurants -- Gagnaire's first US outpost Twist and Bar Masa\/Shaboo's $500 hot pot -- Sage emerged as the most interesting new restaurant in Vegas.\n\nNot that Shawn McClain doesn't come with accolades. Esquire magazine's \"Chef of the Year\", James Beard winner for \"Best Chef Midwest\" but it's safe to say he's not a household name outside of Chicago.\n\nYet.\n\nThe restaurant space itself is everything you'd expect in Vegas from the newest Dubai-funded casino on the Strip. Opulent, expansive, classy and swathed in plum and gold. This is not a restaurant you wander into from the casino floor.\n\nThis is a destination.\n\nAnd the service there was impeccable. Probably the best I've received in ANY restaurant. Ever. Friendly without being intrusive, knowledgeable without being pretentious, and generous.\n\nVancouver Island Kusshi Oysters | Piquillo Pepper and Tobasco Sorbet \/ Aged-Tequila Mignonette\nI love kusshis by themselves but the piquillo pepper and tobasco sorbet was stunning. A perfect cold and hot complement to the briny oyster. With a nod to Mexico, the mignonette sauce was made with aged tequila rather than vinegar.\n\nHeirloom Beet Salad | Duck Prosciutto \/ Point Reyes Blue Cheese \/ Roasted Walnuts \/ Celery Vinaigrette\nOne of my favorite dishes of the night. Simple in its preparation, the beets were soft and flavorful, the vinaigrette perfectly balanced, the blue cheese creamy, and all sitting atop slivers of duck prosciutto.\n\nFoie Gras Custard Brulée | Bing Cherries \/ Toasted Cocoa Nibs \/ Salted Brioche\nOne of the best mouthfuls of food I've enjoyed in '10. I love foie gras, I love creme brulée, and I can honestly think of nothing better than combining the two. Except perhaps shaving a torchon of foie gras onto it and serving it with a sweet and salty salted brioche. Absolutely craveable and made all the better by the complementary glasses of sauternes paired with it.\n\nCrescenza Cheese Mezzaluna | Grilled Mushrooms \/ Braised Black Kale \/ Parsley Emulsion\nOf the two pasta dishes we tried, this was the stronger although nothing extraordinary. Still, the pasta was pillowy and well made, the mushrooms adding a nice, meaty texture to the dish.\n\nRoasted Sweetbreads | Glazed Bacon \/ Creamy White Polenta \/ Marinated Chanterelles\nI'm a big fan of sweetbreads. The breading on the sweetbreads here was less crispy than I would have liked although the polenta it sat on was very good, having soaked up all the juices of the sweetbreads and bacon. Bacon is one of those things I'm really getting over although, thick cut like this and glazed, it was a welcome addition to the dish.\n\nMaine Lobster Ravioli | Lemon-Olive Oil Puree \/ Baby Spring Peas \/ Mascarpone \/ Fresh Mint\nThis dish was a disappointment. The sauce overpowered the taste of the delicate lobster to the point that I wouldn't have known I was eating lobster if I hadn't read it on the menu. Overall, oversalted and rather leaden.\n\nSmores\nRemarkably beautiful and satisfying at the same time. Did it remind me of childhood s'mores? I don't know. I didn't grow up here. But the bruléed marshmallow was suitably sweet and sticky and the gingerbread crisp a great savory counterpoint.\n\nTo finish the meal, the kitchen sent out cups of hot chocolate infused with citrus. A fun and whimsical way to end the meal and the citrus finish was a nice touch to the chocolate.\n\nSo there you have it. Yes, there were a couple of missed steps but whether it was the gorgeous space, the opulent and classy ambiance, the wonderful service or the company of great friends, this meal transcended its faults and was definitely greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nPossibly the meal of the year so far and definitely the dish of the year for the foie gras custard brulée.\n\nFor me, Sage is the best bet at CityCenter.\n\nAnd, as I said, I don't like to gamble.
