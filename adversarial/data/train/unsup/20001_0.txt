When the best thing you can say about a restaurant is that the people watching outside the window is good you know there is a problem. \n\nI had the vegetarian burrito, which according to the menu should have included both guacamole and sour cream, although I would have challenged any forensic investigator to find either. When I asked for more I was told I could buy a side - and asking me to buy something that should have been included and was not? I did manage to find a small sprinkling of cheese in the burrito, but it took careful investigation to do that.\n\nBack to the burrito. There was certainly rice in the and also lots of iceburg lettuce, and both in such quantities there was little room for anything else. I had asked for spicy, which appeared to mean that they let the burrito look at a garlic clove from a distance. Certainly no chili peppers had been harmed in the making of this burrito and no other spices either. Bland bland bland bland.\n\nSo, if you hate flavour, abhore spice and generally think things with taste or protein are bad, come on it. The pedestrian traffic out the window may help distract you from the sad lack-luster imposter of a burrito, but there is little else to recommend this place.
