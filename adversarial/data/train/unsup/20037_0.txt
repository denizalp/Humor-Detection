The sweet, creamy goo is the perfect compliment to any warm muffin, but smear it on a fresh pot of Jamm's bread and OMG! It's like a party in your mouth. This fresh little pot of bread is like nothing I've experienced anywhere other than Jamm's. The cream cheese icing is the best. The goodness doesn't stop with the bread and icing, though. We were greeted with a plate of fresh fruit while we browsed the menu and sipped our fresh coffee. This time I opted for the signature omlette and it was awesome. Sliced steak and b√©arnaise sauce with crispy hash browns and another little loaf of heaven. The service was great, as always. We had a couple of first timers with us and they were both impressed with the service and quality. One of them ordered a bowl of grits, which looked like a meal unto itself. Pretty thick and tasty as well. Ask for a cup of coffee to go and continue to enjoy Jamm's on the way home or back to the office.
