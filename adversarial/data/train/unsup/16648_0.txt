Do NOT....I repeat Do NOT allow the car wash attendant to \"help\" you with using the machine to pay even if they become aggressive. Just push their hand out of the way  and do it yourself. If we can drive a car we can certainly use a payment machine without problem. \n\nThey will overcharge you. They ALWAYS select a pricier car wash than what you tell them. The price does not show up in the screen but it will on your receipt after you pay it. Then you have to go in the store to get your refund and it's just a waste of time.\n\nOh and they only do this to women. My husband never had this problem. Sexist, huh?\n\nAt least I got a few car washes for free out of this. The annoyance of it all doesn't really make the free car washes worth it. \n\nSo either don't go here or use the machine yourself. Be as rude as you have to. It'll save your from having to deal with the frustration of getting out of your car and going inside.
