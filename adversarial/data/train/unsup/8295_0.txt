The excitement that a BBQ restaurant was going to open in the Phoenix Roosevelt Art District was exciting. \n\n\n\nOutside curb appeal, this restaurant is warm and inviting. When you get in the door it has very little space to place your orders. The menu looks great.  They need to do something with the dining area. It's too small. Possibly advertise that this is a \"food to go\" restaurant  with limited or no seating. While we were waiting in line and lunch time on Sunday afternoon, customers were turned away because of no seating in the dining area or patio. It took a long time to order food. \n\nThe BBQ was bad. I'm from Kansas City. I grew up eating award wining BBQ. My fist job was at a BBQ restaurant. The ribs were over cooked and fatty. The brisket was chopped and had to much fat. The pulled pork was not eatable. Once again to much fat.  The baked bens were disappointing. They tasted like can baked beans. The Mac and Cheese tasted like box Mac and Cheese. \n\nMaybe this was just a bad day and time that we came to this restaurant. I will be back in a few weeks for another try. I love ribs and brisket. \n\nI hope the owner is onsite and can evaluate his restaurant. I want it to be a success. I love Roosevelt Art District. We need more private business owners.
