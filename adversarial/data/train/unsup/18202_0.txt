Was very disappointed in Vibo.  It looks really nice from the outside and it's trying to be a fancy wine bar, but really is quite an average place.  Very pricey food and very slow service.  We were there on a Tuesday evening when it was very quiet and it took 45 minutes for our entrees (we didn't order appetizers).  The steak was great but the prawn and scallop dish was average and definitely didn't justify the price.  The wine list was very mediocre.  We wouldn't go there again but if money isn't a problem, then it's a nice enough place (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).
