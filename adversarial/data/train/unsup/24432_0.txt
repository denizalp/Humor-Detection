As things stand today, Scottsdale Beer Company has potential but has not realized it.  Yet.  Since it is a new establishment it is still evolving.  For example, some of the beers they intend to offer aren't ready yet, and our waitress was rough around the edges although pleasant.\n\nI only sampled one of their beers, an amber lager.  It was better than bottled, but not \"gee whiz, I have to come back here and order it by the gallon\".
