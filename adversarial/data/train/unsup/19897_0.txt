I've always admired Olympic Stadium and came here often back in the days of the Expos.  I enjoyed the architecture and liked taking the funicular up to the top of the tower.\n\nA few years ago I was here and went to the bio dome, which was cool.\n\nBut Olympic Stadium itself is very down at the heels.  When visiting recently for a Pirates-Blue Jays game, you could see how there were a lot of repairs that were needed and pieces of the stadium were being held together with wood and nails.   The outside is a bit removed from it's former majestic stance.\n\nInside, it's also helplessly outdated compared to newer stadiums.  It stunk that the concessions on the upper level could only take cash, which led to long lines at the ATM.  Also, the limited options (hot dogs, chips, sad poutine and even sadder pizza) were not appetizing.   Also, why could you only get Bud or Bud Light ?  Am I in Canada or St. Louis?\n\nThe sound system is bad, the lighting is not great and the scoreboards are seriously outdated, so this could place could never hope to house a major league team in any sport.  But I still have a soft spot for it.\n\nAlthough I like it, it would probably be for the best if they tore it down and built something new.
