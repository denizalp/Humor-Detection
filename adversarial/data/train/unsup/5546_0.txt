Overall, pretty impressed, and very glad it is so close to me. We came in here for dinner one night and ordered some food to go. The two young ladies at the front desk were very friendly and asked us to have a seat while we waited and told us they would bring out some chips and their homemade refried bean dip. The bean dip was great, and it was very nice of them to offer this to people who were ordering food to go.\n\nThe inside was clean (of course it was, the place is brand new), and decorated with bright colors. The only real complaint about the environment was that the music when we walked in was REALLY loud. It was mariachi music and spanish pop music. One odd Flogging Molly song snuck in for some reason, and that turned up way too loud in a Mexican restaurant was a little weird of an experience...\n\nWe ordered a few tacos and a burrito. When our food was brought to us they said \"here are your two tacos and burritos.\" I ordered three tacos, checked the receipt and realized I was only rang up for two. I said \"it was probably my fault, don't worry about it, two tacos are fine.\" The young man who brought me my food said \"oh no no no, let us treat you\" and less than 2 minutes later a third taco came out and I wasn't charged for it. Major customer service points there!\n\nPrices are also pretty reasonable here too. About 2.50 per taco and the burrito was 7 bucks. We will definitely be back to try the other entree options!
