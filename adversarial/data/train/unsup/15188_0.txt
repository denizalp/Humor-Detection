Very cute!!!! \n\nI like it inside! Dim, nice decor, good music, big, and a lounge downstairs!\n\nI hate the mixture of stairs and darkness because Im always afraid I am going to fall, but it wasn't too bad. The decor was really cute! They put thought in every detail in every corner of the place. The different rooms were nice too. Dancing? Check. Lounging? Check.\n\nI can definitely see why people hook up at Tao though. YOU CAN BARELY SEE IN THERE! Get drunk and Im sure everyone starts looking hot in there eventually. Eww.. hahaha. You better not get too wasted in there people.\n\nLine issue. RIDICULOUS. You better have a VIP host or get bottle service if you're coming here. (Even then it's a pain...) \nOtherwise? FORGET ABOUT IT!\n\nHave a cock and no chicks around you? Find another club to try. hahaha. Im not being funny! I am serious! There were people everywhere trying to get more girls into their party so they can get inside. It looked like everyone was working their tail off!\n\n4 stars for finally quenching my curiousity and for the cute decor. \n\nYea. That's all I needed. We didn't stay long at all (only the girls went in to check it out). Aren't I easy to please sometimes?
