Zenshin looks like Island Sushi. It is! The same owners just opened another local location same style sushi, traditional japanese, and local food. The name you would never know but they do tell you on the menu the Chef same guy. I always been fan of Island Sushi. I been too both locations one on eastern and downtown. One thing diversifies this location is much more upscale feel too it. The sushi bar area is easily biggest one of the three. It has very modern current look too it. Overall never know upscale because the prices are very reasonable most of the items are under $10. There is no real dress code seen braddahs going casual shorts and tank top action. The portion sizes are good size goes along with the local style food. It just opened so you could tell that the wait staff still working out the kinks. Overall say the service was great! Some of the sushi took little longer but still got everything that we order. \n\nThe food I ordered the torq fever sushi roll (spicy tuna roll) the presentation was beautiful. The taste was solid spicy tuna roll. I had the tonkatsu ramen. I know why ordering ramen if not the big three. I was in the mood for ramen. It was another solid dish. The broth was Ono! It was filling with all the toppings. Lucky enough that got too try some of my friends dishes. I tried the gyoza, softshell crab, sashimi platter, and eggplant fries. All tasty stuff. The presentations on all the food was really nice definitely for the price thinking something off. It all on point. \n\nIt great addition too South Point Hotel. Hotel that always felt lacking in diversity comes too restaurants. Zenshin not only great sushi and local food. Another part of Vegas and find some comfort local food 808 style!!!! Sure I plan on going back if ever in the area need too get my local food! =)))))
