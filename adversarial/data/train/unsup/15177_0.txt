Stopped in to check out the Red Umbrella Diaries event and we grabbed a seat out in the back patio. We started off with a couple of drinks- a sangria for the wifey, and I love me a good mojito...the sangria was pretty good, but my mojito was no bueno, I didn't even finish it.\n\nWe also decided to grab a couple of tapas to try-our waitress swore by the crabcakes and the fish tacos, so we went with her recommendations. The Crabcakes were excellent and paired well with the sauces and mixed greens.\nThe fish tacos on the other hand were a joke. for $10 you got a deconstructed plate of  3 mini tortillas, a small piece of fish, a sliver of pineapple with tons of slaw and salsa. This one was also no bueno.\n\nThe atmosphere here is cool though, like a very condensed version of First Friday.\nafter the Red Umbrella Diaries, Oneness Vibe provided some reggae beats, artists were painting, people were chilaxing by the bonfire, and we hung out with Angela H. and her pal, Jen F., and Joe L. Great hangout, but I'd probably hit up the street vendors who are on the same street, and serve up some of the tastiest tacos in town...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(202\/365) \" A+ For Atmo\"
