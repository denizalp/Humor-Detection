Locksmith lady (Laura) works fast & friendly! She is good at what she does and I was very impressed. I needed locks revamped for my mom's house and I feel at ease that it has been done quickly and securely by locklady!  I am hiring her to install new locks on my new home and I just think she's GREAT!!
