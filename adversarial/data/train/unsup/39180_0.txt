Hertz Gold Plus Rewards is the way to go! Bypassed the main desk in Las Vegas and went straight to the stall where my car was waiting. Could not have been easier! Car was clean, comfortable, and reliable the whole week. Saved so much money by renting with Hertz by not having to pay for a taxi everywhere we wanted to go. Can't wait to do it again!
