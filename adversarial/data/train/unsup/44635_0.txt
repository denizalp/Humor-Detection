Forbes and Murray corner location.  How can you beat that?  Great ice cream and gellatos.  Can also buy half gallons.  A nice stop in Squirrel Hill even in the winter.  This also is a favorite of students.  Efficient, friendly service.  I'm old school and would settle for Dairy Queen but this certainly has its market.   Gellato selection gives a European flair.
