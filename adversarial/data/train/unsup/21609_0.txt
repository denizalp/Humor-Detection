Fantastic Elite score! This was a great event with even better company of other Yelpers. I arrived around 5pm and received a Govino wine glass and 15 tasting tickets. There were so many great vendors to choose from ranging from local craft brews, wines and spirits. I like how the event wasn't too big and also not very crowded. The photo booth and promo items some of the vendors gave out added to the fun. There was also a live band playing great music. On top of a wonderful day at festival, we were also granted access to the after party of the W Hotel with 6 more tastings. CrushBrew did a great job at their first festival, thanks to  Yelp & Hailey for a great day and night!
