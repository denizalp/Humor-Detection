Welp...I don't even know where to start. I have eaten at this exact location several times and always enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. Had reservations for Easter Sunday at 4pm. Really it wasn't very busy at that time. Our server had one small table and ours (party of 8). He was so odd, weird, said all the wrong things while trying to joke, put in wrong food orders, some of our food came out, others were not ready. The set up they had for larger parties was horrible...The servers have to walk by with trays over the customers heads...it was super dangerous. Just an overall bad experience and definitely will not be back here for awhile!
