Terrible customer service. The owner is rude and cynical. I was told pretty much straightforward that I was a liar... When only stating that I had ordered that way before the owner replied \"I am the owner and you cannot order it that way\"... When in fact it was the same person I had ordered from before! I still placed an order. I called back seconds later because I forgot to tell them which dipping sauce I wanted. Minutes later they call back to ask for a dollar for the sauce! They told me I could pay the dollar at the door, which I agreed to. Then they asked for my credit card number again. Well, apparently they voided my payment so paying their precious dollar at the door was never an option to begin with. I asked to speak with the owner whom I placed the order with and I was told she was busy and couldn't talk to me...then when asking to cancel my order the owner was on the phone in seconds, stating she was standing right next to the employee talking to me the whole time... it now appears to me that the owners are teaching their employees to lie so they don't have to talk to customers themselves. The owner then told me I shouldn't cancel my owner because \"I'll still be hungry\". Ridiculous!!! The owner of this restaurant chose to make a terrible decision in regards to their business transactions with a customer that has returned on several occasions. I am very disappointed. There will be no more orders from this customer. \"I'll stay hungry\" as what was told to me. I hope this review will help others when making that crucial decision between one pizza place or another.
