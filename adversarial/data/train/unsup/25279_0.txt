So I've been holding off on writing this review in the hopes that Enterprise would make this issue right, but it's been over a month and I haven't heard from the company, so I guess I've gotta do this. (For the record, I've sent three separate emails.)\n\nMy experience initially renting the car was fine. The woman at the desk was helpful and patient, and I was quite happy with the car they gave me. (It was a Dodge Dart.) I was told that I would be charged $2.25 a gallon if I returned the car with less than half a tank, so I made a mental note to fill gas before returning it.\n\n(I spent exactly $15 refilling the car and in fact wound up returning it with 3\/4 of a tank.)\n\nAbout a week later, I received my online bill and noticed that I was charged $15.75 under the \"Fuel Service Option\" portion. As mentioned, I returned the car with far more fuel than when I received it, so I'm actually pretty furious that I've been charged an additional $15.75. (This means, in essence, I've spent $30 on gas. For a one-day rental. Does this sound reasonable or fair?)\n\nWhat really gets me is the complete and stony silence from Enterprise regarding this matter. This is how they treat their customers? Well, fine, that's they're choice. But neither I nor anybody in my circle of friends will ever rent from the company again, so I hope it was worth it.
