Strolled in with the intention to eat dinner here  but after a few minutes in the lounge area and the poor\/slow service we decided to go elsewhere. The ambiance is nice but doesn't compensate for the lack of attention from our server, the weak drinks and sloppy appetizers. \nWe expected more from such an attractive restaurant. A two star \"we've had better\" experience at Olive & Ivy.
