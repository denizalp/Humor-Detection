Late lunch with my lovely wife, we arrived between the big rushes and so were seated immediately at a large booth. Courtney did a great job of serving us and her enthusiasm about TH was more than clear.\n\nWe started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes to share. Served with grits, the taste of the tomato came through clearly. Very delicious and a great starter.\n\nFor main course, Mrs chose the Wicked Chicken Biscuit. The tabasco on the top was unexpected but the rest of it looked and tasted amazing. Really delish.\n\nI chose the Grilled Cheese and it was absolutely excellent. The bite from the gorgonzola with the sweetness from the brie was terrific. Super delicious sandwich. The cole slaw on the side was great. A little vinegary, but still quite tasty.\n\nA good meal, great service, I'm absolutely a fan!
