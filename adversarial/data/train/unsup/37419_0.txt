Great brunch spot. Somewhat limited menu, but there is a good variety to choose from. Order at the register and seat yourself. It was pretty crowded here on a Sunday morning, but there was enough seating (especially on the outside patio), that there wasn't much issue finding a seat. My girlfriend and I both had the red velvet waffles here and they were great. Although, they were sweet enough with the frosting that we didn't use any of the maple syrup they came with. The turkey sausage was also a good side - although it was actually 3 patties, rather than a sausage link. Overall, it's a nice casual place for brunch right on Mill Ave; just make sure to get here outside of peak hours if it's hot outside and you want to find a seat indoors.
