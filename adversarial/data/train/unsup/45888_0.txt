I laugh at these weak reviews. You clearly don't know about true  Napolitano style pizza, or are not seeing or tasting the details and nuances that go into this pie. The doe is perfect with a little bit a stretch to it, the toppings are just right, not too much sauce, not too much cheese. The margherita pizza is the best in the state. Even next to Pomo this is hands down the best. Basil is fresh sauce is boss and the mozz is different but its rich as done right. The Rosa is amazing. Pistachios, rosemary, red onions, and Parmesan reggiano. Service is usually great, and the food is usually consistent. They always take care of us. Chris bianco knows what he's doing. Panne Bianco and the downtown location also do a fantastic job. If you want american pizza go somewhere else, this is gourmet connoisseur pie. And I've been to New York, ate pizza in every borough and grew up with Italians on the east coast, so take my word for it.
