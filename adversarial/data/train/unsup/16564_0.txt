HORRIBLE! RUN AWAY FROM THESE GUYS! We used them for a VERY HIGH END, EXPENSIVE production, and was completely scammed. They made a ton of promises and didn't deliver. They completely ruined our event and company's reputation for how it went down. John, the owner, was the one we were dealing with start to finish. He guaranteed us certain things and never delivered. They provided low end equipment that looked, sounded and performed terrible, not the equipment we paid for or was quoted for. We had signed off on diagrams of what the entire setup would look like (including the owner's signature), and on the event day they said that wasn't the agreement. Then they said they could'nt provide what we agreed to and paid for. When asked later as to why not, he gave nothing but excuses and became aggressive, confrontational, threatening and cussing me over the phone. I tell everyone I know in the event business to steer VERY clear of them, and I high suggest you do too!
