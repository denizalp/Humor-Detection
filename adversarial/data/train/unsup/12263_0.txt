Really cool brewery with plenty of in house beers with choices for every taste. A huge bar and plenty of tables inside and out on the patio. They offer 12 oz. and 16 oz. on most of their beers. I was feeling like going light so I had the All Knight Long, a refreshing pilsner type. Then I had the Doin' Thyme Witbier.a Crisp Belgium style wheat beer. But my favorite was the  Jalapeno Pale Ale. A lot lighter than a typical pale ale and just a hint of spice. They have live music, cornhole sets and a food truck (Rockin BBQ when we were there). Free peanuts are offered that of course, gets you that thirsty I want another beer feeling. Parking is tight on the gravel parking lot and didn't notice any opportunity for street parking.
