I was so excited & looking forward to coming back to the hub after an amazing experience at a recent Yelp event. The climbing & facilities has always been a 5\/5. Staff on site during the supervision were also very encouraging & helpful 5\/5. However, one was likely new & had little experience with putting on the harness & had to fix mine a couple times. I was a little skeptical in the beginning as the girl supervising us was quite tiny. I was worried there'd be a problem if we accidentally let go while climbing to the top, and that she might have gone flying. But all was well & there was nothing to worry about! :)\n\nHowever, it was the customer service experience at the end that left much to be desired 1\/5. Never mind that half of the ppl in our group were charged different amounts, but after discovering the error, the staff asked another friend to come back & pay a few dollars more due to their calculation mistake. It just seemed very unprofessional. Frankly, I would have let that go if I were the hub employee. Instead of losing a few dollars, they could have lost potential memberships, etc. Nothing was really explained to us how it worked esp w\/ the coupon & it was just confusing & chaotic. Tip for hub - next time to avoid making mistakes with a group, perhaps you should have them all submit their payment at the same time so there is no confusion. It was a bit unfortunate cuz the experience last time was absolutely wonderful! \n\nIn terms of the climbing, they had changed some of the 'climbing holds' (not sure what it's called) so that it will constantly be fresh, challenging and different. That was very nice to see. We noticed immediately the dragon was not like how it was last month. Even though we only got to try it once as our climb for the dragon got cut short by a staff doing the demo w\/ a group of kids. Would def. recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge and fun with friends. The hub (as I've heard from regular climbers) is the best in the city.
