We love Camp Bow Wow Avondale!! And so, I need to add another paw-tastic review. Since my last review, we've used their dog boarding services several more times (vacations, business trips, etc). Heather the owner and her team of dedicated paw-some  counselors made us feel at ease dropping off our precious baby, Louie, at the camp for the extended stay. In fact, Louie looked forward to his camp vacays and always came home a happy pup. \n\nHeather has proven to us that she cares deeply about improving her business: Finally upgraded the grainy looking cameras to higher quality ones. Yay! Thank you so much!! \n\nAnd I like how she and her team care for the pups well being: There was one incident where Louie came home with a cold after his stay and it might've been the shampoo they used. Having corresponded with Heather about the issue, she seems genuinely concerned for the poor guy and offered Louie a complimentary hypoallergenic bath and made note for next time. We appreciated the nice gesture and continued to use their services. \n\nLastly, why we love Camp Bow Wow Avondale? It melts our hearts every time we see our Louie being treated with love and care, like a family... (see photo). Thank you so much Heather and team CBW Avondale!!
