Where do I start? Well to be clear, I never actually ate here...unless you count my stomach eating itself from utter and total starvation! \n\nComing all the way to Matts was a stretch for us, living on the west side and having a breakfast place we already love. But...we had heard great things and wanted to check it out. MISTAKE one. \n\nWe called and were told there wasn't much of a wait. We arrived and were told it should be pretty quick. I think that's the point where they realized we had kids. This place HATES kids. MISTAKE two.\n\nWe waited for 90 minutes! We watched parties come after us, get seated and leave while we were waiting outside. And these were parties of ALL sizes. They even LIED to us and said we were next and sat a party of the exact same size that arrived 20 minutes after us. \n\nWe left and went around the corner to the Phoenix Public Market. I doubt that the food here could be good enough to put up with their complete and total bullshit.
