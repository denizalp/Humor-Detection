I found this unassuming place almost by accident.  I am so happy I walked in and gave it a try.  It is our go to place for Mexican food cravings.  My go to order is the beef tacos with the side salad.  The meat is tender and everything is perfectly seasoned.  The owner is friendly, personable and seems to genuinely love what he does -which may explain why they have stood the test of time.  The quality of the food and service has been consistently great and I look forward to eating here again...and again.
