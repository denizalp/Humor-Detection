The brunch was delicious!  I had the nachos and my partner had the biscuits and gravy.  So much flavor!  Gorgeous decor and great service!  This is the place to take your friend who thinks vegetarian food is boring.  The tofu is excellent, they get it from a farm in Virginia and it is the opposite of negative tofu stereotypes- it is firm but not dry, moist and perfectly seasoned.  The $2 Bloody Mary rocked my world.  good prices all around.  Can't wait to go back.
