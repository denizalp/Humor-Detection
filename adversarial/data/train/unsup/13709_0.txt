For my second ever time in Vegas, went to XS again on a Friday night for Above and Beyond's first night of residency at Encore.  It was AWESOME!  I love that they always throw out those light sticks - such a fun thing to wave around and a cute souvenir of the night!\n\nThe pool part was actually open this time - walking through the outdoor area was realllllllly nice and way less crowded than inside.  Especially the bar.\n\nFound out that free tables for ladies from promoters are more of a Monday night thing (at least at XS and Marquee), so for cute girls (ugh sorry again for the douchiness) plan your Vegas trip around a Monday!  It's so worth it!  We only got 1 free drink ticket this time since it was Friday, and no table service :(  But again, (douchedouchedouche) if you put in the effort to look hot, walking around the table areas should get you invited into one of them - look for bachelor parties!!!  Hahaha shameless.  But seriously, be careful please!  I always make one of the guys pouring the drinks have a gulp of mine before I start.  BE SAFE KIDS!!!
