I am a SANDWICH FANATIC!!!!!\n\nSack's is one of my fav sandwich shops. It was my go to spot for lunch last semester at ASU. These days I can only afford to go on occasion. Great sandwiches just wish they would come down on their prices a bit to make it more pocket friendly.\n\nNice bonus if you \"like\" on fb as they offer free drinks from time to time. Oh, and the cookie you get with your sandwich is a nice touch. And there is also the punch card. 10th sandwich is free!\n\nThe impressionist and jazz are my fav sammies. One is a veggie and the other is bacon, turkey and avocado. The crew comes up with some pretty tasty sandwich specials, sometimes they sound crazy, but trust they will be delicioso!\n\nDownside is parking. There's like 5 spots. Great option for students and ASU staff, not so much for passerbyers (try the Sack's on Hardy if you need to park).
