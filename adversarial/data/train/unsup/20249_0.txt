Make no mistake, this is bar food. NASC is adjacent to a bar in a business park- neither of which really fit the area, making it a little hard to find when they're the only spot in the complex open over the weekend. Besides the sandos, menu has bar staple apps and burgers.\n\nCame in right after opening and ordered two sandwiches and a salad. There was only one employee working, sweet but a little overwhelmed. Dining area has a rustic slant to the decor and games to play while you wait.\n\nThe American Hero sandwich (roasted turkey, fire smoked ham, smoked pit beef, cheddar, Swiss) and the Fried Green Tomato BLT were both pretty lackluster- meats were all dry, bacon tasted microwaved, sandwiches were sans condiments which made them even dryer. The Chicago Chopped Salad was even worse, with old-looking chicken and dried-out pepperoncini. \n\nWe didn't finish a single item we ordered and I wouldn't come back. Not sure how this spot gets rave reviews from anyone other than desk monkeys whose only alternative is food from a vending machine.
