Waited 1.5 hours to see the Dr. What is the point of having appointment? 2.5 hrs total for office visit.1.5 hours of my life wasted away waiting in doctor office. No movies, no workout area, no video games, and no cookies. Had plenty of time to write this bad review, won't be coming back. Have better things to with my life, then wait in a waiting room.
