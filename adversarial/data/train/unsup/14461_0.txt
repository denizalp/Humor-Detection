Oh boy, where do I start?  A colleague suggested that we come here for a lunch meeting one day.  He said they had the best French Dip Sandwich in town.  Seduced by this claim, I had to give this place a try.  Of course, my first time there I had to try this legendary Sandwich.  Priced at $20, it better be good...\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/houstons-scottsdale?select=U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w#U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w\n\nI took one bite and OMG...!  It was friggin' awesome!  Even better than I expected.  The flavor of the Prime Rib and the Au Jus sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.  It also comes with a Creamy Horseradish Sauce that just adds to the flavor explosion.  The Bread is Buttered and soft, but had just the right texture to hold this all together and complimented the sharp flavors of the Beef and Sauce.  Wow, it is a masterpiece.\n\nThe service here is also impeccable.  You feel like you're dining in a 5 diamond restaurant....and it's lunch!\n\nI was so impressed after that 1st visit, that I've been back several times and have brought many friends and colleagues to experience the French Dip.\n\nMy other favorite item is the Hickory Burger (Canadian Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, w\/Hickory Sauce), $14.  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/houstons-scottsdale?select=CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw#CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw\nThat's right folks, there's a thick slice of Canadian Bacon that tops this Burger!  This is a big bad Burger....and it tastes awesome!  I can barely take a bite out of it....and it's not like some freakishly huge Burger, but the ingredients are fresh and stacked high....making for an awesome Burger.\n\nFor sides, the Cole Slaw is by far the best you can order and I highly recommend that.  The Fries are so\/so.  \n\nAnother tip, if you come for lunch you can make reservations.  It can get busy, so it's worth the extra step to do so.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
