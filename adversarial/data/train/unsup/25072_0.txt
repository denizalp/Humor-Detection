Worst pharmacy ever. I can never get my prescriptions or refills in a timely fashion. I put in a prescription on Monday and I logged in online to check the status and it said pending. I chatted with an online rep and they told me that it wouldn't be ready until Thursday! Ridiculous. I called the Tempe location and asked if they had the medicine in stock, and if I could transfer my request over to their location. The pharmacist transferred my prescription  and then said that it would be ready within the hour. When people are sick they need access to their medication right away; they shouldn't have to wait days. They really need to get their act together.
