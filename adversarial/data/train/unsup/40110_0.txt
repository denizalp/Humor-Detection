Try Fresh co. Or No Frills for lower prices on grocery but they dont offer a 5pm dinner takeout\n\nI had their takeout food and my crew responded as follows\n\nCan we have Pancers Deli, Bones or Pollo locco next time?\n\nThe Pancers Cottager special is friday, bones does a monday special and I forgot about it so ended up at Fortinos in panic mode\n\nFried dried Chicken at $15 was a disappointment\nSoggy sweet potatoes fries was sad...get a large as a tip and toast them in your oven\nRibs was more fat than meat and sauce tasted off\n\nThat cost me $40\n\nIf you want honest and authentic then this is not for you but if you are in a hurry and don't care about quality then enjoy this take out food\n\nNow the rock a very good pizza if you can afford the 20 minute wait\n\nOther than that their factory assembly line fast food kiosk is a sad experience but is appealing to the harried house wife\n\nWhy did i not trust my inner yelp and just grab a Pancers Deli or  Vinni Pannini bundle instead?
