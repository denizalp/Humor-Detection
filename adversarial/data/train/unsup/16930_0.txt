I always have a great experience and meal at Cowfish. They have more unique and tasty options to cover any diet, preference, or hankering.  The food is fantastic and they have the best, cool and friendly servers.\n\nMy favorites:  \nLobster & Crab Spring Rolls\nCrab Rangoon Dip\nThe All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi\nThe Nature Boy's WOOOOO-shi BuffalOOOOO-shi Roll\nBlackened Tuna Roll\n\nI consistently get great service and a great meal at Cowfish.  #lovecowfish
