We passed by this a ton of times and there was never a line.  Finally we decided to try it out on Sunday and it was a half hour long wait to order.  Totallh worth the wait and the price especially if you love eggs and breakfast.  I love biting into the sandwich and having the egg yolk break and soak into your bun.  The bun is key and what does it.  It's like a fresh baked buttery croissant except without the flakiness.  The ratio of all the components is just right.  You get all the goodness of a plate of breakfast in each bite.  Not too greasy, fresh ingredients.  Their menu is simple like in-n-out.  Its just different kinds egg based of sandwiches.\n\nSeating sucked for us on a Sunday afternoon. You have to do that lingering stalking method where you wait around for someone to leave then dive for their table lol. This is not the place to meet a group of ppl for brunch.\n\nStill a good unique eggbased sandwich.  Can't get anything like this anywhere else so I would suffer the long wait again.
