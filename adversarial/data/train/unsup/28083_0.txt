What brought me to this place which is about 7 miles west of the the Strip, was a Yelp deal I stumbled upon.  $10 for a $20 gift certificate?  I'm no fool, but that is a great deal!  My hubby and I dined here for lunch on Saturday, March 3rd.  Since we were the only ones dining at the restaurant at the time, we had the choice of sitting where we wanted to which was nice.  This place has a real mom and pop shop type of feel to it. The gentleman who waited on us (I think he may have been one of the owners) was really friendly and helpful.  My hubby and I ordered their Chicken Satay, Garlic Pepper chicken and their Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad and hot tea. \n\nCHICKEN SATAY:  I loved how they used white meat chicken for this.  It was moist, juicy and flavorful.  The peanut sauce tasted fresh and was delicious.  The best peanut sauce ever!  The cucumber relish was also very fresh and complimented this dish very nicely.\n\nGRILLED TIGER SHRIMP MANGO SALAD:  OMG!  A MUST ORDER!!!!  This was probably one of the best Thai style salads I have ever had.  It has baby greens, cashew nuts, mango, red onions, sweet peppers, Asian herbs and chili lime dressing. I loved how it combined the sweetness of the mango, with the spicy, tanginess  of the dressing.  Definitely a flavor match made in heaven.  According to our server, their dressing is homemade.  DAMN!  I wish I could take a bottle of it home!  A warning though, we ordered a spice level of 3 for the salad and the heat sneaks up on you!!  LOL!  Though my tongue was on fire, I could not stop eating it as it was that GOOD!\n\nCHICKEN IN GARLIC PEPPER SAUCE:  Another winner.  If you love garlic, then this is definitely a dish for you!  Full of flavor and just plain yum!  Again, I loved how they use white meat chicken in this dish.  \n\nHOT TEA:  Very good.  It has a unique, floral taste to it.  \n\n\nFINAL VERDICT:  WORTH THE DRIVE FROM THE STRIP!  GREAT FOOD, GREAT PRICES (WAY CHEAPER THAN ANYTHING ON THE STRIP), FRIENDLY SERVICE AND CLEAN ENVIRONMENT!!!  \n\nCan't wait to come back!!!  :)
