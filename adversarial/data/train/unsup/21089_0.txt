Oh man. Where do I begin.\nFirst of all, when you walk in here, it's like you're walking in to willy wonkas chocolate factory. Only, this is the Russian chocolate factory. \nMy friend introduced me to this place a while back because I was looking for something different. I was tired of American cake. \nWay to much frosting and not enough cake. Or vise versa.\nWell, I was introduced to Spatka! Holy hell. This is thin layer after layer of cake and frosting. Equal amounts of both, perfectly sweetened. I will admit this, we bring home a cake and eat the entire thing right out of the box while binge watching Netflix.\nThe other baked goods they have are just as spectacular. Really, nothing that is prepared here is bad.\nWe love to just bring home the locks and snack on those for a few days. \nThey do have a deli that is packed full of homemade delicious Russian foods. Hot and fresh. \nI would highly recommend this place. If you don't speak or understand the Russian language, I would ask for help.
