So, boba isn't that novel if you're from an area with a bigger Asian community.  For me growing up and in college, boba was everywhere.  I never really got into it, so I don't have a seasoned boba palate, but I do know a good boba cafe when I see one and Eba is the real deal.\n\nThe little details here struck me as legit.  \n\n* The boba flavors and extras are extensive - probably about 50 or so different flavors and way to order. I opted for the vanilla green tea complete with little tapioca balls at the bottom, which satiated my (at the time) liquid diet.\n* Hot food lunch offerings. When I met Gabi and other Yelpers I noticed I could have even had a full-on rice chicken curry lunch.  \n*  But the icing on the cake was the karaoke set in the corner.  Hellz YES, how authentically Asian -- Karaoke when you're sober!!  Oh the horror, good thing no one spiked my boba otherwise I would have been strutting on the table singing \"Humpty Dance\" by Digital Underground much to my and your dismay.\n\nI'm liking you Eba.  I'll warn you next time so you have sufficient time to confiscate the aforementioned karaoke machine.  I will be back.
