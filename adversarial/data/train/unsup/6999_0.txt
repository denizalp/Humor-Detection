Lendingtree taut that they have access to all types of loans. Unfortunately, this is a con to drive users to their site. \n\nPhoned Lendingtree to inquiry specifically about finding the exact type of loan, that might be able to meet my purchasing needs. I asked \"Scott\" about \"Construction Loan\" options, which are promoted at their own site. \"Scott\" said that they didn't have this underwriting capability unfortunately. Too bad. I then asked about a \"Raw Land Loan\". Again, \"We can't help.\". I inquired about a \"SBA loan.\" \"Sorry. We aren't going to be able to help you today.\" ...... Waste of time. IF they only want to loan pocket change, why don't they promote these products-only? Appropriately, LendingTwig should be their name.
