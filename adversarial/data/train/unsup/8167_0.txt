Gallo Blanco is a wonderful little surprise; exactly where you wouldn't expect it.  In a hotel lobby!\n\nOn our most recent trip, we came here after spending the morning at the Heard Museum just down the street.  As I mentioned, Gallo Blanco is located in the lobby of Clarendon Hotel.  I really do not mean it to be a smug comment, but I have never found any great food in hotel lobbies. Until now.! BTW, if you didn't have the address, or knew it was there -- you might drive past and miss it. I know we have a few times.  D'oh!\n\nThe food is very good, what I like to call \"upscale Mexican hip\".  But don't let that stop you, because the food is as good as any Mexican food truck!  LOL  \n\nThe Fish Tacos are to die for!  They come simply with iceberg lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole.  Oh, and not a bad deal for $3.50!  We also like the made to order Guacamole for $7.00, and the Asado Salad.  It comes with grilled Chicken, Romaine lettuce, Spinach, Cabbage, Apples and cheese for $10.00.  We have tried most items on the menu, and everything is excellent.\n\nGallo Blanco likes to advertise that their ingredients are fresh, from local suppliers and farmers. Great stuff.  Order the white sangria, it's delicious.\n\nEnjoy!
