We came here on a Saturday evening, a little before 8pm, and had their dinner buffet for \n31.54 (Used a 15% off dinner coupon that I received in the mail) \n\n- Right before we walked in 2 Asian men came out arguing about Lobster! Literally, \"Let's take this outside!\" Hot commodity. YES! \n- Pay before you eat like a casino buffet. \nItems to grab a second time\n1. salmon sashimi \n2. Lobster - like at a dim sum restaurant\n3. Prawns - like at Makinos\n4. Crab legs \n- Disorganized seating. \n- Like most Asians, you come for the seafood. They do have the normal Chinese buffet food and the sushi rolls that no one gets. Fillers. \n- No dim sum. No tempura. \n- Oysters taste just like the sea...yuck. Good thing they have lemons and chili paste.\n- Exactly what I expected. Great food, sloppy venue. If you can get over that, then you'll have a wonderful time. \n- Full-filling. Cheap. No dates. Family + Bring GM+GF type of place. You challenge yourself to AYCE, then leave with that  greasy upset stomach feeling. haha
