This place really focus on customer service.   Their foods are made with fresh ingredients and herbs.  I have the small (3.95) tom yum noodles with chicken  and it was the best broth that I ever have.  I also wanted to try their pad thai on the lunch special for 8.95 and it was great.  My only complaint is that on the menu, you have an option of chicken or pork, veg or tofu but the waitress said that it only comes with  chicken so we have  all chicken plates.  I will definitely come back to try their dinner menu.
