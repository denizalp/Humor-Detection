I finally stumbled in. \n\nIts in a ghetto part of town, but if you're paying $3 for a movie, you shouldn't expect red carpet anyways. \n\nThe guy that works the box office is the same guy that works the concession. The popcorn was more expensive than the movie, haha. BUT they also have these seasoning powders to spruce up your popcorn. You won't find that in any Regal. \n\nWe smuggled in a shitload of snacks. I always feel bad when I bring in foods with crunchy-sounding wrappers, but no worries, we were the only ones in there. Since we were totally alone, we contemplated having sex, but we were afraid of catching the Aids. I am not kidding when I say the place is grimy. \n\nThe projector was noisy, but it added to the old-timey ambiance. It was like I was watching an old school Bogart flick. After a few minutes, you forget about it. \n\nBonus: its right next to the Pinball Hall of Fame. Ideal date night for the cheap: buy your date a frappe at reJAVAnate on Trop ($5), take her to the Pinball Hall of Fame ($3), then hit up a slightly stale or foreign film ($6 for two). Perfect. \n\nSo really, its a one-star experience, but because its so cheap, I give it four stars IN YOUR BUTT! \n\n* off the strip, non-casino
