I can walk there!!!\n\n Not, like, a real city person walk. I mean a \"Phoenix, Arizona, this is totally walking distance from my office\" kind of situation. So, I am in heaven. \n\nThat being said, I'm not sure I can see myself hanging out at Lola. It was sort of chilly inside (both temperature wise and general tone). But, I have been enjoying the coffee. \n\nThe first time I went to Lola, I got their version of a white mocha - very very good.\n\nToday I picked their drip coffee and asked for hazelnut flavoring to be added. I was pleasantly surprised that I was not charged extra for the hazelnut, that I ALMOST tipped the girl ... if only she would have smiled ... or made me feel remotely welcome. \n\nSo, Lola could use some customer service spiffying up (based on other reviews I read as well), but it's not going to stop me from going there. \n\nDid I mention I can walk there? \n\nOh, and the coffee today was really quite good.
