Disregard the sniffy reviews by food snobs; Monty's is great at being what it is, a nouveau diner with an eclectic menu, welcoming to old and young, hipster and square, LGBT and straight,etc. Great breakfast items (French toast,omelettes, scramblers, pancakes) available around the clock, lots of comfort food veg and non-veg dishes (\"meatloaf of the gods\" enchiladas, chili, etc.). Everything is freshly prepared with good ingredients. Not to mention the delicious pies and cakes..coffee is meh but that's par for diners. Prices are reasonable, two can be stuffed for $30. Friendly service by the mostly college student\/artsy young person staff. If you're looking for a good solid (but not fancy-shmancy) meal on the E. Side of Madison, can't do better than Monty's.
