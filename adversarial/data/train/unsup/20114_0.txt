I am not the type of person to give a bad review on a restaurant, but I feel like the 5-star reviews of this place are a complete misrepresentation of the quality and don't want others to be mislead. I don't understand how this restaurant has 5 star reviews!!!\n\nGiven that Sammiches Bistro is so close to my house and it had rave reviews on both Yelp and Google, we decided to give this place a try. Sammiches has a small dining area and bar top area which is where we were promptly seated. \n\nWe ordered two steak sandwiches that were comprised of pre-cooked ribeye steak that was cubed into large chunks and then refrigerated until served. Unfortunately, this gives the steak a thick unappealing rubbery texture. The sandwich was served on a barely toasted baguette with garlic salt, garlic aoli, and caramelized onions. I opted for no mushrooms. The french fries were fine, just a basic frozen packaged fry. \n\nThe waitstaff was just meh....not overly attentive and spent most of their time standing around. The owner was attentive and asked what we thought or how he could make the meal better, etc. \n\nThe point is, NOTHING about sammiches screams 5-stars to me and I don't want others to be mislead.
