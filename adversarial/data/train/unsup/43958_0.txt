Nice hotel. Very pretty. Our room was clean. I loved the sunken living room. Although we didn't really use it, I liked that it gave us that much more room. The bathroom was very nice. Has a large soaking tub and a great shower! Wish they had some better resteraunts, wasn't crazy about the ones we've tried. It is kind of at the end of the strip though, so it was a ton of walking.
