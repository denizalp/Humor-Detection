Stopped in here a few months back.  Walking into the store it is very bright with florescent lights that made me feel like I was in an episode of twilight zone.  Not that I need to feel like I am at a 5 star resort but the lighting in here is jarring.\n\nThe staff was a little to eager.  One woman followed me around and kept trying to offer helpful suggestions \"all you have to do is ask\"....Uh thanks but I think I got this all figured out.  Tried to make as little eye contact on checkout and the cashier kept saying creapy shit like \"well I know you'll be back\".  \n\nDo people walk into adult stores and ask for help and recommendations?  Ekk.  Everything sold here can be supplied with the same general directions: 1) Insert 2) Turn on 3) enjoy.  No need for creepy chit-chat.  Just let me pay for my items and skeddadle.
