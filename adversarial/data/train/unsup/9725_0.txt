I got a Thai massage from Anna. I was super excited because I've only gotten Swedish massages before, but I didn't know what to expect. I was hoping she would walk on me, but she couldn't because of my body frame. :( anyways, it was a little rough, but it felt amazing, & she was always asking if she should be more gentle. I felt that at the end of the massage I felt better than at the end of the Swedish, the ultimate results were better. No pain no gain? The price was also amazing, especially compared to chains like Massage Envy & Massage Heights. I plan on coming back twice a month for some TLC. Also, they are opening one on Eastern! ;D
