We had Lunch here on a Monday and the place was completely empty.\nThe guy who helped us was very informed and explained how we could mix and match.\n\n~ Veg thali combo $10.49\n Choice of 3 veg curries with kulcha, salad, appetizer & dessert.\n~ Two Entree Combo $9.99\nChoice of 2 Curries with Plain Basmati Rice or Veg Fried Rice and Naan, Side Veg Salad.\n\nFor the veg thali we got the dal,okra and aloo gobi the curries were just okay with the 2 entree combo i got the tandoori paneer and veg korma both of which were disappointing the korma tastes nothing like a cashew based gravy and the paneer was not very fresh.\nThe kulcha was nice but my naan was unfortunately a little burnt.\n\nAlso tried the mint strawberry lemonade, it was nice.\n\nOverall i would say i have had better.\n\nCheers!
