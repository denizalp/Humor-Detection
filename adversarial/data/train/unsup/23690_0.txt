We frequent Press at the Four Seasons before having dinner at Charlie Palmer. On our last stay cation at the Four Seasons I decided to Have a Martini at the bar. The Bartenders name is Marla. She was unfriendly which is out of character for employees at the Four Seasons. I asked for a Belvedere up. She delivered my Martini on the Rocks. I explained I ordered it up.  She replies, oh you want a Martini. The evening at the Bar was very disappointing.   Last night we returned to Press prior to going to a  show at  Mandalay Bay.  Russ who usually Bartender was there and we had a great time.
