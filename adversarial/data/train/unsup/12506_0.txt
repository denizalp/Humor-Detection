OMFG I SO ENJOYED THIS! Yes I'm a total douche. It was really gross and interesting. The case was pretty easy to solve, but I like seeing all the icky stuff, like dead bugs on a body OMGGG GROSSS! And learning things about stuff like that, none of which I can actually remember now, as I was incredibly sick that day from some bad beef that I ate at a McDonald's restaurant in the Strip Shopping Mall, which gave me an asthma attack during this CSI: The Experience. \n\nSo my crime-fighting career was not going well, as I had to keep sitting down and breaking out in sweat. I don't remember much more but dead bodies, and Gail Grissom, and the video where I answered the questions. But I got my crime-fighting degree, BECAUSE I ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS RIGHT BUT ONE! I'm sooooo AWESOME YOU GUYS! And NOWWW...  I'm a Junior Rookie Detective! They e-mailed me the degree, and I swear I'm gonna print that sucker & hang it next to my college degree. Boo-yah, Beches! Booo..... yahhhhhhh. There will be photos. On Facebook. I may wear a sexy cop outfit. I'm a total douche-loser. I know this. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA. (but, but..... I really, like, want to be a cool sexy ballerina veterinarian cop. :(  This is as close as I'm gonna get!)\n\nDid I mention I love CSI, and Law & Order, and this is like my secret wet dream, if I was a guy and had wet dreams? Ah, we can't all be Stabler & Benson. sigh.\n\nP.S. you people who say this sucked, you're no fun, and you suck. Why don't you stay home and watch \"Dancing with the Stars\" or some crap like that. Tweebs.\n\nIn conclusion, they should expand this into a multi-million dollar, holographic complex featuring live actors, like a Halloween Horror house, but with more crimes, that you solve, and spend millions of dollars making it bloodier, \"solve-ier\", with a real\" jail,\" a bar afterward,  and letting me wear cop outfits and pretending to arrest people. There could be also male \"Sexy Cops\" for bachelorette parties.\n\nSigh....  If I had the money, I would totes approach them with the cash and this awesome business proposal.
