I had three business breakfasts during the 2014 Marijuana Business Expo  at the at this horrid restaurant. Everybody told me this was an awesome breakfast, They can't even cook an egg.\n\nFirst try, I tried the two egg breakfast and a fruit bowl. The scrambled eggs were from a caterers tray, the bacon was overcooked, the hash browns were burnt, and the fruit wasn't ripe.\n\nSecond breakfast, I ordered two scrambled ala carte and a side of bacon. I specifically asked for the eggs to be scrambled fresh. They brought me eggs from the caterers tray again. I ate the bacon; it was passable.\n\nThird try, I order eggs over easy and a side of bacon. The eggs and the bacon was undercooked. I couldn't eat any of it.\n\nThis is a management and hiring problem. They need to fire the management first and see if the staff can be trained. If you can't cook eggs and bacon, your restaurant should not be serving breakfast.\n\nThis is a truly terrible restaurant. My clients paid them close to $80 dollars for my food and I got three passable pieces of bacon and six average cups of coffee. Stay away!
