Gordon Ramsay is one of my fave chefs to watch on TV. He's sort of the Simon Cowell of the foodie world and I love that!\n\nI was extremely excited to dine here with the bf and our bodybuilder friend Seth (Elf boy). We actually patiently waited in line for about 20-25 minutes. Not so bad of a wait for a popular restaurant on a night where people were ready to grub before hittin' up da clubs. \n\nI loved how casual the environment was but it still had it's little upscale feel to it with the service. I thought it was pretty cool when the waitress brought out this iPad drink menu where you can scroll through all the drinks they offered. Seth and I both had a glass of the Pumpkin beer which was bombtastic! \n\nI honestly don't remember which burger I ordered but I do remember thoroughly enjoying it. The meat was cooked perfectly medium for my taste. \n\nWe also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 regular fries and onion rings for the table. I liked how the sweet potato fries came out with this delicious honey dipping sauce and there was powdered sugar all over them. You definitely don't need to order any dessert if you get these fries.\n\nI definitely would come back here with a huge empty stomach so I can try out some other tasty items on their menu! Maybe for lunch that way there's no wait. :)
