I'm going to keep this review short and sweet, mainly because I have leftovers to eat.\n\nCharles Bukowski said \"find what you love and let it kill you.\"\n\nWell, now that I've found Taj Palace I finally understand what he meant.\n\nI love Taj Palace and since I am diabetic I am going to eat all the carbs on their menu and die from them.\n\nCircle of life and shizzle, y'all da bomb dizzle and anybody that says different don't no NAAN.
