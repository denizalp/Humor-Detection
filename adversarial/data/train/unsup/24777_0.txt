Came here for my boyfriend's son's birthday.  He wanted sushi so sushi he got.  This happens to be my guys favorite sushi place so we try to come when we're in Charlotte.  \n\nPricing is a bit high but they have an extensive menu from sashimi to rolls and bento boxes. \n\nThey also have noodles and fried rice as well as dessert.  \n\nWe spent about  $160 for two adults and 2 kids.  A couple of sake and beer. \n\nPlace does get busy on the weekends so if you plan on trying it out, go early or off hours if you don't want to wait in line.
