Okay, I got drunk really early and don't remember most of it but this is from my friends experience. LOL.\n\nThey play really good music. The place gets packed and hot inside. They said it was actually less hot being outside! The drinks are expensive but that's like every club in Vegas. Compared to other clubs in Vegas, they would say this is in the top 3. Too bad you can't go into the pool here like XS\n\nIf you have a room key, you can get in for free up to 2 people. So when you are at the front desk, ask for extras. LOL! Also, you get to skip the line if you have a room key.\n\nNote: when leaving the club you will have to walk down a LONG flight of stairs to leave...
