Yelp Says they are 43rd and Happy Valley. i called for delivery they answered the phone and put me on hold for about 5 mins. when they came back on the phone they said thank for calling Pizza Mia on 43rd and Bethany. I told her their Yelp account said they were on Happy Valley and 43rd, she responded \"well were not\". I said ok you may want to update your Yelp account and she hung up with out saying a word. \n\nI guess they are just to busy to be polite.
