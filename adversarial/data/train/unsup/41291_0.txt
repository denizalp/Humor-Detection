I must have used 20 napkins to finish only 2 tacos because their tacos are super juicy. Decided to try the brisket taco and tinga pollo and have no regrets. If you decide to dine in the tacos are served on a metal tray with a paper lining that says \"mi taco\" on it. The presentation was mediocre but the tacos tasted fantastic. For both tacos the tortilla was chewy. The brisket was soft and flavourful, and tasted really good with cilantro sauce. I preferred this over the pollo (chicken) one which I decided to try with chipotle sauce.\n\nOnce you order they give you a plastic card with a number on it and you wait. The wait time was a bit longer (around 10 minutes for 2 tacos) but it was okay as it was a busy time (lunvh hour) with lots of customers. Limited and cramped seating though. Despite the longer wait times I would say for the amazing tacos it deserves a whopping 4\/5.
