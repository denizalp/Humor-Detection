Such a weird dining experience. Within two minutes of being seated, my boyfriend went to the bathroom and the waitress came over to ask if I was ready to order. I told her I was not and my boyfriend was in the bathroom so she went away and came back another 2 times in the next 2 minutes while I was still sitting by myself. The second my boyfriend came back, before he even cracked the menu, there they were again! Seriously we felt like they were trying to rush us right out. \nOnce we ordered, they brought the rolls before the edamame so we told them to skip it since we were already half way done with our sushi anyways and they seemed to not understand why we wouldn't want to eat an appetizer after the main course. The sushi was ok but the pieces of cucumber in the rolls were big chunks, which is weird to me. \nThe icing on the cake is when they gave us the check and told us to \"take our time.\" Really? After all that?
