As a Shanghainese I can confirm that the flavour is great!!!\n\nI am surprised to see no one in the reviews mentioned their bite size wonton. That is probably a Shanghainese cuisine classic. They made the stock full of umami and wontons tasted authentic. I was so in love with it.\nSang-ji Bao was good too, I have never been really a big fan of sang-ji bao(this type of food overall) so it's unfair for me to judge whether it's good or not.\n\nMake sure you bring cash, they take only cash under $20.
