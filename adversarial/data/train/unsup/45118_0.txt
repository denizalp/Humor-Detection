This is in a great location being on 10th and I know many people are not wanting to go in her because of the appearance on the outside but the food is amazing! Don't be afraid to go in and try it! \nThey had a booth at \"Taste of Calgary\" this year. On the menu at \"Taste of Calgary\" they had: \n- Pad Thai Chicken which was gluten free\n- Pineapple Curry Beef and Rice which was gluten free\n- Deep Fried Chicken Spring Rolls\n- Coconut Sticky Rice with Thai Custard which was gluten free and vegetarian\n- Green papaya and Carrot Salad which was gluten free\n\nThis place is very good for accommodating for people with food allergies. They had many items that were vegetarian or gluten free. However, they had no items that were dairy free which was disappointing to see. \nThey also didn't have a vegetarian symbol beside the green papaya and carrot salad which they did list as gluten free but I do not know how it would not be vegetarian but I also do not want to assume in case it really is not.
