If I could give this place negative stars I would. \nWe came here on a Sunday evening where were it was pretty empty, \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nNachos - probably the worst I've ever had, they were so soggy covered in runny sour cream and cheese \n\nChicken Tacos - pretty tasty, but it had a very strong chipotle flavour\n\nShrimp Tacos- had a very overpowering chipotle flavour , so much so it was difficult to eat.\n\nVeggie Enchiladas - it was simply just grilled veggies and cheese inside a flour tortilla covered with cheese and yellow sauce that was way too runny. \n\nThe water had a weird aftertaste\n\nThe service is extremely slow , And to top it off, they had the audacity to give themselves an automatic  18%  tip for a group more then 4ppl which turned out to be $20 for the poor service \n\nI can say with 100% certainty I will not be returning or reccomending this place to anyone.
