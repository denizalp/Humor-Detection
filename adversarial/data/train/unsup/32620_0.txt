Awful experience and a waste of time. I really wish I had read reviews before booking this reservation. I ended up here after taking my car in for a repair. I only needed a rental for the day as I had work, errands, etc. is just a hassle to be without a vehicle. Booked reservation on Hotwire for some reason I usually just go to Enterprise. Lesson learned! Apparently this place caters to dirtbags that steal cars so even though I have credit card( which they wanted to put a $400 hold on) and an insurance policy that would actually cover the entire price of a Nissan Altima if I were to disappear in lol...I drive a much nicer vehicle just saying. They would not rent me a car after waiting in a dimly lit and dirty back room for 40 minutes. I guess because I'm a local I have to present a utility bill to prove my address?..I'm so confused. I have a valid NV driving license, credit card with matching address and insurance with matching address that again would cover $100,000 in loss..WTF.
