I noticed Sharetea opened at the First Markham Plaza and I believe they took over the old bbt spot.I was super excited to try since I heard good things from the Yonge St location. I still have yet tried that location though.\n\nI came on a Friday night, and I feel like they probably just opened pretty recently. The place is quite spacious with limited tables and chairs. I would say they are looking for people to just take away unless they are looking to add more seats. The decor is simple but they have a very colourful wall and their beverage selection menu is also very colourful. They a wide range of drinks....milk teas, green\/black teas, the foam tea (which they call 'Creama') and etc.\n I like how their label on their bbt really reflects Taipei- I had a Taipei 101 label...brings me back to the good times in TW :)\n\nI ordered their brown rice milk tea with tapioca- which was pretty good. I am not a fan of the regular sized bubbles to be honest...but it is really not bad here. Also, note that I did want their mini tapiocas but unfortunately they said they did not have it. There is always next time!\nMy friend got the winter melon creama, which she really enjoyed as she is a milk foam tea connoisseur.\nI would like to see in the future, the drinks that they feature or popular though cause essentially it is my first time at Sharetea. Not a big deal, but it would be a nice thing to have.\n\nIf you are in the area or looking for a drink after dinner, do try this place out- another good alternative
