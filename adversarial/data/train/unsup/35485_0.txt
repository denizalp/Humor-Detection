My dad is from India and until now, I haven't been able to find a place in Tempe that could stand next to his cooking. Even though he'd never want me to admit it, Delhi Palace is just as good! The Aloo Gobi was AMAZING and the Chicken Tikka Masala was great (though I probably could have handled a bit more spice). Definitely get the garlic naan, as no meal is really complete without it. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars would have to be the price. I've heard they do have a great deal on their lunch buffet, so I'll be back again soon to give it a try!
