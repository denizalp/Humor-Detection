Damn. Not sure why the hate, the food was delish. Serious Delish.\n\nThe service was also spot on, even though we were Grouponers, we were treated like high rollers, our server not only was professional, she was cute as a button with sexy southern style and a flirty fun attitude: perfect accent to the upscale decor and high falootin food.\n\nI got the Beef Tartare, not something I do most places but it was well recommended and boy, were they right. \n\nFor an entree, I had the brick roasted chicken with duck fat fried potatoes and yes, that was as drool worthy as it sounds, the chicken was perfect, the potatoes managed a level of decadence not normally obtainable by lowly tubers. My guy ordered the  Bouillabaisse and it was as impressive as you'd expect as a star of the menu.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't remember the dessert, but not because it wasn't memorable, I'm sure it was delicious.  But, after all the good wine, amazing food and stellar service, I think I was just blissed out and anything else was just more of the same.
