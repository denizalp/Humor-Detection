Want some head in your taco? Come to Three Amigos. \n\nTaco meat options include head (cabeza), al pastor (Pork), shredded beef, tongue (lengua) and chicken, maybe carne asada too? The tacos also come wrapped in two, not one, but twoooooo corn tortillas! \n\nRice is just like I remember, and refried beans are not just refried beans. They're awesome when they're made right! The enchiladas are pretty solid and they call their rolled tacos dorados. Sometimes they're known as flautas. Tomato, tomahtoe; potato potahtoe, whatever, who cares!  I don't know the technical difference, all I know is that they're good!\n\nThey're even open late on weekends - like a real taco shop should be!  This place is the truth and this Southern California boy hereby grants his stamp of approval! Eat here now!
