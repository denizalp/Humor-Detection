I friend recommended this place and since I travel to Vegas at least 2 or 3 times a year, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did.  I thought the food was great. I've had the chicken parmesan and on another visit, spaghetti with red sauce.  Both dishes were great, and the portions were HUGE.  Even better was the free wine they kept bringing (it's all you can drink, and it's a house red or white served in a carafe). \n\nThe place reminds you of gangster hangouts you've seen in the movies.  It's dark inside, no windows (reducing the chance of driveby's), with lot's of nooks and crannies (small rooms, and even smaller rooms). One great advantage to their location is their proximity to the hotels on the strip, but your not on the strip.
