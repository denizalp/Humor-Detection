Searching Nearby Me on Yelp landed me here.  I was here on a Saturday night after running the RNR LV 5K.  The place is hidden at night.  It is located on a shady looking street near an overpass.  Get your GPS ready or you will miss it.  The parking is pretty small so you may not be able to find parking but there is also street parking.  There are tables outside in the patio but there are a number of tables inside as well.  You order by lining up on the right and then grabbing a table where the servers will bring you the platters of food.\n\nFor the five of us, we got the The Pit Special and the Ribs Platter.  It was more than enough food for us.  The best items in the meals were the sides.  The meats themselves were a bit dry (mainly the ribs) so I focused my eyes on the sides.  Of all the sides, I enjoyed the mac and cheese and the corn nuggets.  A must get when you are there.  Of the meats, even though most were dry, I liked the brisket and the baby-back ribs.  There were a couple types of sauces near the drink counter (honey mustard and a vinegar sauce).  Also on the table was a barbeque-like sauce.  But even with the sauces, the meats were still dry...  Such a bummer but I would still give this place another try.  I noticed the table next to us ordering a huge burger that was stacked like 6 inches high.  Crazy fatty goodness I bet and I wish because that is what I'm going to be grabbing when I come again.
