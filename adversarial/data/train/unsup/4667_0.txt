This place is creepy, and smells of \"old woman,\" no offence to the old women out there, who may also be yelpers...\n\nAh, I'm guessing by the sludge that this place has never been cleaned, so like since it was built. I mean grime and splatter, but being located in an industrial area doesn't help.\n\nIt has character, oh loads of character, and if the food was amazing, I may be able to forgive the sketchiness, but here goes:\n\nOur toast came out 5 minutes before the rest of our brekky, my eggs were overcooked, the hash browns were weird in a way I couldn't put my finger on, and the bacon tasted as if it was cooked last week. When I went to take a sip of my water, I nearly gagged, as the glass and\/or water tasted like \"old lady.\" Again, no offence.\n\nIt was a place I had read about, and was looking forward to seeing for myself, but I will never, ever go back. However, if there was some weird awesome reality show that took place in this restaurant, I would probably watch it and become seriously addicted to it, for no good reason other than it was creepy and gross.
