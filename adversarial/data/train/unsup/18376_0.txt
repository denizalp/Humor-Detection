I went to Merle Norman for a bikini wax after my sister suggested I try it out (er...Merle Norman, not a bikini wax).  It was my first time, so I was definitely looking for recommendations!  When I called to book the appointment, the person on the phone was a bit abrupt, but seemed to know her stuff when I asked a couple of questions.\n\nThe location itself is very clean, and everyone seems to be very professional.  My esthetician was very nice and friendly, and quite efficient - after all was said and done, I think I was in and out in 10 minutes (it was just a basic bikini wax).  Overall, my experience was fine, except for a few things:\n\n- I told the esthetician (who I believe was Fran) that it was my first time, so any extra info would be great.  She didn't explain anything that she was doing, and didn't give me post-waxing skin care tips, which would have been great for this waxing newbie.\n\n- The esthetician didn't wear gloves, I thought that was something people did?  They do have a handwashing station though, and I watched her wash her hands before she got started.\n\n- Despite having done this for 10 years, the esthetician didn't use the same kind of technique I expected from reading up on bikini waxes (e.g. adding pressure to the area after pulling off the wax strip to reduce the stinging).  Yes, bikini waxes hurt (I said damn!), but a little help to take away the sting would have been super.\n\nOverall, it was fine, and the price was right - $15 + tax and tip.  And I'll probably end up going back, because I don't have any other recommendations for local places.  But, considering it was my first time, I was sorta hoping for a little more.
