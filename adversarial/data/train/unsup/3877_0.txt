I decided to try this new eyebrow threading spot out. I always get nervous about waxing or threading at a new place. My brows are already pretty thin... one wrong move and the whole thing could be gone! However the girl who did my brows listened to what I wanted and only \"cleaned 'em up\". They look great! \nI used the Yelp check in offer. They didn't know it was on here but they happily obliged. Nice ladies. I will be back.
