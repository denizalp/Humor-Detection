This is a busy establishment and they serve quality drinks at a reasonable price. They are quick to greet you upon entering and thank you as you are leaving. Free WiFi and a very upbeat atmosphere. Every employee that i have encountered has been friendly and outgoing. My most favorite employee is Manami- what a great addition to the staff here.
