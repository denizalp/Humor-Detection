I know there are a lot of Ikea haters.  And I'm super sorry, but I just LOVE Ikea.  And I realize that there are TONS of other places to buy better\/more stylish\/cuter furniture, but you know what?  I still love Ikea, and I'm not ashamed. And the \"crappy\" little desk I got for my apartment my sophomore year of college is STILL being put to good use in my house, so neener neener.\n\n When we go to Ikea, it's an EVENT.  We mosey on through, dream-building our perfect house, room by room.  Shopping at Ikea is an experience and not just a \"go here, find something, get out\" type of joint.  Hubby and I have re-decorated our house a thousand times in our mind, and each time we go there we get great ideas for our forever home.  It's just so much fun!  I love looking through the marketplace and finding really cool, really inexpensive gadgets and goodies. \n\nAnd the cafeteria is always the bomb!  Swedish meatballs, mmmmmmmmmmmm.  If you become a member of the Ikea Family, you get free tea or coffee every time you go, and special offers on different merchandise every month (it's free to sign up!).\n\nI love Ikea.  I love it.  It's my favorite.  Don't be a hater.
