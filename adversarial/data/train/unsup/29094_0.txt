I rode in from Los Angeles and needed a bubble shield badly for my ride back. I stopped by the dealership before baker and they didn't have it but wasn't worried because I was staying on Fremont and figured that this HD store had gear. Wrong - its just a retail shop for tourists. Should have called ahead. Heading to the red rock dealership now.
