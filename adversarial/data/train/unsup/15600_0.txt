Very disappointing....the bellman said this place was good....\"everything you want for $10\"...ok...sounds ok....we headed down there and they had a $9.99 breakfast....2 pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon and toast....no coffee......Coffee was an additional $4.50!  Whaaat?  How can you serve breakfast without coffee!!!\nWe ordered the breakfast and as soon as it came, this big bird swooped in and picked up my husband's pancakes!...Yuuuk!  it dropped the pancakes on the table, but we surely weren't gonna eat that!  Flagged down a waiter and they replaced his meal.\nMy meal was untouched by the bird, but I noticed that the bacon was burnt (I did order it crispy) and it looked like they just burnt it....the tomato slice on the plate for garnish was over ripe....all in all...not impressed at at....
