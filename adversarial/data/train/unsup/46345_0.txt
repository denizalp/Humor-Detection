After a denial from extended warranty company I took my car in for a couple minor interior items. 1 was steering wheel chrome was lifting and sharp edges were cutting my hands during turns. 2 my driver seat suddenly started unraveling at the seam under my bum. Aurel, the Service Manager was fantastic and so helpfully understanding. He took care of it. The entire staff was so accommodating and made me feel like royalty. The customer service here is On Point! From the receptionist to the barista at coffee shop in waiting area with free snacks and reduced pricing on purchase items. My mind was blown away.You don't get service like this anymore.\nMy car is back in tip top shape! Thanks to the service crew!
