Closest all you can eat sushi, I'd come here. Affordable, fish is good, I stopped getting the deep fried butterfly cheese because there's basically was no cheese in the oily deep fried wonton wrapper. Love the sushi, the handrolls, the maki, sometimes the teriyaki beef is overcooked, but I always look forward to the deep fried banana with my red bean ice cream. The interior is absolutely cute with the origami cranes, it's clean and doesn't feel claustrophobic. All time best in Brampton for me.
