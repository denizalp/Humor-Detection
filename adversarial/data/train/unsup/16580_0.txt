There's a whole lotta love up in here! \n\nI found it easiest to park in the 3rd Downtown Garage off Ogden.  If you know where the heart attack restaurant is then you know where this little gem is hiding. ;) \n\nI had a blast and the drink specials were FAB on Sunday night! Best service all night from the wonderful cocktail waitress that hosted our group to the fabulous bitches behind the bar! These girls really know how to put on a show! Loved the mini performances that they did impromptu up on the booth ledges.  We were even given a nice comp for a complete lane all night since the score wasn't working.  \n\nI have to say that I'd come back in a heartbeat! Love the mega dance floor and the House DJ was really cranking out some beauty beats! Just a great place to lounge w\/ plush leather chairs and even a billiards room w\/ tables and seats.  This is a great little place!
