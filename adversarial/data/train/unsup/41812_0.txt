Stayed for a night and experienced a very clean room. I had a very undesirable experience at the restaurant, Fireside Grill & because it was challenging to reach the owner of the restaurant, Phil, Gary the owner of the hotel applied a heavy discount to my room for a future stay. The rooms are simple, but good for the price. If I had recommendations, I would recommend that they add some simple, fresh colors to the lobby to make it more inviting and warm. I've helped businesses transform their spaces and feel they could benefit from simple changes. In addition, it is unfortunate that the restaurant isn't doing well and it's a poor reflection on the hotel. However, Gary, the owner of the hotel, was very accommodating . The location is nice and In the heart of Fountain Hills. I would stay there again. I would not eat there again. The staff at the hotel were friendly, efficient and professional. I enjoyed my stay directly with the hotel.
