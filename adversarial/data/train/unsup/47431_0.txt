What a little gem!  \n\nWe ordered takeout (for 13) one night while visiting family in Stow.  I admit that based on nothing but stereotype (with possibly a hint of Boulder foody snobbishness), I wasn't expecting a combo Thai\/Chinese restaurant in little old Stow to wow me.  I'm hear to tell you just how wrong I was.\n\nCoconut soup?  Delicate, well spiced with the right amount of sweet.\n\nPanang Curry?  Just the right twang in my mouth.  It could have been a bit spicier, but I have only myself to blame for that (having been burned once too often with even MILD dishes, I tend to be pretty cautious...)  AND I loved that they made this with tofu even though that wasn't an option on the menu.\n\nThai Dumplings?  Positively addictive.  I added a good solid half inch to my waistline with these...\n\nPad Sew?  Way to go Thai Gourmet!\n\nAnd to top it all off, there wasn't one error in our order full of special requests.  And it was ready on time.  And hot.\n\nIf you are a Stow-area local, don't hesitate to try out this great little Thai\/Chinese joint!
