Cafe Rio is part of our regular lunch rotation at my work.  My boss loves the barbacoa, though I personally find it too sweet.  I prefer the grilled chicken or steak, tamales, and the quesadillas.  We often order as a  large group and I LOVE the online ordering system - it allows for a ton of customization and is very easy to navigate.  They are very good at getting our orders right, too.  Their organizational efforts in catering to the work-lunch crowd has earned them a fifth star from me.\n\nThe salsas are all very good, I love the hot red sauce and the medium green tomatillo, and the pico de gallo is outstanding.  Everything is fresh and made to order and the portions are generous.  I've never had a bad meal here and even though the menu is small, there is enough variety to please pretty much everyone.  Service is quick and friendly and they look like they're having a good time behind the counter.... \"EXTRA MEAT!!\" - my goofy boss loves making them do that!
