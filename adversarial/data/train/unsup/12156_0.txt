Before going to Surrender this is what I heard: small version of XS, no dance floor, uncool, go to XS instead, etc...\n\nAfter going to Surrender I was pleasantly surprised!  I really liked the outdoor portion.  Mr. Wynn does know how to make some amazing outdoor spaces for sure.  I had wanted to check this place out for a while and it took me a few months to finally visit.  I had been to XS and Tryst and Surrender doesn't fall too short of either at all!  I had a great time and we had no problems getting in.  One of my friends contacted a promoter who got our entire group of half girls and and guys in for free.  Unheard of!  The music was a great mix of electronic\/house\/hip-hop.  There were cool lasers too :)\n\nI usually feel like people at XS are trying to hard or are mad drama queens.  (I still love XS though ha!)  Here at Surrender it was great music, no problems, and just plain fun.  I did take quite a few shots of Henny before I left for the club but that is beside the point.  Just make sure not to get kicked out like my friends did.  They somehow got back in though!  \n\nCrazy night.  Fun times.  No stress.\n\nBtw: Water costs $8 a bottle.  It is a mini bottle of Figi water too.  After finishing the sip of water in a minute, my friend then refilled the bottles about 5 times for us while we were dancing on the dance floor.  Water fountains by the bathrooms... if you don't wanna waste your money on fancy water.
