Risking my life, wallet and personal safety I dash across a busy street, around homeless people and past gangsters to get to this store.\n\n It's not that I love circle K, and its not that this one is great as circle Ks go the secret is the location. My office sits in the middle of an urban wasteland with little near by aside from this lone circle K. \n\nOn my visit today like many other visits I went for the fountain drink special. Any size $.89. I naturally go with the largest 44oz Styrofoam cup. I am pleased that there is diet caffeine free coke as that is a rare option.\n\n In addition to a decent fountain selection there are flavor and supplement shots that can be added. I skip the flavor shots as they probably have sugar and load on on B12, ecanacia, vitamin C and Ginkobiloba. There also is an caffeine and gurarna shot option but adding that to caffeine free coke seems a bit silly.\n\n There is the usual selection of junk food and beer, and a copious amount of legal stimulants at the counter for those too lazy to visit the numerous drug dealers near by. \n\nIf for some odd reason you wanted a DVD there is a red box out front.\n\nThis is not the cleanest or nicest convince store by far, but it is here.
