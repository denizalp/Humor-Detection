I went to the food truck event at Top Shelf Wine and Spirits a while back and found a bunch of trucks I had never heard of. Islandtucky looked to be the most promising and it didn't disappoint. I like that they use chicken thighs in their garlic chicken plate ($8.95). The juicy dark meat is the way to go to get the most flavorful chicken. The breading on the meat was good, but not as crispy as I'd prefer, while the sauce added a touch of sweetness to add depth to the flavors.
