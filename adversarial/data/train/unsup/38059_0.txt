My daughter and I went to Asian Noodle and Sushi based on her checking out a Google rating for the place. She ordered Fujian rice noodles without the shrimp (they accommodated her due to food allergy). I ordered the spicy braised meat and vegetables over rice--it was delicious. The meat options are beef, chicken, pork, and beef tendon (there may have been more options). I had the beef tendon which are actually kind of meaty, sliced up thinly. The pickled vegetables are paired with sauteed yu choy greens and topped with a boiled egg split in half which was tasty and complemented the overall flavor well. It was not overly spicy. My daughter liked her dish as well. Our server did right by us and we appreciated her helpfulness with the menu items. The sushi rolls were fine--we ordered two 8-pc portions, one spicy tuna, the other salmon. The only minor knock is that its interior has more of a lunch place feel rather than a place where you go to have a nice sit-down meal. I generally prefer warm interior light to fluorescent but if you can get past this and focus on the food, you might enjoy the value of a decent meal at a reasonable price (they gave me a large enough portion of which I took home leftovers). FYI this is on Cedar St. in Champaign, not Urbana, the former location of Yellow Fin, which sadly I never got to try.
