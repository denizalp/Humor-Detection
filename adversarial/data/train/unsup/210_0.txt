Ruined Armin.\n\nI paid to see the DJ, not the bouncer's hand.\n\nThe owner has no respect for the music and oversells his club for the money. Don't think your ticket gets you a view of the DJ, the dance floor is blocked by power tripping bouncers who also go through the crowd with flashlights and start fights. \n\nDon't waste your money trying to see a show here. The dayclub is alright.
