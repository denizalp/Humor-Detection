I made a reservation for the new Beer Park for late night for my 40th birthday thinking \"ooh fun, we will get to watch the Bellagio fountains and drink beer and have fun\". I was wrong.\n\nPluses: Not many. Smaller selection of beer than expected. Great ceramic red solo cups and plates. Good soft pretzels. \n\nMinuses: Beer selection is mainly dark or Amber beers. Super hot up on the roof even at night. The cool air Misters blow right up into the air. Totally useless. The view of the Bellagio fountains? Non existent through shrubbery. Waitstaff was less than pleasant. \n\nAll in all, save your money. Drink for free in the casino.
