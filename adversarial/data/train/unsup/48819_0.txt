I have to admit I liked Garcia's pizza.  Its not fancy or glamorous, but you can buy it by the slice and that makes a difference for lunch sometimes.  This place was never busy, so I did whatever I did that past for studing sometimes here.  The interior was nice and roomie and had and interesting set of furniture.  The crust was cruncy (not crisp on the bottom and doughy, really unique actually.  So unique in fact, occassionally I would get a specific craving, which is always a good sign.  The sauce was very tomato-y.  Good pizza, by the slice.  Cheap.  I can't argue.  I'd give it a 3.5 but must round down.
