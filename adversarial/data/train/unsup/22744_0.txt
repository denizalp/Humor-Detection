This gym is a joke. They do not approve of workout partners I haven't been to a gym in years so I decided to join and get in shape. Since Its been so long, the last thing I want to do is work out alone so for six weeks me, my fianc√©, and nephew all went and worked out together.  We all live together and drive together. But one day the sad excuse of a manager, Amanda came and accused us of...someone training someone, we assured her that wasn't the case. We were just a family all going to the gym together. So the next day when we came in together we were asked to get our stuff and leave. Ive never been so embarrassed and unwelcome at a gym in my life. Shame on you Southside la fitness. Get over yourself!
