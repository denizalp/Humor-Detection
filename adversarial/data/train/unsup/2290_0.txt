Really, Caffe Boa, you know better. You know better than letting me stand outside for 15 minutes waiting for your hostess, while you are less than 1\/4 full for brunch. You know better than charging me $14.00 for an eggs benedict that comes with nothing more than 2 eggs on an english muffin.\n I'm here for the organic, sustainable, impeccable food and I can afford it, but where is it? \n\n You know better than giving me a server that knows nothing about your product. Yes, I do want to know if your meat is local, organic, sustainable. I'm paying $14 a head for beakfast, so bring on the knowledge. I'm eating here because you say you serve an organic sustainable product, show me you do. Also, you know better than giving me a server who looks like they just rolled out of bed in their grubby, stained black pullover. I appreciate the attempt at a black uniform but make it clean next time as well.  Finally, if I order two glasses of sparking, don't charge me $18 for the all the can drink, when charging me $8 a glass would have been cheaper. Seriously, is this any better than panhandling? \n\nSo, where the hell is the Caffe Boa of dinner fame. The food, the knowledge, the attempt to prove to me that what I was paying for was worth it. Where is that Caffe Boa? Because it sure didn't show up for brunch today.
