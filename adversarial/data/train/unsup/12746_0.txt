CF shops (called Shops at Don Mills before Cadillac Fairview bought it) is an outdoor type market, perfect for the summer time. I'm not sure how I feel about this place in the winter, I know they have a few events that run, but the few times I tried to come to these events, I still thought it was too cold and not worth my time.\n\nCF has branded this mall though, and included the iconic deer during Christmas time this past year as a part of the branding. \n\nThe shops here are all on the higher end, and gives you a bit of the American vybe (but the States definitely has much better weather than us). To give credit to this mall, these shops are fairly unique to this mall, and there's a lovely parking lot in the back with adequate parking.\n\nDuring the summer, I think this mall is lovely and I definitely come once a year to enjoy the middle open space and grab an ice cream to shop around.
