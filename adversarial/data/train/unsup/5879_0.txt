HURRY. GET OVER TO THIS PLACE! AN ARCHITECTURAL  CELEBRATION OF THE CIRCLE AND A WONDERFUL MINGLING OF AMERICAN CUISINE WITH MEDITERRANEAN STYLE. Great value in the Summer Prix Fix at $30 pp++.\n\nTHE INTRODUCTION\n--hidden from the street (you have to know you're going there), its entrance is a grand circular plaza swathed with inlaid stone and a fantastic layered fountain...\n--perfect turning radius for a 15-passenger limousine;\n--entryway fit for royalty is framed with columns and features two gigantic entry doors in case you arrived in a servant-borne carriage;\n--once inside the atrium, the swank really kicks in...\n--across another cavernous circular space, the host podium awaits you afront a fabulous white bead curtain;\n--off left is the bar with plush paisley-shaped seating (the yin-and-yang being the best way to split a circle);\n--lighting and furniture design is a wonderful fusion of 50's and contemporary.\n\nBUT THE BEST PART: THE CUISINE\n--great martini preparation; all it needs is a glassware upgrade...\n--speaking of, server coyly replaced ours when he noticed it was spotty -- kudos, man!\n--fabulous Sacred Stone cab had someone Googling for the winery's contact info.\n--fried calamari over cantaloupe butter, garnished with cantaloupe caviar.\n--pan roasted free-range chicken breast is soft pillowy perfection\n--salmon was a bit firm for my taste, but the orzo was excellent\n--aged prime rib eye with fingerling potato pancetta hash just the right blend of flavors, a tasty reduction accompanies and ascended several levels of heaven with the Sacred Stone.\n\nBUT...\n--dessert was a disappointment. creme brulee was uninspired and the \"freshly baked cookies\" were far from. No fruit anywhere.\n\nOpened at the beginning of the Arizona summer (test-your-resolve-and-your-bank-account-balance season for restaurants). Maybe they wanted several months to prepare for season. The garage-doored wall will open to some fun outdoor seating once it cools down.\n\nI really hope this one survives. Make your reservation today!
