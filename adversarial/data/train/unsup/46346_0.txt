The first couple of years I lived at Montego Bay I was very happy. I felt the rent was reasonable for what I got. Then they changed management and everything changed. Rents went up incredibly each year, utilities got higher and higher, fees were being charged for ridiculous things like trash pick up at your door whether you used it or not. It seems like every time you turned around there was an extra fee for some stupid thing or another. I do have to say that for the most part maintenance was handled on a pretty regular basis. The maintenance crew were polite and did the work as best they could. As for the management staff... In the beginning I thought they were great. But after Pinnacle management took over, I got the feeling that everyone hated their job and were always in a bad mood. Overall the last year of my living at Montego Bay was pretty much a bad experience! It seems that things are less safe than they were a few years ago as well. I wouldn't recommend renting there.
