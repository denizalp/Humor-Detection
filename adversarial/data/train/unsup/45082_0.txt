Cool space. I really liked their patio, and the indoor decor was also gorgeous. \n\nI didn't get any of the food, but their cocktails were all delicious. I felt like the prices could have been a little lower for the basic cocktails (like the Tom Collins). We ordered one drink (augh I forget what it was) that was good, but a little soapy-- and the presentation was gross because the chalky white liquid got all stuck along the sides of the glass as you drank. Not exactly appetizing. My favorite drink was the campari and pamplemousse. Worth a return trip.
