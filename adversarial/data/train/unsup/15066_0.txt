Not going to lie, if you are expecting service from this restaurant you're going to be really disappointed. Dinner service usually have 2 servers, and you literally have to hunt them down for order and water. Other than that, I have to say this is honestly one of the best Chinese restaurant in Calgary. This is coming from an immigrant from Hong Kong by the way. That's worth something right? (lol) \n\nAnyway, back to the review. They make old school Canton style cuisine, and their food is always fresh and never over cooked. They are super famous for their salt n pepper squid, so I am not going to go into that. If you love seafood and cream sauce, I beg you to give the lobster in cream sauce a shot. The way they make their cream sauce is just heaven...I am not joking or exaggerating when I say that my Italian fiance will take the left overs from the dish and turn it into lobster alfredo linguine. It is that good. Another favourite of mine is their deep fried chicken. The chicken is NEVER dry, breast always moist and skin crispy, simply perfection. Favourite part is probably the little saucer plate with the spiced salt in it, oh and the prawn crackers. (Very authentic) \n\nWhy only 4 stars after such a good review of their food? 2 reasons. One I already talked about, the service. The other is because the restaurant itself is not friendly for people with disabilities, and their stairs are freaking steep! All in all, this is a really good place for good Chinese food.
