Pretty meh.\n\nI came here early on a Saturday morning to get my inspection for NC registration and it passed all the tests except for the tinting.  What kind of racket does NC have going?  Last year, I went to the same place and my car passed inspection just fine.  Nothing's changed, but now, the tinting on my windows failed.  It's not that dark.  It's not like anyone can get away with drugs or sex without being seen - not that I've tried.  So now, I'm in the unenviable position of having to get my window tinting removed.  What a pain. \n\nOther than failing, I like Jiffy Lube because they do the inspection and oil change pretty quick.  They got to working on it right away (there was no wait), and they changed the oil, ran the inspection, vacuumed the inside, and other little things.  The people working there looked like dudes I wouldn't want to run into in the alley, but appearance aside, they did a great job of explaining and were pretty nice.  Any other setting outside of Jiffy Lube, they would've cleaned my clock.  \n\nI'll keep coming here because they do a fine job.  They also do it quick.  And it's affordable. \n\ndmo out (or am i really out? can you see through the tinting? smh)
