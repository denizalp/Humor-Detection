Another Green's and Proteins!\n\nI usually get a grilled veggie wrap and tofu fries. Actually I try to try something different each time I visit a location. \n\nGot a berry smoothie today and can say that this location put out the same quality as the other two locations I have been to.\n\nG&P's favors opening locations by LVAC's and this is no exception. Right at N. Decatur and Rice.\n\nAnyway I'm usually not in this area but ran an errand this morning and popped in for a custom smoothie and am happy the quality is staying consistent.\n\nThese places are not Go Raw but they always put out a fast and healthy choice when needed :)\n\nHappy to see another location and good luck!
