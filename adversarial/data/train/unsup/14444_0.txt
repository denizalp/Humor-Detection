Our server pissed me off.  I ordered a salty dog (greyhound with a salt rim).  It came without a salt rim, just as a regular greyhound, and the bill was $16 and had it charged as a Moscow mule. We asked to have it changed on the bill, since I ended up with a plain grapefruit and vodka which was only $10 on the menu.  Rather than settling for the lower charge, she argues with us, talks smack about the bartender and blames the screw-up entirely on him, snatches my drink off the table and brings me back a salty dog with the most sparse salt rim I've ever seen (it literally only went halfway around) and still charges us $16. That's $6 for a few, barely-there crystals of salt, for anyone paying attention! \n\nAs for the food, it was definitely on the creative side for buffet food, but, unfortunately, still had the undersalted-sitting-in-a-steam-tray-for-hours buffet quality.  The mashed potatoes were good, I'll give 'em that. A couple of the pastas were serviceable.  Everything else was exactly what you'd expect.  And a lot of the items come in individual tiny little ramekins that take up your entire plate, so you have to go back for seconds many more times than you usually would.  Not sure if this is a tactic to get people to eat less for their money or not.  Hmmmm.  \n\nOverall, pretty disappointing.  You think you're paying more for unique menu offerings and implied higher quality, but it's all the same buffet rubbish.
