Met my friends here before the Cardinals vs Dbacks game.  Right next door to La Piazza PHX, right on 1st St.  Got a meter right in front ($1.25 per hour).  My friends were already there and grabbed a booth, so I met them inside.  Cool little place!\n\nI'm cutting carbs, so I went with an order of their wings.  Normally, $11.00, but it was Happy Hour, so they were only $7.00.  Score!  About 10 decent sized wings.  I ordered them \"extra crispy\", and while crisp, I would have preferred another minute or so in the fryer.  Sauce was good, ranch was good, celery sticks were good.  For $7.00, it was a deal!  My friends ordered some mussels and the fish and chips.  It looked tasty, and they seemed to like it.\n\nService was on point!  There wasn't a minute that went by without someone checking on you or refilling your waters and what have you.  I was impressed.  Only bad thing I can say about the place is that the floor was SUPER slippery.  I headed back to the restroom, and almost slipped twice.  Walk SLOWLY!\n\nVibe was cool, menu looked great (when my diet is over, I would definitely like to check out some of their food), and the price was very good for happy hour.  I could definitely see myself coming back here before a game.
