I was a little skeptical of this place when I walked up to this place on a Friday evening and it was nearly empty. I was even more surprised to see such good reviews here.\n\nI ordered a bento box and my food was alright. However, my teriyaki was barely warm and the tempura seemed like it had been sitting around for a while. My dining companion was quite disappointed with the soup he ordered, frequently lamenting his suggestion of trying this place.\n\nAll in all, the experience was passable. But in a neighbourhood like The Annex with so many options for sushi, do yourself a favour and go somewhere else.
