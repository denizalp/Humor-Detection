When in Vegas, you don't think of dining at a ramen place... But after eating a large buffet lunch, ramen or something light doesn't sound so bad!!\n\nThe ramen was fresh and soup was pretty good. I got the one with the heavy garlic oil (can't remember the name). My only gripe was that the pork slice was only a single slice. It was prepared very well and delicious. \n\nThey offer small and large size rice bowls. My fianc√© got the small char siu bowl with shredded egg. It was a simple dish and it's not the typical char siu you normally get at a Chinese restaurant, it's a subtle stewed pork. \n\nThe atmosphere is your typical Japanese ramen or izakaya joint (everything is wood and there is sushi bar seating).  \n\nOverall their service is friendly and their prices are affordable. They even have a stamp card, but four ramen bowls and get a free appetizer!!\n\n3.5 stars\n\nYelp 100 Challenge - 36 of 100
