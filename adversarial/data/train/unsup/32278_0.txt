I started looking into electrolysis a little over a year ago. During my research I came across the American electrology association website and elected one person that happens to own Sena Pelo Medspa. I had my initial consultation with Stephanie who was extremely knowledgeable and seemed passion about electrolysis. This encounter stood out! after trying  different options for facial hair removal without success, I decided to move forward with the electrolysis procedure. For my first appointment I scheduled a 15min procedure. The technician barely explained what was she was doing and neglected to inform me that this procedure is painful. I was called back 6min late for my appt time yet she stopped the procedure at the scheduled end time.  I didn't mind initially because this procedure is quit painful. Attempting to remain optimistic I scheduled another appt for a 1 hour treatment 2weeks late with a nurse so that I could receive a lidocaine injection. Again I was called back late 7mins, the machines wasn't cooperating, and the time it took to do the injection took up about 15min of my treatment time; yet treatment ended at the scheduled time. this is a costly procedure and every minute  counts literally! I must say that I very disappointed with the service I received which is unfortunate because I thought that I was headed in the right direction for permanent removal of my facial hair.
