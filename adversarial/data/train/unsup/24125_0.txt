Pic Nic has the opportunity to be a great spot, but they are not delivering on a few fronts. \n\nFirstly, the decor is awful. It looks as if someone went crazy at IKEA to select the furnishings. Guys - your competition in this neighbourhood is steep, you need to invest in proper furniture and lighting. Give up all the candles, it doesn't work when the chairs are hard as rocks and look bargain basement. Don't pour water using plastic jugs, this isn't lunch hour at the local junior high school.\n\nSecondly, the service needs a shake-up. The gals working that evening sauntered around and acted as if they were doing you a favour to serve you. Save the attitude for when you're out at the bar on your own time, not when I'm paying over $100 to be there. \n\nThirdly, the food. Bottom line, don't bother with food because you're clearly phoning it in. Focus your time and attention on good wine (which was decent) and some charcuterie \/ cheeses. Your menu simply isn't accurate and the quality is awful. Again your competition is blowing you away here.\n\nI like the concept of a wine bar that focuses on good wine, good service and good atmosphere. Integrate your name and brand into those three things and do it well, then I'll return.
