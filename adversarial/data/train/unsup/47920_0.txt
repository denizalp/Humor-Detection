I got the chicken Katsu tonight and it was horrible the rice when I opened it looked half eaten and also found a hair in it and it was cold. Maybe they didn't like me and gave me someone's left overs. It came with 2 thin chicken cutlets, 1 was good the other awful. Chicken had weird texture when biting into it like... Rubbery carrot... Not impressed did not eat even 1\/3 of my meal. $15.58 a bit pricey especially for rice from a trash bin & mutant, freezer burned expired chicken. \n\nHungry buyer beware, maybe disappointed.
