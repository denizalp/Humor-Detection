Every year I am in charge of bringing dessert from a local spot for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Last year we did an ice cream pie from Sweet Republic and that was good. \n\nBut this year was different...\n\nThis year we sorta flipped out when we tasted our creme brulees. We ordered a few pumpkin and then got a ton of different flavors so we could try them all. \n\nWe sat in a circle and just passed them around going to town. They were all amazing. The winners though, were the classic vanilla and chocolate. As in, the kids were licking the containers. We didn't even think the kids would like them but they couldn't get enough. \n\nWe loved it so much we are even doing it twice- Christmas here we come! \n\nI had the order delivered to my work, it came wrapped in a bow with an adorable re-usable container full of raw sugar for flaming. We used the broiler because our torch was out of gas and it turned out wonderful. I did a test on one of the brulees to get the hang of it. Prep time was about 15 minutes to do all 12 brulees. it was amazing. \n\nJulia is such a pleasure to work with as well. She is always quick to respond to e-mails and was right on time!
