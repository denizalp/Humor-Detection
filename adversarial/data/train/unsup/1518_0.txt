Ahhh, Spring is coming. it's getting warmer outside and I NEED A CHILI DOG!!\n\nSeriously, This is the best chili dogs you will ever have. I dare you to find better. (It's not possible so don't waist your time trying).\n\nAll my previous reviews still stand for Vic and his love of the chili dog.\n\nWhy are you still reading this... Get up, Get out and get one. \n\nThough you will be probably standing behind me.
