I had just a few requests while visiting Montreal and bagels was at the top of the list. On Sunday morning I dragged my gluten free traveling companion Crystal H to Fairmount  so I could get a bagel before leaving this lovely city.\n\nCrystal was a good sport and stood in line with me even though she couldn't indulge in a bagel herself. Fortunately the line moved pretty fast and minutes later I was sitting outside on a bench enjoying not 1, but 2 warm sesame bagels. Mmmm. I enjoyed them the good old fashioned Montreal way- dipping them in a tiny tub of Philadelphia cream cheese. \n\nThey were so good that I contemplated bringing some home for the family, but realized I'd probably just eat the entire bag on the plane.  I'll just have to take the fam back to Montreal with me soon we can enjoy some more good bagels.
