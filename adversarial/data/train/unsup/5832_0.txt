This place is amazing!  This would be the perfect date spot- intimate and romantic- but, instead, I came with my friend. Oh well.  We still had a great time.  We came hungry, and left stuffed and oh so happy!\n\nSweet O Wine and Chocolate Lounge is family owned and operated, and it's the best place I've been in awhile.  The food is really good, and they don't just have desserts!  They have a list of tasty panini's on the menu, and I got the olive and mozzarella one, while my friend opted for the roasted vegetable.  Both were delicious.  They come with a nice little green salad too.\n\nWe had a nice red wine with our dinner too- although I can't remember the name of it.  Choosing what to have for dessert was soooo hard though.  They have chocolates, truffles, caramels, cakes and all sorts of tempting pastries.  This place is what dreams are made of! \n\nOh wait! I forgot- they also have dessert panini's that looked amazing too.  We chose to get the assorted mini pastries.  They were like tiny bits of heaven in our mouths!  They also have assorted mini petit fours and fondues.  Mark my words- I will be back!!
