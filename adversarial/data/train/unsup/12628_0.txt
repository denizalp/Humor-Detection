If you're looking for the only place to spend more than $300 for dinner, come here. I promise, you won't be disappointed! \n\nSW Steakhouse is a very classy and swanky restaurant. Here's the scoop on why I award them a 4.0 GPA:\n\n+ Seating was very quick, but I recommend making a reservation because this place is uber popular. \n+ The servers were right on key with EVERYTHING. You definitely get what you pay for. The management here really keep the ambiance and experience top notch with every aspect of the meal. For example, my ice tea (not a big drinker obviously) was always filled. My colleague's 1\/2 bottle of wine was poured perfectly\n+ All the food came out in a timely manner! Very important especially when there's multiple guests in your party. \n+ Our servers were very professional, but funny. Their humor felt real and I felt a good connection with them. \n+ The food was absolutely excellent: veal (scrumptious and tender with the bone in...) Thanks to SW, I've found my favorite food of all time. crab soup was filling and was presented in a artful way, making it better tasting! \n+ For me, it's all about the bathroom, but at SW, they gave us this dessert that lifted my spirits so high! Sounds corny, but damn, I was hella happy. I saw in the corner of my eye this dessert structure of mini funnel cakes on a mini tree lined with fat strawberries and 3 dipping sauces. I seriously hope I'm this happy when I get married. \n\nLastly, know that you're paying for excellence here so don't be surprised. If you have it in your budget to have dinner here, I highly recommend it. And don't forget to try that dessert. Maybe you'll be as happy as I was.
