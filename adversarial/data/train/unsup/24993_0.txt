Yelp 100 Challenge 15' * 17\/100\n\nI am a huge bookworm. On top of that, I am also a broadway geek! \n\nBroadwaybound LV had a delightful cast of high-schoolers perform the Tony Award Winning Anything Goes last month and absolutely nailed it! My friends and I were way in over our heads during the tap dancing scene and were fascinated from start to finish, all at a fraction of the price offered at the Smith Center. A lot of it had to do with how well the kids were trained but what is less apparent is how the library's technical resources helped make it such a successful production. \n\nThe theatre has an intimate setting with no bad seats. It really helps when I don't have to keep pulling out my binoculars during the performance! Sound system was clear and solid, no feedback or any other technical errors. Lighting had all the essentials from spotlights to dimmers and the like. I thought the stage was just the right size, allowing local productions to utilize every corner creatively and engage the audience well.\n\nI have yet to explore the book section since I go to the Sahara West branch whenever I need to check something out. That's one thing I promised myself I would do before the year is over!
