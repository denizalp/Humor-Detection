I've been meaning to write this for awhile...My family and I attended the Russo & Steele auction in January (2014)  in Scottsdale while we were visiting family.  We went there to see the cars and my husband ended up becoming a registered bidder.  Although we were out bid on the two cars we liked,  the process was exciting and fun.  The  staff was courteous and helpful as we were first timers. We will attend the event again given the opportunity works with our travel schedules.
