We were on a Date Night at a Concert in Comerica Theater when I called an audible.\n\nWe had the Suite all to ourselves, with food and drinks; and I really wanted to end the evening with panache. After all, I was on a date with my Beloved (when am I not on a Date Night with her, anyway?).\n\nThanks to the trusty Yelp Mobile app, and YT; I was able to get some recommendations of late night eats in the area that stayed open past 10PM. I typically have two time periods wherein I wake up - 6AM and 10PM. I get alot of work done during the day, and late at night. \n\nUnfortunately, many places her close at 9PM, or even if they close at 10PM on the weekends; their last seating is typically at 9:30PM.\n\nNot so for Corduroy. Thanks to one Yelper's PM, we were able to grab a late night bite after the concert; and prolong the evening with conversation and continually developing our lifelong friendship with endless conversation - until the place closes!\n\nWe pulled into the parking lot, I noticed that there seemed to be a dearth of cars in the parking lot. Only Durant's next door was still hopping, and they were actually winding down.\n\nWhen we walked in, we were surprised to see that except for one gentleman at one end of the bar, and another lady at the other end of the bar, all the tables were empty. We thought that this was rather unusual for a Saturday evening. Could this be indicative of how bad this place is?\n\nAbsolutely Not!\n\nOur server was polite and engaging; and introduced us to the evening's offerings. We didn't want anything too filling, but enough to satiate any pangs of hunger with enough left overs for the following day.\n\nWe ordered the Mango Guac with Tortilla chips. And for the main course, my wife ordered the Boursin Mac & Cheese accompanied by Grilled Chicken. I ordered the Corduroy Burger with a Side Salad.\n\nAs we waited for the food to arrive, we just took the time to take in how well appointed this place is, and how it provides a great view of Central Avenue. Not that it mattered to me, since I wasn't starting at the view of the street when I had the company of my Beloved.\n\nI am not a fan of Guacamole, but my recent acclimation to the combination of Mango and Avocado is changing my often maligned predisposition. This combination is both lively and flavorful.\n\nWhen our main course arrived, my wife immediately commented on how well the chicken was prepared and grilled. And the sauce that enveloped the Mac & Cheese was heavenly. Who would've thought that Mac & Cheese could taste so good - she quipped!\n\nThe Corduroy Burger was massive and the Hamburger Meat was quite succulent. The Bacon that it came with could have been a little less overdone, however. And the mixed green salad was a great addition, but a little bit on the dry side.\n\nAll in All, our experience with this establishment made for a delightful end to a lovely evening!
