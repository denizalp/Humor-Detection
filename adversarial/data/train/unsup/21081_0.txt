How can you call yourself a \"Steakhouse\" and NOT know how to properly cook a steak?\n\nI take my steaks seriously and after seeing SW Steakhouse featured on the Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\", I had high expectations. However, I left completely disappointed and scratching my head as to how SW Steakhouse even came to be on the show.\n\nOn Sunday, 9.11.11, my friends and I (party of 7) came to dinner at SW Steakhouse at 5:30 PM with reservations.\n\nWe were seated outdoors overlooking the Lake of Dreams which I had requested; a must for a picturesque dinner.\n\nF O O D\n*BACON CHEESE BREAD - 4 STARS\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=DIbahOb0BjAVX_-UWzvgJg\nServed warm, the bread was buttery with savory smoky bacon bits. The encrusted cheese gave it a subtle salty richness.\n\n*SAUTEED FOIE GRAS w\/ Grilled Pineapple, Brioche Toast, Blackberry Jam ($24) - 4 STARS\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=BTysi-8pPcSmVUzOOoTTWw\nThe foie gras was nicely seared and had a luxurious richness without being overly greasy. The brioche gave it a nice texture contrast and the blackberry jam's subtle tartness help balance out all the flavors nicely.\n\n*42 OZ. CHILI RUBBED DOUBLE RIBEYE (Serves Two; $106) - 2.5 STARS\n(Please note: You can add the chili rub to any steak)\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=Os4j8i4_9JNNoYiy8ug5Zg\nFeatured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\", the Chili Rubbed Ribeye was sorely disappointing. Though the ribeye was super rich in beefy flavor, it was overcooked. Requested medium rare, our steak was more like medium well. The chili rub which consisted of cayenne, cumin, and other spices was too overpowering and took away from the steak's natural flavor. It was like a glorified carne asada. \n\nJust to note, everyone's steak in our table except for one person was overcooked; that's a HUGE problem if you're a \"steakhouse\".\n\n*SIDES (Serves 2-3 people; $10 each)\n-BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED CORN - 4.5 STARS\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=CYLC3lwpL4oeN_U8pd0Rtw\n-PARMESEAN CREAMED SPINACH - 3 STARS\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=RqIEXlzqknOsDwf2h5O7AA\n-MAC 'N CHEESE - 3 STARS\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=UmWwruy4gLCTLNwilfxVug\n-FINGERLING POTATOES w\/ Green Beans & Bacon - 3 STARS\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=ThOijLkCcmw-PSFFYVuaxg\n\nThe only side worth mentioning was the Black Truffle Creamed Corn. It was slightly chunky, yet creamy with a fresh sweetness. The addition of the black truffles added a decadent earthiness to the corn.\n\n*FUNNEL CAKE & STRAWBERRIES w\/ Anglaise, Salty Caramel and Fudge Sauce ($18) - 4.5 STARS\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=3A-B4f4ztqIfi04VXQGILQ\nThe star of the night, the funnel cakes were beautifully presented on tree branches with a accompanying trio of sauces. It was crisp, light and airy. A mixture of the anglaise and salty caramel  gave it a creamy sweetness.\n\nS E R V I C E\nHaving dined at numerous fine dining restaurants, one would have a certain expectation in terms of service especially at the prestigious Wynn. Just like the steaks, the service was disappointing.\n\nOur waitress was MIA most of the night and never once checked on us to see how we were doing; yet we saw her repeatedly go to other tables with older patrons. Perhaps, people should be reminded that Generation Y are the \"foodies\" and \"yelpers\".\n\nWhen one of my friend's steak was cooked almost to a well done (requested medium rare), we had to wave our hands in the air just to get her attention to send it back. Only then did she ask, if the rest of our steaks were properly cooked. That's when our entire table went silent and I responded, \"No, most of our steaks were overcooked...\"\n\nWhen you're paying at least $100\/person, you should never have to wave down your waitress\/waiter at a restaurant of this caliber and for a place that's part of the Wynn family, you would think they would have tried to rectify everyone's overcooked steaks especially having mentioned it. I rarely send back my food, but our waitress should have least offered to make things right but she didn't. INEXCUSABLE. \n\nA M B I A N C E \/ D E C O R\nClassy, modern and swanky. The outdoor dining area overlooking the Lake of Dreams was breathtaking. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=1urgH7YBnqfhIKUG3R82FQ\n\nDuring our 2.5 hour dinner, there were two water shows: a frog singing the \"Moon Song\" and two balls mating and having a baby ball. Though it was entertaining and cute, I thought it was a bit cheesy.\n\nAfter our disappointing dining experience at SW Steakhouse, I can't help but wonder if being featured on the Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" was merely a paid advertisement.
