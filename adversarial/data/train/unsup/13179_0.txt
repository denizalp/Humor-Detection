Whoa! WTH happened in the past couple months? We went last night with a coupon and were pretty much insulted by the waiter! We gave him our coupon before eating, which he took, no problems. \nWhen it was time to order desert, the waiter condescendingly asked us if we had a coupon for that too?!!!! Our desert came 20 minutes later (bananas foster) and it came out black as tar!!! We went to send it back, when the server said, \"yeah, it's a little burnt, huh?\". C'mon, really?!! If you knew it was burnt, why'd you serve it?!!!
