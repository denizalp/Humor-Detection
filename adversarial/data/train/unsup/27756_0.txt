Dropped by for brunch while walking on west queen West. Ordered the Swan breakfast which consists of two eggs, toast, home fries, and the option of pancetta or sausage. The eggs and pancetta were made well. The toast was lackluster, and the home fries were burnt and chewy. All in all, I wasn't overly impressed with what I had compared to many other brunch options available. My g\/f got French today which was OK, but lacked that nice fluffiness you get from good French toast. It wasn't terrible, but I probably won't be back.
