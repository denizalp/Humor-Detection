I LOVE this place. \nOne of the best things about living in South End is definitely living so close to Common Market. Mini review: if you haven't been, go. \n\nIts an awesome little eclectic shop. I'll start with the deli - their menu is simple but great. The staff is friendly, the food is always fresh, and even when its decently crowded, its pretty quick. They also have freezers with some great side items such as risottos, chicken salads, pastas, and different ravioli options AND delicious looking deserts! \n\nThey also have, and what they're well known for, is their great extensive beer, cider, and wine selection. You can buy great local and hard to find 6 packs and individual beers. You can also find a great bottle of wine out of their really comprehensive selection and you won't be disappointed. On top of that they offer wine and beer tastings - which are great. \n\nThey also serve King of Pops, which I love and and are great to grab on the go when walking around South End. ALSO, (so many also's because this place has it all) they have a lot of gluten free, vegan, vegetarian snacks and treats throughout the store. I have tried a few and always been pleasantly surprised.
