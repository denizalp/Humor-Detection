I took my relatives to Hash House a Go Go before going to the Hoover Dam. They were wanting to go during the weekend but it was too packed. We ended up going during the week . It  was still pretty busy but we were seated right away. I think my cousin was surprised how busy it was. I wanted to say people do venture off the strip to eat ...it's not unheard of.\n\nI didn't want to eat anything heavy because I thought we were going to be at The Hoover Dam for a couple of hours. I ordered the Grilled Portabello sandwich $12.95. It had roasted red peppers, Basil Pesto, griddled goat cheese on a fresh baked bun. It was good but I think I haven't acquired the taste for goat cheese yet. It had an after taste to it. The sandwich was huge but what isn't over here LOL.\n\nMy brother, aunt and cousin were really happy with their meals as well!
