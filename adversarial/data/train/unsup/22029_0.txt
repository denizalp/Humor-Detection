Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. They have creative and unique menu items, tapas (small plates for you Anglophones), interesting cocktails and the best bartenders in town. Getting up to the bar is like a game for me and I love it. How many people can I squeeze by to get into the prime seating?\n\nThe vibe at Soul is upscale, most nights there is a DJ, it's dark and a little loud, but somehow still pulls itself off as a speakeasy-like atmosphere. Definitely come here with a small group. Big groups will never get seated -- just not enough space. Sharing tapas is the best way to go here. I have never eaten a meal here without sharing their fries, a generous portion of garlicky, perfectly delicious fries. Shoe string style if you were wondering. I, also, highly recommend their sushi. The Soul roll is one of my faves, not overly spicy, so don't let those jalape√±os scare you off. \n\nIf you want interesting cocktails you have come to the right place. Check out their menu with tons of house favorites (Basil Smash) or tell Adam or one of the other awesome bartenders what you like and they will mix up something special just for you. \n\nOn most nights and ALL weekends you will wait at Soul, for sometimes up to an hour, but it is totally worth it. Elbow in at the bar and order some cocktails and hummus to keep you happy while you wait. If you can snag a place on the patio on a night with good weather, you have definitely hit the jackpot. Perfect view of the Charlotte skyline. Soul is a great date spot -- nothing like getting to know someone by sharing food. \n\nSoul has always been an ultra hip spot in the sea of a semi-hip place, but now that Plaza Midwood is growing up, I think Soul compliments its neighbors well (ie: Peculiar Rabbit and Twenty Two). If you have someone you want to impress in Charlotte, go ahead and head over to Soul Gastrolounge.
