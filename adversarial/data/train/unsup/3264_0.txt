Besides sushi, I've never had crab before. I had NO idea what to expect when I walked in this place. As I took a look around I saw a bunch of people wearing bibs, licking their fingers, and slurping crab juices. I was kind of disgusted to be honest, and it was a little too late for me to back out since I was meeting a friend there.\n\nThe first thing the waitress did was cover my table in construction paper and tie a bib around me. I'm a classy lady, and this went way beyond my sensibilities. As each moment passed, I became more and more skeptical of this place and had very little interest in ordering anything. My dinner mate did not have the same feelings and ordered half the menu. Three different types of crabs, oysters, shrimp, bread, and fries. It was all delivered in plastic baggies and accompanied with a giant tin bin.\n\nMy dining mate cut my first crab leg and gave me a piece and as soon as I had my first bite of Angry Crab crab meat I was in love. It was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I didn't want to wait for someone to cut the crab meat open for me so I grabbed the crab and started tearing and ripping. I needed more crab meat. I did the same with the shrimp, and I slurped the oysters. I had sauce on my face and I was licking my fingers. \n\nI left feeling dirty and smelling fishy but it was THE BEST FOOD that I've had in a long time. Enjoyed the food tremendously and loved the experience.
