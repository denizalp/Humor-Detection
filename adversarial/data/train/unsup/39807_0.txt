Whether in platters or as a sandwich (in a pita) the falafels and the chicken and beef shawarma are delicious and tangy. The samosas are homemade and very good. Spicy samosas are not unreasonably so. The rice is among the best I've ever had. You may have to ask for it as I don't think it's a posted menu item.
