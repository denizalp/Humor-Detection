Finally visited the restaurant, and I can confidently say this is as good as it gets for Mexican food in Las Vegas.\n\nYou start with chips, bean dip, mild salsa. There are 10 different levels of spicy salsa that you can choose from, a habanero salsa being the hottest. Service with a smile, a mariachi in the background (with a great voice, no less), and 22 oz margaritas make this place a go-to.\n\nStarted with the nopales con cebollados - cactus strips with fried onion. Served with corn tortillas, was delicious. Split the shrimp ceviche salad which was excellent and filling, and also split the steak fajitas. Delicious, served with guac, sour cream, rice, beans, flour torts. A meal for two with two drinks apiece, two apps, fajitas for two came out to $85 with tip. A bargain!
