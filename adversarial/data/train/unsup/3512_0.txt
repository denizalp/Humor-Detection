I came here yesterday for a SpaGirls event. The normal $35 blowdry was $25. Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, I parked in the south garage which was just off the side street Drybar was located. It didn't take me long to locate it and it was a very short walk from the garage. The decor was light and nicely done. On Saturdays and Sundays,they have champagne and dessert until 2pm so I had a couple of mimosas during my time there. My appt was at 2pm but they got me in 15 minutes early which was nice. When they took me back, Christine washed my hair and talked to me about the conditioning shot for my hair. For $20, it is supposed to last for 6 weeks. I thought, why not, since summer is coming and my coarse hair is about to get drier. I asked Christine to do what I think is called \"Straight Up\" which is stick straight. Since my hair is really thick, it took her awhile but she did a fantastic job! I have honestly never seen my hair look this good. My girlfriend went too and I never saw her curly hair look that good straight. She had her ends curled whereas I did mine all straight but both of our hair looked awesome. When I got home and went to work, I received many compliments. I felt the staff was very friendly and I would definitely go back. They have packages like 3 blowdrys for $100 which saves some $. I wouldn't go to Drybar all of the time but for a girl with curly hair, it is a nice indulgence to have someone blowdry and style it straight for me. Love it!!
