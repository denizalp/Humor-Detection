At first I was really happy with the service and the pricing; however, on multiple consecutive occasions I've come in and the doctor is unavailable which is understandable because she needs to take lunch but the inconsistent time is a bit annoying so instead I call ahead of time and even when I do the receptionist doesn't tell me that the doctors going to lunch after her current patients lined up so I find out when I get there I can wait close to an hour or come back. You should tell me the doctor is going to lunch when I call instead of telling me after when I arrive. \n\nAfter receiving a reply I changed my 1 star to a 3 star. The joint definitely doesn't deserve a 1 star. I was just very upset that day after calling to see if the doctor was available then was told she was going to lunch after the current patients after I arrived. I would give a 5 star but until that issue is resolved I don't feel that their practice deserves a 5 star.
