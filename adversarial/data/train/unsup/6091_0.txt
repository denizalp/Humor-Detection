My lovely colleague and friend Cara L insisted on taking me to Great Lakes Brewing Co. for a glass of their Christmas Ale, which she described as something along the lines of \"Christmas crack.\" We took a seat at a high top in the bar area and I ordered a pint, hoping my feelings would be as enthusiastic. 'Twas indeed an addictive pint of brew. Smooth, strong and with just the right spice of the season, I liked it so much I ordered another at the next bar. And now that I'm back home, I'm hitting up Philly Tap Finder to track the sucker down. \n\nGIVE ME ALL THE CHRISTMAS ALE!
