Nathan served me today, he was great!! Made my subs just as I asked & offered deluxe. Very friendly too. Outside light was not turned on, it was dark so I had to search for the place since I am not from this area. He thanked me for letting him know and made sure it was turned on as soon as he was done with my order.
