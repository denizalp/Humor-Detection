My computer start-up password for Microsoft Windows was compromised in a phone call which resulted in a scam and the inability to sign on my computer. After checking reviews for the Geek Squad, Data Doctors and uBreakiFix, I called uBreakiFix and met Alex. He assured me that if he was not able to reset the password, there would be no charge (music to my ears). As an aside, I brought him my monitor thinking it was my computer which shows you how computer savvy I am! He took wonderful care of me and my computer and restored it to its original condition without me having to take out a loan for payment for his services. I was not able to hook up my printer\/scanner to the computer and did not have the start-up disc so called HP who quoted me a $24.95 fee for tech support to which I agreed. After two and a half hours on the phone with her, she was unsuccessful after 8 download attempts and told me she would call me back in 2 hours after she spoke with her supervisor. In the meantime I called Alex who successfully downloaded it over the phone and also set me up with Microsoft's free anti-virus software. I cannot say enough about Alex and the wonderful service I have received. He is a true testament to superior customer service and I recommend him highly. Thank you Alex for your courtesy, patience and knowledge. I am one satisfied customer who was glad I made the right choice in using uBreakiFix and having Alex as my tech.
