We came here last night as a group of 6 to celebrate a friends birthday. I had heard great things about Maggiano's from friends and co-workers over the years. Since we love Italian food, I was very excited for this meal.\n\nQuite the disappointment. \n\nWe ordered Johnny's Carbonara  ($18.25) and Mom's Lasagna ($16.95). The food was actually quite good! Portion sizes are generous and filling. My carbonara was creamy and rich and the bacon was cooked perfectly! I have zero complaints about the food. We had several appetizers and deserts as well. The flat bread pizza was a perfect light snack to enjoy while waiting for our main dishes. Plus after the meal that chocolate cake was out of this world! Very rich!\n\nI really dig the atmosphere as well! Plenty of touches that scream Italy and Vegas, like pics of the Rat Pack and whatnot. \n\nwhy the 2 stars?\n\nUnfortunately, lackluster service was the issue. Nathan was our waiter for the evening. While the service wasn't completely terrible, several things were amiss. Items requested were forgotten, even after he verified the request. Drink orders were separate and staggered, instead of together. \n\nI guess where all the disappointment stems from is when we went to pay the bill and leave. We went as essentially 3 sets of 2 people. When asking for the bills to be split, just having 2 people put on one separate bill proved to be such an apparently laborious task, we decided to just settle the last 4 among ourselves. For the 2 of us, our bill came to roughly $36 dollars. I rounded up to $40 and added a $10 tip. I was charged a flat $50 and signed my credit card slip. \n\nNathan came back and then told me that the $50 did not include his tip. Mind you, he was tipped from all parties at the table. He was taken care of in that regards, and I think quite well all things considered.  He basically just stood there over me without saying a word. I did not want to gripe over $10 at a special friends birthday gathering, so I gave him another $10 cash. It felt like a shakedown and left a very sour taste in my mouth. Everyone at the table agreed that it was out of line and inappropriate. For this alone, we will not be back to Maggiano's. \n\nI hope that $10 was worth it, because now 6 people have a sour opinion of Maggiano's and we will certainly seek other options for our regular get togethers.\n\nI am still quite annoyed with how the situation played out and this ruined what was otherwise a great meal with great friends. I am not going to give them 1 star simply because the food was very good. \n\nBut we will not be back and I'm pretty sure our friends were just as put off by the whole thing as well.\n\n2 stars.
