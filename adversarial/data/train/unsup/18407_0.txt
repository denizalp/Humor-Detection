Somewhere in between a 3.5-4 star rating for me.\n\nWent here with a small group of fellow yelpers on a Friday night. Djerba la Douce is small place, seats around 20 people, that serves up Tunisian food (North African with both French and Italian influences).\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, the food preparation takes a long time. The kitchen is completely open and you can see the owner and his family hard at work preparing the food. So it's not that there is any slacking off in the kitchen or bad management - the food prep for this type of cuisine is just a lengthy process. Skip dining here if you are in a rush.\n\nI ordered the merguese (usually spelled \"Merguez\" in case you want to google) which is sausage made with lamb & beef, served with a few homemade french fries, an egg and a spicy harissa sauce. We asked for VERY spicy and I didn't find it insane, but it had a nice kick. The food was delicious, meat portion ridiculous (FOUR sausages!) I found the sauce very oily, so it's definitely not diet food.\n\nInteresting decor at this place and you'll feel more like you're in someone's family home rather than a restaurant. Service was OK but not overly attentive. Small menu selection but looks like they do every dish well. 5 stars for unique food choices.
