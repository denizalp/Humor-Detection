Dr. Anita Lanier is fabulous, I injured my tail bone, and had sharp shooting pains when attempting to sit or stand.  I had never had acupuncture, but thought I would try it.  Dr. Lanier explained every thing to me so I was comfortable.  She also gave me some Oriental Herbs and patches, which worked great.  After my session I had no more shooting pains, unbelievable!  It will still take time to fully heal my tail bone, but it feels much better and NO MORE SHOOTING PAINS, which were horrible.  Dr. Lanier is an amazing healer, 5 STARS!
