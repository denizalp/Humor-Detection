Cashier was nice and answered my question on what flavor is the most popular. The ATL Style dry rub is the most popular so I ordered 6 traditional wings in that style. I also ordered 6 traditional medium Red Hot wings and Cajun style fries. The Cajun style fries were recommended by the cashier. They were delicious! The ATL dry rub was fantastic! The Red Hot medium was spicier than the usual medium buffalo restaurant serve and the vinegar was too strong for me but I still liked them. The chicken is fried very well. They have Pepsi and Dr Pepper along with Kool-Aid and iced tea. This place is NOW my chicken wing spot. Sorry Buffalo Wild Wings and Native Grill!
