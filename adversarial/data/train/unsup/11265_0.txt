Welp... Buck & Rider, you've TOTALLY redeemed yourself! My first visit wasn't the absolute greatest, but I said I would give it another try... and this time around... wow, just wow. I was absolutely impressed -- not only by the food, but all around!  \n\nMy boyfriend and I went in on Saturday night since he was craving seafood, and I had my fingers crossed that Buck & Rider wouldn't disappoint. We showed up around 8:30pm to a packed house, however we only waited maaaybe ten minutes for a seat to open up -- and it was in the bar area so we could take advantage of the amazing reverse happy hour -- yay! (We were a bit early, though, reverse happy hour doesn't start until 9:30pm). We were seated quickly, greeted by our amazing server, brought menus, water, and my boyfriend was given the \"welcome shpiel\" since it was his first time in. \n\nI ordered the Ace in the Hole (I highly recommend if you like tequila!) It was light, fruity, and summery, although perfectly balanced and not overbearingly sweet.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to order a few different menu items and share so we could have a variety. We ordered the following:\n\n* Baja Style Seafood Cocktail: Jumbo lump crab, shrimp, scallops, and tomato. Super yummy, although I ate all the crab and shrimp and then was only left with scallops... which are not my favorite, so I left those for my boyfriend, hehe.\n* Voodoo Fried Rice (My FAVORITE!): Fried rice with shrimp, organic chicken, peas, gojuchang (aka a red chili paste\/sauce), and red fresnos. Think of a cross-over between jambalaya and fried rice. It was so delicious, and the flavors were phenomenal! I ordered another one so I could take home and enjoy the deliciousness the next day. Highly recommend! \n* Sushi Grade White Fish Ceviche: avocado, cherry tomato, roasted sweet potato, fennel, and scallops. This was good too, although not my favorite so I only had a few bites -- it was a smidge too \"fishy\" for my liking, but then again, seafood tends to be \"fishy\", lol.\n* Crunchy Shrimp Roll: Roasted almonds, avocado, spicy mayo, and Serrano peppers. Delicious and different with the roasted almonds; the hint of that roasted almond flavor added extra pizazz to the roll. I would absolutely recommend it, and order it again on a future visit. \n\nWe also received tortilla chips and saltines with our food, although I'm not sure which ordered item they officially \"come with\". \n\nThe service was exceptional, and I was thoroughly impressed at how quickly the food came out -- I felt like we would barely place our order and next thing we knew, our food was on our table. The presentation of everything was extremely appetizing (see photos), and I assure you, everything was just as delicious and flavorful as it looked! Thank you, Buck & Rider -- the server, management, and staff that made our evening so wonderful! We'll see you again soon!!!
