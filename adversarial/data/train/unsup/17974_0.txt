Sunset Park Dog Park is such a great park to bring my dog to when we travel to Las Vegas. They have two huge areas (one dedicated to large dogs and one dedicated to small dogs) plus an extra one they put into rotation when the one of them are being cleaned. There are not many places to necessarily walk your dog especially when staying on the strip, so we load Zeus up in the car and drive ~10 minutes to this lovely park. There's plenty of parking and we've never not been able to find a spot. When it is dark, there are lights that come on. We'll keep coming back when we're in the area.\n\n2016 Review #60
