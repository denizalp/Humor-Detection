I was in the area so I came back and gave them another try.  Glad to see they got rid of that silly credit card fee.  The burrito didn't seem as big as they used to be but the meat was tasty and they also didn't hold back on the pico they put in it.  \n\nThe cashier was friendly and they gave enough salsa for the entire burrito.\n\nI would come back if I was in the mood for a quick carne asada burrito.
