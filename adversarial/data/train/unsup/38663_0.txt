Very disappointing on many levels. I had to be the one to ask Mike Burghardt about making a maximum annual contribution to my Roth IRA to reduce my federal and state taxes. His reply, \"Oh yeah, I'll have to look into it and let you know.\" \n\nA month after filing I received a notice from the State saying the 2010 refund I received was overpaid by several hundred dollars. I now owed that back plus interest that was accruing daily. Since Mr. Burghardt filed my taxes both years I contacted him immediately. His response, \"I'm very busy with tax season. I won't be able to get to it for probably a month.\" That was 9 weeks, 3 phone calls and 2 emails ago. \n\nPaying the extra money to hiring a tax accountant to file one's taxes assures certain protections and assistance in just this kind of incident. Unfortunately, I have yet to hear back from Mike and have had to handle the matter on my own. In my opinion, it appears Mr. Burghardt wants the fees of a tax account without any of the responsibilities. He is not reliable or worthy of trust. \n\nGo elsewhere.
