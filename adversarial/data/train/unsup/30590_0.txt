The best restaurant in Surprise hands down. \n\nFood is amazing, make sure you try the garlic noodles. Prices are high. Too high in my opinion, however I still find myself here a lot. Their Pho is some of the best ive had. The owner and staff is very friendly. This place gets packed. Expect a wait weekends at 6.\n\nIts next to pei wei, which given the price different and quality difference really doesnt make them direct competition.
