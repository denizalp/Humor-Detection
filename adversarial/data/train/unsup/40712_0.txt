Can I give less than one star? I was house sitting who uses kennel care. We needed the vet in an emergency. During regular business hours they told us they were closing in 40 minutes and to take the dog to an emergency clinic. At the emergency clinic not associated with kennel care at all the vet who took us in made mention on being on her way out the door when we walked in. She stayed with the hurt dog from about 5:45 until 9:30 that night. To be honest I would have expected that from Kennel Care as that is supposed to be the dogs home vet. However, after looking at other comments I am not the first customer to be told to go somewhere else in an emergency. Honestly it is vet clinics like this that give all vets a bad name. Thankful that not all businesses are run this way, and some vets will stay late to help a hurt animal.
