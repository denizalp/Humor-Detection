Hmmmm, I don't know. I'm not really feeling it. I always try to base my reviews off things overall. This has to do with just the food portion.\n\nI had the carnitas and the adobada.\nThe meat is seriously lacking in flavor and all I could taste was onions. \nThe carnitas taco was bland and didn't seem to be slow cooked. It was somewhat tender, but not fall apart in your mouth. \nThe adobada is typically a very strong marinated pork - this is the least flavor I've ever experienced. \n\nEven the green avacado salsa, rice and beans they use is very mediocre and bland. \n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm picky? Or...I like my food to have flavor to it? \nI also need to point out this important detail - I was STARVING when I ate these. I hadn't eaten in 6 hours - I eat about every 2-3 hours on a daily basis. When I'm starving, I pretty much think almost anything is good. That being said, that should stick out in your mind.\nI know I haven't tried other items on the menu, but tacos should be the key factor to any mexican joint. I'm a taco whore, and I will judge any place based on the tacos. It's the main thing the majority of people eat when they want fast Mexican, and if you can't get that right, I don't know how anything else could be better. If an Asian\/Mexican joint with Asians cooking can get it right...I don't know who the hell else can.
