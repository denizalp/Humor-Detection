2.5 star \n\nTelus Tuesday Specials Restaurant #3 \n\nI am a little confused... I made a reservations for 7:30 pm for Marben... and ended up some of my guests showing up at 7..and some showing up past 8? And I ended up drinking all the Jennifer's Coronas that my wallet can handle while waiting till 8:30 before I can have my dinner... \n\nThis is the only Telus Special restaurants that have a \"Special and Limited and Pricer\" menu. And our waitress assured me that the portions are a little bigger than their regular tapas portions. \n\nI have to tell you their Tapas versions are really small... small in portions but big on prices.. \n\nTelus Specials \n- Ryan's Charcuterie (free) meh.. Black Hoof's Rule!! \n- Marianne's Duck Confit ($23).. only decent choice and waitress' recommendations \n- Ervinna's Ice Cream Sandwich (free)... skip go for Warm Apple Pudding! \n\nJohn's Burger ($17) and Fred's Pork Belly ($12) \n- Tapas small size.... and $17!! for a burger..with fries...(now I need to have another drink!) and Pork Belly is like 1 small piece...(great if you are on a low cholesterol diet!) \n\nI feel sorry for my guests.. they were all feeling hungry before, during and after dinner... I didn't feel like a good host... All Marben's fault! \n\nMarben's interesting choice of paintings deco makes the evening's conservations one of the more interesting one I have for awhile.. as how often when guys start talking about waxing?? Brazilian waxing?
