Dear The Stand,\n\nI have been coming here since I moved to Phoenix last year, thanks to your delicious short rib tacos. I moved to Tempe and regularly make the 25 minute drive to get my fix of savory and sweet delights. Recently, the pickled cabbage (the sweet component that makes the taco.... everything that is good in this crazy world) has turned into a bland afterthought. Why? Why have you taken away the one taco that understood me? Have you given in to sweet-shaming? \"Omg this is too sweet for me...\" As if liking something less sweet makes you cooler? More than? Tell those superior, self-aggrandizing, pleasure-denying fools to shut it. Admittedly, this is the only reason I can think of for changing a perfect taco recipe, so if it's anything else,  please share. I need someone to blame for this travesty, and I don't want it to be you guys. Please bring my tacos back.\n\nM.
