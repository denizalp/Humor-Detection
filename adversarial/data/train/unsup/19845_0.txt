My friends and I made a reservation for a Friday night about a week or so ago. We walked right into our table, and we immediately noticed a bit of a smell...like at a Chinese supermarket, but it didn't bother us too much. The restaurant was empty at 6, but the tables filled up by 6:30. The service was great as the server always checked to ensure everything was going well.\n\nSome of my friends started with Beerlao, which is a beer from a Lao brewery and apparently, it is not always available at the restaurant. I tried a little and it is very light; at only 4%, it hardly tastes like alcohol.\n\nSince it was the first time at Sabai Sabai for most of us, the 6 of us ordered all of their curries, plus holy basil stir-fried shrimp and Northern Thai pork skewers. \n\n* Khao soi: This was my first time trying khao soi. I thought the soup was good, but the deep-fried egg noodles tasted a little stale.\n* Panang curry: My favourite out of all four curries. I drenched my rice with the sauce and it was delicious. \n* Green curry: It was okay, although I am not a big fan to begin with.\n* Massaman curry: I liked the tenderness of the beef. The sauce is similar to their khao soi. \n* Stir-fried shrimp: I did not try this.\n* Pork skewers: It tastes just like the BBQ pork (叉燒) you get at Chinese BBQ shops. \n\nI must say...the portions were a LOT smaller than I had expected. When the server came with the first curry dish, I thought one of us had added an appetizer, but nope! Sadly, it was one of our main dishes. The curries are decent - not too heavy, thick, or spicy - but they don't scream \"wow!\" and at $9 for the pork skewers, I'm pretty sure I can get a whole pound of BBQ pork at a BBQ shop in Chinatown. \n\nSabai Sabai is the only place I know in the area that serves the classic Thai mango sticky rice dessert. It just so happened that it was their dessert of the day. Sweet sticky rice covered in coconut sauce and topped with fresh mango...mmm... Now I want to go back just to have it again!\n\nIn all seriousness though, I think I really would only return for their mango sticky rice dessert. I understand that it is a tapas restaurant, but I can't justify paying the price for such incredibly small portions. (It ended up being about $30\/person and I was only half full.)
