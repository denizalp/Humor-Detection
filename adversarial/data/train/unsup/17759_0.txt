Limited selection, nonexistent service. I've experienced better at other bakeries in the Spring Mountain area, and with better prices.\n\nCame in the moring after a holiday and selection was bare-bones: one or two of most items, all savory items completely out. I didn't see any pork buns, but any item listed with hotdog, \"pizza\", or green onion was not on display- selection heavily favors sweets. But even so, there were one or two of each roll cake on display, one peanutbutter pastry, and one pack of garlic bread slices. No egg tarts, cheese buns, or anything else I was hoping to try. \n\nGiven the limited stock out, I couldn't tell if I'd somehow come too late or if they were just a little late getting items out- but after wandering around for a few minutes and making my selections, no one came out to help me or cash me out. \n\nAccording to the menu, they also offer coffee and smoothies, as well as whole cakes in the display case at the front. Prices are a bit higher (by $1-2) for the same items at bakeries further up the street.\n\nFinally was able to purchase a few items, none of which tasted fresh, didn't finish any of them. Mochi bun was a fun option, but the items I was most interested to try were out of stock or somehow not being made that day.
