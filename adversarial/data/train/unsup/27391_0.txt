Went to Bar Hop on a Friday afternoon for lunch. It has a great beer menu for those that like the unique, craft and imported. But don't be fooled by its great drink selection, this is a gastro pub that will leave you satisfied - the menu is diverse and amazing. The house jerky with bourbon bacon jam is amazing. It's not what one would consider a traditional appetizer but it works! The house smoked wings are really tasty. The lager jerk mussels are truly amazing and they're served with crusty break to soak up the brothy goodness. It has a small steer-side patio overlooking King Street for the people watchers and the dining\/bar area is comfortable and trendy. I can't wait to go back.
