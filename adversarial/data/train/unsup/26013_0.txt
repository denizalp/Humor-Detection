Came to the Local Pub to see a friend of mine perform a couple of sets. His performance was fantastic, and I did love the ambience of the place, but the food and customer service were terrible! I ordered a very simple dish, steamed edamame (Japanese-style soy beans, served salted). All you do is stick some frozen edamame in the microwave, not difficult - so why did it take ages and ages to be made? Meanwhile, other customers were getting their fancy dinners served before my order. And when my edamame finally did arrive, half the beans were still semi-frozen! Unbelievable. I brought this to the attention of the staff. Weirdly, they acted like I was the one who was somehow being annoying and unreasonable. No explanations, no apologies - they accepted it back emotionlessly, and asked what I wanted them to do with it (??). I thought for sure the chef at least would be quite shocked and apologetic about their mistake, maybe steam me up a brand new batch for me, maybe add in a little extra something to make up for it... But no - the server just brought me back the remaining beans, re-microwaved, and not only that, it took them _ages_ (again!) to bring me back the re-heated beans. No apologies either, of course. Needless to say, I will be warning everyone I know to stay away from this place, and will never be returning - even if my friend performs there again in the future.  :(
