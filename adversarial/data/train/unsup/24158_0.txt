$53 a night on a Saturday! Cannot complain! Make sure you sign up for the whatever club this hotel belongs to and get a 40% off for your stay!\n\nCheck out the pics. This is a new, modern, young and hip hotel. Definitely good for a romantic getaway or just friends sharing a room if you want the best bang for the buck! Old rich couples who used to stay at the Bellagio can switch it up too I guess.\n\nGiven that the hotel just opened in August, formerly the Sahara, the rooms are new and clean. The carpet is so nice that you'll feel okay to walk around barefoot! \n\nBathroom is so white and clean. No traces of hair or dust or pool of water. Good housekeeping work! \n\nService was great! They greeted us warmly at the front desk and she was very patient to answer my questions about the monorail. Yes the monorail takes you to a couple of hotels all the way to MGM I believe, or at least it's one of the stops. I called them later to ask for a free late check-out too and they let us stay till noon, which is nice to have that extra hour!\n\nOh and they do have a cute, stylish design on their laundry bag. I took it home with me :P\n\nOne thing to watch out for... don't pick up the snacks or the \"intimacy package\" or whatever they have there unless you actually want them. They have a sensor and would charge you if it's away from the tray for 60 seconds. That cliche of \"put it back where you find it\" does apply, otherwise you'll be penalized... unless you actually want a small bag of Jose Andres gourmet chips that who knows how long it's been there for for 8 bucks, then go for it!\n\nDownside - at the end of the strip, not a good location, but the monorail would make this situation better. If you drive, then I guess it's not a problem!\n\nWould definitely check this place for availability again next time I'm in Vegas!
