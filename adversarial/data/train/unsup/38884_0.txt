I will be using the term \"customer\" here in place of \"Patient\", because that is all you are here, is a dollar sign.  \nPlease, please , I beg of you go somewhere else! The staff here is pretty terrible, I have had such bad customer service here. Everything from appointments that were not entered in the system to prescriptions that are not sent to the pharmacy;  and everything leads back to a lack of communication between the staff and the customers. \nI am not alone on this, I have seen other patients go to the front desk and complain that they have been waiting over an hour from their appointment time, and they walk out. The front desk staff is very unsympathetic, perhaps among the worst I have ever seen.\nPlease do not be filled by the esthetics  of this clinic it is all a facade.\nTerrible admin, I think you guys need to fire your office manager and retrain everyone in admin!
