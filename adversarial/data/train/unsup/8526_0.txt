This is funny they say they can't find my name in there databanks anywhere. Of course they can't.\nOkay, maybe I should be more specific,  my incident with Sundevil auto took place one year ago. But I'm going to repost this every six months. I want people to know this place is not trustworthy and they did rip me off.\nHad I known about yelp and what it was I would've posted a year ago. Doesn't matter, I'm doing it now.\nThe date on my invoice is August 13, 2012.   Invoice number 24171\nEveryone please read my earlier review. Beware of this place!\n\nEverything they said I needed done when I went to another shop, they said I didn't need any of that.\nI am going to repost this every six months so everyone knows about this place. I'm not saying all Sundevil auto garages are like this but I would beware!\n\nA total rip off and a joke! I had to go back two times to have work fixed properly after they had it. The first time they forgot to put a lug nut back on my tire. Are you kidding me??!!\nThen, I had my brakes fixed, they sent me away with them worse than when I came in.\nWhen I asked about it they said I needed a new master cylinder and could be another $800.00 worth of work. I finally had enough.\nI took my car to another shop and was told the air wasn't bled out of my brake lines and there was absolutely nothing wrong with my master cylinder. Wow!\nI honestly felt like I was robbed. They also told me I needed some front end work done, axles or something. The other shop confirmed there was nothing wrong with that either.\nPeople think long and hard before you take your vehicle there. The manager was no help what so ever and when confronted with all this denied it all the way. Stood by his mechanics assessment of my car.\n\nI found a new place:\nBay's Auto and Tire\nExtremely trustworthy and friendly staff. No shenanigans!
