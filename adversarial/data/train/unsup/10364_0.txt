Pretty good bakery located in Montreal's Chinatown.  We received good service here too.  \n\nNot the best on this street though.  Of the three bakeries, Patisserie Callia was second best.  The egg tarts and the custard bun were above average.  Other goodies were mediocre.\n\nAre they worth returning to?  Yes, they are.  I would return for their yummy egg tarts and lower prices than the competition.
