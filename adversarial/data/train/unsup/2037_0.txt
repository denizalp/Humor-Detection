Horrible.. Horrific.. horrid..\nThree words that describes my most recent visit to this establishment. Calling is a restaurant would give it way more credit than it deserves.\nOver priced.. over cooked..\nWe called to complain and were told that even if we brought the wings back all we'd get is the wings replaced with more wings.\nYeah, as if I'd waste more gas just to get more awful \"food\".\n Refusing to refund a customer for wretched, burned up, tiny wings is ridiculous.\nSO.. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE.
