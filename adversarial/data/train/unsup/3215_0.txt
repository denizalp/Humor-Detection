After reading all the great reviews about this place I had to check it out.\n               Well I'm officialy in love with Los Reyes de la Torta!Stopped in on a whim and never wanted to leave.The queso was thick and creamy and just GOOD.The torta is the biggest I've ever seen so full of flavor that hit you one after another.I almost felt bad paying them so little for such a huge meal,so I tipped generously.\n       So the next time your there look around,that brunette you see in the corner with a sleeping bag is me moving in and never leaving.
