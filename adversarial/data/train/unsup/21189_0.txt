If you want to spend a fortune on a highly unremarkable meal, this is your spot.  The Prime Rib, at $55, was no better than a steak at Sizzler. Simply nothing notable about this place to justify a $140 tab for two main courses and 6 Oysters, no wine, no dessert.  Highway robbery. Friendly enough service.
