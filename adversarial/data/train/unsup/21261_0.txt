WTH Yelp? So all the reviews rave about this place, but none of y'all warned me that it was on the corner of ghetto blvd & sketch street!! \n\nI mean,  don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, I'm still Brook from the block so I felt right at home. And the tacos are magic, the sauce is on point, and that fresh horchata was SO refreshing! \n\nBut I brought some friends here when we all were visiting Vegas for a bachelorette party and they were pretty uncomfortable because we weren't prepared for the neighborhood. \n\nWould I come back? Yes- during the day time. With mace safely hidden in tow. \n\nWould I bring tourists here again? No way. This place is a PERFECT taco truck; but it's no good if you're an out-of-towner that feels uncomfortable on new places.
