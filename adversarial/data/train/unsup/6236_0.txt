My boyfriend wanted barbeque but then again he always wants barbeque, and at first we were planning on going to a barbeque chain restaurant in Henderson but then I remembered reading reviews about a really good BBQ place near the strip clubs. I looked on Yelp and voila, there it was, Rollin Smoke Barbeque.\n\n We came last night around 9 PM and it wasn't busy but there were people there enjoying their dinners. You order and pay at the counter\/booth and they bring the food out to you. I got the beef brisket sandwich with a side of okra and my boyfriend got the trio with ribs, brisket, and pork with a side of mac and cheese. My sandwich was delicious! I ate it with a fork because it was so stuffed with meat that I knew it would spill out of the bun once I had it in my hands. The okra was good too. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about his trio of meat! He loved every bit of it. \n\nIt's a small, simple restaurant located down the street from Spearmint Rhino. The person who took our order was sooo friendly! My boyfriend was having a hard time deciding on what he wanted and the guy offered several suggestions, even stating which ones were his mother or grandmother's recipes. He even told us how he and his brother got started in the barbeque business. \n\nI wonder if they've ever been featured on one of those travel or food network shows? Because if not then they really should be!
