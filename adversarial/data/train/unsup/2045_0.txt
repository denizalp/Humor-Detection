Always a great treat\n\n Baskin-Robbins has always been a lot time favorite of mine.  Quality confections, quickly prepared and reasonably priced.\n\n The staff is always friendly and service is always fast. The hardest part of my visit is making a selection with so many flavors to choose from.\n\nOnce you make a selection you will have your ice cream in hand within minutes, reguardless of how busy the store is.  So if your looking for geeat icecream head to Baskin-Robbins for a  mouth-watering experience.
