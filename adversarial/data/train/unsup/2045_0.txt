I just got married last night and I am so happy I chose Amelia & Co to do my hair and makeup! I didn't have the chance to do a trial before my wedding and was relying on all the reviews I read that said I would not be disappointed...boy were they right! \n\nHayley did a phenomenal job on my hair and it was exactly the way I wanted it- I got so many compliments through out the night! My makeup was just as flawless...I was so bummed when I had to wash it off... \n\nThe best part is I only had a few keywords on how I wanted my makeup and she knocked it out of the park! It lasted all night and I've never felt more beautiful! \n\nMy girls looked just as good- everyone was happy- pictures came out awesome! It's so great that these ladies are willing to travel to you... Love love love our makeup and hair!\n\nThank you so much!!!
