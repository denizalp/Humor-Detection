I've heard amazing things about Vegas buffets and I was underwhelmed.  We were the only people in the restaurant and it was far to expensive for what we got, in my opinion.\n\nThe food was good, but not out of this world - I wasn't impressed with the options.  A lot of it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while even though it was 6 or 7 pm on a Saturday evening in Vegas.\n\nThe carving station Prime Rib was very very good, so credit where credit is due.  I've noticed that other Yelpers felt the same, I should have checked before we went!
