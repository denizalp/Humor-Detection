Excellent location for dinner with friends in the south hills!  All of the seafood options were delicious, including the crab cake sandwhich and the shrimp po' boy.  \n\nThe happy hour specials were very reasonable as well, with a large drink and appetizer selection.   They offer a small plate bar with a selection of small dishes such as oysters, shrimp cocktail, and much more.  They also have multiple outdoor bars and is a great location I have dinner and drinks with friends during the warmer months.\n\nWorthwhile to check out with a group of friends!
