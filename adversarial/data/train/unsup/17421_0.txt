Slow service! Terrible waitresses I ordered a 'buffalo chicken sandwich' and I got the sloppiest sandwich I have ever seen ! Two skinny chicken fingers on a bun?! Ew I told her I wanted to order something else and the waitress said sorry it's going to take alongn time so I didn't eat any of it and she still billed me for it. Obviously was not goin g to i think McDonald's would have been a better option. Save your money it's overpriced and gross!
