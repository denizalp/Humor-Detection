I would prefer to give 3 1\/2 stars. \n\nThey have a great beer selection. I ordered the Jive Turkey sandwich. It was really good. \n\nVery cute, intimate place. Which brings me to my biggest complaint. The music was so loud I could barley have a conversation. The nice candles and mood lighting, but blaring music in such a small place just doesn't work. \n\nThe service was ok. Not great. Not bad. It seemed to take awhile to get refills on the drinks. \n\nI would definitely go back to try some other food.
