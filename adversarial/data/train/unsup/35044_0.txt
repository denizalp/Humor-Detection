Really nicely plated. One entree was hot and other two served lukewarm. Good salsa. Nothing special flavor wise on any of our entrees. Long wait for food. Margaritas would be more appropriately called 'dwarf margaritas.'  I at one point found myself wondering how you can screw up ice water. Answer = put only three ice cubes in it and serve it tepid, if asked for more water, walk off with the glass and return it with the apparently standard three-cube tepid temp fill. Not a dining experience we'll be repeating unless he'll freezes over.
