Out of all the brunch spots I've frequented recently, Swan serves up my favorite French Toast!!!!! It is quite the generous portion, but it just left me wanting for more. What I loved most was the strawberry sauce on top of the toast, which I think, skyrockets this classic brunch dish into super stardom. You can totally totally skip the maple syrup. More strawberry sauce, please!\n\nI came here on a Sunday afternoon, and the wait time was no longer than ten minutes.  It is very old school; it's got that outdated look plus the original coca-cola freezer that has now been turned into an oyster bar.\n\nI can't speak much on the coffee, but my mimosa was just what I needed!  I tried the Ceasar as well, which was extra piccante!
