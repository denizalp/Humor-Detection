My New Years resolution is to stop drunk Yelping. I wrote a review ages ago that I forgot all about, whoops. It was harsh, double whoops. I get a little mouthy when I'm drunk. What can I say? I was expecting it to be like the one in NYC. The one in NYC is amazing because of the great crowd. However, Vegas doesn't have that kind of crowd... Anywhere! You will not find gorgeous supermodels in Vegas, period. So I set my expectations a little too high. \n\nUpon my most recent trip to Vegas, we re-visited 1 Oak. I guess they worked out all the kinks.\n\nThe music was great and they played a lot of hip-hop. We wanted a break from the EDM scene and so 1 Oak was perfect. They also have big dj's so make sure to figure out what type of music is playing. At least there is a variety unlike most clubs in Vegas that ONLY play EDM. Ugh! I like house but sometimes I don't feel like hearing the same boom boom boom ALL night. I think 1 Oak is the only club that doesn't strictly play EDM.\n\nThe general line was long. Yes. The best thing to do is get a table or contact a promoter beforehand. Yes it's squished if you don't get bottle service but it's Vegas...it will be squished anywhere sans a table.
