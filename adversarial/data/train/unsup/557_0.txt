The duck. It's quite good. 16 spices cover this savory main course and goes very well with a sweet red wine. Very choice. \n\nThe dark colors enveloping the surrounding atmosphere and the placing of the tables are nice.  You have enough space between people which I like. It's not too crowded. \n\nGood service there. I admit I got lost with the wine and which one I wanted. You get a quick taste of a wine you chose and if you approve you're supposed to nod in approval which I almost pulled off. Trust me though, I don't think I would have scoffed and chosen another wine because the first wasn't to my satisfaction. \n\nThe table we chose seemed like the best for people watching and enough space between you and other tables. I liked that. Great conversation and great food. I have good memories here and will come back again.
