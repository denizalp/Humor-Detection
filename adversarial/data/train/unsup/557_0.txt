Running injury sent me here.  I do like the physiotherapist that i was assigned to.  She's quite helpful and after a couple treatments - I'm back up and running again.  (Her name is Celeste)\n\nI do though find the the admin staff a bit standoffish and even rude at times.  They chitchat & laugh amongst themselves while clients wait to be acknowledged. Anyways - small annoyance.\n\nAlso - I clearly indicated on my form that they can send me email reminders instead of call - but they still call everytime.
