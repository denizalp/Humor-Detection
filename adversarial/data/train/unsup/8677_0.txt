In Cleveland's Little Italy, this is the best pizza I've had in the neighborhood. Not that that's necessarily saying much, because Mama Santa's is extremely overrated. But it is hope I suppose. \n\nValentino's is a small take-out only joint. Order ahead and pick-up or grab a slice to go. The pizza is cooked in a regular gas fired stone oven. The same as most restaurants have in their kitchen. The pizza we chose was the 14\" Valentino's Deluxe. The crust was chewy, yet firm, the sauce, flavorful, the toppings well portioned and the mozzarella, adequate to hold it all together. The one thing stood out to me was the olives. Whole, luscious looking kalamata olives sitting atop this pizza, unlike the boring black mushed up slices that come from a can like most other pizza joints. Actual real, healthy looking olives! What a concept!
