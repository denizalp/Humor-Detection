Went in tonight for the very first time. \nAMAZING!!!  Beats Carrabas, beats Brio and beats several casino places. \nHad Linguine Pesto with chicken and it blew my socks off.  My wife had Chicken Scaloppini and loved her food.  Nice cab table wine.  Made fresh bread with a garlic oil to dip into.  \nGreat owners and people there.\nWILL BE BACK NEXT WEEK!!!
