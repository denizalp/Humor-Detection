Stuck here for 3hrs on a layover.  What to do, what to do?  This airport is huge.  It seems to be the main hub for all flights in the southwest.  Stop off at the gift shop to scan the magazine racks.  OK, that keeps me busy for only 20 min.  What else to do?  Let's try to catch up on some reviews.  What's it gonna cost me to get online?  Hmmm...Sky Harbor Public WLAN?  Could it be?  YES!!!  FREE WI-FI!!!  Makes the layover that much more bearable.
