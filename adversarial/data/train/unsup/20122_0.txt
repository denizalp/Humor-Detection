I hate to admit that my familiarity with celebrity restaurants on the Strip is few and far between due to budget constraints.\n\nJust like any casino, hotels and restaurants on the Strip have one objective in mind which is quite blatant in Giada.  New York Times' Pete Wells compared the space to a museum since everything from the napkins to the plates to the tons of retail merchadise showcase the brand of Giada de Laurentiis, Italian-born American celebrity chef.\n\nThis profit-driven objective may be easily be overlooked by well-heeled diners with its tasteful but casual interiors and satisfying food.  You are greeted with counters of freshly made pasta and antipasto at the entrance.  The space is relaxed, chic and beautiful, with views of the Strip.  $100 will get you satisfied for lunch, but for dinner and drinks, you'll definitely need $200\/head or more.\n\nServing sizes are a little small, but the quality of food is excellent.  I really enjoyed the seared tuna bruschettas, the scallop risotto and the Tomahawk steak was excellent.  There are evil servers wheel around a dessert cart coaxing you to spend some more.  Giada is a well-oiled machine to please, but make sure you read the fine print.  To view more photos, check out my blog. :) http:\/\/findingtheyummyinvegas.com\/dinner-party-giada\/
