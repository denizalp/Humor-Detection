Was Charles who walked me through the ordering process awesome? Yes.\nIs the price right? Yes.\nWas it speedy? Yes\nWere my dumps delish? Yes.\n\nBut I left there wanting a little bit more. I mean for something with so much square footage, there isn't much variety. Meat or potato, that's all you get. And while I understand that's their thing... I wonder if they could fill that out a little bit more because tonight I had both meat and potato and don't feel like I need to rush back there. \n\nNow all that said, they were tasty, and my 4star rating is based on the fact that I really dug the entire experience... just a little something more than two options would make this place more of a go to for me. I will say that I love that in their move from State to Gorham they've made some solid food upgrades. They use an organic flour, Wisconsin potatoes and black earth meats, whereas Charlie told me before, everything was from Sysco. \n\nHow about a salad? \nA soup? \nAnything with color?
