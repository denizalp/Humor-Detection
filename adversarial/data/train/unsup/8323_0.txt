It's hard to not be jealous of these guys, introducing Detroit style Coney Island hot dogs to Cleveland.  As  I hail from the \"D\", I was really looking forward to seeing if they actually got it right.\n\nThey did....really truly did.\n\nExcept for the lack of a loud Greek guy yelling from the line, the food at the The Coney Company is true to form.  They use a local (Detroit) chili company, and have the authentic natural casing hot dogs.  They offer all the favorites like a \"loose coney\"  and \"coney taco\".  The dogs were cooked perfectly, toppings perfect, and the buns sealed the deal.  \n\nThis is a family run joint, and they were there, with great service.  It's clean, easy to find, and very affordable. \n\nSupport local business and keep Detroit chili in the CLE!!
