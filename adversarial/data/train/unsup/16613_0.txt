The first time I tried Spinato's pizza was when my friend introduced me to it with carryout over the summer.  We went with the thin crust pizza and I really enjoyed it. The next time I was in town I stopped in and tried the restaurant itself, and really had a good time.\n\nI don't know what this place was before, but I swear it used to be a Chili's. I could be wrong, but either way, its really well decorated.  Warm well decorated interior with a full bar and a great menu. Lots to choose from, and not just pizza (even though its their specialty.)\n\nI really like the decor of this place. Not overstated, but classy enough that you can take your parents here and not have them freak out like mine do.  It feels like a great date spot too.  Service was great, and I really had a good time and the pizza and salad that I had were tasty.  I would come here again in a heartbeat. Check it out, worth the trip if you want something different and want to have a good time.
