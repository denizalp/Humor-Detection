My husband had been raving about some sliders he had here a while back so we decided to stop by on our way home from the movies. \n\nWe walked in but weren't greeted, we were just asked if we were 21 and asked to present our ID's which we did. After that we were told we could sit wherever we wanted and the bartender took our drink orders, she was not friendly. \n\nAfter a few minutes, a waiter emerged from the back, the bartender asked him to bring out our drinks to us, he placed them down and handed us menu's. My husband said it wasn't the same menu as last time, so the waiter mentioned that they had just moved into the kitchen, so it's now Tony Big's Pizza N Pasta, serving food inside of Putter's, he also said they weren't accepting debit at the time, only cash. We still decided to order anyways. \n\nItem's Ordered:\n-Chili Cheese Burger ($7.75)\n-BBQ Crispy Chicken Sandwich ($8.99)\n\nOur food came out quick and piping hot. The fries were crispy, plain, but still good. My burger was good as well, the patty was seasoned well, it was juicy, and the bun was soft and fluffy. The burger was topped with shredded lettuce, string onions, mozzarella cheese, and chili, which also had good flavor, but I felt that it needed more chili powder. I didn't try my husbands chicken sandwich but he said it was great, messy though so beware. Our waiter was very friendly, checked up on us to make sure everything was good, he was very attentive, and brought out condiments before we even received our food. Excellent service, good food. As for our beverages, the bloody mary I ordered from the bartender was good but as I stated before, she was not friendly, nor was she attentive, so hopefully next time we come in, there's a different bartender. I'm only rating 4 stars because of the restaurant, but I'll be back because I want to sample more food on the menu.
