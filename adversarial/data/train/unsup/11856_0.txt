I've seen my extremely picky father 100% satisfied with a restaurant 3 times in my entire life. This was one of them.\n\nAfter yet another failed attempted of trying to go Raku (which seems to always and forever be booked solid on my trips to Vegas), my dad and I decided to walk over to Takashi instead, since Raku's hour long wait was too much for us (we were pretty hungry). We managed to snag the very last table. We each decided on a course menu - 10 course for me (29$) and 12 course for him (39$). Despite the stellar reviews, I wasn't really expecting my dad to enjoy it (he's the definition of a sushi snob).\n\nBut after course after course of incredibly fresh, delicious Japanese goodness (from oysters to sashimi to sushi to soba noodle salad to tempura to soup to dessert), I've found a new all-time favorite that I'll definitely be going to whenever I'm in Vegas. Everything was perfect - the food, the price, and the service. And seeing my dad so enamored by a restaurant (something that happens as often as certain cosmic phenomena, meaning every decade or so) was a rare pleasure. He didn't complain once! Miracles do happen!\n\nOverall, I highly, highly recommend Takashi. It's fantastic!
