Oh man oh man, this is a hidden, don't know until you order a pita from here. It rocks, a lot. The pita I got was beef, I meant to order the Gyro which is the traditional beef and lamb and it looks like the one in the picture but I was so damn hungry I forgot. I got a side of onion rings instead of fries as a test to see if it was on the menu because it was good or just on the menu but no one ever orders it, yes I trick these places to get the best reviews for my faithful friends online at Yelp. The pita bread was soft and thick more like a greek pita you get at a restaurant, grilled and soft. There was beef steak, not just small chopped up steak and the lettuce was shredded and tasted fresh. The key to this was the Tzatziki sauce, tangy, thick, not runny and not salty, just cool flavor. I wanted to eat another one right after I finished but got it to go and realized that I was in the living room after inhaling the pita with no regards to my surroundings, it was that good. I would like to thank the owner and the pita guy too, they were super chill and friendly, not that the place was shady, but it literally is a hole in the wall that you pass by while saying \"another shishtouk place\" woohoo. You actually will be saying woo f$^%ing hoo after having one of these bad boys.
