Butt Out is amazing! Andrew was awesome and so nice! They have everything you need to start vaping or to continue vaping! You are not rushed to make a decision. I actually felt like they would not mind if we sat there and tested their juices all day. Their juices are delicious! I have been vaping for about a year and a half and had become a little bored with it. Andrew and Matt got me excited about it again! I got their banana nut bread, Lucy in the Sky and Nutella (sans the calories). All delicious! These guys are very genuine and are happy to help with any questions you may have. The only complaint I have is that they do not have 'Butt Out' in Atlanta! :( I am sure I will be making internet orders from them soon. I want to give them ALL my vaping allowance! I highly recommend going to see them if you are in Phoenix!
