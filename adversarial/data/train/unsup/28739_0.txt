Located directly across the street from the ROM it is a good location for brunch. We were seated by the windows in the front and quickly served drinks. I opted for fresh orange juice and that was a real treat. Paired with my eggs in a hole meal I was so happy. A bagel topped with bacon and two eggs inside. Of course it was all topped with cheese. Side of home fries as well. This was the perfect meal before roaming through the museum all day.
