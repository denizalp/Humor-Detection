This spot was recommended by a friend after having a conversation about food being one of the things we miss most about Hawai'i. Apparently it's owned by the same people who own Kahuku Superette located in, you guessed it, Kahuku on Oahu's North Shore. Kahuku Superette is known for some of the best poke on the island and I can definitely vouch for it. \n\nI can't say that this is the best local food I've had while living here in Vegas, but it wasn't terrible. My family and I came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, which I guess is a bad time to come if you want poke because they had no spicy ahi left. There was only enough left to make the poke bowl that my sister had ordered. The poke is priced a little higher than other places I've been to in the valley, but it was good. I liked that the fish was cut into small pieces.\n\nMeat Jun- It was just okay. The meat was thinly sliced, just how I like it. Pan fried in a traditional sweet egg wash. It definitely needs the sauce that it's served with. I'm disappointed that the rice wasn't sticky. It was rather dry. Mac salad made up for it though! Can't go wrong with mac salad, right?\n\nFried Noodles- The typical fried saimin noodles with chicken, fish cake, and a variety of veggies mixed in. I wasn't a fan. The dish was extremely bland and the chicken was completely dried out. It needed more than shoyu!\n\nI also ordered a side of kimchi. Don't waste your dollar! The kimchi didn't even look fermented and it lacked that tangy flavor.\n\nIf you have room for dessert, I would recommend the guava cake. I don't think it's made in-house and it was a little on the dry side, but it was good and satisfied my sweet tooth after a savory meal.\n\nThe menu is reasonably priced and the customer service is great! Overall, a decent place to fulfill your Hawaiian\/local food cravings. Kanak attack for sure! If I come back, it'll definitely be to try the garlic shrimp.
