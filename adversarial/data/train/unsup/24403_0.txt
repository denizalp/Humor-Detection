I thought I took a photo, but I guess not. It might be because I was distracted. \n\nWhen I arrived in an Uber and exited the car, I saw a doorman outside. It made me think of a non-fiction book I read about a Las Vegas doorman. That story was about a guy who destroyed his back, developed a perpetual cough, and ruined his marriage by working as a doorman. I asked the doorman if he read the book. He said, \"No.\" \n\nThen I explained what happened to the doorman from the book. The doorman at TI gave me a nasty look. \n\nThis is a problem of mine. I sometimes jump before looking at what's below. It can also be good because I don't like games and want answers immediately. \n\nI got an immediate answer at TI without having to ask anyone anything. Let me be blunt: The poker room here sucks. It is by far the worst poker room in Las Vegas. It's small, there is only one game running, the employees seem to hate working there, and there is no character to the room. Can you at least put a picture on the wall? Maybe the Suicide King or something? Shoot ... it could be the 2 of hearts. Anything!!! \n\nIf you're a poker player and you want to feel like you're dying, go here. If you would rather feel alive, walk right past it without even acknowledging its existence. And I predict it won't exist much longer. \n\nThe three stars is because TI has good moderately-priced food (and a pirate ship).
