I was looking for an organic food market other than Wholefoods,\nI went to Glazier's to check it out. Well well it is basically Winco quality and type of food with WF prices....\n\nThey do have a small organic\/gluten free section, and some imported stuff ( Goya brand that reminded me Jon's market in LA...)\n\nThe place is not modern or new, a funky smell all over the store....\n\nDefinitely not what I was looking for.
