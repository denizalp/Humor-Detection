Super cute and small ice cream shop with a lot of unique flavours. I was pleasantly surprised that with a small cup you were able to pick two scoops. I ended up picking Earl Grey and Hojicha (roasted green tea) and they were both amazing. Tasted exactly like how the drinks should taste, but ice cream versions. I was also able to try my friends' scoops which were a variety of different fruit flavoured ones and they were also great. Overall I don't think you can go wrong with this place!
