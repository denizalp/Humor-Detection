If you need a high chair don't even bother  I've been trying to come here since they have opened, driving from centennial hills well we have tried 3 times and hey were super busy so we just left finally we were able to come early. We waited in line and ordered them went to sit down and realized they have no high chairs??! You gotta be kidding me??!! Waste of my time and gas  two thumbs down! Get it together zero Degrees
