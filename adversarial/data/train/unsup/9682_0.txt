Go anywhere else but here! Ridiculously over priced! My consultation for a cut and color was $325. They are not a high-end salon. They are located within some random strip mall. Customer service is horrible. The one Mexican hairstylist, sorry can't remember her name, was rude and condescending. I am also a woman of color so I have darker natural hair which she should understand. However, customer service is not important to them. Just a very money greedy salon. Why waste your money on something not worth it when there are so many other salons out there?
