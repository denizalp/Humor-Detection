Was there last night.  Food was, as usual, good.  One of my favorites is the Gobi Manchurian that is crispy and spicy.  My whole family and my friends love this, so I was disappointed when the server told me they no longer serve this.  Instead, there is only a Gobi Manchurian served with green peppers in a sauce with a side of rice.  It tasted good, but isn't the Gobi Manchurian I love.
