I just got married at the Mon Bel Ami yesterday and had a wonderful ceremony in their gazebo, they were great from the limo ride over all the way through.  Our minister was amazing my husband is French and was nervous about repeating the vows in English he spoke slowly and clearly for Ben to understand.  We had the cake and  real champagne toast after which was wonderful and very reasonably priced we were not rushed at all and it was a lovely experience I am very happy to recommend them
