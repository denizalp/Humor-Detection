They say that there are three rules in restaurants:\n\n1) Location, 2) Location, and 3) Location.\n\nOkay... so I'm not entirely sure that those rules apply only to restaurants... but they *ARE* important considerations. So what does that have to do with tasty Thai food? Cool your caballo, I'm getting around to it.\n\nYou see, this restaurant offers solid Thai food. Indeed, it's *REALLY GOOD* Thai food. And with enough visits, I could give it another star. The problem is, to get to this restaurant, I have to drive past another Thai restaurant which I've already given five stars to. An exceptional restaurant which I won't name for fairness's sake, but one that I'd have a hard time driving past if I was craving Thai food. So honestly, that's really the biggest flaw that I can find with this place... and who knows? Maybe I'll find myself coming here a few more times just to give it that extra star. Who knows.\n\nWe ordered the fresh rolls with shrimp, Panang curry with beef, spicy noodles with beef, and the mango sticky rice.\n\nThe fresh rolls were delicious, fat, and stuffed full of crisp veggies... but were distinctively skimpy on the shrimp. Worth mentioning, however, was the homemade peanut sauce. It was *AMAZING* and really needs to be tried. They do a great job with it here. The spicy noodles were good, though the slices of beef weren't the best flank steak I've ever had. The Panang curry was tasty, and so was the dessert.\n\nEverything was *good* here, but nothing really smacked me upside the head. Granted, they're up against some stiff competition in my book, but a little competition never hurt anyone...
