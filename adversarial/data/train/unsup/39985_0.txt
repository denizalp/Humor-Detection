The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is the food tasted fine. Service was awful. I called in a carry out and they game me a 20 min window I arrived 5 mins early therr are workers all over seemingly waiting to do something, pay and wait I'm the only person in the place aside from a few people who were eating. Cashier tell me it'll be just a few mins. As I wait people come in after me and order and leave with their orders I finally (after now waiting 15 mins after my promised pickup time so 35 mins now) and I finally get someone to stop chatting with each other to ask if I needed something I let him know I have been waiting for 15 minutes after the 20 minutes my pizza was promised so he goes to check and a few mins later a woman comes up unapologetic no smile nothing and grabs the stuff on the counter and pizza from the warmer (mind you no one said anything about my order being ready) and she looks at me still no cordial bone in her body and says \"Have you paid yet\" and I nicely answered \"yes\" she looks at me and moves my order to the computer (does not tell me anything as to what she is doing) and keeps typing stuff up and finally says \"here you go\". Still no apology or recognition and the only nice words were to tell me have a nice night still emotionless face no smile and very inscencere. So I am not sure why there are 8 people \"working\" when there is no sort of process. \n\nThis was my first time ever having Barros and with this experience it will probably be my last mind you it's even the closest place to me and I still probably will not go. Thanks for the poor experience but I will take my manners elsewhere and strongly recommend you pay attention to experience it's kind of a big deal. All I did was carryout who knows how it would be if I asked for delivery or dined in.
