Before the days of gluten free, fat free, low sodium diets and the trend towards healthy eating, people would sometimes be in the mood for a well made greasy burger. You old timers know what I'm talking about, the kind of food that gives you the \"itis\" (look it up in an urban dictionary) and puts you in a food coma.\n\nWell! Butcher's Son knows how to put together a juicy, medium rare burger. Their special today was a brisket burger with double smoked bacon, a fried tomato and BBQ aoili. I loved the patty but what stood out for me was the delicious bacon: thick cut, smoky, crispy but not hard with a perfect fat to meat ratio.\n\nI just thought they were only a butcher's shop but they offer so much more. They have home made soups and chilis, single serve pot pies, lasagna, mini pizzas. There are marinated individual chicken breasts and marinated whole chickens, also Salem's Lott Scary Hot Sauces for sale and a small selection of goodies from Leah's bakery.\n\nI was eyeing their gorgeously marbled steaks; I can't wait to come back to try it in their sandwiches! Friendly and helpful staff.
