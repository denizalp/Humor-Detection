Welcome to the 4th location of this great Mexican chain restaurant! The new location opened up on Labor day and the decor makes you feel exactly like you are in Mexico. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.\n\nThe menu is identical to the menu you get at the other three locations. In this case I was having lunch with my daughter. They serve complimentary chips and they have a special lunch menu where you can get a meal for under $10.00. They have a birthday club which you can join which you will get an email with a buy one get one free entree.\n\nI ordered my favorite the arroz con pollo with rice and salad. My daughter had two burritos with rice and refried beans. Portion sizes are generous so be prepared to come hungry! Take out is also available. \n\nEmiliano's is located in McCandless Crossing right next to Lowe's. There is plenty of free parking and has a great menu. They have both men and ladies restroom along with a family or gender neutral one.\n\nWill definitely return to visit again in the near future.
