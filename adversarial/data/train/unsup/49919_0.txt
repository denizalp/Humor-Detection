The food is ok at this restaurant, but in my opinion is quite overpriced and not worth the massive lines that are ALWAYS there.\nBut what IS worth the wait? THE CHEESECAKES! You will wait about 20 minutes (expect to add to that on a Saturday night) to order and receive your cheeaecake, but it is soooooooooooo worth the wait. They have at least 30 different varieties to pick from (which makes for a few minutes of intense anxiety when deciding) and I haven't had a bad one yet! \nTake my advice, go eat your meal somewhere else and take the money you save and then come here and buy extra slices of this heavenly cheesecake!
