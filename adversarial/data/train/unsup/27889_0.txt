Recently went and hired snowshoes and XC ski package from these in the last couple of weeks and was really satisfied with the gear and how it is organised.\nPrices are very competitive, I hired the XC ski gear on Friday pm and returned Monday pm for $35, couldn't find any one else near that.\nThey have tons of gear whatever you want to try, so thumbs up from me!
