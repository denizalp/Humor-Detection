Sweaty Betty's is a place that I go to. Beyond that, it's a place that I like to go. \n\nIt's like going into Ronnie's 069, only it's less scary and the music is usually better. The small back room here has a couch that I like to sit on. Others think it might have bed bugs... they need to get a grip. \n\nLast night I ended up on an accidental double date, and three out of four of us thought Sweet B's was the place to hit. The fourth can't legally vote in Belle Canada, so he didn't get a say. We drank good beer and bad tequila and sat in the back. We also got a pickle bowl, as one does here. The tiny forks are the cutest. \n\nAs I leaned into my fave couch we realized we were in a room full of Irish people. Drunk fun Irish people! They were on their way to The Dog And Bear for Karaoke, naturally I made a Commitments joke. Then 4 blokes gave me and the lovely lady next to me their best \"Roid Sally Roid\" and my life was made. \n\nPEPPER PROPS To Roddy Doyle. The Commitments, The Snapper and The Van are all solid books.
