I ended up here in June, still on my quest for the ultimate foot spa. My boyfriend said that I could get a massage for my birthday, so I picked Andy's. They were busy the night I was there, so I waited out in the lobby on a couch for about 10 minutes, before being ushered in.\n\nMy body was not ready.\n\nI'm going to keep it quick and just say that my massage here was really good. Very thorough, and they get into it here. No \"lazy strokes\" and \"baby rubs\" allowed! \n\nWait. This is starting to sound too sexual LOL.\n\nWhat I experienced was very well done, amazing technique here. I just had the basic one, but it is anything but basic! I really love this place. The first reason I can't give full stars is because there are no private areas (unless you pay more). The main room is everyone, all together. Just splayed out. At this spa, you get a really good back massage, not just a good foot one. They pay just as much attention to your back as your feet..... But you pretty much have to get almost nekkid for it. \n\nMy undies were really low, and the towel pulled low as well. My upper butt area was totally exposed! And when he wanted to do my shoulders and upper back, I had to remove my bra. I decided it would be cool to wear my sports bra that night, so I had to lift up and pull it over my head... You get the drift. Just.... Don't wear a sports bra lol.\n\nNormally, this doesn't bother me, but because you are just out with a bunch of other strangers, they could see plenty of butt and side boob, I'm sure. It was hard for me to concentrate on the massage and relax, because I had no privacy.\n\nAnyway, if the no privacy thing doesn't bother you at all, then by all means, COME HERE! You will not be disappointed, it's a wonderful massage.\n\nNow the bad news. This is the second reason why I couldn't give full stars.\n\nThe tipping pressure here is real. When we were done, I tipped my masseuse personally. I walked out to the front desk, where the slightly grumpy manager\/desk person was sitting. He said something in Chinese to the guy, and then told my boyfriend, \"Ok, you owe me $20.\" I thought, \"uhhh, yeah?... That's the price, right?...\" \n\nMy bf speaks Chinese, and I asked what he said when we got outside. I guess he had asked my masseuse if I had tipped already. So If I had not, then the price would have probably gone up to $30. Sort of a dick move, if you ask me. I mean, if you are gonna be sneaky, at least make sure your customer can't understand what you are saying LOL.
