We ALWAYS get carried away and order toooooo many dishes.\nAnd always save room (or just take home leftovers) for dessert.\nI have been here about a dozen times so I will highlight some of our favorites:::::::::::::::\n\norange chicken- this is my favorite dish. If I have curry...the chicken gets to swim in curry :)\n\nbrown rice- it's always perfect and I always order extra because we always have leftovers\n\nsizzling beef- be sure that you like very crisp red and green peppers because it has a lot\n\nvegetable curry- yes, yes and more yes...it's perfect and not toooo spicy and it has home-style potatoes in it, delish\n\nvegetables in tamarin curry- amazing! similar to the regular curry but it has a different flavor and is spicier\n\nroti with curry- an even different curry than the vegetable curry with the little home-style potatoes floating in it, dipping the fresh pillowy like bread into the curry is divine\n\nfried veggie dumpling- watch out they are hot...and wow they are good crispy and soft yummy veggie inside\n\nveggie app sushi roll (April monthly app special)- this is a monthly fav and it's possibly the best thing I have ever put in my mouth ever LOL! it's an all veggie \"sushi\" roll, he uses very very thin mushroom to mock the nori and then the whole thing is deep fried...it's sooo creamy from the avocado it makes me want one just typing this...I'm pretty sure it's San-J Organic Reduced Sodium Gluten Free Tamari Soy Sauce that is drizzled on the top after and its served with some pickled ginger\n\nthai tea- wow it is lightly sweetened and does not give me auto diabetes when I drink it like normal thai tea \"mixes\" sooooo good and they seem to use a bland or coconut and almond milk to top it off\n\nYOU HAVE TO SAVE ROOM FOR THIS: vegan avocado ice cream with lotus chips, just get it believe me you will be amazed! the crispy lotus chips are like addictive potato chips just plain awesome\n\nI could go on and on forever but these are a few of our regular favorites. \n\nAs far as the service (forgot to talk about that :) it's always an A+ prompt, sweet, and funny!
