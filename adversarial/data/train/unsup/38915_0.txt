We've been ordering \"To Go\" Orders since July 2017, 2-3 TIMES a month.  Appears your \"to go\" orders keep getting CHEAPER on the sides (rice ETC). It's disappointing when you drive all the way there and you get such little side order of rice with all that meat and sauce... Note to self Tandoori Times... Stay constant when your fill your orders TO-GO orders and fill them like WE ARE CUSTOMERS DINING AT YOUR TABLES.  \nWe no longer eat at your restaurant - service is slow, wine is horrible, table and chairs super uncomfortable...but your food is good and that's the ONLY reason why we keep coming back...
