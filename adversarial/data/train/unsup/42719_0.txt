Just as good as the Mesa location.  We had an excellent experience.  And love that this location just opened within walking distance to our home.  I had the margarita flight, all 3 were delicious and full of flavor, their salsa is one of the best I've had out.  I liked the Lobster Con Queso app and my dinner was awesome; The double barrel ENCHILADAS - a must try.
