Walking into this salon I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere, the upscale look, elegance and lack of typical nail salon odor. However, this gave me higher standards than I should have had. I called to see if they were busy before walking in without an appointment. I just needed a fill and wanted black nail polish. Nothing too fancy. Fortunately they were not busy at all, so I was seated right away. The nail tech didn't really greet me or talk to me a lot, which isn't usually a problem, however, he made me feel very uncomfortable. The whole experience seemed very rushed and as if I was a burden to him. I knew he was judging my nails and the length of time I've waited to get them filled (Hey, I work two jobs...). He kept telling me to relax my hands, but instead of nicely saying it in a reassuring voice, it was more of a demand. Relaxing after this was of course impossible.\n\nI asked him if he could file my nails a little shorter than they were and he said no, that with a fill he cannot file them any shorter. I've never had a nail tech deny filing my nails...\"okay then\", I thought, \"I'll file them when I'm home.\" He did a nice job on the front of my nails, but underneath it's pretty messy. Not smooth at all and he left some polish on my hands. While I was waiting for my nails to dry I accidently bumped one nail against the table and smudged it, but I was actually worried he'd be mad at me if I told him. So I thought, \"Ugh, I guess I'll just fix it at home...\"\n\nI shouldn't feel intimidated by a nail tech. They should always be friendly, professional and make every customer comfortable. When I left the salon, nobody even blinked or acknowledged me leaving. Usually when I leave any store, salon, etc, I'm told to have a good night or at least thanked.\n\nMy fill cost $21.60, which is the most I've ever paid for a fill. I could get a full set with french tips where I normally go for $25.
