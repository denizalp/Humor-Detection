My husband and I got married 2 1\/2 years ago and I could not have asked for a better wedding!! I always share, with fondness, our wedding day at Mon Bel Ami. We got a package and they handled EVERYTHING! I was so nervous about the stress that comes with wedding planning and they eased every worry and met me with nothing, but assurance and comfort that my wedding day would be special. It was. The flowers were beautiful, the venue was perfect, cake tasted great, reception was fun, and the pictures were gorgeous. Thank you so much! I always say I wish I could marry him again! It was such an amazing, unforgettable day!
