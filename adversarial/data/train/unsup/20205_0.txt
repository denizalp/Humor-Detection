BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL........PARKING COST US $290!!!!! When you park in the dirt lot behind Paz to the north you will get a $290 parking ticket for parking in a non dust free lot. The signs posted 'park at your own risk' don't mean valuables in your car, it means you're not supposed to park there even tho everyone does. And no heads up from Paz staff......the server could of whispered something in our ear.\n\nOther than that.....drinks were good, food was yummy, street corn da bomb and service was good. Still can't believe we got a friggin parking ticket. So much for trying to support local businesses.
