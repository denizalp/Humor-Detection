When you have a toddler appointments can be a bit stressful ... thankfully Kidtastic seems to understand this . Walked in and was signed in right away. The waiting room had a ton of different activities from a table with toys on it , books and a kids  movie  playing he was entertained . We barely had time to  play  with a toy before  they called him back . Not only was everyone friendly, but I didn't feel rushed as they let my almost 2 year old explore his surroundings.  The assistant was great she brought in a tooth brush just in case he needed distraction. . They also had a movie playing over the dental chair so cool ! Thankfully my little guy did not fuss at all and felt extremely informed after the appointment . The Dr. didn't seem to mind my billion questions regarding his teeth in 10 years (hahaha I tend to get ahead of my self ) He was amazing with my dude and   he seemed to be comfortable with him ! \n\nPlus after they get a token and  pick out a toy !! \n\nAmazing Place they get kids and mom's too !
