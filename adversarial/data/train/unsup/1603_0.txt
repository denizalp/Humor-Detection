okay, when i ordered their \"famous\" carnitas...i thought i would be getting at least MORE than one for $6! NOPE, i only got one small ass carnita! im telling you i was hungry as hell b\/c my bf and i had drank quite a bit a from the other night so you guys already know im gonna need some food in my system and water.\n\ni was so shocked that it was only ONE carnita for that price..dont get me wrong..it was pretty damn good. but DAMN, seriously?  i ordered their hot and soup since our waitress did say their plates do run small and now i know why she meant by small ..she meant quantity. (hence the ONE carnita!) she did also say it is a sharing type of dining experience but how am i supposed to share with that one carnita and a med size bowl of hot and sour soup?!?!\n\nmy bf ordered their mole carnita and yes it was small and there was only one. my guy can eat and i dont know why i was more dissapointed than he was lol. you guys can tell i was hungryyy and my fattyass side was showing. he also ordered their street pork sandwich which was $10...and it was a the size of a mini and i mean MINI pancake.....i even said...\"are you serious??\" \n\nservice was good, a little too invasive and too pushy for me..probably it was b\/c our waitress was training but it was little bit too much..always trying to talk to us when we were eating..trying to make us buy more small size entrees...i totally get what they are trying to do but girl i gotta eat in peace!!\n\nour bill was $30 for those 2 carnitas, 1 small ass sandwhich and a bowl of hot and sour soup. \n\ni personally wouldnt try this place again bc of the portions and prices but if youre looking for that asian\/mexican fusion place...this is it for you. BUT if you are a fat ass like myself or need that good amt of food in your system..this isnt your place.
