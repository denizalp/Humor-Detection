We went because we got a comp. The food was decent and the portions were huge the seafood seemed fresh we had the steamed clams for an app and then i had the diablo pasta which was good, it had lots of scallops and shrimp and lobster my bf had the fried scallops and shrimp.about $80 for an app and two entrees that were kind of bland. A bit pricey and i don't think we would have gone if it was not free.
