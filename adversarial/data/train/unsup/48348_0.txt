I Love breakfast here! I wish I lived closer......Every time I'm in town, we go here for simply the Best breakfast around! Awesome Pancakes, Amazing Eggs and Bacon too, you really can't go wrong. Easy location in Scottsdale, yummy food, great drinks! My go to breakfast location! My favorites are protein pancakes, or the Nutella crepes and lastly they have great coffee to seal the deal! I'm a fan!
