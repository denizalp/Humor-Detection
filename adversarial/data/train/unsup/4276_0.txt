This is probably one of the few hotels I have to visit every time I'm in Vegas.  It's not just a beautiful place to stay in (I love the suites that face the Strip), but simply walking through the hotel is an adventure in and of itself.  Every few months or so, they change the decorations in their botanical garden to match the theme of an upcoming holiday or season.  It's always magnificently and artfully displayed, so make sure you bring your camera!  Sometimes, they may even have a little bird or butterfly exhibit (I think this occurs during the Spring time).  I also love the glass blown flowers on the ceiling of the lobby.  It is definitely worth seeing!\n\nThere are also beautiful couture shops and boutiques.  Bellagio has a great selection for those high end shoppers :)\n\nIf you're looking for a great show, catch O - a Cirque du Soleil show with a water theme.  Breathtaking acrobatics and costumes.. love it!\n\nLast but not least, the Bellagio has a beautiful water show.  I think it comes on every half hour, and it takes place right in the Bellagio fountain.  If you have a room that faces the Strip, you are in luck!  If not, don't sweat!  You can get front row views right on the Strip!  The water moves with the music, and when it crescendos, you can hear the thundering of the water.  It's truly a spectacular to see.  Check it out!
