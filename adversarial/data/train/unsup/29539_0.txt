We were in town for our son to race at Bootleg Canyon and stayed at the Sands Motel next door.  Our son wanted to carbo load for his next day's race, so we went there because pasta was on the menu.  What a cute place!  The food was really good, although I ordered the \"grilled\" pork chop that was actually battered and fried.  It was really good, but I would not have ordered it if I new it was going to be prepared that way.  The vegetables with it were perfectly cooked.  Great service.  We will go back if we are ever in that area again.  Prices were definitely reasonable for what we got.
