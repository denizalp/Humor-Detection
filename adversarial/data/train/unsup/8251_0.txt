When I moved to Las Vegas in 1993, this mall was the best in town.  Before all of the high end malls on the Strip were built, this was the place to go shopping.....well, all good things get crappy over time.  This place is really Ghetto now.  Was going to do some Christmas shopping, but walked around for 10 minutes and said \"screw this\" and left.\n\nWill I return?  No way.
