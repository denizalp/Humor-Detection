Review is for casino only, since I have never stayed in one of the rooms.\n\n(+) In a great location on the strip, you are connected(via tram) to the Mirage and within walking distance to Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, Encore, Harrahs, and Caesars. Also Fashion Show Mall just north of the property. Prime location, actually!\n(+) Slots have always at least given me some play and every now and again some money! One of the better places to play on the Strip, if you ask me.\n(+) casino is not too big and rather easy to navigate\n(+) Home of the first ever Cirque show on the Strip, Mystere. Great show. See separate review. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/cirque-du-soleil-myst%C3%A8re-las-vegas-2\n(+) Plenty of food and store options to choose from. Personally, I think I enjoyed Gilley's the most.\n(+) CVS on site near the sportsbook actually has some great prices for toiletries and whatnot that are very good considering your location.\n\n(-) I am not a fan of the some of the changes of recent years, namely losing the Pirate show, losing the skull and crossbones sign, and building that brown monstrosity of a building in the front of the bay. To me, it looks very out of place. I miss the old Treasure Island in a lot of ways.\n(-) Pool area is rather small considering the size and location of the property its self.\n(-) Some of the food outlets are not very good at all. Namely Senor Frogs and Kahunaville (which apparently just closed permanently!)\n\nFor the location, I believe TI offers a lot of value in a lot of ways. That being said, I do miss the old TI I remember from the 90's and early 2000's. I still swing by here a lot and bring friends and family by when they visit. It is still A-OK.\n\n3 stars.
