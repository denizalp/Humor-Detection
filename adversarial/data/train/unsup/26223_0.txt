We were randomly walking along Bloor St to find something to eat. My friend saw this place and there is always a line up but as we were early, there wasn't that many people so we decided to try. We started off with a cocktail - very strong AVERNA DE LA FAMILIA - Jose Cuervo Tradicionel, Averna, Lemon, Honey, Ginger Beer. I was ok but my friend was quite tipsy after the drink. Next, we got some GUACAMOLE AND CHIPS - chips was freshly fried and fresh guacamole. Also, we got K-MEX SLAW - Korean Cabbage, Avocado, Corn, Queso Fresco, Pineapple-Ginger Dressing. This is the first time I have this korean \/ mexican salad, but it was delicious. I love the sauce.\n\nFinally, the main tacos arrived. Between the 3 of us, we got 3 different types of taco and it was enough for us for sure. We were very full at the end. BAJA FISH - fried, guac kimchi joven - this was our favourite. Big chucks of fish fried and pour with sauce and kimchi to add a little kick. This was spicy enough for me but my friends piled on the extra spices. BRAISED SHORT-RIB - braised Beef in Ancho-Guajillo, Mole Rojo - now I know it is hard to eat with a crispy taco, everything spilled everywhere so it was pretty messy but in a good way. CHORIZO VERDE - poblano Chile Cured Pork. I didn't like this one as much as it was not as much things in the taco.\n\nNext time, I would for sure go back for the Baja fish and tried the other ones. They are all so good. My only complaint is that our tables were on high stools so no where to put my purse except on the floor.
