We were at BLD for a Saturday morning breakfast.  Place opened at 8, we were there at 8:10...so it wasn't busy and there was a gaggle of wait staff...all waiting around.  It took forever to get OJ, coffee and waters.  I am an Eggs Benedict fanatic and try them wherever I can.  These were the worst.  The eggs were way underdone.  The waiter was kind enough to remind me that this was the case with Eggs Benedict.  One of the eggs was so underdone that the yolk literally slid out of the runny poached egg white.  It looked like it gave birth in my plate!  On top of that, the Hollandaise was way too tart.  The waiter brought out another poached egg floating in water in a cereal bowl as a replacement.  I looked at him with a \"what the h@!* am I supposed to do with this\" look.  He took my plate and the bowl and returned with it on a toasted English muffin on the same plate...sans Hollandaise.\n\nThe general consensus:  there is nothing compelling enough to bring us back.
