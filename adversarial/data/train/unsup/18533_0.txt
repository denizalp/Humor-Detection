Here's the Montreal wrap-up review. Pre-flight Sunday funday took place at Marche Jean-Talon, a foodie smorgasbord of delightful delicacies sure to fancy and titillate the best Yelpers amongst us. Unlike the enclosed markets in the States (Chelsea Market, Ferry Market, and the like), Montreal's Marche Jean-Talon is open air, more European-leaning than American.\n\nOur motley crew bought this and that and snacked as desired, with many various shops, cuisines, and stations to choose from. Fresh fruits, fresh pastries, fresh uni, all went down the hatch. I wouldn't have minded a few more hours here and few less hitting the bottle, but alas, that will have to be a helpful tip for time next.
