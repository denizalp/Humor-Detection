We didn't golf and didn't care...that's how much fun this place was! The Friday of March Madness was epic.  They were slammed and the service was slow, but they apologized and it wasn't a big deal because the energy was incredible.  Really a must-do in Vegas.  The menu is huge and everything we ordered was delicious.  We regret not making a reservation, but it's noted for next time!! See you soon.
