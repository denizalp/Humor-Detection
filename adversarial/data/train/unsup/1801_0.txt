Simply amazing food! This was not Sonora Mexican food. This was fantastic Mexico City sopes, street tacos, mole, etc..the chili relleno had a the most delicious salsa on top, and the waitress, whose own mother was the chef, was so down to earth delightful. She suggested the chile nogada which is only available during certain times of the year and on Saturdays--it was like nothing I've ever tasted. The goat cheese sauce was divine. Exceptionally good prices. Overall wonderful experience!!
