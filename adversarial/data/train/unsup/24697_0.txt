I've had better than Genghis Grill.  Why is mongolian BBQ difficult to find these days?  I can't find one in my neighborhood and someone told me to try Genghis Grill out. Since I was going to be in Tempe, I figured WHY NOT?!  Genghis Grill is  not my thing. \n\nWe got seated and handed a small metal bowl, I was confused.  At the other mongolian places I have been, you start out with a big bowl not this dinky bowl.  So, I say \"whatever, fatty\" in my head and head over to the start line to get this meal going.  What do I see?  Nothing but the sickest thing I have seen in a long time.  A BIG-ASS BOWL of BLOODY MEAT, just sitting there in a bowl of blood.  I've never wanted to be a vegetarian so badly in my life.  I suppose I was used to YC's where the meat is frozen and shaved.   I don't like actually seeing the blood of a meat product, it really grosses me out.  \n\nAnyhow, the bowl didn't fit nearly as much food as other places, I guess it's good I didn't over -stuff myself but the price was higher and that whole  meat product area was really bad.  Oh and the scallops, I think they were scallops?  Anyhow it was like a bowl of white fluff (you know marshmallow fluff? in a far?) No real shape to them.    So this whole \"fresh\" meat, chicken area is one of the grossest things I have seen in a long time. \n\nI must say that after it was all cooked and brought to the table it was more than enough food and it tasted okay, not what I was expecting.
