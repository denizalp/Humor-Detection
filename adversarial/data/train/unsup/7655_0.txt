This place is a good location,but during lunch you have to park far away because, it is a little crazy. That is OK because,you need to walk after all those Calories right. \n The staff is friendly and very helpful. Since I had never been before they explained everything very nicely.\nThe menu is quite large for a burger joint.\n I got the Mushroom Burger sin mayo. It was very good. The fries are so so.\nNext time I will try the Sweet potato fries or the Smashfries. They look interesting.\nPrices are not too bad at all and the place is very clean. Which is very good!\nIn reading the menu I see you can even build your own Burger.\nChoosing your own type of Bun as well. It only took 10 min to get my items to go! I thought that was pretty good as the place was packed and they make it all from Scratch.\nI have driven by it 100's of time,so now I am glad that I finally stopped to check it out.
