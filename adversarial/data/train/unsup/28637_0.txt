I've been here many times food & service usually good till tonight. Went thru drive thru Brought dinner home. I'm 5 minutes away. Opened dinner kids meal fries were cold and hard & Gyro meat was hard and dried up! I called and spoke to William who claimed to be the manager so I told him what came in my bag & said that is typically not what we get. He hung up the phone. I thought well maybe we got disconnected. So I called back, my number is blocked so it comes up private, the phone disconnected again. After 2 more tries with the same result I unblocked my number, William answered, I said I thought at 1st we got disconnected. As soon as I said that he hung up again!\nSeriously ...who does that!! I was being nice cause it was late & perhaps someone was having a bad day.... After verifying that he did hang up on my call a few times, I am over it.\nThis guy is the manager? If this is the best they've got...I'd hate to see their worst. It's the end of Showmar's for me & my family!
