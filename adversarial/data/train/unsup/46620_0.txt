My wife and I decided to try out the breakfast brunch buffet at The Cheesecake Company at Northland Village Shops yesterday morning for the first time. We had the made-to-order omelette at the omelette bar. It was OK. They had a lot of non-breakfast foods, like roasts and lasagna, which is OK if you're interested in \nlunch, but we weren't. That wasn't a complaint, just an observation. Ordering from the menu was not an option during the brunch buffet.\n\nOn to the food. The bacon was cheap quality and not completely cooked. The sausages were OK. The fruit plate was great if you like melon. The croissants tasted day old. The waffles were very soggy and not very warm - same for the french toast. But the killer for me was the cheesecake. Now, if you know The Cheesecake Company, you know what kind of cheesecake they have. Huge. Tall cakes and big slices. The cheesecakes on the buffet were not those. These were the small, grocery store grade cheesecakes. This seemed like a real cheap-out to me and my wife agreed. Even another couple in the restaurant said the same thing. So as much as I hate to say this, definitely not worth $50 for two people. For a sample of a high grade breakfast buffet that is worth the money, go to Thompson's at the Hyatt downtown. You'll see what I mean.
