TMad! Aside from my all time favorite teriyaki spot in LA, Teriyaki Madness is probably my second fave. This location is brand spanking new and much more spacious than most of the restaurants around town. Come try it and you'll fall in love too. The chicken is so tender and tasty. The veggies are delicious too. I've recently been converted to brown rice from a certain someone...so now that's my go-to. ;) The shrimp tempura & edamame are highly recommend also. The yakisoba is just ok. It's a bit too greasy for my taste, I'd pass on that. They also offer low-carb plates and chicken bowls for the kiddos. Glad this place is so close by. We probably eat here about once a week, their catchphrase \"Highly Addictive\" is very true. \n\nTip: Sign up to receive text alerts for promotions & deals.
