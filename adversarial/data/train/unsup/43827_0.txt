I like this place!! I wasn't expecting it to be a bar\/billiard lounge along with an Italian cuisine. I will definitely be coming back to this place to come hang out and shoot some pool. \n\nMe and my boyfriend were craving pasta and I found this place on Yelp being the closest thing to me at the time. I was kind of skeptical over the reviews but I thought why not give it a try.\n\nI ordered their spaghetti and the pasta\/marinara sauce  was made exactly how I wanted. And their garlic bread was super addicting! I can't wait to go back I'm already craving their marinara sauce and meatball... 5 stars for this place!
