Mildred's Temple Kitchen is situated in liberty village, so despite the 45 minute wait for brunch on a Saturday morning, it wasn't all too bad because you can walk around in the nearby stores. The restaurant was quite big, and the lights and big windows made the interior really cute. The three of us got a corner seat with pillows, which made the experience extra cozy!\n\nUnlike what you'd expect from the name \"Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes,\" the pancakes were neither light nor fluffy. I was pretty surprised because they were actually more dense (like scones). Nonetheless, they still tasted amazing and paired really well with the blueberry compote! The best part may have been the maple syrup. Since the compote wasn't too sweet (surprisingly!), the syrup adds just the right amount of sweetness to the combination. I can't comment on the whipped cream- I opted out of that because I personally don't like whipped cream. I would definitely come back for the pancakes!\n\nI also ordered their weekend special, which consisted of two sunny side up eggs overtop maple glazed ham with BBQ sauce and jalapeño corn bread. It came with a side of mixed greens as well. I would say the eggs and ham were quite average, seeing as the BBQ sauce was quite overpowering. The corn bread was tasty- the jalapeño definitely added a nice (spicy) kick to it!\n\nLastly, I need to make a comment about my unique washroom experience at Mildred's. There are individual stalls, and it's as though you are on an Air Canada flight because they play the audio recording of announcements and safety procedures. Not too sure why they do this, but it was very interesting.\n\nI can't wait to come back to try Veda's Choice with smoked salmon (and the pancakes again)!
