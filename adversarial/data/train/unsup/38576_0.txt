We LOVED this place! The sangria was the best I've ever had and I'm a sangria snob. We only ordered the chicken chicharrones and the octopus because we were full but can't wait to go back to try more of the menu because it looks awesome. We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome! I would give 10 stars if I could!
