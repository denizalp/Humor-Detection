We love Humble Pie Pizza. Our favorites are the Pepperoni or the Meat Lovers, and the Fig & Prosciutto. This is great neighborhood place, all the servers and especially the bartenders are friendly and attentive. The have great apps but we normally order a Wedge salad and a Veggie salad and both are great. The pizza has the best crust and is definitely better than the run of the mill pizza place.
