Costco - where they keep the cost low. \nShopping for a family of 6, Costco trips are never cheap. However, they offer great deals with good quality in wholesale\/bulk sizes. Whether you're looking for fresh produce, a new mattress, or daily vitamins, Costco's got it. \n\nOf course, everybody knows to come to Costco for the samples throughout the aisles that could satisfy as a light lunch if you score enough servings. \n\nDo not sleep on their food court!! On my trip today, I ordered a full combination pizza ($9.99), two chicken Caesar salads ($3.99\/each), a chicken bake ($2.99), a churro ($1.00), and a very berry smoothie ($2.99) - all for $26! What a steal!
