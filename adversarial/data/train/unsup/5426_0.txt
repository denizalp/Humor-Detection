Full Disclosure:  I have an axe to grind with this kind of food...\n\nFor the short attention span set:\n-trendy food (not a compliment)\n-mediocre burgers inside fantastic buns\n-upscale, modern atmosphere\n-cute, if precious presentations\n\nThat being said, put in proper context (i.e. this is the Bellagio), their food is reasonably tasty.  It's meant as an upscale bar restaurant, and it gets the job done, albeit with the typical lack of soul that is par for the course on the strip.  I stuck strictly with appetizers, as was recommended by a friend who really enjoys this place up and down.   The highlight of the menu were the Kobe beef sliders...but not for the beef.  As we had a large party, I had a chance to sample sliders from different orders, and the range of doneness was completely inconsistent.  Some were nicely med-rare while, unfortunately, many others were well done with the core of the burger a dead grey.  This was almost made up for by absolutely frickin wonderful burger buns.  Great texture, good sponge, and a hint of sweetness in a white crumb.  A nice touch is that the buns are brushed with an egg wash which gives a boost to the texture.  Unlike the burger itself, every bite of bun that I had was a good one.\n\nNext up was a frito misto which included both rock shrimp and squid. Nothing too shabby, but the seasoning definitely overpowered the contents.  However, if you're into the batter, then I guess it really won't matter what's inside.  Actually now that I think about it, it was definitely more like Cantonese style \"salt and pepper\" coating more than an Italian Frito Misto...\n\nThen came the \"very adult mac & cheese\"  basically it was mac & cheese with surprise!  (not really) truffle oil.  The mac & cheese is then cut into sticks, breaded up and deep fried.  To be straight up, a good number of folks at our table really enjoyed this, but I found that it overused the truffle oil.  Again, if you're of the \"never have enough foie or truffles\" mindset, then you'll actually like it.  Truffles are a potent ingredient, and in my opinion, it's a difficult thing to balance properly.  Most places want  to impress you by hitting you over the head with it, and FIX is not alone.\n\nA nice flourish was something they call \"forks\", but basically it's smoked salmon with a little creme fraiche on top of a speared mini-blini and topped with osetra caviar.   Pretty normal brunch fare, but presented cutely.\n\nOn the other hand the \"Kobe chili cheese fries\" was completely forgettable, although the regular fries were nicely done.\n\nThe decor scores on the \"make you feel cool\" vibe with the wavy wooden plank roof, and it's appropriate for the location.\n\nIn the end the style of food is pretty unimaginative, it's typical snazzed up \"comfort food\" that probably hits the target market, but doesn't satisfy folks who have respect for real comfort food.  Also, it's a prime example of gourmet pandering...\n\n1. take a simple food\n2. add pricey ingredients\n3. ?\n4. PROFIT!\n\nExcept in this case, we all know \"?\" actually means \"charge up the ass.\"  Even if you can't relate to my take on things, have you ever thought...\"oh man, Kobe beef's so overrated, I don't know what the big deal's about\" ...well that's because of places like this.  Basically, restaurants know that if they put Kobe or Foie on their menus, they can instantly charge a premium and sell hundreds of the dishes a night. (I could also rant on things labeled Sea Bass and the use of short ribs....but I'll save that for another time).  \n\nProperly prepared Wagyu and specifically Kobe can be a truly heavenly experience...but when you take what is essentially beef's version of foie, but then grind it up for burger patties or chili, the ingredient is slaughtered.  You can duplicate the result at home just by grinding up corn-fed chuck and adding extra strips of beef fat to the mix....  In any case, actual Kobe, and Kobe-style meat should be almost scary white and as raw as you can stand.  So next time you see Kobe ground up for something, braised, or cooked like a regular steak, skip it, your wallet will thank you and your tongue won't miss a thing.  If you want Kobe, but  cringe at the thought of beef sashimi,  just head out to Nobu at the Hard rock.  Their new style Kobe Beef is both different from the traditional shabu shabu, but still respects the ingredient.  It's been around for years, but they still manage to do it well.\n\nSure, I hate this kind of food, but at least they make up for it with some winners, and it's perfectly appropriate for what it is.
