Came here for breakfast with the family. I guess I should have ordered the dessert looking pancakes and waffles. I ordered your typical breakfast and they do not carry sausage here. I do not like bacon so they offered this red looking sausage that I was not a fan of at all. The vibe was nice and chef took the time to come out and ensure everything tasted good.
