I never really liked kouign amann as its always been too heavy and too sweet when I've tried it, even in Paris. But when I heard about this place, I had to try it! Sob! It was life alterring. It really made such an impact, it changed my perspective. I now understand what kouign amann is all about! I will forever have that experience and remember it. I am so thankful I came in and got some.\n Thank you!
