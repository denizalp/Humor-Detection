Let me start by saying that this is a dive bar in the quintessential definition of dive bars so if you look at this review and rating going in with the knowledge that this is explicitly a dive bar....then you'll  understand where the rating is coming from.   They have cheap drinks, cheap food, pronounced yinzer accents and great atmosphere if you can see through the cigarette smoke. The cheese logs are homemade, the burgers are done appropriately, the drinks are strong, the pizza is tasty. Is it Altius??? No. And it's not supposed to be. It's perfectly UN perfect... just the way you want it.
