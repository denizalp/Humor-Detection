Often closed,  out of stock indie butcher that's more focused on having beer with his buds on his own patio than serve his customers.  I keep giving this place more chances only to be let down with either what I want not being in stock or the raw product just being average and highly overpriced.  I can name at least 3 better butchers in a 10km radius.
