Finally!\nFINALLY!  \nFINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSomeone who listens and can cut hair well!!!!  Thank the Baby Jesus!!!\nI swear, I've not had a good cut since my stylist (who was my stylist in Chicago) moved to Bath and I moved and followed her to OH.  (Not followed in the stalker sense of the word.)  She's gone now and on to bigger and better things in CA and my hairs has been worse for the wear.\n\nI cannot tell you how much money I have spent on terrible haircuts in the past year.  The best cuts I've gotten are from my barber (she does a great job, don't get me wrong.).\n\nI was lunching at LockKeepers on Canal in Valley View and my server informed me about Legacy.  She even recommended the stylist to see.  Saturday morning I popped into Legacy since I was in the vicinity and asked if Megan was available for a haircut.  I had to wait approx. 15 minutes but she was happy to take me.\n\nWe talked about my current cut, my likes and dislikes.  She listened, made suggestions, and then went to work.  She reminded me of the good stylists on Tabitha takes Control.  I was so happy with my cut.  What I liked best was that Megan really took the time to understand what I was wanting and needing.  Not only that but at the end of my cut told me that if I found after a few days there were problems just to come back and she'd take care of it.\n\nThe price at this salon is VERY reasonable.  For the quality of care and the cut I got, I cannot be happier!  Thank you Megan and Legacy Hair Studio!  I'll be back & tell ALL my friends to come.
