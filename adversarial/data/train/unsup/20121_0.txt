My name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...\n\nThis place? \n\nI'd say at least try it once.\n\nA nice Sunday brunch menu.\nA freakin giant 32oz Bloody Mary WITH a whole damn grilled cheese on it and much more!\nInterestingly delicious burger meat.\nI can't remember this place ever being rumshakers.\nHorrendous service.
