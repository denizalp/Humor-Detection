I've been having the chicken cranberry wrap every single time I eat here and I just can't get enough!  \n\nThe generous chicken cranberry salad is wrapped in a large green tortilla wrap with pecans and cheese included and then melted on the panini grill. \n\nThe result? Biting into this wrap is like biting into a warm delicious hug. The flavors really go well together.  Of the half a dozen times I've had this wrap, it's pretty consistent. There was only one time where they heated the wrap a bit too long. This wrap you gotta try at least once!!!
