Whatever you do, DO NOT use this company! I called them because my washing machine was having problems draining. When I spoke to the manager Chris, I told him my washing machine brand, model, and what the problem was. He then scheduled a technician to come out and look at it same day...great right? WRONG!   \n\nFirstly, they didn't bother to tell me that they charge you $60 for the visit to look at it. I'd have no problem paying that fee had the technician come in, run some tests, done ANY actual diagnostics on the machine, but all he did was come in (for no longer than 3 minutes) and say \"Yeah this is a terrible washing machine that breaks all the time and it'll cost you $300 for me to replace the pump on it\". So my response was, \"why didn't Chris tell me that this morning over the phone when I told him what type of machine I had and what the problem was?\" Well the answer is because then they wouldn't get their bullsh*t $60 fee.  \n\nWhen I asked the technician if he could call Chris so I could ask why they were going to charge me for a 3 minute discussion that could (and should) have happened on our phone call earlier in the day, he freaked out and stormed off. I immediately called the office to try and get a hold of Chris so I could work this out, but got a very nice lady on the phone instead who said she'd have Chris call me back. Ten minutes later Chris calls me and as soon as I started to relay what had happened he said \"Since you wasted my technician's time and you won't pay I'm not going to let you waste any more of my time\" and hung up on me.  \n\nI never leave reviews, but felt compelled to warn other people about this company.
