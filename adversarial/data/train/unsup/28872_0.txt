Great spot for work lunch! I had the Steak Frites (flank) which was amazing beyond my expectations. The steak was cooked medium rare as requested, juicy and paired with herb butter. To my surprise, it was very thick for a flank.  It could use  more seasoning and the server forgot to bring black pepper but it was still good. The fries were addictive as well, with mayo and a very special ketchup. The server was very upbeat and was very knowledgeable about the beer menu.\n\nThis place has a completely different vibe during the day. I came for lunch and the d√©cor was actually pretty nice (vs. the time I came at night and it was all dark).
