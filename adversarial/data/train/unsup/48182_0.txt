We've been coming here for some years now during our visits for F1.  It's just down the street from where we stay so its also convenient.   It has a great party atmosphere that's for sure and a great selection of beers.  If you are lucky enough to come on the days before and after the races you will be pleasantly surprised with excellent service and room to breath   During the F1 you go at your own risk knowing the place is very popular. Food:  we had wings again but this time my hubbie also had the curry of the day (lamb) and it was excellent.  The wings are ok; the sauce is an odd colour orange but is tasty but it came back on us afterwards for some time. It's a great local bar!
