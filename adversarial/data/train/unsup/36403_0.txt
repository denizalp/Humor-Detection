I had a carnita taco and a bean tostado and both were MASSIVE! The taco itself was large enough for a lunch meal and it was reasonably priced at $2.95. It was packed with plenty of meat and set inside a double corn tortilla. The meat was fried crispy which is the way carnitas should be prepared. Very flavorful pork and piled high. The bean tostado was very large as well, but there was too much lettuce and the beans were just average. In any other part of the country these would be considered good beans, but in Arizona they are just average. Overall a great value stop for lunch and I'll definitely be back for the menudo (only served on Saturdays and Sundays)
