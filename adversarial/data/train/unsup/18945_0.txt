My husband and I came here for our anniversary a few weeks ago.  To be honest, I didn't think I'd be that stuffed at the end our meal due to some of the photos I saw on Yelp.  I was so so wrong.  We did the course menu that fit in best with our time.  We had a show to catch by 10 and our dinner was at 6.  What's great is that they ask you immediately if there are any time constraints you are under and let you know which course meals you should avoid.  \n\nThe food was amazing.  Really.  Everything that came out was exceptional.  What made it even better was the service.  Everyone from the sommelier, the hostess and servers were top notch.  I'd love to return, and plan on coming back for another special night.
