It gets very packed for games and Friday happy hour.\n\nBlue 32 is a good sports bar, lots and lots of TVs, clean, nice decor The women's restroom is luxurious as far as restrooms in sports bars are concerned.  The service is just okay.\n\nOver Christmas they had these specialty drinks made with all the rich, decadent liquors.  One of them was a martini with graham cracker crust on the rim of the glass - I had two of those holiday spirits, sooo good!
