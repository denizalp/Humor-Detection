There was a scorpion in my bathroom, I'm completely traumatized by it. Also, my room wasn't cleaned. The GM has accommodated me to some point, but didn't appreciate him trying to tell me scorpions are not dangerous. It can kill you and to me that's dangerous. I've never had a scorpion visit me in Vegas. Scary!
