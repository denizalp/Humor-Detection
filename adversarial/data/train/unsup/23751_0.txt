Portions are huge, sushi is fresh, dishes are delicious. If I had one quibble, it would be the very, very slow service during the time we visited.\n\nWe visited on a Friday evening around 7:00 PM, and it was super busy. I'd recommend calling in and making a reservation, or you may be stuck waiting for a table on high volume Friday\/Saturday nights. \n\nWe ordered: a Chicken Katsu appetizer (which may as well have been a main meal, the portion size was quite large), a Gyoza appetizer, and a variety of rolls which came with Crunchy Soup and a Sashimi Salad, both of which were delicious. Overall, the sushi was super fresh, great temperature, and had interesting flavours and textures. The Chicken Katsu was crunchy yet tender, and the sashimi salad that came with our rolls was also really unique. A great meal overall with wonderful flavour.\n\nThe place is clean, ambiance is very group\/family friendly but still intimate enough because of the way certain tables are set up. Our only issue was that our server was basically non-existent for most of the meal - it took about 25 minutes for her to come over and write down our order (we didn't get the iPads during our meal, just a traditional menu), and another 25 minutes after our meal for her to bring over the bill (we actually had to stand up and look for her so we could hunt our bill down!).\n\nOther than wait issues, the experience overall (especially the food) made for a great Friday night. If we're ever in the area again, we would come back - the food was delicious enough to warrant another visit!
