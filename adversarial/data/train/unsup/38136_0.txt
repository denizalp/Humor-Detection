These are my fave treats in Montreal. Salty, savoury and sweet. They are rich so beware. I cant eat more than one. Dont sleep on their croissants, come in the morning and you can get a warm fresh one. \n\nIf they sell out of kougin aman, fear not; more are being baked. You can leave your name and number and reserve a whole pie or a few slices, to come back and pick up when ready. Awesome!\n\nCheck this place out, be prepared for lines out the door on weekend mornings. \n\n* The quiche was basic. Stick to croissants and kougin aman
