I have only been to the Tempe location and loved the food there, but was looking for a more \"upscale\" atmosphere to take my parents to when they were in town.  This place was perfect. The patio seating was beautiful. It had nice shade from trees and other patio overhangs and the servers didn't forget you when you sit outside. The inside was just as nice too, but a little bit more noisy. The food here was just as impressive as the other locations. I got the leek soup and The Greek pasty and they were so good. I would also recommend their iced teas! They have some pretty great flavors as opposed to just the traditional iced tea. \n\nGreat service, great atmosphere, and great prices. Can't beat this place.
