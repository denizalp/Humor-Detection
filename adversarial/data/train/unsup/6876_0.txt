Had lunch here with Arlin B. and Rand H. and yes the pizza is good here but I do not think it is good enough for the price or the wait.The crust was really good and the topping were ok but I prefer a meat lovers pizza piled high.There are at least 5 other pizza places i would rather eat at . I would probably never return here because I was not as impressed as much as many other yelpers are.
