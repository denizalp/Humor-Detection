Decided to go here because my usual Pho place is closed for the week. Walked in and had a great first impression of the place. We ordered to go and went straight to the counter where we were greeted rudely and had to wait awhile before someone could even take our order. Like any Pho place, i just order chicken pho and was asked by the girl what number it was on the menu which i clearly did not know. So I had to search for it myself. We were told it would be about a 10 minute wait, which was fine. \nWhile waiting at the front counter i observed each worker running around in chaos not knowing what was going on (typical for a new restaurant). Ended up waiting about 20 minutes for our Pho. \nAs for taste, it's like any other pho bowl I've had, except they use different chicken than I've had at other places. This place seems to use something like a rotisserie chicken which was unusual for me, but it still tasted great! \nThree stars because of service. They are a new restaurant and could use some improvement.
