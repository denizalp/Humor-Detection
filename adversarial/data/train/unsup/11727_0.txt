I agree with the below posters.  Especially Rachel.  I could not believe the unprofessional bedside manner of Dr. Susun Kim.  The rudest doctor I've ever encountered in my life.  As I tell quite a few people what happened, especially Dr. friends, my friend actually went to school with her as well (he's an ER Dr.) so it's always better to think twice working in a \"small town\", although it's just better to treat patients and others humanely period.  I came in for a rash and also dermatitis.  As with Rachel, I waited quite a while...45 minutes after my appointment time and then 15-20 minutes in the examination room.  Dr. Kim came in with a scowl on her face (I think it's just permanent) as I greeted her and she brusquely gave me a diagnosis and was outta there...or TRYING to be outta there within less than one minute.  I was really friendly to her regardless thinking maybe she had a bad day...not knowing she is having a bad life probably... and as she was throwing the door open to her next \"victim\" (not patient) when I asked her if I could ask her one more question.  This was the best part.  She stood with her back on the edge of the door, still had the exam room door open and gave an attitude, \"eye roll\" like I better hurry the f^&* up because  she has a date with a K-pop star.  I was in utter shock....this is a DOCTOR?  Why would anyone with this type of personality and attitude want a career in helping others?  She gave me a curt reply, dismissed me and took off.  And I just sat there with my jaw kinda agape that anyone like this could have a license to practice.\nThe lack of patience won't gain you any patients.  \n\nIf you choose to go, don't say I didn't warn ya! :)
