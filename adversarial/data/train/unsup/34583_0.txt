YAY! A completely gluten free restaurant. I'm in love. Super cute little place on 17th ave. Pretty decor of green, white and purple and all healthy. \n\nBeing a new place, they do have some things to work out, it was very slow, but worth the wait. They have lots of yummy smoothies, I went for the kale mojito (no booze) it was super yummy. Then I went for the granola with yogurt and fresh fruit. It was super really good and a big portion. \n\nLittle pricey, but that is to be expected, but for good, healthy, gluten free food I don't mind. I can't wait to go back and try many more things.
