How may I assist you with your reservation today?\n\nDavid:  What kind of price could I get at the flamingo hotel. For Aug 8 to Aug 11, We will be arriving around 2:00 p.m. and departing around noon. \n\nSarah M.:  I'll be happy to help with your questions and reservation today!\n\nSarah M.:  Please give me 3 to 5 minutes to check on that for you.\n\nDavid:  The Ex Caliber is offering a rate at 65.00 a night.\n\nDavid:  Did I lose you?\n\nSarah M.:  Thank you for waiting. I am showing that the Flamingo has a Deluxe Room for $93.33 per night. How does that sound?\n\nDavid:  Not good. I can get it for 65.00 plus tax for a one bedroom two beds non smoking breakfast. I thought you compared prices online let try again.\n\nDavid:  It a corporate meeting I am attending that is very high.\n\nDavid:  It a corporate meeting I am attending that is very high.\n\nSarah M.:  I can only offer the same pricing and inventory shown on our website.\n\nDavid:  Hmm I just spoke with your reservation department, and they told me to speak with the online web chat that they can offer better prices. Why are you not willing to help?\n\nSarah M.:  I can only offer what's listed online. I'm showing that the Flamingo Las Vegas is $93.33 per night for the 8th to the 11th.\n\nDavid:  With price line, I can get a room for two beds for $160.71 everything included.\n\nSarah M.:  You're on the Name Your Own-Price page.\n\nSarah M.:  With Name, Your Own Price what will happen is you will choose your area, star level and price. Then you will review the information and agree upon the terms and conditions. Once you enter your credit card information and click the \"Buy My Hotel Room Now\" button, we will search for a hotel for you. If we find one, then we will book you there and charge your card, then you will get the hotel's name and information.\n\nDavid:  That is sad you are not willing to price it better than that. I guess I will yelp your status and copy the feedback on yelp.\n\nSarah M.:  I am showing you are on the Name Your Own Price.\n\nDavid:  That's fine I'll just yelp this whole conversation and leave a bad feedback.\n\nSarah M.:  With that option, you can choose the price you want to pay. However, you are not guaranteed a specific bed type, or a specific hotel, like the Flamingo.\n\nSarah M.:  If you are only interested in the Flamingo, it is the $93.33 per night price.\n\nSarah M.:  Name Your Own Price is mainly about savings, so the hotel name is not disclosed until after purchase. However, you will get a quality hotel, and it will match your selected star rating (or higher), area selection, travel dates, and number of rooms.\n\nDavid:  Well, the Flamingo is not a nice hotel it's old and smells so don't try to pull that on me. There are better hotels out there then yours.\n\nSarah M.:  If you choose to Name Your Own Price, you are not guaranteed a specific hotel, or specific beds.\n\nSarah M.:  We do guarantee that if your bid is accepted, the hotel will be in the area that you selected, at the star level or higher than you specified.\n\nDavid:  I am sure they are willing to work for their customers.\n\nSarah M.:  With Name Your Own Price, all rooms will accommodate up to two adults. Requests for bed types (King, Queen, two Doubles, etc.) or other special needs (including preferences for smoking or non-smoking rooms) should be requested through your confirmed hotel and cannot be guaranteed.\n\nSarah M.:  If knowing your exact hotel is important to you, I recommend you use our \"list view\" option. Using this option, you can choose a specific hotel and room type that is within your price range. Which option will work best for you?\n\nDavid:  I see we are not covering anything here so have a great evening, and I will copy and paste this on yelp. Thank you
