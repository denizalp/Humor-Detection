My husband and I stopped here on a Saturday for lunch. It was fairly slow. I grew up in Germany and while I realize nothing compares to home cooked German food or the food back in Bavaria, I'm always willing to try German restaurants to see how they are.  \n\nPros: decent service (it was slow though, so I don't know how it gets when it is busy), good beer (even though they can't spell the name of it in their menu - sigh!), big menu selection and good portion sizes.  Oh and I liked the sauerkraut. The best part of the meal was the bread which was more of a French bread than anything German. \n\nCons: my husband had a schnitzel and I had the Bauernschmaus. Somehow all 4 types of meat were very tough. The potatoes seemed to be instant potatoes or at least tasted like it. The dumpling was really dense and kind of tough. The broth for my liver dumpling soup was lukewarm at best but at least the dumpling was warm. Overall everything just seemed to be very bland and lacked flavor. \n\nNext time we'll be heading to the other German place again that's just a few doors down. The selection there may be smaller but the quality of the food seems much better.
