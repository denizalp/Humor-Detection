Can you put negative 10 stars? I do not believe this place should even get a 1 rating.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! When we walked in it looked dingy.  Also, I wanted to wash my hands so on my way to the bathroom, I saw that there were flies coming from the kitchen. When i got to the bathroom there was vomit in the sink and period trailing like dots on the floor.  The cook looked absolutely disgusting and seemed like he just broke out of curry prison and his sweat dripped in the food however, everywhere was closed on Christmas Eve and after traveling from New York for 10 hours we were absolutely tired and hungry. This was the worst decision we ever made.  We would not return and I recommend you do not come here.   I also  still have a bad case of the shittings. We left the restaurant and my brother has been on the toilet ever since.  We had to go across the street to McDonalds to eat like kings.  We spent $110 for nothing.
