Rude guy came to give us estimates. He looked like we were interrupting his nap or something. \n\nThen we asked to get our parking validated as per their websites instructions. No, he would not. The gentleman asked how much we paid and he goes, well at least you didn't spend 100 bucks. \n\nTHAT IS NOT THE POINT this guy that represents Oliver is very disappointing. There are too many people that will buy jewlery.
