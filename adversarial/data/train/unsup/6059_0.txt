What a ridiculous move by the owner. He's a cheap guy, wow now they charge $0.50 for lettuce. A pinch of lettuce not standard, but 50 cents, thats absolutely ridiculous! Plus $1 extra for a teaspoon of sour cream. The guys making your burrito wont even tell you until its time to pay. Time to smarten up and take that away. The place only gets 2 stars for the food tAste which is pretty good otherwise, but service lacks big.
