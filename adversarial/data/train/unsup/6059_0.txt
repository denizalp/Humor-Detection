Took my Co worker out to eat.My bill came up to $28.97 but my credit card was charged for $70.00.l sign my credit paper for $28.00.call Restaurant  back ask to speak to Manager that never happen. Who ever answered  the phone told me last was only charged for $28.00 ,just kept on talking to me like last lied.Staff should be trained better than that.Also caused my account a overdraft fee,let knew how much longer could spend. Management stated it was a mistake  but how long for a $28 dollar bill.
