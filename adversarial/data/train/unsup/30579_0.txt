Slightly hidden location with a pretty lowkey sign, but definitely not indicative of the food itself! The sushi boat had a wide range of sushi and sashimi, including more novelty selections such as kanpachi and awabi.  The sashimi comes in fairly large portions and is fresh! The roll that came with the boat is quite filling and has a good filling to rice ratio. I would recommend, however, ordering the sushi without the wasabi, as it does tend to overwhelm the overall flavour. They offer live octopus at this location which would be an interesting choice to try! Overall, very friendly service and a good selection of food, from sushi to donburi, to a variety of rolls!
