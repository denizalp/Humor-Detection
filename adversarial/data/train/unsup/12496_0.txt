Very rude management . \nTemperature is in the 50's. Came in with my fiancé to have dinner and was told that you could sit at the bar but not at the dining room in a fairly empty Resturant because he was wearing a beanie and they had a dress code that said men could not wear hats. The bar and restaurant are all in the same area and not separated. This chain has lost it's mind . Between me and my fiancé we were probably wearing a half a million dollars in jewelry not trying to be pretentious but we eat out 6 nights a week and they lost a good customer.
