Omgosh.  This place is a block from my house so the location is convenient.  My initial perceptions before going were sketchy but once my husband and I went in for breakfast a few weekends back, we are weekend regulars!! \nThe employees are so great! They are friendly and whether they are serving you or not, they give the friendliest greeting with a smile. Nothing phony. \nThe place is VERY clean - dated but CLEAN. Just the 80's pink but it's cleverly nostalgic. My husband and I love sitting at the bar so we can watch morning sports after our workouts. The service is quick!! I don't think I've been anywhere with faster service - and even firing the busiest of morning breakfast hours!! The kitchen crew is crazy organized and efficient.  \nThe food is FABulous!! Yum yum!! My favorite is the skinny skillet. So freakin good. My husband is a big muscular guy and he easily is fueled up by the food, too. We will definitely keep coming back. Love this place!!!! \nThey only take cash or checks which is probably why the prices are so great, too! But if you forget, they have an ATM by the front door. \nGet in here!!! :-)
