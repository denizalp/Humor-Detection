Wow where do I begin almost speechless on this one!!! \n\nSo I use to work concierge for Palace Station and had got to work early so I decided to breakfast at their buffet. \n\nWhat a MISTAKE! \n\nBIG TIME YUCKO!!! \n\nSo I went for breakfast at like 7am so food should be fresh and delicious I'm thinking it should be. I tried their nasty watery runny eggs omg I almost threw up! \n\nI also tried their extra crispy burned bacon I think it cut my throat going down! So last and just as least as the other items I tried their oatmeal because I figured how can you mess up oatmeal well Palace Station was successful at messing that up to! \n\nI think I would of had a better dining experience eating out of their dumpster! Yes it was extremely cheap in price but come on I don't expect to go to a Station Casino and eat dog food! \n\nPlease I beg of you NEVER EAT HERE! \n\nNote: Service is awful the server made me feel like I was inconveniencing her when I asked for a refill on coffee then rolled her eyes when I ordered a chocolate milk! WOW Sorry to have disturbed you DOING YOUR JOB!!!
