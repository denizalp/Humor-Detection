Never ordering from this place again. We ordered our pizza around 8:50pm. We confirmed our address with the employee twice. The place is 2 miles away from us and we had been told that the pizza should be delivered in 45 minutes. After waiting an hour, we called to check on the status of the pizza. The employee said that the deliver should be there in 10 minutes. After waiting another 30 minutes, we called to speak to a manager. We informed her of the situation and informed her that we were worried the pizza would be cold. The mamager said that she would call the deliver to see where the the hell he is at. The deliver said that he would be there in a minute. The deliver called again to confirm the address which was wrong. The address that he had driven to which was in Phoenix and it was 15 minutes away from us. The deliver said that he would be there in five minutes before we knew that he was in Phoenix. We called the pizza place  again to check on the status of the pizza. The person who answered the phone was someone who made the pizza. We informed him of the situation. The cook said that we could check the pizza once it had been delivered and if it wasn't to our standards since we had voiced many times that the pizza would be cold by now, he would remake the pizza. We told the cook that we appericate he's efforts but that we were just going to cancel the pizza. In total we waited 2 hours. Around 11pm the deliver called to say he couldn't find our place. We had to inform him that we cancelled the pizza 15 minutes ago. The most improfessional people we have had to deal with.
