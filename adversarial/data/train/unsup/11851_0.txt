2 stars versus 1 star because the girls who work here were very apologetic for such a long wait for the food.\n\nSo when you walk in, you order your food at the register and then you seat yourself kind of deal. Luckily I came here with my girlfriends because if I was alone and waited for food for OVER 45 minutes, I would've demanded my money back. \n\nAnyways. As said above. It took forever for food to come out. But I was thinking, \"Okay, they just opened up not too long ago. They're probably still trying to get it together. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt if the food is bomb.\" But... wrong.\n\nI ordered the Guava Chiffon pancakes short stack and that was probably the only good thing about my meal. It came out first before the crab cake benedict and kalua pig benedict I had ordered. I couldn't even finish the short stack but I'm glad I didn't order more.\n\nBoth of the benedicts and the rest of my friends' food had come about 5-10 minutes after the pancakes. First off. The food was way too salty. Like I legitimately got high blood pressure just eating the pounds of salt they put in their food (or I probably was just angry that the food had taken so long to get to the table and have it taste the way it did). And also. The food was lukewarm, closer to being cold. Not even hot. If I'm waiting for years for food to come out, at least have it hot, fresh, and ready, please? Lukewarm IS NOT cute.\n\nDon't know if I should have said something while in the restaurant but it probably wouldn't have been a good idea seeing how hard the girls were working to apologize to customers, etc. \n\nI had high hopes for this place but it was just way too hyped up. Probably won't be coming back.
