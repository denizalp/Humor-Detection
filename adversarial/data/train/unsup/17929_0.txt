After a trip to Target, we were hungry so my daughter and I stopped in for some dinner here.  She loves salad bars since she can pick out what she likes and just eat that.  It was about 8pm on a week night so they were not busy.  We were greeted warmly and paid then went to the salad bar.  Things had not been restocked but that's ok, there was still plenty and it was good.  They had some different salad....an oriental noodle one that I liked, and of course soup and bread.  For dessert they had the soft serve ice cream that is so yummy and lots of toppings to go with it.  \n\nThe place was clean and the staff was nice.  It's nothing outstanding but it was good and we were full.  And it was fairly inexpensive too.
