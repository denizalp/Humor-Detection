AMAZING.  This place is just purely AMAZING.\n\nI dropped a pretty penny for some decent seats a few months after it opened.  I am a cheapskate and would normally would never drop this amount of dough on one night of entertainment, but this was oh-so-worth-it.  For months (years to come?) I can't help but keep reliving in my head the memories of this wonderful performance that marries the imagination and the love of Beatles perfectly into one show.  I have never seen anything like this.  I've seen Cirque du Soleil shows previously but nothing like this.  Nothing.  Come see it.  Live it.  I know I sound corny and I am not even a huge Beatles fan before I see this, but now I totally am.  All you need, is love.
