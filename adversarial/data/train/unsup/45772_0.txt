Kim is awesome!!! the studio is relaxing, quiet, clean... so far I have had 2 spider vein treatments and a chemical peel.  Both have been great...I have purchased makeup products and a day and night treatment cream. It is a wonderful feeling when someone will  stop me in a store and compliment how wonderful my skin looks... I tell them to thank Kim, she is the best of the best!
