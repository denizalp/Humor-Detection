This place is located in the food court of the Riviera. I ordered the chicken tikka masala & mango lassi. The mango lassi was great & I would definitely order it again, but the chicken tikka masala was more bland than that of any other place I have ever tried! The naan was humongous and pretty good, but not enough for me to come back here in the future.\n\nI probably won't be back here -- even though I really enjoyed the mango lassi-- just because it's in a weird location. It was like walking through a maze just to get to the food court (as I was leaving, I heard guests complaining about the same thing).. but I'm assuming the food court is more geared towards tourists as it does have an opening facing Las Vegas Blvd.
