My partner and I ordered pulled pork sandwiches. If the smell coming from this place isn't enough to get you running threw their doors, their pulled pork was just right! Service was speedy and we didn't feel forgotten. Hannah served us and not only is she great at serving, she's drop dead gorgeous! We are happy to come back and enjoy the food, the service, and the comfortable atmosphere. This is right off the train line, so there are no excuses for figuring out how to get there.
