Been here several times, once during the week before the crowd came in and another time on the weekend, but still early enough to beat the crowd. Both times, service was horrible.  Sat at a table both times and service took forever. By the time a server came to take our orders it still took some time to actually get our beers.  Then we ordered our food and another long wait.  By this time the crowd started coming in so we decided to go outside in the yard where there wasn't so many people.  Since the weather was still pretty chilly no one was out there so beers were a little easier to get at the bar.  Sure the games are fun and the place is super close to my house and they have a great beer list, but for the wait I don't think it's worth it.  The food is just ok too nothing I would go out of my way for.
