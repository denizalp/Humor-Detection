RUN!!! This place is exactly what it's name says! They're a CON! They lied and said their furniture is made in the USA and it is NOT! It was damaged upon delivery or shipping process, I bought 3 sets of furniture to furnish my new home with. The living room furniture can't be sat on.. I sat on it 3 times and within minutes I had a red burning rash! All over my body! They promised it was all made in the USA. I'll let u read for yourself, Google this \" red rash after sitting on new furniture \" so now I know why I was getting the rash. They haven't done a thing to help I have been getting the run around for over 3 months.  \n\nAs for the bedroom set that was delivered its beautiful but obviously damaged upon delivery or in shipping. I have taken off days from work to stay home and meet with the serviceman. He conveniently didn't  show any of the 3 days. Uggg I can't believe their lack of customer service! Oh and for each set of furniture I bought I received a free tv, it was a promotional deal.... So within 2 weeks one of the tv's stopped working. They have had it in repair for 2 months. This place is THE WORST!
