Me and husband always love the food here. We got the NY Special on a Sicilian crust and it was amazing. Great crunch on the bottom of the crust and soft bouncy crust for the rest of the pizza. I had the small fettuccine alfredo with chicken one time and it was the perfect portion size for one person without any leftovers. \n\nThe pizza even taste great warmed up in the toaster oven\n\nOur favorite pizza joint in Gilbert!
