I would think of all places Red Lobster would know how to make Fish and Chips, apparently not.  My husband and I both ordered them on Memorial Day, and regretted it walking out.  We took it home to our dogs it was that bad.  First place, it is one piece with a ton of grease on your plate and maybe 10 French Fries, the tarter sauce was so sweet, why would you do that ?   I wish now we would have just went to Long John Silvers, it probably would have been so much better and not $30 to feed our dogs fish.  NOW, we remember why we don't go here.
