Amazing! I have been procrastinating about 8 years of past taxes. I went. Into iqtax, after reading review on yelp. I went in with no appointment and was seen within minutes. The person who helped me was Lizette. She is amazing, walked thru 8 years of past taxes and explained everything to me. Fast forward, I walked out with a payment to IRS of 50 bucks. I can't believe it. Lizette knows her stuff. Thank you so much for all the help. Oh and can I tell you the fees were less than a quarter of what I've been quoted in the past. I cannot say enough good stuff about this place. I will use them from now on as well as have all my father's tax need taken care of here in the future.  Thank you.
