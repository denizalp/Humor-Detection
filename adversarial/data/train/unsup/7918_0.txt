My friends really wanted to try their surf and turf pho - rib eye and lobster. They thought the flavor was good and liked the combo. I opted for the oxtail pho. My bowl was tasty as the flavors from the oxtail made it great.  I liked how the meat was cooked and easily comes off the bone. We also ordered the oxtail fries and the beef salad. The fries almost reminded me of poutine fries. They were a bit soggy as the juices\/gravy soaked in them. The beef salad was good as the beef was very tender (I wished the pieces were a bit better).
