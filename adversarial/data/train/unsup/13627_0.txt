This place is so gross and dirty the sneeze guard was dripped with water from it being so steamy. than black green yellowish brown crap more like shit dripped on my plate and the food on the line. I told the manager out loud and showed all the customers what was on my hand on my plate. I told everyone to get up and leave and I told the manager nobody is paying. I told him I'm reporting him t the health department an he played the we will looooose are jobs,its not our fault,what do you want? also the I never get sick don't do this to a small business owner. everyone got up and left. I will never go there again an the other customers wont either. manager said \" I NEVER GET SICK FROM THIS FOOD\"! NASTY NASTY NASTY! I took pictures check it out. thanks for reading =*.*=
