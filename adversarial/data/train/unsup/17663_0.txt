Dear Pastavino, Chef Marc, and staff:\nWhy did you screw me? I walked out of your restaurant feeling dirty, ashamed, and ultimately screwed.\n5-star reviews left and right, family members telling me it is impeccable, chitter-chatter of a chef painting a picture of a truly delicious Italian meal...\nAt first I feel happiness fill me as I see the cutest little lounge and a chalk board menu boasting fresh pasta to go. +1 point\n \"This place looks promising,\" I say to myself, not knowing the horrors of sketchy service that was about to come into place.\n\nAfter I take in the cuteness\/warmth of the atmosphere, I realize I don't know what to do next. Okay, there's no one around, I obviously seat myself. I set my things down and realize that this must be a walk up counter type of deal. So I go up to the counter and stare at the menu for some time half-way tying to decided what to eat, and half-way trying to see if I will ever get some service. -1 point\n\nAhh, finally someone walks in from the back, a nice looking gentleman with a lovely accent gives us attention. We ask about the menu a little bit, and then I ask a question, a question that I ask often to servers who seem to be up for it. \" What do you like\/suggest.\"\nHe then goes on to describe a sandwich flaring; his arms in a fashion that seems to have been rehearsed in the past.\n\nHe describes a well seasoned chicken breast with fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion with a spread of mayonnaise. And as I'm typing this, I'm wondering how in the world he made it sound soo much better than it really is. I think it was the accent. \"Tomahto.\"\n\nOk, I say, I'll take it for here.\n\n\"OHH for here?! Well take a seat, we'll bring the food and some drinks!\"\n\n\nAs it begins to come out, in the hands of a young girl, I see her stop and ask an older woman, \"What is this??\"\nThe older woman snatched the basket from her and brought it to our table. -1 point\n\nAlthough the woman did that in front of us, and all of the employees seemed to play-fight, all of the employees whom we came across were friendly, funny, and sweet towards us. I actually liked the feel of the employees playing around and being joyful in front of the customers, it felt like we were in their home, and part of the family. 1 point\n\nBack to the sandwich: \"The San Fransisco\" \nIt was just as I described earlier: Chicken Parmesan, chopped romaine, chopped tomatoes, chopped onion on a baguette with some plain ol' mayo. This sandwich did not come off as anything special, at all. I had to remind myself that I was eating in an Italian restaurant, because the sandwich was defiantly not letting me know. - 1 point.\n\nOh well, this \"special\" sandwich that the gentleman offered is not on the menu, hmm I wonder why.\n\nWhile eating I hear the same gentleman tell the cook to make two more. And as he's calling out the second one, I heard someone ask, \"Why are you selling so many?\"\n\nWhat does the man do?\n\nRubs his thumbs against the his other fingers suggesting only one thing: Money.\n\nAnd it's true. The full sandwiches on the menu say they are (rounded) $10.00. Our Sandwich was about $13.00. My friend suggested that he was selling so many because the chicken parmesan could be about to go bad, which is a good possibility. Maybe it was a dinner special the night before, who knows. Or maybe it truly is the servers FAVORITE sandwich, as he mentioned about 4 times while we were trying to eat. - 1 point.\n\nAllow me to continue:\nAs I sit around enjoying my lunch break and taking in all the different aspects of the restaurant, I realize...Hey....why is everyone else getting bread with oil & vinegar? Hmm. Maybe they asked for it....oh wait, someone next to us just got it too, and they didn't order it. Does that mean....I'm not good enough to be treated the same as the other customers? Ok. I'm upset. I can get past this though -1 point.\n\nAfter asking and looking over both the lunch menu and the dinner menu from the night before (as the dinner menu changes every night +1 point) We get asked about dessert, in which the selection sounded very fine. +1. Our server names off the list and my fellow diner decides on the ricotta cheesecake.\n\nIt comes out...\nhmm.\nI'm going to make a guess that there isn't a pastry chef in, or someone who knows how to plate a cheesecake, but oh well, once again something tiny that can be looked over.\n\nWhat can not be looked over: The taste of something that will soon be spoiled. Possibly the poor strawberries on my plate. Possibly the cake. But it was hit and miss. Some bites were delicious, while some made me question whether I should be prepared for a night with my head in the toilet. -1 point (more like -100!)\nIn then end I sat staring at my plate, wondering why I had been rejected and screwed by Pastavino. But damn, I can't help but think it was just an off day.\nThats the reason for the 2nd star. Because I will give this place a second chance, a dinner. I (and my wallet..and my stomach,) hope I don't get screwed again.
