Positives- Arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes prior to our reservation and got seated right away. Had a good Old Fashioned. Nice ambiance. Had a very nice and attentive server. I enjoyed my mash potatoes and the rye bread. \nCons- My baked Walleye was kind of fishy and my sisters baked cod  was not very warm. Would not go back for the fish fry. There are other options that are better and less expensive ($18 for not so good walleye) \nI would go back to sit at the bar for a drink - I liked the look of this place.
