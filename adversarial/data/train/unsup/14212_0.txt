All this time and I haven't written a review for Shiloh? What's wrong with me??? Better late than never, I suppose. I visited SG with a group of out-of-towners on Sunday for brunch. I don't even know where to start. It didn't hurt that we were literally the first people in line, but talk about FRESH. I ate way too much, but thoroughly enjoyed everything, including: sausage gravy & biscuits; pulled\/jerk chicken on top of mac n cheese, pancakes with the best berry compote EVER, bagels & lox, a custom omelette - okay, I'm going to stop there since I've already embarrassed myself. My point is, it is a ROBUST brunch and great for kiddos too. They charge $1 per each year of the child's age, so it's a good value as well. Most importantly, every adult buffet ($18.01\/each) comes with a free cocktail (5 stars for their frozen cosmos), so drink (and eat) up, Yelpers!
