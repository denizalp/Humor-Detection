My ex fiance and I came here based off his best friends rave reviews.  I have learned that wait time in the morning here sucks!  I actually came here on a very cold, cloudy and rainy day....which Vegas rarely gets.  We wait for 48 min to get seated and believe me every min. sucked!  So we go to our table and the server was nice but I cant remember his name....I ordered OJ and it was fresh squeezed and lacked sugar.  I ordered their version of country fried steak and it was nothing to rave about.  I didnt dig their potatoes a whole lot nor did I go crazy over their eggs.  For the price, Id say skip this place and go to Dennys.
