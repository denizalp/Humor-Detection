Never again.  RUDE. RUDE. RUDE.\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I came in a half an hour before closing so we already knew not to expect much. We walked in and the ladies at the front counter told us to look inside at the food because they would not be bringing any new food out, which was fair enough. We said it was fine and they gave us a discount which was nice of them since we did not expect them to do so. They quickly showed us to our seats and then we took off to the food. \n\nAfter rushing to bring back our food to the table our server asked us for the receipt and I told her that we paid at the front already but if she wanted my receipt was somewhere in my bag and I would gladly find it for her. I knew all the servers were eager to get out of there, they were all sitting in the back and looking at us so I was looking in my bag in a hurry and it took me a few minutes to find it (it was in the side pocket of course lol). During this whole time she looked at me with a disgusted look and kept talking to her coworkers in Chinese. I swear she was thinking we never paid in the first place. I finally found it and she was like.. 'it says one' and then gave me another disgusted look. I told her it was a discounted price for two meals. Bad communication from front counter to servers I guess. \n\nAnyways, the food was pretty good. The sushi was not fresh of course as well as other food but it was closing so I wouldn't mark down for that. All in all, the food was over all, good!\n\nIt was the servers that really made me upset about this place. When the table next to us all left, one of the servers rushed over to the table, counted the tip of three dollars and threw it back on the table. She shouted to her coworkers 'three dollars' and other words in Chinese and started laughing. Her doing that in front of all her customers was not cool at all.\n\nWe left in a hurry, since all 15 workers were staring at us hahaha. No 'thank you' or 'good bye'. Weird. LOL whatever.
