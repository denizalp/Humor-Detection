I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago.\n\n\"Big deal,\" I thought. \"How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?\"\n\nWell, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.\n\nA few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.\n\nMy first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in\/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.\n\nWhen I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.\n\nAfter placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.\n\nThe guy preparing food replied with a laugh.\n\n\"Is it good?\" I asked\n\nJay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, \"Yes it's good.\" \n\nThen he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, my food was ready.\n\nThe food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!\n\nThe prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.\n\nI also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.\n\nAnd finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- Cash Only.\n\n- Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).\n\n- There never seems to be any \"Lumpia!\" :-\/
