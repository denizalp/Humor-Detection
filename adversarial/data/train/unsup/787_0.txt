The first time i went in at 6:30, they told us there wont have a table until 9:30, so we left.  Second time we made a reservation (6:45), a couple walked in and was told there wont be a table till \"ten-fifteen\".  They thought he meant 10~15 minutes, and were corrected, 10:15pm it was.  So you are warned, make reservation.\n(unless you are on your own, then you can always fight your way to the bar table)\n\nwe had the fish taco and the Octopus (Tako) taco.  Honestly i am a bit disappointed.  The tako tasted like chicken than seafood.  I love seafood and have octopus a lot.  This is not bad, just different...\n\nWe had a sashimi starter too, it might be a special of the day.  I cannot find it on their online menu.  Well... too bad, cause it was actually pretty good.\n\nAt the end of the day, I just do not think the waiting time \/ reservation time is justified.  I do think it is overrated. and hence, the \"ok\" rating.   This place is too busy to go before seeing a play, too loud for a date, and far too busy for your sudden taco rush.  Certainly worth a try, but i am not a big fan for re-visit.
