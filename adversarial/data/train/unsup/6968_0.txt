Gorgeous place for a wedding!\n\nI used to live in Cleveland, so I remember coming here for awards ceremonies and meetings. This was my first visit at night (dusk actually) and even though it was cloudy and grey outside, the view through floor-to-ceiling windows at sunset really couldn't be matched. It was magical.\n\nThe setup was sort of awkward for a wedding since the reception & dinner were in the same space, but somehow, they managed to fit it all in.\n\nTo whomever might be reading this as a representative of Windows, you really need to work on some manners with your staff. During the ceremony we heard the staff talking loudly at the   back of the room, lots of slamming doors, and even a walkie-talkie conversation on the level below our space! Rude. Rude. I definitely would've turned into bridezilla if that was my wedding and all of that happened.\n\nDinner was delicious as well. Typically big catered events, weddings included, skimp on the food. You know; overcooked chicken, bland steak, sub-par sides. Not here. The chicken was incredible and the bf's prime rib was perfect! I was huge fan of the grilled vegetables each dish was served with!\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful place for a wedding. I'm sure it was hella expensive though.
