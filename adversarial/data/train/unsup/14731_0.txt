The Lost Leaf is your typical hipster bar, the likes of which I'd only been in on the East Coast. The West Coast equivalent of wandering around a city and going to an unmarked upstairs bar is this converted house. It has the fridge full of all kinds of microbrews, and of course, PBR in cans for those of you true hipsters (still don't understand the irony of drinking gross canned beer). \n\nThey have live music 7 days a week, which I love. As they say in Wedding Crashers, \"It's a great band, it's a bad band, it's like pizza baby!\" But the three times I've gone they've always had a different genre of music and good bands you can get really close to. Because there's not really a stage so much as a little alcove. \n\nIf you go early you can enjoy a more chill vibe, and as the night goes on, it gets more and more crowded and louder and louder. \n\nThe bf and I tried mead here. I mean, how often do you get to try the nectar of vikings? We probably won't repeat that experience as we ended up at the illustrious Hotel Coronado, complimenting a shoeless man on his lack of footwear and feeling pretty terrible the next morning. \n\nIt's a fabulous end to a Roosevelt Row pub crawl, when you feel like good music, trying new beer, and dancing. I love the crowd. There's always some old hippies who are totally feeling the music besides the 20 something bespectacled hipster crowd. And guys wearing backpacks. Who wears a backpack to a bar?\n\nI'll be back.
