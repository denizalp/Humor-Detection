We love everyday noodle for their pork soup dumplings- they are a must have. Today we tried the chicken noodle soup- that had full piece of chicken with bones in them. We also had the bubble tea which is always a treat. The Bok Choy is delicious with the oyster sauce. The one and only disappoint was the crab dumplings ( just would never ever get them over the pork ones) not the same.\nOverall awesome place!
