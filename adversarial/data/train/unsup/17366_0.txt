Terrible service. Absolutely the worse dinning experience one can have. I ask the waiter to recommend a Cabernet or  Merlot wine, he walked away and came back with a glass of red wine (?) suggestion? As I swirled the glass, my hand felt a crusty coating surrounding the glass. Held it to the light..filthy. The 34 minute wait from after consuming the appetizer, until the main meal arrived was unacceptable. No water service or check in from the waiter. No lighting in the bar dinning area except tea lights. I had to use my phone to illuminate the menu. Other guest did as well. The place was not busy, yet service was awful.. \nGreat place to retire as it may be that long before you see either the waiter or your food. Eat elsewhere. Coal miners lamp required.
