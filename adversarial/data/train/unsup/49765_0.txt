A hidden gem in Vegas. We had 12 in our party and had a round table with a Lazy Susan. Perfect for family style. The Duck, Lamb, MongolianBeef and Orange Chicken were awesome. The place has elegance and sophistication yet is very affordable. As far as service goes no news is good news. Servers always had our food and drinks coming but never noticed they were there. Great place for an event or occasion. Ours was a graduation dinner.
