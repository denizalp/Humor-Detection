Well, I never expected to end up here on a Sunday night, but there I WAS.\n\nUnsurprisingly, 99.9999% of the crowd was women. Women of all ages- from the middle-aged menopausal to the barely (and QUESTIONABLY) legal.\n\nI went with a friend to the traveling show at the Baltimore Soundstage, and it was AWESOME. I love that they don't only pick volunteers for audience interaction (even though getting pulled onstage is one of my greatest fears), but the fact that they go out of their way to find shy, older ladies and incorporate them into the event makes it so FUN and inclusive.\n\nThose people especially come away from the event, I think, surprised with themselves and having the most fun out of everyone.\n\nIt was a very well-paced and organized show, with tasteful choreography (I might even be inspired to steal some moves), cool vocal talent, and fun audience skits.\n\nNot sure how soon, I'll go back to see a show, but I wouldn't cross it entirely off my list ;-)
