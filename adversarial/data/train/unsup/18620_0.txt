Tory Burch is a well known American designer who has designs that focus on bright American Sportswear and also a lot of trendy bright handbags or shoes to match.\n\nBefore Tory landed it's own stores in Canada, I often saw them in Holt Renfrew where it had circular golden emblem sit on bags and loafers.  Though most designs are modern, it does have a bit of a retro vibe.  The stores are exactly like her brand.  Golden accents frame up the bold colours of emeralds and rubies on the pieces.  Sometimes you'll spot a cutesy saying on a bag or a cat face on an item.  \n\nMost days the store is a calm spot but during the winter sales... watch out for the older ladies just swarming the store because of the 50% off everything sale.  Service here is mostly solid where they have 3 people trying to help people find sizes or pull items for a closer look.\n\nI find the style not quite mine but it's all very wearable with easy tunics, simple flowy pieces, or a figure skimming sheath.  The prices are above the average piece but I do find the material quality much nicer.  Fit and finish is a step up and if you do find something you like, it's an easy nice wear.\n\nI do have to mention that the sizing is not as forgiving if you're petite.  What was described as figure skimming and above the knees... well, it went a good inch below and perhaps almost 2 inches too big in other spots.  Maybe I'm just not cut out for the same as most Americans! oh well.
