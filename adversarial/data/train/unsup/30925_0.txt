Ate here yesterday and feel a bit iffy about the experience. We were seated immediately with our toddler and waited for quite awhile for drink service. Our server seemed stretched across many tables. We got our drinks after about 15 minutes and then ordered queso, a salad and a cheesesteak. The waiter started to leave without asking if\/what we wanted for our son, even though we were looking at the kids menu they gave us. \n\nAfter 25 minutes or so, our drinks were empty and we still hadn't received our queso app. My goat cheese salad, son's sliders and sweet potato fries and hubby's Philly came out and were all very good. The slider meat, in particular was very fresh and tasty. We told the runner who brought our food to ensure that our waiter knew not to bring out the delayed queso. No apology or offer to alleviate the botched order from her or our waiter. We eventually got drink refills and told our waiter about the queso. His reply...\"oh, I probably forgot to place that order.\" (laughing) Again, no apology or attempt to correct his mistake. Not a good first experience with customer service. The food we did get, however, was very good and we would be willing to go back and try more with a different server. This would be a great atmosphere for watching a game.
