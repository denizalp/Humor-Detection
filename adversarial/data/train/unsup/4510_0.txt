I would think twice before even wasting your time getting an estimate with this company. Difficult would be how I describe the experience. After having to schedule them twice to get an estimate, I still wasn't contacted with the estimate. I called and their supervisor told me he would contact me by the end of the day. A week later, still no call. \n\nI tried to contact the owner to tell him. (If it were my business I would want to know but maybe he has so MUCH work he doesn't have time to replace an estimated $600-700 job), He would not take the call. Unbelievable! I thought businesses needed just a little customer service o be successful. Apparently, I was wrong. But, it does explain why his employees have not regard for potential customers and follow through. The owner doesn't either.\n\nI guess they did me a favor. I am sure that if I used this company it would have been nothing but frustration.
