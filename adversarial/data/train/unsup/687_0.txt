*violently shakes head right and left* \n\nYeah. I didn't really like this place. The service was pretty good (tbh this makes up the entirety of the one star rating lol.) The food or at least what I had was not good at all.\n\nI got the \"Spicy Flavoured Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle Soup\". It was so god damn salty. It's just straight up salt. Apparently it is a level 2 spicy (or it had two red peppers next to the name), but ya girl wasn't even chugging water because it was spicy. LEVEL 2 SPICY MORE LIKE LEVEL 100 SALTY. I swear my tongue was cover in salt particles. Other than the saltiness, it tastes quite...bitter too. I think it's the pepper so whatever but yeah. The salt part was just ridiculous. It's funny because there was this woman next to me that had the same thing and I was like bruh, if you can't handle the spiciness DONT ORDER IT (she was drinking a lot of water and coughing quite a lot too). OH BOY I NEED A SLAP TO THE FACE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU MAN. I AM SORRY I HAVE WRONGED YOU LIKE SO. NEVER AGAIN. I honestly wanna hug her for finishing it because I really tried my best to, but I really couldn't. I legit tried to put the rice noodles and the other ingredients out of their salty misery by taking them out of the soup and drowning them in water but it was STILL SO SALTY. \n\nSALT FOR DAYS SALT SALT SALT \n\nPro: If you share a photo of your food or something on social media, you get free red bean filled pumpkin pancakes! They were pretty good (and hella hot; my tongue be a medium rare)\n\n**excuse my grammar in this; it's horrid
