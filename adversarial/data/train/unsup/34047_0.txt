Bought A GROUPON for this place for 6 colon hydrotherapy sessions. Called numerous times over a 3 week time frame, phone rings once then hangs up. I then decided to email..did that 3 times,no reply..in boxed this company on Facebook twice,someone read\/saw the message..still no reply. Why post  products you won't honor or at least be professional and return calls\/ answer the phone. Heard many good things about this place..guess it was just friends of the ppl who work here to make it seem like a great  company. Whatever their doing seems weird. Take caution.
