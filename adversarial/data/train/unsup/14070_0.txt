My husband and I have been members for years and I can't believe I haven't written a review. Front desk staff friendly and very accommodating.  My therapist ondrell is amazing at deep pressure. However if you are looking for a fluff and buff she is not your girl.  She prides herself on getting to those deep knots and getting them to relax.  She does well at it. Overall great value for their membership.  They have added new services with stretching and facials.  My massages here are way better than any massage I have had at the fancy strip spas.  My recommendation is finding a therapist you like and book them out every month.  Treat your body well and gift yourself a membership. Front desk is always nice and helpful.  I love it that they remember us and know our routine.  They are very accommodating.
