I have a love\/hate relationship with this fast. \n\nPros:\n*Fast\n*Many Options\n*Free Vacuums\n*Strong Vacuums \n*Lot of Vacuums\n\nCons:\n*It is a drive through car wash - just never as good as a hand wash\n*If I pay $20 for their premium car wash, I expect it to be super clean with no streaks. But then I remind myself it is just never as good as a hand wash.\n\nIn the end, it gets my car clean and the job done.
