The first of many weird @ss bar crawl that my companion and I did in our recent Vegas trip.\n\nThis by far was the most expensive crawl we did.\n\nAfter a satisfying brunch at their renown buffet at Wynn Hotel, my buddy decided that a drink was in order. I guess he hated to miss out his mid-noon kettle one shot.\n\nWe rounded the corner and discovered this small bar with a gaming machine on every bar seat. It wasn't very much to look at first. After all, I was thinking it was a way to charge for drinks while you're pulling a few card games.\n\nIf I was pulling a few slots, I would have gotten the drinks for free and just tip the waitress\/servers that passed by the floor. Instead we decided to gorge ourselves with overpriced drinks (about $12 for each of the mixed drinks, so I think) and a minimal selections of games at each gaming screen at the bar.\n\nThe bummer part was that we would hit MGM Grand later on the same evening and found out that their bar would comp for our drinks if we play the game machine at the bar. Furthermore,  we could have more choices of type of card games in the game machine.\n\nYes, it was a pricey mistake at the bar. Next we know better than sticking around Wynn's for an early noon drink.\n\nThe only redeeming value was that I ordered a Vodka red bull with Ketel One as my choice of brand. At least they let me keep the rest of the can of Red Bull where most places don't.\n\nIt pay off a little for me as I won $10 at the game machine. So it only cost me $2 really for the drink! \n\nVictory!!\n\nQuality: ****\nDecor: ***\nService:***\nAmenity: **\nAmbiance: ***
