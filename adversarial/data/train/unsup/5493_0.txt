My coworkers and I decided this would be a fun team building activity. A girl in our group purchased their Groupon and called to set an appointment time for us. We all got there at 9 pm on a Sunday night. The guy working was friendly and explained the process since none of us, except for one, have done an escape room before. He let us in our room, gave us a walkie talkie in case we needed hints and wished us luck. \n\nOur room's goal was to find the anecdote to a deadly virus before the hour was up. While I'm not going to ruin the surprise for people with this review, you pretty much have to use clues hidden through out the room to find the anecdote. There were 6 of us and we solved it without any hints in under 40 minutes. It was pretty fun and there were times we doubted ourselves, but it was exciting to keep finding things that led us closer to our objective. \n\nHere's my complaint. When we finally found the last clue, we used it to open a chamber with the anecdote inside. We pulled out the vial with the liquid inside and we were excited we found it. Only thing is, when we did find the anecdote, there was no \"hooray you found it!!\" over the walkie talkie. There are cameras in the room so they can see if you have solved it or not. We were waving the vial in front of the camera and still nothing. So we thought it wasn't the anecdote and spent another 10ish minutes looking for more clues. That's when someone in our group asked over the walkie talkie if the vial we found was really the anecdote. That's when the guy finally said congratulations over the walkie and let us out of the room. It was a big let down for all of us in the group because we wasted all that time still looking. When we asked why there was no acknowledgment, he said he was away from the screen. Gee thanks! \n\nOur group had fun, but we were all disappointed in the outcome. We plan on doing another escape room in the near future, but sadly, we will be going somewhere else.
