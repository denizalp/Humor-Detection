I've been here a few times and had mixed feelings about the place but last night I had one of the best sandwiches in my entire life. No exaggeration.\n\nI ordered the fried oyster poboy and it was superb. No other way to describe it. They were huge meaty oysters and the chef didn't cheap out on me, the sandwich was loaded from front to back. It was absolutely amazing.\nI found myself wanting to order a second immediately after.\n\nThis restaurant doesn't just do crab right, it does seafood right.
