I have had Daniel print T-shirts for me since 2009. They have held up very well, are still comfortable and the printing has lasted. I have been wearing shirts that he has printed since 2006 or 2007 and I fully stand behind his quality and value. \n\nThey are very easy to work with and I have no reservations writing this review.
