The fitness part of this place is great: machines are new and plentiful.  Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels.\n\nNow, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha.\n\nThe massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices.  I wouldn't return to the spa, although the gym is good.
