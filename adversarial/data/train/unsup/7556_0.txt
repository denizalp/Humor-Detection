I was in the area looking for a quick bite, and I saw this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try due to the relatively good ratings. \n\nThis place ain't no Benihana's. No show at your table, but it does its job. The chicken teppanyaki is a steal at $8.95, and it also comes with your choice of soup or salad. The portions are humongous, and it tastes pretty good as well (too much butter though). \n\nHowever, the spicy tuna was terrible. I'm not sure if I had a bad batch of tuna or not, but it did not taste fresh, and it had a really funky taste to it. I ate two pieces and threw the rest away. Shortly after, my stomach started to hurt, and then I had the runs. Yikes.\n\nI don't recommend getting their spicy tuna or anything spicy tuna related, but their teppanyaki plates are definitely worth a try.
