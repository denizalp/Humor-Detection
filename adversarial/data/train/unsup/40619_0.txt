I have been going here every 3 weeks for several years and the food has been really consistant, the service quick, but the price has steadily increased and for some odd reason, the last few times I've ordered, the pickle has either been non existant or it's lookinb pretty wilted. HIghly recommend the crazy dave if you like a little heat in your lunch.
