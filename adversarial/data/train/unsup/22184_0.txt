Ordered pizza delivery from here on September 23, 2016.  Our pizza arrived hot and fresh in about 30 minutes which was less time than I was expecting. Also the driver was very friendly and looked professional.  I hadn't had Domino's in about 10 years because I thought their pizza was shitty and would take forever but I gave them a chance and I'm glad I did. \n\nI got a large pizza with pineapple, ham, and jalapenos for $15.99.  It sounds terrible but trust me when I tell you it is so delicious.  Especially when you get a bite with all three ingredients in it...it's like a MOUTHGASM.  And if you wanna make it extra white trashy like me ask for some ranch dressing to dip it in.  They charge .50 cents for each little cup of dressing tho.  \n\nI like that when you order online there is a tracker that tells you the status of your pizza.  Has society gotten so uppity and demanding that they need to know the minute-by-minute status of their pizza delivery?  I'm more of a wait-an-hour-then-call-and-see-where-my-damn-pizza-is type of girl.  \n\nMy husband also got 8 pieces of boneless chicken for $6.49.  They taste exactly like frozen popcorn chicken.  They're nothing special so I'd recommend getting a sauce to go with them.  They have a lot to choose from like hot sauce, sweet mango & habanero, BBQ, ranch, blue cheese, garlic butter, and marinara.  \n\n$25 bucks is kinda more than I want to spend on mass-produced pizza and frozen chicken.  I think for the price I'd rather go to Little Caesars and get the same thing for like $6 less.  \n\nHaving said that I think the DXP is really cool...it's a little Chevy Spark economy car with a pizza warmer build into it.  I've never seen one in Vegas but I think the concept is pretty neat.  Maybe that's why their pizza is so garsh darn expensive...to pay for their fancy new lil' cars.  I dunno.
