We ended up in Captial Seafood Restaurant as we were looking for Pho Vietnam. It's crazy confusing as both signs are lit up all big above this restaurant area. Once in the door they have a stack of menus for both restaurants. They then ask you which one you want. We looked around and everyone was eating Seafood, so we punted and went with the Seafood. \n\nEveryone around us were locals. The prices were great and the food was pretty good. Actually two of the dishes we had were great: bok choy with mushrooms and salt & pepper squid. Both cooked perfectly - not overcooked and really flavorful. We also got the crab appetizer - which was a special. That dish was so bad that neither of us could eat it. It was cooked so long that you could even bite all the way through the pieces. And it had a sauce that was totally funky.\n\nAll together though - for the prices and the majority of great food AND the amount of locals that were obviously enjoying themselves and had spreads on their table that looked delicious: we would come back for sure.
