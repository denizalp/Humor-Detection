This looks like a great little neighbourhood pub.  However, the bartender who greeted us had us hating the place within our first 60 seconds. His intention was to make sure he had the opportunity to maximize the revenue opportunity from each of his few tables. Fair enough. We were only staying for a few drinks and we would have been happy anywhere.  But the way he went about it left us feeling like we were vagrants trying to bed down in a corner booth. \n\nIt's amazing how a few misspoken words can leave a lasting impression. I'm not going back.  EVER.
