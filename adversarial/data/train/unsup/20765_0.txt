I just tried them today. I would have to say that I would be really impressed with everything if I wouldn't have had an issue with my food. I got the honey walnut shrimp and it tasted as if it had been fried\/cooked in old oil. It had a terrible after taste. I stopped eating it, it was that bad. I contacted the restaurant and Summer began defending the oil, stating that the oil is changed every day and my complaint had her scratching her head as to how this could happen. I was shocked at her defensiveness and thought to call and soak with a higher Manager in the morning as I felt I would get no where with her. \n\nIf customer service is their focus, she didn't meet that expectation for me.
