The quality of food that you receive for the price is ridiculous. The prime rib was cold and half of it was not even edible (pure fat). If you decide to share a plate they tack on an extra $20 charge without notifying you. You're much better off going to Herbs and Rye or another steakhouse in the area. You're basically paying for the ambiance. Our family was so disappointment; we will not be going back.
