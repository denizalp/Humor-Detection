Their service sucks I order a tum yum soup and it was too sweet the waitress if she can bring me lemongrass to give it to sour taste that it lacked and she got mad and told me to GET OUT she didn't have an attitude at ask my friends if their food was fine I told her there food is good it was just my soup then she replied I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU! I was embarrassed and just left the place HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE...
