We were at the Bellagio and the boys were playing video games. My sister and I decided to get some gelato before heading out to watch the water show out front.\n\nI taste-tested a few flavors and settled on the lemon. I have never tasted a lemon gelato so tart  AND creamy at the same time! It really hit the spot and was VERY refreshing on a hot Vegas day!\n\nRight near the pool and arcade and museum. A little pricey. I think it was about $10 for 2 servings. Oh well! You're in Vegas! Who cares!
