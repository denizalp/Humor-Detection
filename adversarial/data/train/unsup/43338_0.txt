First and foremost, the food tastes great, but it did not help with the bad taste in my mouth, left by the service received.\n\nI'm a fan of Guy Fieri, I love to watch Triple D. With that being said, I am disappointed in his Vegas Kitchen And Bar. My wife and I have gone twice now. The first time we went, the hostess acted very bored and could care less about us. I guess I was expecting a Guy Fieri like enthusiasm. And to be honest, I guess that would not be fair to do. \n\nThe second time around, We arrived sat down at about 11:30. Our server took our order, about 20 minutes later our server came back and claimed that the kitchen was running slow. Mind you, the place was maybe half full. After eating our server gave us the bill which was printed about the same time we were told about the kitchen being slow. I felt like maybe it was the server who was slow to give the kitchen . Was I lied to? I sure felt like it.
