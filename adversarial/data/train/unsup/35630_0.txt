Before arriving to Las Vegas, we had looked up things you must do while in Vegas.  One of the things listed that you must check out was In-N-Out Burgers.\n\nWe pulled up to a packed parking lot as people were fighting for parking spots.  When we walked in the line was so long we thought, damn this is gonna be and in-n-stay rather than in-n-out burger place.  Wrong.  They were so fast along with the diners because tables were like parking spots, loads of people and cars and not a lot of seating or parking spots.  We spotted a table and downed our burgers and fries.  It reminded me of a Johnny Rockets Restaurant if you have ever been there but it was much better!!  For under $5 bucks a person, you could have a tasty burger with fries and a drink and its really good.  They apparently butcher their own meat so I was told.  At least the company which is family owned butchers their own meat.\n\nIf you are in Las Vegas and needing a quick bite, definitely stop by In-N-Out Burgers!!  It was totally worth it!!\n\nCheers and Enjoy!!
