Based on the nam eighties place I would expect Otto be bar style food. However, their menu is a little fancy compared to what I had expected. Their salads are very good and the service has always been great. There's not a lot of parking close to it but at least it's located in a shopping center. Wait times are sometimes very long and there aren't many seats for people who are waiting. There is also a massive bird problem if you happen to sit outside. Sometimes their specials are to die for and I really wish the buffalo chicken dip was an actual menu item. I did get food poisoning once from the buffalo chicken so I no longer order chicken from them.
