Okay, I admit that I have been a bit of a bad girl with my lunches the past couple of days.  Yesterday I ate at Fadz Sandwich Shop and today I went over to Wiener World.  I guess I haven't felt like brown-bagging it lately.  \n\nWiener World is another one of those places that has always just been there.  The neon exterior sign proclaims \"Hot Dogs, Fries, Kielbasa, Fish, Ice Cream, Pizza\" and believe me, that's all you gotta know about this place.  The dogs are grilled and they do have a certain \"crunch\" to them.  I like the all-beef dog  with mustard, onions, relish, pickle, and (thanks to my Chicago friends) NO KETCHUP!  The chili dogs here are fantastic too.  \n\nThe place is kind of spartan, but it's really more of a \"grab-n-go\" place.  I took mine back to the office.  They also have a walk-up window and in the summer, many people prefer to dine \"al-fresco\".  There are numerous squares and plazas nearby in which to have a pleasant lunch.\n\nI heard a great quote once about work and it went something like this:  \"Probing the minds of management around here is like probing the innards of a hotdog.  The less you know what's really in there, the happier you are.\"  But let's face it, sometimes a girl's just gotta have a hotdog and today was one of those days.
