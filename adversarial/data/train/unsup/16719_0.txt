II had the original Burger Lounge in San Diego bookmarked since the day they opened.  I had chances to go, but was swayed by either a friend's bad review of the place or because there's so many other options in Daygo.  Since then, Burger Lounge has expanded throughout the 619.  As they got bigger, I heard that the quality of their burgers got worse.  Let me see for myself. \n\nBurger Lounge is now in Las Vegas inside the Aria and conveniently located next to the poker room.  The location is small and can be easily missed if you're not paying attention.  The menu consist of burgers, a turkey burger, a veggie burger, 2 types of breakfast sandwiches, and salad (but who has time for that?).  Sides include fries and onion rings. Burger Lounge also has floats and shakes for dessert.  I got the Double Classic (double grass-fed beef and cheese).  You know how in some places you can't tell the difference between a regular burger and a burger that comes from grass-fed cows.  Here, I can taste the difference.  The burgers are fresh, juicy, and very tasty. The quality that you get here also comes with a hefty price.  3 burgers (one was a double), two sides, and one drink cost us about $75.  In my opinion, that's a little steep considering that the size of the burgers are a little small.  But you pay for quality, right? Overall, I'm a fan of the taste of their burgers. I'm just not a huge fan of the value.  \n\n2017 Yelp Review #63
