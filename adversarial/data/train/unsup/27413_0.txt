Not the best buffet in Vegas.\nThe food selection consist of Italian, Mexican, Chinese, BBQ and sea.\nThere were not too many options at each and every one of the cuisines. Mexican was basically rice, guacamole, chicken and salsa. Italian was pizza and macaroni, Chinese looked like a skinny version of Panda Express and the BBQ... Well you can call it BBQ if all you like is baby back ribs and potatoes.\nI gave it star instead of 2 because the staff was friendly and the dessert were good
