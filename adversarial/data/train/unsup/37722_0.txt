$70! For 2 kid size portions! My husband and I are originally from Louisiana, so we were excited to go to Landry's for some of our hone town favorites. However, we were deeply disappointed. I ordered the fried seafood platter and my husband ordered the beer battered fish and chips. My seafood platter was extremely small and unseasoned. I have never seen a seafood platter that small before. I literally had 5 French fries, 4 oysters, 4 shrimp, 1 stuffed shrimp, 1 small piece of Basa and a stuffed crab, a few strings of fried onions. This was for $23.99. Now way was this platter worth that amount. My husband was also very displeased with his amount for the price. We have visited Landry's in New Orleans, LA and Lafayette, La. The size of out plates there was enormous well seasoned and worth the price. We were completely shocked with the Landry's in Las Vegas. This is not the restaurant we once knew. Something needs to change because our experience is not the 4 star Landry's we experienced with the restaurants in Louisiana. The chefs in the Las Vegas restaurant need to take lessons from the chefs in the Louisiana Landry's. You must season seafood! It's complete garbage otherwise. For the price portion size should not be the size of a kiddie plate. Presentation is also a must! Out food looked like it had been thrown on a plate, no neatness at all. We defiantly would not recommend the Las Vegas location or visit again. Serious changes need to be made with this restaurants chefs\/cooks. They need to be given instruction on how to properly cook and serve Landry's dishes.
