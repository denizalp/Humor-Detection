November Challenge - 12\/30\n\nAfter browsing through Calgary's Taboo trade show and coming back with bed sheets and hot sauce, my friend and I decided to do a quick stop at A Little More Interesting. Tired from the constant, aggressive \"You should read this terrible Twi-mom slash fic that somehow got a book deal of its own!\" sales pitch we got all up and down Taboo, A Little More Interesting was much classier and felt less Hot Topic for Your Mom. \n\nThe store is well laid out; according to my friend, they've likely scaled down on their wares and offer only what sells, unlike other stores that seem to have everything from videos to novelty plastic buttcheeks. The staff is friendly, and know when to offer advice and when to let you peruse on your own. Best of all, their prices were far more reasonable than the \"awesome deals\" being offered at the trade show. \n\nThe lingerie section is pretty costume-y, much of it seems like it needs to come with a RPG script or a cape, but a small selection would definitely fall in to the casual daytime look category. \n\nGive them a try. Paying them a visit, I could definitely see why they're rated one of Calgary's Best year after year :).
