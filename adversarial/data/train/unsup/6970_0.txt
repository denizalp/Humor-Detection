Poor Golfland Sunsplash, you get a bad rap. Maybe it's because I don't have children that I like you. I like you enough to even tolerate people that let their children hop all over the place ruining a relaxing evening of very unskilled mini golf. I don't care if you are outdated. I appreciate the nostalgia and will continue to visit it you once every year or so just to enjoy all the memories and have some good times.
