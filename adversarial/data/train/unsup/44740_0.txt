I love this place. Their service is friendly and everything I've tried on the menu for the last 2.5 years has been great. The calamari appetizer, half price at happy hour, is the best calamari in the country. And my airline pilot husband and I have traveled and eaten out a whole lot in the last 30 years. Our college student son likes the food as well. The Asian fusion cuisine works. You'll love it.
