Prepare to be disappointed. I assure you that your fantasy will not come true here. The facility is pretty cool and the staff was kind but it's just another tourist trap to bleed you dry. I visited as part of a couple. The prices we're pretty ridiculous even for a couple. The single man rate is even higher I could only imagine how much worse it would have been if I had gone solo. Way too many creepy single men roaming from room to room. The place is pretty big but it works against itself when there's no one there. It was dark and creepy, not a sexy vibe at all. There is no alcohol on the premises but there is a bar next door. The bar next door had a pretty shitty clientele. We hung around for a few hours, the place was pretty dead so we went to the bar next door for a little while. We went back but we never clicked with anyone so we left.
