I've never had a bad massage at the VH Spa. Leslie was my masseuse today and he was fantastic; he definitely did not take it easy on me for the deep tissue massage, and I mean that in the best way possible. I had some horrible knots in my shoulders and he took his time to work out the kinks. The amenities are pretty basic compared to other high end spas in Scottsdale, but the price point is excellent. Make sure you check out the Swell Specials on their website before booking - most of them are even better than what you find on Groupon. My hour long deep tissue massage was only $69 (+ gratuity). There is a dry sauna available for use and a well stocked exercise room. It also includes hotel pool and hot tub access if you want to make a day out of it. They also validate for parking, so don't hesitate to use the valet. I highly recommend grabbing lunch or dinner at Cafe Zuzu downstairs - their food is out of this world!
