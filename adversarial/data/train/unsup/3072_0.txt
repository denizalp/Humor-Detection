I have come here a handful of times now. Hands down, best buffet in Vegas. Word has spread so the prices have jumped =[\nStill, the locals and tourists alike flock here. \nTry coming early, BEFORE they open... There's already a line, trust me. The shortest I've ever waited was maybe 20 minutes but the longest was an hour.\nEach minute of torture was worth it.\nEnormous variety of food to choose from.\nThe servers are attentive here. I never have to ask for a refill, they always know to bring me more ginger ale because they actually pay attention to you!!! \nSO MANY HUGE CRAB LEGS. \nThey have sushi, sashimi, pasta, BEST FREAKIN PRIME RIB AT A BUFFET EVER, \n\noh my goodness..\nI can't gush about this place enough.\n\nMy friend is a local to Vegas and took me here. I love him so so so much for bringing Studio B into my life.\n\nThe desserts are all good too. Each time I come, I have about 6-8 desserts.\n\nyes, I am greedy.
