My family and I really enjoy going to the Winking Lizard. I have tried many of their different dishes and I have not found one I didn't like. It's an all-around good place. The hamburgers are good, I like their corned beef, and (of course) their wings! \n\nFor their spring menu, they added a lamb burger... Which is awesome!\n\nGreat beer selection too!
