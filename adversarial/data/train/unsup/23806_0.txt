Dear SLS (Las Vegas), \n\nI am a local and have tried and tried... Our relationship is now over... And let me tell you why! Your property lacks consistency, customer service, and overall property information. Your local nights and nearby residents promos were great in idea but not when you must sit through terrible service, mediocre food, and staff who are bouncing from one place to the other on property. With a couple great food options due to them simply being on your property immediately makes it lose it's luster. Katsuya, Bazaar Meat, and SLS Hotel... I'll see visit you when I am NOT in Las Vegas. Complete let down of a property, I could not understand why it was so empty when I would visit... After going, and going, and going... I understand. Nightlife is painful, appreciate the live musicians placed randomly through the property, and the occasional acts they bring in at The Foundry. I would recommend you start letting your front of house staff know WHO is performing as well as WHEN and WHERE. We were sent to the strip for entertainment to learn they had events going on that very same evening, lol. Wishing you guys better business skills!\n\nOh! Cleo, I love your watermelon and greek salad =).
