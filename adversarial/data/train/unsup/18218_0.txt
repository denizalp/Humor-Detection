My visit to Tiffany's was as much an experience as it was a meal. Our Breakfast Club is always in search of a good eatery for the morning meal. I have driven past White Cross hundreds of times, but have never been inside. Upon entry, the atmosphere kind of takes you back to the day's of Mel's Diner on the TV show Alice. It's old school, with a few tables and plenty of space at the counter. We all bellied up to the counter and got a front row seat to watch the goings on at the grill. For me the decison was easy. Chicken Fried Steak. No choice of potato. You get what they give you and they were good. Crispy with lots of flavor. The meat was breaded while we watched and then slapped on the grill. It was tender and easily cut with only a fork. The waitress makes your toast while you watch and keeps your coffee cup full throughout the meal. This was down home, throw back dining at it's finest. The cook took time to show us the fresh meat he used for the CFS and explained he had been working the grill at Tiffany's for more than 30 years. The waitress was personable and friendly, explaining the grill was open 'round the clock. We all chose traditional breakfast food, but Tiffany's also offers Trout or Liver with your eggs, if you so choose. If you are visiting Vegas and want a departure from the typical Vegas faire, you've got to try Tiffany's. If you are local and want to experience your town like never before, step on inside for a throwback to a simpler time. I will definitely return to Tiffany's. Their CFS ranks among some of the best I've had in town.
