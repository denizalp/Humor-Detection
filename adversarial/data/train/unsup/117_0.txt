Pamela's saved us after we were turned away from the S&D Polish Deli down the street for not being Polish enough (we may have fled after being stared at uncomfortably by three strange women).\n\nWandering gypsies without a home, we found Pamela's a few blocks up and they welcomed us. This Cash Only (of course) diner in the amazing Strip District is freaking adorable with portraits, news articles and art all over the walls. It screams kitsch, and being of the tacky variety of human I immediately felt comfortable here. \n\nI was really craving something fattening, like a milkshake, but Pamela's saved me from myself by being one of those rare diners that doesn't offer milkshakes. Fine. I ordered the hamburger, and indeed it tasted like a hamburger. The fries were definitely made out of potatoes. Our silverware was clean. The place didn't smell like vomit, and that speaks volumes when it comes to diners. The guy running the place gave us advice about Pittsburgh, useful bits such as \"Yeah, this town is dead by 6 pm.\" Good to know.\n\nPamela's was by the far the most welcoming place we encountered in this area (S&D and Penn Avenue Fish both being just outright rude), and for that they earn a place in this Southern girl's heart.
