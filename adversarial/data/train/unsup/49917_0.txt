I flew from Philly to Vegas to marry the woman of my dreams,but unfortunately my suit that was supposed to meet me here didn't. After speaking to Patrice(manager at Vegas location) she was extremely helpful and really saved the day. The crew back at the Philly location also played a special part in helping solve my issues immediately. So with less then 2 hours to get back to the hotel an get prepared for a life changing event such has marriage I made it!! An Men's Wearhouse made it also....\nNot to mention when I called Ms.Patrice today she remembered my wife name an gave us well wishes an I think it was so thoughtful. I'll be back again an again.\nAnd I looked gooooooooooooooooooooooood
