Myself and a friend headed here after hitting up a movie at the AMC next door and despite the later hour the staff was friendly and warm when we came in.  We were seated in a booth towards the back of the restaurant and the server came up within seconds to take our drink order.  \n\nWhen the waitress returned with our drinks we were ready to order and she was happy to oblige.  I had the mushroom and swiss burger and my friend had the boneless buffalo wings with a side of fries.  The burger was cooked to a darker medium - I usually like medium rare, but I don't remember being asked what temp, so it's probably a standard for the establishment.  \n\nAs we were finishing up, I requested a to-go order for my fiancee so that he would have something to eat when he got off work.  The waitress had the food out within a couple of minutes, and he really enjoyed the burger and mashed potatoes.\n\nOverall: A\nDefinitely a place we will go back to when in the area!  The staff was really friendly and the food was good - next go around I think I'll get chicken tenders!
