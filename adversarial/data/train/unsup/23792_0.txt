We needed to get a document notarized for insurance purposes. After doing a Yelp search, this was the closest location to us. Quick and easy. We signed the document. The employee signed and stamped the document. Paid the $10 and in less than 5 minutes we were done. If we ever need to get anything notarized in the future, we know where to go. \n\nP.S. They also do shipping, faxing, copying and all other things UPS related.
