I've been here quite a few times now since I'm going to be a mom soon. I can honestly say that I really do love this store. They have aisles and aisles of stuff that are super organized. Items dedicated to feeding, baby gear (strollers\/car seats), bathing and diapers are on the left side of the store. The clothing and furniture departments are in the middle. Bedding, decor and toys are on the right side. It's always been super quiet during my visits, so I've never had an issue with items being out of stock. I have never had to wait in line at the register for long. I had my baby registry here and it was a super easy process for returns and purchased. And they have a rewards card where you accumulate points, which then turns into $ off your future purchases. So why only the 3 star rating? Prices for items can be ridiculous. I've seen the exact same items at Target for much cheaper. But I can see visits here in my near future since they have items that I've only seen at this store. So alas, I will be back, spending $$ on my son and his needs.
