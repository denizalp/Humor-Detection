This shop is the best. Been coming here 3 years now. Staff is always kind and helpful. They take time to answer questions, and make sure you know how to use whatever product you buy from them. I quit smoking cigarettes 3 years ago and almost fell off the wagon yesterday. I had just lost one of my pets and needed new coils for my vape because the only one I had was so burned, it was scorching my throat. I went in the evening with sunglasses on to hide my grief. Unfortunately, the coils for my pen were out of stock. It just wasn't my day. I was upset but bought liquid and figured I'd just get cigarettes on the way home. Sydney is the gal who was helping me and maybe she could just sense that I needed help. She got a coil out from a new box and sold it to me. It was the only thing that saved me from going backwards to cigarettes. I really appreciate them even though they had no idea what I was going through. I recommend them for their products, their liquid (nothing in this town beats fruits and cream), but mostly the staff. They just know how to treat people right. Thank you Sydney!!!
