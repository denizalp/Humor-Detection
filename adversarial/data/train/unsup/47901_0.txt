This is the worst Wendy's I have ordered food from. 3rd time going to this Wendy's restaurant. Every time I go I don't get what I ordered. I paid for a triple burger and got a double that looked like they made the burger then stepped on it. Also this took about 30 minutes to get a crappy meal. I will not return. Chances are I'll get the same terrible service. If your reading this and have never been to this restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this Wendy's.\nIf the owner or manager is reading this you should pay attention to your restaurant. I will spread the word about the service I received.
