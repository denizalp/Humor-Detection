I booked the room on their website and was treated like a VIP from check-in to check-out. Plenty of visible security at the elevators to make sure you get to the right set of super fast elevators and to make sure you are supposed to be there. \n\nThe room felt like a suite with nicely appointed cabinetry & furnishings throughout. I was very impressed with the deep soaking tub, even though the jets did not work (I reported this on check-out). There was even a digital scale in the bathroom. Everything was very clean and it was a real pleasure not smelling cigarette or cigar smoke anywhere in the building. I would gladly return to this property if my travels take me to Las Vegas.
