This place is awesome! A great little dive not that far from the strip. $1 PBRs....where else can you get a beer in Vegas for $1?  Service was prompt and friendly.  No tabs, so you pay for each round. And you pay cash, they don't take credit cards. \n\nWe came here late afternoon during the week. The crowd was a mix of locals, some tourists and hotel workers.   They had a security guard in there checking ids.  Prices on everything were pretty darn low. Not sure if I'd tempt fate and have a hotdog.  \n\nIn closing: $1 PBRs 2 blocks from the strip.
