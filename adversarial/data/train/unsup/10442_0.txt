The last time I went roller skating was probably 1987, at Skaters World in Wayne, NJ.\nMy sister invited me this past Saturday afternoon and I was no disappointed. All that was missing were some acid washed jeans and scrunchy socks to complete my trip back into the 80s.\nWe had a great time! IT was PACKED. There were tons of birthday parties so my only real complaint was the lack of tables and food. They literally were out of hot dogs and pizza for non party skaters (insane, we had nachos. boo).\nThe music was great, the dj was fantastic with getting the kids involved, and the training skate mate rental for the little kids was great.\nWe'll be back :)
