I had a few hours to kill on the Strip recently and I was famished, so I decided to finally try the Earl of Sandwich to see if it lived up to the massive amount of hype it gets from tourists. First impression: Ugh. There was a long line, a couple of the employees looked pretty frazzled and many of the table were littered with trash. \n\nI ended up ordering 'The Best BLT'. A little cocky, are we Earl? I love BLTs and I love BLTAs even more, so I had them add avocado for a $1 upcharge. Then I waited another 10 minutes after I ordered to pay another employee $10 and change for the sandwich and drink. After paying I was given one of the buzzers many places use to let people know their tables are ready.  Thankfully the wait for my actual food was pretty short, I had just grabbed some napkins and filled my drink. \n\nMy sandwich was good but mindblowing? No. Not even close. The bacon was well cooked, nothing ruins a BLT quicker then soggy bacon.. but I have had more flavorful bacon elsewhere. The bread was tasty but greasy, causing me to require a ton of napkins. The avocado really made it as good as it was, but I get the credit for that, not Earl. \n\nMany people call The Earl of Sandwich inexpensive, I guess for the Strip it isn't insane, but I am pretty sure that for just a few dollars more I could have found a place on the Strip where I could get a BLTA with waiter service.\n\nIf you are stumbling around Planet Hollywood all wasty-pants, these sandwiches would probably blow you away. If you are sober, or a local (or both) chances are you won't be THAT impressed by these. Worth a visit if you are in the area but not worth a special trip to the Strip in my opinion.
