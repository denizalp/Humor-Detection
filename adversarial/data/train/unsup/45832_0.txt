I have generally had good experience with Freshii, but today I ordered spicy lemongrass soup vegetarian with tofu to go. When I reached my office and started eating it, the tofu was spoilt, it was smelling. Unfortunately I did not have the energy and time to head back and tell them. I am very disappointed. I have ordered this soup but after today's experience I may not go back. Please check the ingredients before you serve your customers. I am terribly upset
