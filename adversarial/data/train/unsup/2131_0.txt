This little pharmacy is located right across from ABC store in University area. I was recommended by a friend of mine to visit this place if I ever need any medicine. Well I figured I should pick up my acid reflux pill before I eat my pizza since it has lot of tomato\/tomato paste. \n\nI got in and I was welcomed by this cute Pharm tech :) I started asking question because I needed something for my acid reflux and the Pharmacist came to help me since I was asking good questions. He suggested a medicine which helped me get a good night sleep with out worrying about my acid reflux and it didn't break my bank since it was OTC. He also asked me if I was talking any other drugs to make sure I don't get any side effect. \n\nBoth employees were very friendly and talkative, I spend almost 30 minutes talking them rather then wait at other drug stores. On my way out, the pharmacist told me that if that don't do the justice, I will give you something better but I want you to start with low dose since you are just starting out.
