I had this place bookmarked for about two years, finally had a chance to try here this morning. \n\nPast several times, whenever I came, wait was 45-60 mins. Finally came at 8:20am and was told 20 mins wait. Gave my cell phone number, waited for about 10 mins when I received text message that my table is ready! \n\nService was very prompt, so efficient. Food came out fairly quick.\n\nBased on reviews, tried bacon Belgium waffles. Bacon is inside the waffles as well as on top. Salty bacon and sweet waffles were perfect combination. \n\nAlso tried my ultimate favorite breakfast, classic egg benedict. It came with hash browns. Never had this kind, potato was sliced thin, parts of it was a tad burned but good taste for sure. Egg benedict tasted like egg benedict should taste like.\n\nBest part was freshly squeezed orange juice. It tasted so good, wished they served it with champagne. \n\nMost food was just about $10 each, great price, fast service, no wonder why they have a long wait on weekend morning.
