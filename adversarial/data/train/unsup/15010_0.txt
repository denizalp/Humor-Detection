What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. \n\nThis review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.\n\nThe layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. \n\nI was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!\n\nLet's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.\n\nDATE TIP: Fellas, let me break it down for you. Women typically don't appreciate random hands up their skirts. At least buy them a drink first! Ha.
