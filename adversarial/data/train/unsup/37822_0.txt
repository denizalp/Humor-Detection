This chain is always nice to stop and eat at once and a while. The food portions are huge and I like the options as well as the orange juice maker they have behind the bar. The prices do feel high especially for breakfast foods.. The atmosphere reminds me of walking into a bed and breakfast or cabin in the woods. Overall, enjoyed my time there.
