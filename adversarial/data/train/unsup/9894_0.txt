Salut, to this little Grocery! Bunched in to a small corner strip mall, this place doesn't look like much from the outside, but boy is it some kind of awesome on the inside! Super cute high tops with flowers and succulents. They had fridges full of beers, wines, and foods such as salads, and sandwiches. The Deli was filled with tasty sweet treats, cheeses, and small plates behind glass windows. There were 2 guys manning the whole place. Taking orders, greeting guests, taking out and making the food. They did a very good job at all of the above. We ordered the Beignets, Creme Brûlée, and a French Press. We were all very pleased. I will say that I was a little disappointed in the Beignets... A bit more doughy then what I've had before, not very melt in your mouth. (I would - 1\/2 star for that if I could.) but the French Press Coffee was perfect, and the Creme Brûlée was fantastic! I will be back for some lunch and some more sweet treats. And I just loved the ambiance!!
