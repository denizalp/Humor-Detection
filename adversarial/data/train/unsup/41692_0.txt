I have used and recommended this company for several years now. All I can say is, they are awesome. \nDependable, careful, courteous and friendly. I recently made the mistake of letting my contractor use someone else (we were in a pinch) for some work on one of our properties. The experience was so bad that I called Mike and he quickly bailed me out of a potential problem. \nLesson learned. I knew I should have called them first but let someone talk me into what could have been a disaster. \nI highly recommend this company, we have several properties and my wife is also a realtor that uses him for her clients. They have never let us down and we've never had problem they couldn't fix.
