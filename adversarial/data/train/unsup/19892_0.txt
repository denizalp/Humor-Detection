My husband is going to need a second job to support my love affair with Tommy V's.  Love the new decor (clean and modern) and the staff.  Our visits were almost 2 weeks apart, and we were surprised that not only did the bartender (Lisa) remember us but remembered what we had to drink!\n\nAnd the food...Fantastic happy hour that sadly runs only Mon-Fri and is really more of a lunch menu with salads, pasta dishes, and sandwiches.  The very happy hour menu offers select $5 apps, $5 well & wine, and beer specials.  First time we shared the short rib sliders from the $5 menu as well as risotto carbonara and smoked salmon bruschetta. While the bruschetta was perfectly fine, it was the only thing that didn't wow me.  The sliders (2) were worth twice their price tag and the risotto was incredible with pancetta, parmigiano, and peas.  \n\nWeekends offer only the dinner menu.  My husband had the grilled shrimp risotto (yes, he's into risotto thanks to all the Hell's Kitchen viewing this summer).  Although a little pricey ($18), it was well worth it.  Because good things come in threes, I had the hand-made pasta trio ($19):  mushroom and mascarpone tortelli; brie and asiago gnocchi in a brown butter sauce, and spinach ricotta ravioli.  The only bad thing about this dish was I had to offer my husband a bite of each.\n\nMy diet had been going so well, too.  What a shame it's all over.  See you soon Tommy.
