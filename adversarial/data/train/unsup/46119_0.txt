For your typical, hole-in-the-wall, take-out Chinese Food place it's very good! Especially in this area. I'd say it's the best. Last night was the second time my husband and I ordered out here. (You can dine-in and they also deliver!) I'm really not a big fan of take out Chinese and I tend to avoid it. But I think this place has changed my mind! We got the Orange Chicken ($7,) Egg rolls (2 for $2,) and Crab Puffs (6-7 for $3.) {Yea... We know we're basic ) How do you beat those prices? The chicken was still crispy(usually hard to do with take out),  all white meat, nice portion, we had leftover after sharing even. The Egg rRolls were nice and crispy, as were the Crab Puffs! And the white right was nice, sticky, and not dry!\n\nOn the another note. I wasn't a fan of the Sweet and Sour Sauce. It had nooooo flavor. It was very watery. And I might get a side of the orange sauce. We discovered most of it ended up on the bottom of the box. So a tip I might give is to dump your food into bowls and mix to get a better coating of sauce all around. \n\nIf you are looking for a cheap, fast, good meal. You have come to the right place!
