Came here with friends one day for lunch. I am a vegetarian while everyone else I was eating with ate meat. \nThere were no menu options other than sides or appetizers for vegetarian options so I got the mozzarella sticks. They were ok but nothing special or unique. I do believe they made their own marinara sauce which is a plus. They have a small local beer selection on draft as well. \nAll in all I wouldn't go here again. All of my meat eating friends seemed to enjoy it though. They have pretty standard food options, bar food for sure.
