First time for everything. I recently had my first quick appointment here. I was in a hurry and needed a polish change on my toes. I was able to get in right away with no wait. I brought my own polish which was painted perfectly on my toes. The shop is decorated very nice. Looks very classy. Many open spots that would make the perfect girls night out. \n\nEveryone was friendly excluding the two young boys who rang me up. The teenagers seemed to not really want to be working and did not provide the best service by saying \"Hello\" or even \"Thank you!\" They took my money without even looking me in the face and walked away with the tip. I would try them again for other services.
