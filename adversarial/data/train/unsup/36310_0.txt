I ended up with a last minute day off and didn't want to waste it, but I thought it might be too late to get an appointment for a pedicure. I called over and was told they could get me in about an hour from the time I was calling. Perfect! \n\nThe woman on the phone was very helpful in explaining their location. I live nearby and have been to GVR countless times, but would have never found this place hidden behind the GVR property across from the new Lifetime Fitness. \n\nThe whole spa\/salon area is gorgeous and definitely adds to the experience. My pedicure service turned out great and the technician was very friendly. I left feeling very relaxed. I can't wait to go back for a massage sometime. They also offer a locals discount which made the service more reasonable in cost.
