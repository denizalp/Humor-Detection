This place was AMAZING!  I got there when they opened and was there until maybe 2 AM.  The piano player was named Frank and there wasn't a song he couldn't play.  There were many people from all over the world.  I sang a couple of times and it was a lot of fun.  FYI: if you tip the piano player a LOT of money you can sing a whole bunch of songs at once.  I got a beer and it was like $6 but didn't care.  The bartenders who were there that night should have Grammys!  I can't wait to go back there.
