This is by far my favorite Target store in the valley. I tend to be a difficult customer in regards to looking for specific sizes, items, and dealing with returns but tonight Thomas (who mentioned he was still in training) checked me out and he was the most pleasant employee I have EVER dealt with. Not only did he initiate meaningful conversation, but was virtuous enough to walk my bags after check out to me on my side of the register...this is something luxury retailers such as Nordstrom's provide, and I would have never expected it and was pleasantly surprised! Thank you Thomas!
