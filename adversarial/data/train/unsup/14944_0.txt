Breakfast for Lunch\n\nThis was the first time I visited \"Scramble a Breakfast Joint\" based on the reviews of fellow \"Yelpers\". From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted by a friendly staff member and you can't help but notice the cleanliness of the restaurant. \n\nThe menu is printed on the wall, so you place your order at the register, take a seat, and wait for your delicious meal to be delivered. There is a bottomless coffee and beverage station in the middle of the restaurant and TVs throughout the entire restaurant.\n\nOn this visit I had the buttermilk pancakes and bacon All I have to say is, these pancakes were not only delicious but made perfectly, soft and fluffy on the insdide and golden brown on the outside, perfect! and the bacon was thick, but not too thick; crispy but not too crispy; once again, perfect,  tasty and delicious.\n\nI look forward to revisiting \"Scramble a Breakfast Joint\" again and try other delicious items offered on their menu.
