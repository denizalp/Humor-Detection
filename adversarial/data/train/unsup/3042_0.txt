This review began in my mind about 10 days ago. I picked up my little shirt collection and all seemed well. Price was OK. Then, tonight, I unpacked one of my shirts to wear to dinner.\n\nThe sleeve is almost completely torn off and pinned with two safety pins. I guess they figured I would just assume that it was an updated fashion statement. They probably didn't mention it because they couldn't handle my explosion of gratitude.
