My god this place is phenomenal.  I have been to many other popular sushi places including nobu. This one is by far my favorite.  All of the ingredients are incredibly fresh and combined wonderfully.  I ordered about eleven different things and they were all spectacular.\n\n4.7\/5 stars. My brother says try the wagyu beef potstickers.
