Meh... I've had better cow before.  We were recommended to dine here by the front desk guy for a good steak but honestly, my dude has grilled up better steaks from Ralphs.  I had the 9oz Fillet Mignon which was good but certainly didn't make me do the happy dance and boss lady had a NY Strip that was just not good, at all.  Very chewy.  Both steaks were barely warm.  However, we did enjoy the Creamed Corn with Black Truffles but how can you f*ck up cream and truffles?  Impossible.  Also, you can't get a bottle of wine here for less than 300 bucks.  And we're not talking about rare, hard to find wines here.  We're talking stuff that you can buy at BevMo for 40 bucks.\n\nThe atmosphere is your traditional steakhouse feel.  If I was to dine here again, I'd prefer to sit outdoors.  Indoors was a bit stuffy.  \n\nThe service was very friendly and if it wasn't for our waiter, I'd give this place 2 stars.\n\nI know it's rude to mention another restaurant in a review but if you're looking for a good steak, trek on over to Eiffel Tower.  Now THAT is good cow.
