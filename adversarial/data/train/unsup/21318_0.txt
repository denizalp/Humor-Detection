Bado's Reuben Pizza ranks as one of the strangest and greatest pies that I have ever torn apart with my fingers and teeth. Just like the best example of this breed of sandwich, its toppings consist of pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, sauerkraut, and a corned beef as fragile and sweet as prosciutto, all of it lying on crust as soft and comforting as a pita bread lullaby. My \"small\" pizza of 4 weighty cuts were savored rather than devoured. \n\nKay ordered a \"Greek\" salad and a cup of their du jour soups in the Cheesy Bacon. Salty, creamy, steamy, dreamy, I was only allowed to have one taste, but I stole a second before handing the cup back to Kay. \n\nDessert was merely a wedge of cheesecake with strawberries, yet it screamed vanilla extract ardently. I don't know if Bado's makes it in-house or has it brought in, but its profound flavor was a bit of a whammy.\n\nCombine that with adequate service and a \"vintage\" sense of decor, and I can't see any reason to give Bado's less than 5 stars. I should have reviewed this place a year ago. \n\nP.S. Bado's now serves breakfast on Saturdays from 9AM to noon and on Sundays from 9AM to 1PM.\n\nP.P.S. Bado's offers delivery, but I do not know their range.
