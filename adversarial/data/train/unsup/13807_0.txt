We had an early dinner and staff were very helpful about the menu. My husband is a hot dog kind of guy and he liked his green dog with the lobster flavored bun. The garlic fries are good!\nI had a brown dog and found sauce to be rather salty.\nI had the dirty corn which was very tender. \nThe decor is clean and sparse, and they serve beers and sodas.\nMy husband had the deep fried oreo and enjoyed that.\nI was not overwhelmed but it is a fun place if you are a hot dog aficionado. I love that the space is such that no one is sitting too close to anyone else!!
