We stop here pretty regularly and order black bean tostadas with no sour cream or cheese. It is a pretty large portion for very little money. The salsa is comes with is fresh and if you order extra chips, they are seasoned and you can make a full dinner or large lunch out of $9-10. It's vegetarian friendly and the staff at this location has been extremely nice and helpful. The one of Easy that closed was similar, but with poor management. \n\nIt could be much better, though. The guacamole tastes like a frozen brand and the sauces do not really compliment the food at all. Some of them taste good, but a unique salsa bar would make much more sense.
