I've been to my fair share of Vegas clubs over the years. I mean anywhere from Tao, lavo, the bank and almost anywhere you can think of. My friends and I have had Omnia on our list for quite some time so of course we were excited. \n\nUpon arrival there were so many different lines some so much longer than others it was a little confusing. Lucky for us we didn't have to wait in line. Of course we went straight to the bar to get drinks. We ordered four drinks and four shots for about $150.00, but it's Vegas what do you expect right? \n\nThe great thing about omnia they have two rooms. One room is EDM and the other is hip hop both were packed. We headed to the hip hop room and it was pure madness. The music was great and so was the crowd. We had a good time dancing the night away. \n\nOmnia is by far one of the best clubs in Vegas to date. The space, the decor, and the music. I would say watch your belongings closely because I can see how things can come up missing with so many people around.
