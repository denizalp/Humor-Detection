In life, you get what you pay for.  If money were no object to me, I would stay at Cosmo every time that I go to Vegas.  Decided to break the bank and stay there on the last two nights of a four day trip.  It is without a doubt the nicest and trendiest hotel that I have ever stayed in.  Ended up in a terrace studio on the 57th floor with a view facing south towards Luxor and Mandelay Bay.  Jumbo flat screens in both the bedroom and the front room.  \n\nWalking around the property, I felt like was in a modern-day Logan's Run.  The vast majority of the clientele here is young and good looking.  You may give yourself whiplash when you first get here, but within a couple hours you should be completely desensitized to the extremely attractive members of the opposite gender walking around.\n\nAll of the restaurants I have been to at Cosmo I have thoroughly enjoyed.  Didn't go to the Wicked Spoon Buffet this time, but have been there before and it was awesome.  Two rather affordable options are Secret Pizza and Holstein's.  Secret Pizza has authentic New York pies for five dollars a slice.  Holstein's has great burgers in the ten to twenty dollar range.  Also, you have to try the W.W.E.D? ice cream drink at the Neopolitan by the pool.  It is heaven in a glass.\n\nProbably stay somewhere cheaper in Vegas next time I go, but life is short and you gotta treat yourself once in awhile.
