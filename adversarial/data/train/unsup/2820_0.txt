Oh I forgot how much I hate you! \n\nYou've  yet again managed to ruin another family vacation! I promised myself the last time that I would never fly you again.  But somehow I forgot. \n\nDelayed due to a malfunctioning generator?? Really and now you want me to go 5 hours cross country on you with my offspring! I will never ever fly you again.\n\nMissing the AZ diamondback game was the least of my worries.  Thinking that I was flying on an old decrepit plane....yeah pretty much occupied my mind.\n\nYour staff is rude.  You didn't even offer us a FREE snack after delaying us for 3 hours.  \n\nYou made me want to write Jet Blue a love letter, asking for forgiveness because I cheated with a lesser quality airline.  I will never fly you again and OH I won't forget!!
