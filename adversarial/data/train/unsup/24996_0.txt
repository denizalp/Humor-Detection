I got 2 replacement wicks here for my kangerbox mini n the sales guy convinced me to buy 2 n not individual so i did. So 2 weeks later when it was time to replace my wick not only did the replacement not work but both of them didn't. So i called them to see if they can rwplace it cuz the original person who sold them to me said thwy will replace it if its defective in which they both were and now they won't honor what they say. I lost out on $10 bucks basically. Dishonest customer service.! I won't be returning.!!! I believe Micheal was my sales rep when i bougjt the 2 replacements...!! Smdh
