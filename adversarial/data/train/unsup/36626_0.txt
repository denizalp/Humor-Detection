My husband and I dined here once for lunch; we had a reservation but they were not busy during lunch time. We were immediately seated as we arrived; the hostess and our server were very friendly and professional - great service!\n\nI had their rib eye steak and husband had their spaghetti with two glass of wine; the steak was perfectly cooked and it was very tender and flavorful, husband said the spaghetti was average and it can be better. The wines were in reasonable price point, were smooth and rich in flavor. \n\nWe finished with an order of creme brule and it was prefect to end the meal.
