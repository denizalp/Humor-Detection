First of all, methinks it looks more like a pringle than a saddle so for most of my life I often refer to is as \"the Pringledome\".\n\nHowever, the other night my husband took me to my first Flames game there, and it wasn't the exciting experience he told me it would be...I mean, it was okay, but ever-so-crowded!\n\nI guess what confused me the most was the way the tickets were numbered for the seats. After walking around for what felt like 30 minutes, we finally found that our \"section\" was in the upper level and we had to climb several stairs (which honestly made me feel woozy, since I fear heights...no I fear the sudden stop at the end of the fall). I made a boo-boo when I thought we found our seats and we took them, but about 10 minutes later someone came along with what looked like matching tickets and said they were their seats, so we agreed to move, and after a lot of trial & error we finally found our seats. By that point I honestly wasn't even sure I'd enjoy the game anymore. Thankfully, it picked up & got more interesting and we were allowed to stay in the seats we finally got lol. \nIt's always nice to try new things, but with me being a girly-girl & all, I don't see myself going to another hockey game anytime soon. \n\nNote: the last time I was even AT the Saddledome like that was when I was 8 years old and my mum took me to the circus. If I remember correctly, I ended up crying my eyes out that day for similar reasons.
