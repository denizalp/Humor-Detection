If you want to commit suicide by soda and sweets, come here and get your supplies.\n\nRocket Fizz is a great place to find odd sodas and candies that bring back childhood memories.  I visited a similar little store in St. George once, so finding one here that's bigger and better is awesome!  If they have the Jelly Belly Strawberry Jam soda, grab one.  They're goooooood.\n\nGreat prices, a plethora of soda to choose from and great candies.  I love the Fizz.
