The world record for the fastest time to eat a 12â€³ pizza is 41.31 seconds.  Think you can beat it? \n\nI was next door at their brother restaurant, Scotti's, when I saw an innocent yet alluring slice of pepperoni pizza from Rosatti's.  I was hungry and figured that, hey, I can try TWO new places at once (the sacrifices made to be a Yelper, yo).  Plus, I was pretty hungry! My eyes were bigger than my stomach though and I wasn't able to finish both my grilled cheese and my slice of pizza.  Whoops.\n\nOnward with the review: So the pizza was okay.  It was greasy, the crust was doughy, and there wasn't too much cheese drag action.  It was a pretty standard slice and at $3 for a slice, it wasn't bad.  Perhaps I would have had my socks blown off if I wasn't also eating an amazing Ham & Gouda from Scotti's.  That slice of pie definitely took the backseat while I was slamming down my grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nUpdate: Came back on a later visit to try their Chicago style pie with pan crust, and while it took like 30-35mins, it was amazing! Not my favorite deep dish but it'll fulfil a craving! Giving them another star.
