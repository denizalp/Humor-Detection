If I lived on the west side, I would be here all the time.\n\nI won't bother repeating all the great things everyone else has said about the ambiance and great service here - I'll just talk about the amazing food that I ate. I came here on a Thursday, their raw food night. We ordered a ton of things to share - the \"nrg\" soup (from their raw menu), as well as the sunburst salad, on the road sandwich, and fun guy pizza. Every single thing was SO good. I was a little bit nervous about the raw soup, but it was delicious. I'm a sucker for beets, and the salad and sandwich were both amazing. The pizza was incredible too - it was obviously a lot heavier than the other things we got, but it tasted great as leftovers the next day. We also took home a piece of their raw samoa cheesecake, and I couldn't believe that it was raw - it tasted decadent but didn't give you that heavy feeling you get after you eat normal cheesecake.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't hesitate to come back here. Even if you feel a little bit unsure about their raw food night, I think it's definitely worth a try - I ended up loving it so much more than I was expecting!
