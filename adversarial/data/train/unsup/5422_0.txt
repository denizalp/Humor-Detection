Does anybody in the world enjoy going to a car dealership? Shouldn't it be fun? You're buying a new car, that's cool!\n\nWhy do these car salesman continue to pull the wool over our eyes? I went in there told them the car I wanted to buy: a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I had them run my credit to show that I was serious about it. Given that I'm trying to purchase a vehicle that just came out last month I'm not even vying for a deal.\n\nAfter the salesman knew I wasn't going to buy that night, his 'manager' came out and spoke to me in an incomprehensible vagueness to simple questions. I asked him what my payment would be, and it was $150 more a month than it should have been. The 'manager' prefaced it by saying, 'we can work the numbers when you get serious'. \n\nWhy can't they just show me this?\n\nPrice of Car\nMinus The Value of Your Trade In\nThe Interest Rate and Length of Loan\n=========================\n= Your Monthly Payment\n\nIt's a simple F*#@%ING formula! Stop with the all the damn BS car dealers and realize that it's no longer the good ol' days with uneducated customers you could rape. Customers these days have all the information we need now on KBB.com to get the value of our car, determine financing, and the fair market price on a new vehicle. The problem now is once you have that information, you have to go through an insanely ridiculous 3+ hour charade to get your new car off the lot.
