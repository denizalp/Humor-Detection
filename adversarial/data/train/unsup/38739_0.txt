I love coming here for lunch with my family, great good deal. \nThe only issue I have with this restaurant is that it only offers lunch during weekday (closed during weekend lunch) and it's at the corner so not too many people would notice.\nFood wise, I've tried many different items on the menu - special lunch and other causal plates. \nI am impressed that all their sushi are made with purple rice, normally you have to pay extra in other restaurants to have this option. And for bento boxes, you get to pick steam veggies or tempura veggies.\nCausal plates that I've tried are pretty amazing, such as Calamari, Okonomi Yaki, Dynamite Roll, California Don, Sashimi are tasty and fresh.
