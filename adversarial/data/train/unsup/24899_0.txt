After the absolute worst day possible at work, being tired, hot, tired, and frustrated...Le Grande Orange and Lindsay saved the day! I still can't believe the amount and size of all the goodies! My favorite was the chocolate croissant. The red velvet cupcakes and english muffins were also amazing. So awesome that we bought some to english muffins to bring home. And the swag bag...OMG! Two $10 vouchers to buy more goodies and more sweets! They really spoiled us. I am very impressed at how well they treated us. How did I not know about this place! I will now be a regular! I can't wait to go have another chocolate croissant and try some of their food. I will think fondly of them in the morning when I have my muffin for breakfast and a cookie with lunch! It is like the party doesn't have to stop with all the goodies I have still to eat from the bag!
