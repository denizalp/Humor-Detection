Terrible service.   \n\nSummary:  Said alignment was off when not true.   Didn't top of windshield wiper fluid or radiator reservoir.   Didn't check tire pressure or reset tire pressure sensor which is needed after a tire rotation. \n\nMore detail:\nWent in for $16.95 oil change with tire rotation,  fluids check and chassis lube\/inspection.   I was informed my car uses synthetic oil,  no problem,  I knew this.   Price was now $39.95.  Should be done in 45 mins.   \n\nAfter 1 hour they told me my air filter needed change (I declined)  and that the tire wear indicated my alignment was off.   Car is a year old,  I declined sensing a bit of work fishing.  In reality tire pressure was low causing above normal wear on the outside of the tread. \n\nAfter 1.5 hours,  the car was finished.   I headed home and a mile down the road the tire pressure indicator light came on.   I pulled over and all 4 tires where at 22-24 psi.  I turned around a went back.   They inflated the tires to 32 psi.   They didn't reset the tire pressure light,  I had to pull out the manual.
