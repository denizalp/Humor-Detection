The salsa they hand you with the chips tastes like, I don't know, Agent Orange?  It doesn't taste good.  My tostada was swimming in a pool of grease.  My enchilada was decent.  The taco I had gave off an aftertaste that was remarkably similar to a fart.  It had a crunchy shell that can cut up your gums.\n\nGoddamn, everyone who works here is so nice.  I feel bad giving it two stars but the food was really, honestly, not very good.  I am not a picky eater, really.  I am easy to please.  If I tell you a place has lousy food, then man, you are gonna shit your pants.
