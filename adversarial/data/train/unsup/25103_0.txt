Never, never stay here! We arrived late on Saturday night.  The room was prepaid, and I'd called ahead.  They sent us up to the third floor, where we found the latch on the outside of the door, so unsecured.   The window was wide open, and had no screen.  I called down to the desk and told the clerk I was uneasy, so he told us to come down and he'd change our room.  He upgraded us to a nicer room, and by this time, it was getting late.  We checked in and went to bed.  The next morning, I found a used washcloth on the shower curtain rod.  We checked out, and that night, realized we'd left one of our Sonicare toothbrushes in the room.  I called the hotel right away, and was told they'd call me back.  24 hours later, no call, so I tried again.  I was told again they'd call me back.  The next morning, I thought I'd give it another try.  I didn't even get my first sentence out of my mouth before the girl said \"we didn't find it\".  I responded \"so, your staff threw away a $100 toothbrush?\", to which she answered \"not necessarily, maybe housekeeping missed it and the next guest threw it away\" (as if that were a more acceptable scenario)...?!?  I told her that wouldn't surprise me, since I'd found a used washcloth during our stay.  She interrupted me to say very sarcastically \"ma'am, if you have a $100 toothbrush, maybe you should keep track of it\" and hung up on me.  I called Corporate.  Not because I want them to be responsible for the toothbrush, but because they should know how that operation is being run.  They promised me a call back within 72 hours.  That was 60 hours ago.  No call yet.   Like I said, I don't want anything from them, but you would think they'd want to fix their customer service issues.
