After church, my wife and I were hungry and we decided to come here. Their food is served cafeteria style where you pick and choose what entrees you want with your starch (think panda express style). My fav dish here is their laing (taro leaves in coconut milk). Their spread is the usual fair (adobo, kare-kare, squid guisado, dinuguan, pancit, fried bangus, etc.) Their plates run between $6-$8 which is a good deal. Their bibingka here is the BOMB! I would say this is probably in the top 5 of desserts in Vegas I've tried. The portion for $4.50 can easily be shared by 4 people. Its soft and and buttery with a nice cake consistence.  2 entree plate and a bibinkgka for lunch?....yes please!
