I just had lunch at Les 3 Brasseurs (aka. The 3 Brewers). Having worked in the Yonge\/Dundas area for the last 9 years, this pub was a welcome change. I ordered the Premium Wheat Ale which I enjoyed (brewed in-house) and the JCK salad ($11.99) - comes with Marinated grilled chicken, grilled eggplant, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and feta cheese. I was not able to finish the salad (probably because the beer filled me up) but it was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly. It was moist and warm. The grilled veggies and their house dressing (which tasted like balsamic vinaigrette) were delicious. The salad came on a bed of mixed greens. The feta was plentiful but not very flavourful - I may ask for goat cheese on the salad next go round. Our waiter was knowledgeable and the food was delivered quickly. My lunch companion had the salmon filet with rice and veggies. The filet was a nice large size and was not over or undercooked and the veggies were crisp. Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience.
