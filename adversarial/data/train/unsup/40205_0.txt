Our go-to dinner pickup spot when we visit Vegas for Evo. They now can deliver via Uber Eats so it is even more convenient and accessible. Everything that I tried there (3 Amigos, High Maintenance, etc.) tasted so fresh and flavorful. Just writing a review about the sushi burrito makes my mouth watery. If you like sushi and haven't tried this place yet, you should definitely pay a visit before you leave Las Vegas. And those of you who live there already, I envy you so much that you can eat this yummy sushi burrito any time you want! :-)
