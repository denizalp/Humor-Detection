I've been to Vegas many times in a year, but I don't think I will ever come back to Harrah's in Las Vegas. It has come to be the most unsanitary and has no open-air for the hotel guests. Every time I went down the lobby I had to make sure I leave the hotel within 10 minutes or I will get a major headache. The vast majority of the people here at Harrah's smoke a lot, so I do not recommend this hotel for any family that has any infants or young children with them. \n\nThe next thing why I don't like this hotel are the rooms. It's nice to have a simple room for you to sleep in, but there was only one blanket that can barely cover a whole person's body. And not to mention the shower drain was terrible. No matter how much we tried to shut it off it still manages to make small water drops which was hard to deal with. Another bad thing is the air conditioner is very loud up to the point you can lose your sleep over night.
