After reading all the positive reviews, we decided to try a new place.  The staff was wonderful, service was excellent, however the food was less than desirable.  Since it was later in the morning, we ordered breakfast as their menu indicated that \"Breakfast Served All Day\".  After we ordered our food, our entrees came out within 1 to 2 minutes after we ordered.  That seems way too fast.  The food was cold and the hash browns were overcook and cold, so my guess is the food has been sitting out and not cooked to order.  Needless to say, I will not be back...there are too many breakfast places in the area that serve better food.
