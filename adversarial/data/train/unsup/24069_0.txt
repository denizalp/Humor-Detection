My husband, 10 month old and I were looking for a place to have dinner outside on the river on a beautiful Friday evening.  We came across the listing for the Baja Grill and thought that it was right up our ally!  We arrived around 8:00 and asked for a table outside on the deck.  The waitress had us pick any table and brought a highchair over to us.  A table close to us had two small kids as well.\n\nWe ordered pretty quickly, easy and simple fare.  A chicken quesadilla, shrimp wrap and a side salad.  45 minutes of waiting and our waitress returned to tell us that the kitchen was swamped and our food was almost ready.  What she really should have said is she completely forgot to put in our order because it took another 15 minutes to arrive. \n\nNot 5 minutes into us eating one of the waitresses came over and said to us, \"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but kids are not allowed here after 7:30\".  We were not even finished eating!!   The table with kids right next to us had just finished and were just leaving (past curfew as well I guess).  So first of all we had been seated with a high chair after our cutoff hour (by a member of their staff I would think?!) and then we could have been long gone if our bar food hadn't taken an hour to be delivered.  I'm not sure if she wanted us to ask for a box or what, but it was absolutely ridiculous!\n\nI will never give them service or recommend them to anyone! Nice view but horrible service, mediocre food at best and rude wait staff.  Sheesh louise!
