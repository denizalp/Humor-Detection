The sizzling waffles with ice cream caught my attention. It was recommended on Yelp saying that it was hot and new. Coming in there's someone greeting you and letting you know where the ice cream options are. The menu is quite nice and simple and it guides you step by step on how to order to make your own hot plate of heaven. Near the entrance behind the cash there's a black board with the ice cream options written on it. They don't have the options on the menu because they rotate flavours. I had the coffee milk tea ice cream with Belgian waffles, seasonal fruits, and hot chocolate sauce poured on the 400 degree sizzling plate. It was nice for the waitress to remind me that it's hot and the temperature of the plate. The icecream had a rich coffee flavour which went very well with the waffles. I didn't find that pineapple and apple tasted well hot or with the flavour of the ice cream. The customer service is nice and the renovations remind me of a coffee shop. It's worth a try and I'll definitely go back to try different options!
