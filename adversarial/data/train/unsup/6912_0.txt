The East Carson Street Pizza Gauntlet Part 3\n\nJust as RJ said, we seemed to keep buildling towards something. There was an escalation of sorts at hand, if not in terms of quality but size, stature, poshness of surroundings. Zeeno's was still on top, defeating Sal's, demonstrating that a pizza needs to taste better than it looks. The unassuming Zeno's was on a tear. \n\nSo here we were, working our way down Carson, finding Pizza Sola. There are stools, hard, finished wooden counters, a young perky gal behind the counter. This was a New York pizzeria by way of Shadyside. \n\nThe pizzas behind the glass were even better looking than that ones at Sal's, more sophisticated, as if they actually read books that weren't about beauty, celebrities, or metrosexual vampires. One can have an intelligent conversation with this pizza. \n\nI bucked the trend somewhat and went with a white pizza adorned with breaded eggplant. \n\nIt was like Sal's Pizza (large, crispy crust) but even bigger and with more flavor despite it being sauceless. This was the smarter sister, the one that rebels by going to poetry readings and book club meetings instead of house parties. She's also better looking, knows it, but isn't hung up on it. She doesn't even wear makeup. She doesn't need to. \n\nIf there is such a thing as Gourmet New York Street Pizza, this would serve as an example. The eggplant worked brilliantly as a topping as well and was a new twist for me.\n\nI tasted RJ's standard pep pizza and Kay's plain Sicilian after they griped about the sauce tasting canned. It took a few tastes, but yeah, it came off as supplied-by-third-party-in-buckets as opposed to made-by-Nana-at-6-this-morning. \n\nShe's a brainiac, a knockout, and sees modeling as a sideline to a career in academia.\n\nBut she eats ice cream bars incessantly, leaves candy wrappers everywhere, makes a weird grunting sound when she laughs, and is obsessed with Cake Mania. She's a keeper though. Nobody's perfect. \n\nRight now, Zeeno's and Pizza Sola are tied.  \n\nWhich one will I marry? Dilemmas...I have 'em...\n\nP.S. They also have a nice selection of  Boylan brand bottled sodas. Kay got Jamaican Ginger Beer, and it has some bite to it let me tell you! I drank Black Cherry, the dark horse of soft drinks.
