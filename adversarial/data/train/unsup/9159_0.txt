I pass Hestia daily on my route from Place Ville Marie to Eaton Centre but had never tried it out until now. The place next door (Tunnel Espresso) always seems to draw in the crowds so because of that, I never gave Hestia a go. \n\nFrom it's neat & tidy look, I always thought it was just a tea shop of some sort... How wrong I was! \nHestia has a variety of teas to offer as well as some unique coffee blends that are made to perfection. My absolute favourite, which I have not come across anywhere else, is the Chai Espresso Latte. Basically a combination of the rich blend of spices found in Chai tea (cinnamon, cardamom etc) combined with espresso and a touch of sweetness from the almond milk. I never thought you could combine the two but this concoction definitely works and is truly delicious!\n\nI have yet to try the goodies they offer (food from Aux Vivres & various baked treats) so will definitely be back soon!
