Wandered in here due to high yelp ratings. I'm pleased to report that service was excellent and food was great! The margaritas were decent. The beans tasted fresh as well as the rice. The texture was on point as well. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the tamales weren't perfect, but I am rather picky about tamales. I will definitely be coming back.
