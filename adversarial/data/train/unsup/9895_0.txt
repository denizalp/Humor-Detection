If you've followed me on Yelp, then you know that I'm not a hype-following, band-wagon type of person.  We came here during March to kill a day before a wedding.\n\nTo be quite honest, I don't get all the hype and high reviews here on Yelp?  We purchased tickets for the BRUCE MUNRO: SONORAN LIGHT show for $25 + $5 for daytime passes.  The regular day pass price is $22.  This botanical garden looks like they just picked any random spot in the desert and added concrete trails and bathrooms to it.  I don't mean to detract from the natural beauty of the desert but it just seems like you can find the same plant life on any hiking trail in this region....for free.\n\nSo, where's the $22 going to?  Paving is a one time cost and their bathrooms don't have marble sinks.  It's a botanical garden with desert plants, so we know that it's not going towards the water bill.\n\nWell, at least there was a good amount of parking and the parking was free.\n\nThe night show is worth checking out once but not for $25.  It doesn't take long before everything starts looking redundant.  But, I can't fault them for this.  There's only so many ways you can throw Xmas LED's on the ground and make it look unique.  But, at the same time, for the amount of money this artist is charging, he could certainly at least try to put some more effort into creating a show that actually lives up to the price.\n\nIf you want to make your visit more interesting, try drinking a bottle of wine or pitcher of beer beforehand....or maybe two?\n\nLastly, bring a tripod if you do the night thing.
