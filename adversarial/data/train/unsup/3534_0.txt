This is perhaps the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed it. Rooms were filthy with ground-in flaming orange cheetos into the ancient carpet. Maids didnt bother to come in and clean the rooms or even give you towels or soap.\n The worst part were the attackers! The timeshare people that assaulted you at check-in and inappropriately touched you if you refused to listen to their pitches. Being catcalled at the start and end of everyday as I did the walk of Shame to get past the aggressive hateful timeshare sales people. I had to put a scarf on my head so they would leave me alone. I was brutally pushed by one of them. And tripped by another. They will do anything to get you to listen to their presentations, even if it was physical violence. \nDO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL. It is not a safe place. There was no hotel security and the filthy rooms filled with bed bugs were nothing compared to the giant cockroaches crawling up the walls in Sid's Cafe and at Benihana Restaurant!! The whole place needs to be bombed!\nThe health department needs to be brought in.\nAnd shut this hellhole down!
