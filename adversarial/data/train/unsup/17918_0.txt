This company makes repeated unsolicited calls and ignores the Do Not Call list.  When asked to stop the calls, the callers are rude.  \nIf a company does good work and is owned by law abiding people, their business grows by word of mouth and they do not ignore the law.  This company obviously cannot survive on the quality of its work and therefore makes desperate \"cold calls\".
