This is every girlie-slightly-obsessive-compulsive fashionista's dream closet :-)\n                      \n All things cute and in their place just makes you feel relaxed & happy.... or is that just me? Lol! \n \nThe place has an open floor plan, but it's arranged by colors. All items are well organized & you can easily see their great selection of clothing & accessories without having to rummage. Those who know me know that I don't like rummaging when I'm shopping, it totally stresses me out. \n\nThe location is spotlessly clean, the staff is very friendly.
