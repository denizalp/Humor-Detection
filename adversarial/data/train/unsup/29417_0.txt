Food is top notch, as Guy would say.  \n\nNot gonna waste time telling you how long I had to wait to get in, it is completely irrelevant and always will be for any of you who like to always mention stupid things like that in your even stupider reviews of restaurants.  \n\nI will make this very simple.  I love food of all types really.  From the worst thing to the foo foo-est thing.  That will tell you where my mind is at.  But bad food is detectable, so know that as well. \n\nWith that I say just look at the menu.  If anything on there sounds good to you, you will like it.  Either a bacon mac and cheese burger is amazing, or it's just not your style.  But maybe the turkey sangwich is.  Just read the menu, ask your server if you are confused, and enjoy the splendor that is on it's way to tube town, aka your stomach.
