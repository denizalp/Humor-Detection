This was my first experience at this establishment and I was not disappointed. Having read previous reviews I arrived at 10:20 AM expecting to have to wait awhile to get my order fulfilled. Free water was given to each customer who was in line. i was out with my order at 12:00 noon.  it was fun talking to all the patrons standing in line with me with smelling the bbq aroma.  We got a free sample of  the sausage which was very delicious. the food was the best bbq I have ever eaten!  When in Phoenix this is a must on your eating list.  The only mishap is that I discovered when I got home that our pecan pies were not with our order.  I contacted Little Miss BBQ and they apologized and  credited our bill. They also asked me next time I am in the area to stop by and get the pies.  I will be back.
