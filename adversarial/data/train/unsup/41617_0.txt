My step-daughter and I were first time clients of Paige today and im so impressed with her. She did such an amazing job and was so fun to be with. The time flew by even though she took care of both of us and we had fun while we were there. She gave me exactly what I wanted and I have found my new hair home. We already booked are next appointment! Highly recommend Paige with Chop Salon!!
