This rating is strictly for the waitress name Sarah D. I attend a work dinner and decided to have a cocktail before the dinner...ms Sarah came to my table with a very dry attitude and very unwelcoming....I've been here plenty of times and I've never received service like this before...coming from a lady whom work in the food and beverage industry this was unexpectable...
