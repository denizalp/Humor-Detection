Dear Joe's Bread Basket,\n\nI miss you dearly. I love you. I need you. \n\nEspecially you cheesy bread thingy...\n\nLove,\nAnna\n\nLast dinner in Vegas and it was certainly THE BEST!\n\nOrdered:\nx Large Stone Crab Claws - soooo much meat in these things. Everything's already cracked and pretty much ready to eat. Unless you're my date... then you'll need help with getting the meat out in one piece :P The dip it came with was so creamy and delicious. Perfect combination. \nx Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes - THE BEST crab cakes I've ever had in my life. SOOOO much flavor and SOOO much meat. Pretty much ZERO filler. Highly recommend for you crab lovers. This was probably my favorite of the night.\nx Chopped Seafood Salad - refreshing with lots and lots of fresh seafood. Generous amounts of each ingredient and was the perfect crunch to all the mush we were eating. \n\nTried to order the grilled corn, but was told it was out of season :( Will have to come back to try it in the summer!!\n\nSo. Much. Yes.
