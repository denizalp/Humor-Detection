So I finally went inside after walking pass it for months.  Staff was not the best...kind of felt out of place, like I shouldn't be there, but whatever lol... so I saw that they had weekend specials and I ordered the eggs, home fries and toast.  As I was waiting for some odd reason I wanted to run out of the restaurant...the vibe was so uncomfortable.  It was kind of hard to rate but the food was good, it was just the energy from the staff that was not nice or comfortable at all...so basically 4 stars for the food...negative 22 stars for the staff.
