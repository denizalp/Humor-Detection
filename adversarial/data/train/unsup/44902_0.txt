I had a craving for a philly cheese steak and I have been here before so I thought I should stop in to see if it is consistant. Conclusion, yes it is! I didn't have to wait long 5-7 mins max and my name was called. I get it with onions and red sauce which I think gives it moisture, otherwise I would think it would be dry and tasteless.   Brought it back to the office and ate it all within 10 mins.\n\nPeople there are really nice and friendly. I will come back here again and again :)
