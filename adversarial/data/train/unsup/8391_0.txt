The service was friendly and attentive (5 stars).\n\nTheir buy two get one free roll selection is extensive. We ordered the Monkey Brain, Caterpillar, and Spicy Girl roll and the lowest priced roll was free. All 3 rolls tasted fresh and had delicious sauce. Come here for their rolls!\n\nThe sushi was a hit and miss. The Chu Toro sushi (one piece) was fantastic! The Uni (two pieces) was good but small. The Aji was ok. The Hotate (two pieces) lacked texture (more like mush) and did not taste fresh. It was also missing a citrus seasoning. This was listed on their blackboard special but turned out to be a disappointment. Also, the sushi rice fell apart easily...\n\nOverall, it's a 3.5 stars place due to their sushi quantity and quality. The service brings it up to 4 stars.\n\nPlenty of parking available in the shopping center.
