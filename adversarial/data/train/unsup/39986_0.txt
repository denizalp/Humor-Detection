I've been to this place many times whenever I get sushi cravings, and I'm always left with the same feeling - not bad, a little above average but not AMAZING. I'm focusing on 3 aspects of their food and service overall.\n\nTheir sushi tastes fresh and it's great, but their a bit larger than to my liking, I prefer smaller portions so that I can try a bunch and order more :D Other than that, they have a great variety, many special ones I've never seen in other places! I'd rate it 3.5\/5\n\nTheir fried items like shrimp tempura, gyoza, calamari, scallops, etc. are nice too but they do feel very heavy. So if you do want to focus on sushi, I'd recommend ordering all sushi rolls first, then the fried items so you're stomach isn't already full from all the fatty fried goodness! I'd rate it 3\/5\n\nTheir stir-fry and skewer items are just average too, personally I think they're bland in flavor; especially the Korean short spare ribs. They're my favorite item to get at any Asian restaurant, and although they were incredibly tender, the flavor wasn't there for me :\/ I'd rate 4\/5\n\nThe service is always great here, they fill your water very regularly and quickly. They're very nice whenever you need additional items like napkins, extra spicy mayo, extra utensils\/plates. They greet you the moment you walk inside and seat you immediately if there is not waiting time. Only thing is, servers here are generally more quiet, as most sushi places are, but I do like conversing here and there. I'd rate 4.5\/5\n\nOverall, I'd say this place is good for a sushi fixing that is better than most locations in Vaughan, however, its a bit more pricey. Service is great and variety of foods is better than a lot of locations in Vaughan.
