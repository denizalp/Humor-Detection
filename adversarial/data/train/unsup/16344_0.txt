Im rating this strictly on yesterdays trip to Boneryard.  I have been to this location, the Mayfield location also.  Back in the day we used to hit up the Boneryard downtown all the time.  2.00 drafts for happy hour?  Hell yeah..  They discount ALL the drafts, not like Prosperity, Tap House, South Side, etc. that only discount some beers.  Seems like I always want the one beer that is NOT on special.  Hey, I work for a livin so happy hour prices make my black ass smile!  This particular trip they had happy hr till 9pm AND .49 boneless wangs!  Server was super cute and super fast, despite being run all over by the Buffy and Thad types of early 30, professional types with 2.2 young kids that live in the area.  Food was pretty good, for a chain restaurant.  With the deals they run, it is worth it for an OK dinner and several good beers!
