Dang you, Caracas Empanadas! You're too good. I find myself craving you literally every Saturday when the weather is warm and I know you'll be available at the farmers' market. The plantain and garlic vegetarian empanadas are perfection. I am routinely lost for what to have for brunch when I make my way out to the cart and that's not an option. Nothing else sounds good after I've set my mind on those crispy, amazing pockets. This past weekend I gave in and tried the vegetarian offering of the day when my beloved plantain and garlic variety wasn't available for the second farmers market of the season (and leaving empty-handed last week). I think it was more or less their signature pabellon, sans meat: rice, beans, plantain, and avocado. It was super delish and super filling. I ordered the two for $5 and it was almost too much. Definitely a great deal for a meal on the go. \n\nNow, for as amazing as the empanadas are, what really puts them over the top is the guasacaca. In general, I hate cilantro (I don't have the dreaded soap flavor reaction, I just do not care for it at all). I will go out of my way to ask that cilantro be removed from my orders. However, when combined with garlic and whatever else goes into CE's killer recipe it becomes the most delicious thing on the planet. I want to take shots of this sauce straight from the condiment cup. Not a bite of my empanada goes by that I am not dunking it into the guasacaca first. You may have had guasacaca elsewhere, but it likely does not even compare to this green giant. If I somehow haven't decimated my container(s) of guasacaca with my empanadas the leftovers go in the fridge. It's too precious to chuck into the trash, even if I only have enough for two tortilla chips. \n\nI love you, Caracas Empanadas.
