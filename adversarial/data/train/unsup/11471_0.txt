Vanessa was fantastic, too many ways to review about.  Overall, she knows the way to get regulars to come back & is knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nOrdered another New Yorker, to-go this time.  As we waited, Dad ordered a Moscow Mule & I had the Mumm Brut Ros√©.  Yum & cheers!  \n\n5 star service, but pizza should be just as good to-go as eating there.  When we got home, our New Yorker was soggy & the toppings were falling off.  I had to roll mine up to eat it.  I have ordered pizza to-go once before so not sure what happened here.  \n\nI've had more good than bad times here & can say one star less wouldn't be fair for all the great pizzas & staff.  \n\nIf it happens another time, you'll know.
