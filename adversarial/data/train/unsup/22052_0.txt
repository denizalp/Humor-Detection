Not really much of a farmers market, only a few vendors have actual produce and its pretty much the same stuff all the way around. Gotta get there EARLY if you want good stuff.  Some of the other vendors are a little less my taste (handmade soaps, coffee and food trucks) but I do like the spice and jerkey vendors.  \n\n Just seems like a trendy fad for people living in Gilbert who want to feel snooty. Charging $7 or $8 is a little crazy. Although some of the products we have purchased are good quality I don't find myself going often.\n\n Would love to see more fruit and veggie vendors or vendors in general. We walked the entire area and had a snack and it only took about 30mins.\n  \n  Love the idea, and love the products we do purchase.
