Pelmeni's Russian Dumplings are the best thing to come out of Russia since Gorbachov's birthmark.\n\nFrom a foodways standpoint, this place is a goldmine of genuine cultural fusion:\nHandmade RUSSIAN dumplings meets two dips (sour cream and the CHINESE-rooster hot sauce) with a dash of INDIAN curry powder on top.  Best of all, this is a invention of the folk, not some academic chef.\n\nFrom a utilitarian standpoint, this place is bliss:\nThe simple ordering-style puts chipotle to shame.  Nothing but dumplings.  Here are your options:  potato\/beef\/half-half dumplings, spicy\/notspicy half\/full order.   All for $5\/$7.  And you get a carbonated beverage too.  I recommend Squirt.\n\nFrom an addicts standpoint, this place is dangerous:\nI crave this stuff.  It's addictive.  Dumpling crack.
