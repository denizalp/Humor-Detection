THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay is just ok. For a \"high\" end suites only hotel this place is ok at best. First let's talk about the suites. The suite was ok compared to the Signature MGM. THE Hotel did not have a full kitchen, we couldn't even put our bottle waters in the mini fridge because they would charge us $25 for just sticking in own water bottles in their mini fridge. The TV's are out dated, my grandma has a better tv then what they had. The bathroom was nice separate tub and shower, two sinks, and even a scale so I can see how much weight I gained after eating at the buffets. The bathroom was the only thing that is worth praising. You can also hear the cars on the freeway from the room and we were on the 18th floor! The air conditioner would blow my face every time it went off when I was sleeping. Freaking blizzard every 10 mins. The check out was a bit of a joke as well. We wanted to pay cash but couldn't because their computer system was down. Hopefully they lost all the info so they can't charge my card. This place is just ok I wouldn't stay here again only if it was for free or when I have kids so they can play and pee in the pool.   The pool at the hotel was nice but too many people in my opinion and the music blaring was not pleasant when you're just trying to relax. There is free self parking.  Also their wireless internet is garbage. Try the Signature at the MGM before you come here.
