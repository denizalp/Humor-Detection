Los Paisas has stolen my little Colombian food loving soul. I am crazy about plantains and yucca and LP carved a nice place in my heart! Finally made it in for lunch after hearing many good things from my wife and other friends. \n\nThe inside is quaint and houses a small bar, a handful of tables and a few TV's. Not over the top with decoration. Just simple and direct. \n\nThe staff was zipping around the dining area with multiple plates in hand. A wonderful Colombian culinary ballet was happening around us as we anticipated the arrival of our lunch. \n\nWe started with the Tostones con Queso. Green plantains with queso fresco. Only 3-4 on the plate, but perfect for two to share. These things are topped generously with fresh, melted cheese. Chewy plantains and melted cheese? Might as well be a bullseye. \n\nI ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana. A menagerie of flavors, textures and traditional Colombian dishes. The pork cracklin' was by far the most interesting item on the plate. Fried pork skin. It's like a high-five in your mouth. Like a chewy pork rind but succulent. It's a mammoth-sized portion. I'd recommend trying a bit. Eating the entire portion would be a bit much. The steak, egg and sausage were all fantastic. \n\nHere's the kicker. The herb mixes they bring to the table are the golden goose, the cheery on top, the KO punch and the holy grail rolled into one. Spices and herbs, olive oils that complement every dish rather well. Mixing each one in with the rice and beans....something I crave daily. Can't wait to come back in just for these. \n\nLastly, the agua frescas are immaculate. We tried the pi√±a (pineapple) and loved it. Served in a tall glass with many fresh chunks of pineapple afloat. Loved every sip\/gulp. \n\nThis is definitely one of our go-to's in Crown Town! Love you, Los Paisas!
