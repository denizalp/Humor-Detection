I am not a vegetarian BUT this place has quickly become my new favourite dinner place. I am making my way through the menu and so far have found nothing below 5 stars. It is taking me a while to try everything since I frequently get stuck on one delicious thing and have to order is a few times before I move on the the next, but I have high hopes that the 5 star quality will continue until I reach the end.\n\nIf you have not yet tried this place out, you must.
