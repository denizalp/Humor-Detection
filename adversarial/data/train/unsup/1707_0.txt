Quick and good! It's like aloha kitchen. You order at the register and then sit down and wait for your food.\n\nI ordered the mixed poki salad. It came with both salmon and tuna for a reasonable portion. The fish was fresh and tastes great! I didn't like how salty it was but the wasabi helped balance it. \n\nMy man ordered the beef teriyaki and that was pretty good too. they give you the option either brown rice or white! \n\nBe back soon!
