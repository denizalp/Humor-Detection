Any place that will host this buzzed and slightly obnoxious individual around midnight on a Sunday is fine by me. You know what I order half the time I have the munchies? Carne Asada. I'll eat it on or in pretty much anything. And at Ramiro's, it really packs a punch. Loaded with onions and what I *swear* is HORSERADISH in their guacamole, it was spicy and refreshing. It made me shut up and focus the last of my brain cells on telling the world why they should give it a try as well.\n\nI'm telling you, it might sound simple, but this is some innovative fast food. I'll be back to see what else Ramiro's has up their sleeve...that is, if I come here during normal hours and eat something else. \n\nPS--the aguas frescas don't suck
