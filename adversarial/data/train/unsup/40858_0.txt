Our black rental car was just washed. Now its dried by the sun & filthy with water spots. I can almost not look out of the windows. There were scratches on the drivers side, which when I told the attendant about it, she said it's no problem all the cars have scratches. We decided to return the car after 2 days & rent from another vender. And we had no special pricing either.
