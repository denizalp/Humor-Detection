We're from Toronto, Canada and went here last week while on vacation and it's got the best pho! Honestly, we're very jealous as we don't have anything that compares in terms or quality and flavour! Most places in Toronto dilute the soup and couldn't care about service but not at Jenni Pho! We actually came back and ate here a few times to try the pho, bun (noodles), and rice. And we loved everything! The boba drinks are really good too! My boyfriend's new favourite food is their honey grilled chicken! Portions are huge so bring your appetite! Very clean restaurant, especially the bathroom. And since it's open concept you can check out the chef making your food! Very cool! Highly recommend checking them out!
