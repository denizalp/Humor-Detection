I love Johnny Rockets. This location is a total disappointment. The girls that work there aren't very friendly and don't pay attention you order. I would recommend having them repeat your order so you actually get what you want. I ordered a tuna melt and ended up with a cold tuna sandwich that I had to throw away. It was a total waste of $10. I will pass on this place the next time I eat at the mall.
