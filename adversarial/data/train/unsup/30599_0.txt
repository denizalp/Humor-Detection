MY WHOLE FAMILY GOT FOOD POISONING!! We came here this past Sunday 4\/15\/18 around 3-4pm in the afternoon. We ordered a pizza for our family to split. This is the first we had eaten all day after spending the whole day at Goldfield. Hours later all of my kids starting throwing up. It lasted all night. We had to keep them home from school it was so bad. This is our first time coming here as we have heard good things- this is going to be our last time for sure. I'm disappointed in the quality and it saddens me that my kids had to eat this poor quality food. Disgusting. I will be making a call to the health inspector to check this place out.
