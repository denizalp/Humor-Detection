Vegetarians Beware!  \nWent to Graze for dinner and came home hungry because I'd rather not cobble a meal together out of sides.  My husband got the mac and cheese, because he is apparently 11 years old... or because it is the only vegetarian meal option.  It's certainly sized for an 11 year old.  I had a mixed vegetable salad that was approximately four little carrots and a fried hash brown drizzled in oil.  It was infuriating that this paltry excuse for a salad cost more than a companion's beefy burger and fries!\n\nAnd as far as the ambiance goes: Graze feels nothing like New York or Chicago, as one reviewer wrote.  But then again, I suppose it does have the \"je ne sais quoi\" of the Au Bon Pains at LaGuardia or O'Hare.  It features the same deafening, echoey acoustics, high prices, and food court seating... but at least they have decent vegetarian options.
