The Buffet at Wynn is truly a magical place for hungry folks and tourists. This place looks like something off of a movie. Lots of colorful, neon tall trees, bushes, lights and all in color of course. It's very nostalgic, very much alive. You are surrounded by so many pretty plants!  The chefs are running around with pots and pans and making magic happen. There you'll see their creation of green sparkling cupcakes, with 2 inch frosting with glitter and star shaped cookies climbing up to the top! Can you dream of finishing it? The desserts are heavily assorted with some of the wildest designs, from all the colors it can offer. There's pastel pink cupcakes, chocolate sticks, cookies of all flavors from strawberry, raisins, chocolate chip. \n\nAside from digging into your sweet tooth, the steaks, seafood, breakfast and brunch and other sides are also at the palm of your hands here. There are numerous food towers and the food is made to look like art. \n\nThis is my favorite buffet in NV. I wish I lived here sometimes.
