Eden has gone above in beyond in more than one way. The complex really tries to work with you in all aspects of your renting process along with continuing that relationship even after becoming a resident. I have rented in many different areas, and have yet to meet the level of kindness and understanding that Eden provides. With multiple wall accent colors to choose from to personalize your living quarters, to community potlucks, you cannot go wrong with Eden. I was more that satisfied with all staff members and appreciated the level of compassion and concern the staff had for my residency. \n\nWith it's central location and covered parking, it's a great option for students and young adults. Matt and Jamiee continue to go above and beyond to help you with all of your needs and make you feel right at home. I recommend Eden for it's location, staff, and community as it is a great place to live and be apart of.
