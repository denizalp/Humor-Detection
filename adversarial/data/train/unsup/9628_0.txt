When I die, there will be with a smear of Camembert on my lips and salami in my riggored hand.\n\nCome to Petit Fromage and come here often. \n\nStand in front of the display case for about 15 minutes like I did and let the thoughtful selection of unique meats and cheeses inspire a week's worth of dishes. \n\nWill be back soon, but not soon enough. Extra points for the eye candy working the cheese counter.
