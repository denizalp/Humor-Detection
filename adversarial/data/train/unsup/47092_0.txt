A few weeks ago I had an issue with my a\/c unit and I came here spoke to Eddie and he set me up with the parts that I needed.  He not only got me the correct part but also walked me through the instalation he also offered if needed to give him a call if I was to run into some trouble during instalation.  This place is awesome 5 star friendly service.  Very professional and willing to go the extra mile.  Thanks Eddie!
