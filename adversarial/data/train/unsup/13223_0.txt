Having been a Pinkberry fan for years I was so excited when I heard that finally a location was going to be opening in Vegas, yay! \n\nI couldn't wait to have my standard Pinkberry cup! This cup is composed of original Pinkberry topped with fresh banana, mochi and Fruity Pebbles. Seriously this is like the best cup of froyo ever! So when I started to order my beloved they told me they do not use Fruity Pebbles. You have to be fucking kidding me right? Nope. They have some no high fructose initiative so Fruity Pebbles were removed from the toppings months ago. Im still reeling from this completely and total let down. I begrudgingly ordered my cup sans the Fruity Pebbles and then proceeded to stand there for 5 minutes while my cup disappeared into the back so they could figured out how to cut a banana. When my cup finally emerged from the back and presented to me it was needless to say half melted. No apology, no excuses, nothing. Of course I call out bullshit when I see and asked what they were going to do since my froyo was melted, she just shrugged me off and started helping another customer out. So not only did I not get my Pebbles but I also didn't get that icy crunch that separates Pinkberry from other froyo places. What an annoying and frustrating experience after which Id be hard pressed to return. \n\nLesson here.. if you want Fruity Pebbles bring your own. If you want fresh banana ask for it before they dispense the froyo. Otherwise go to Yogurtland where you have control of your final froyo destiny including high fructose spike cereals.
