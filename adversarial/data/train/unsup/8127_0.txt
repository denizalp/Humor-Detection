not authentic, period.  Waaaaay over priced for its ingredients and portion. Never trust those local quebec newspapers because they don't know much about asian food anyway and they haven't traveled or experienced much outside of quebec. Another word, they don't know what they are talking about. \n\nOrdered the spicy octopus with cucumber. It came out like Chinese Szechuan side dish with lots of sesame oil in it. Cucumber was not even marinated. Any Chinese person could've made a much better version than that. $6 for tiny 5 pieces of octopus and 1\/4 of a cucumber? Kidding me. \n\nGyoza was recommended by the waiter. Seriously?!  If you buy frozen leek dumplings from Korean supermarket for your restaurant, at least don't advertise it as \"recommendation item\". Japanese don't eat leek. Koreans do. $6 for 5 frozen dumplings for what I can buy the entire bag of them. You don't make dumplings from scratch it's no big deal, but just don't pretend people will not recognize it. \n\nFinally, the ramen. I had the lobster miso broth. Lobster seafood flavoured MSG was heavily added coz I felt EXTREMELY thirsty afterward. Ramen was just average, not memorable.  Lack of ingredients of traditional ramen. Other local Isakayas had better ramen, not to mention those NYC places or in Japan. \n\nFYI, my check was $73 for two ramens, that fantastic cucumber and gyoza and a 350ml drink. Could've had two courses much more promising French instead. \n\nWhat a replica!\n\nP.S.When diners review a restaurant, isn't food the most important? Yes you like the decor and the service, but you don't just pay to sit there and admiring the space unless you're in a museum.
