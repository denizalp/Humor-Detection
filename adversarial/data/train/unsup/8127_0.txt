Went here while in the valley...food was good. My Mom got the fried rice...too mushy and used too much sesame oil. Worst part was the staff ignored 2 drunk hipster skater \"dudes\" who were extremely obnoxious and openly on speaker phone called their \"Bro\" to talk about how \"Google famous\" they were going to be posting pictures from the place! Ruined any part of the visit. Staff was friendly but needs to know when EVERY OTHER PATRON WAS ANNOYED BY TWO DOUCHE BAGS ! might return.
