We booked a car through music express who contracted Omni. We brought our son to Vegas for a work convention. We specifically booked this company as they said they had car seats and we reserved car seats for both ways. They didn't have a car seat upon pick up when we arrived so we had to sit and wait for one. We called to complain and ensure they'd have one for when we returned to the airport. When we went to get the car to leave there was no car seat again. It is a frustrating company as we tried a number of times to ensure we'd have a car seat and they acted confused along the way. I wouldn't recommend.
