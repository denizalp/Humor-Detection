Had ZERO expectations for this place and they STILL LET ME DOWN -___- SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY AND MAYBE SOME WHITE HAIR AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n\nCame here just to sleep because we had a flight at 5am but when we got there they said they couldn't find our reservation....AND THEN when they found it, they said they'd given our room to someone earlier with the same last name........uh oh ok well then give us another room right? So we requested A NON SMOKING ROOM and all they could offer at that point was a SMOKING ROOM. I don't care about people who choose to smoke but those who don't smoke know that the smell can be extremely bad and being put in a room that smells like it naturally makes one infuriated. \n\nWe tried reasoning with them but they didn't seem very sorry that they messed up. The manager even came out and yelled at US for being angry?? WTF IVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED. You guys messed up, don't give me attitude -_- How do you even give the room to the wrong person DON'T YOU CHECK ID??? In the end, they gave us a small discount on the room but that's it. Yup. That's it. Never coming back.
