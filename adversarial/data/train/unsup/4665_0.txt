I'm a fan of illy coffee. Their Americano ranks up there as one of my favorites.  Their Americano is strong, smooth, and doesn't have that bitter taste.  Bottom line...illy coffee is really good.  What I'm not a fan of is the high ticket price you're going to have to pay at Espressamente illy. A large Americano and a regular sized caf√© latte w\/soy milk cost us about $15 after tax.  I can get illy a lot cheaper anywhere else.  But I get it.  The prices are jacked up because it's on the strip.  Vegas Baby!!!\n\nTIP:  I got my Ballers Yelp Badge checking into this place.  \n\n2017 Yelp Review #67
