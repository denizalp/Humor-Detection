After reading the reviews and 10 out of 12 were glowing reviews I thought we had to try. So, my friend and I went for some services. I had the mini mani and petite pedi, she had the mini mani and down and dirty pedi. We both loved our services! Diane was my nail tech, she greeted me right on time, introduced herself and shook my hand. Small details, but to me that is a great begining. The mani bar is so cute, I wish I had a martini while having my manicure! The chairs were not so comfortable though... The pedi area, however, was very comfy. Very plush, velvety, pillows, little tables for mags and my coffee. I was offered some water, wich was definately tap, I wish they had little bottles or at least some tasty filtered wated to offer. The staff was friendly, the services were pretty good, it was very clean, and great prices. I will definately go back and tell my friends about it.
