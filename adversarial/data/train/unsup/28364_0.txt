Had lunch with the family.  Love the cincept, but the restaurant has some kinks to work out.  When we arrived there were 2 orders ahead of us and all 3 tables waited at least 12 minutes to get food and orders came out 3-5 minutes in between. Almost seemed they could only handle one order at a time. Also, only found one napkin dispenser in the entire restaurant which caused a big bottleneck by the drinks and condiments.\n\nDespite the operational issues to address, the food was great.  We had one grain and kale bowl, a salad, a kids chicken sandwich and a parmesean and veggie side.  All items got the thunbs up.
