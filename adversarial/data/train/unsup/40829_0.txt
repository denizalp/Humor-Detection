Nice little movie theater.  The seats are comfortable, it's clean and the staff is nice.  For some reason it doesn't come across as spectacular.  I'm always trying to remember which screen room to avoid, I think it's number 10 that's really tiny and the stairs cut right up the middle of the theater so it's impossible to sit in the center for the best view.  But it serves its purpose.
