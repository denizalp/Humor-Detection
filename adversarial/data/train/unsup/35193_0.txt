Service was amazing, staff extremely friendly and welcoming and the waitress went over the whole menu with us.  \n\nI got the Farmstead burger which was more of a wrap, but tasted a lot better than I expected by the way it looks. Also got the Supreme burger which was loaded with onion rings and fries. \n\nThe prices are a little more expensive but you pay for the quality and the restaurant itself had a charming vibe than your regular sit-down burger-shack like the Works or BQM. Overall, I enjoy the fact that all of their products are organic and all natural and have a lot of options for vegetarian and gluten-free meals.
