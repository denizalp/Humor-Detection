Had an emergency situation...needed same day carpet service prior to a furniture delivery. My husband and his rented RugDr were a bust! I usually use Sears for carpet cleaning, but they did not have an opening. Called The Carpet Monkey and Lynn(e) hooked me up w\/Rick and Joe, same day, at a great rate. Thanks for saving my a$$ guys...w\/def use again.
