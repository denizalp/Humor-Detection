When I think of Vegas, I think of good dining. This place does not belong there. The atmosphere felt like a cafeteria\/food court. The staff was a joke. No one told us we had to pay gratuity on a group of 6. In the end our server had added his tip for lousy service, had I not complained, he would have gotten away with over $60 for a job NOT well done. \nA few hours later, as all of us made our way through the night, we all fell ill. We ended the night by going back to our rooms, sick. I am not saying that Chin Chin was the cause, however it was the only thing we had in common. \nDine or Dash? Dash... Just the thought of dining, makes me ill.
