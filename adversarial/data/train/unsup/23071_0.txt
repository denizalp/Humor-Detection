Like the Anti Nowhere Leage \"For You\" song goes:\n\n\"For you \n Well I'll be your soldier \n For you \n I'll bury friends \n For you \n Well I'll be your saviour \n For you \n I'll play and pretend \"\n\nThat's how I feel about this little pub buried amongst suburban strip mall hell.  Every time I come here I have strong drink, good conversation (with bartenders that ACTUALLY chat with customers) and good pub grub.  Always lots of regulars and a couple of random drunks, yuppies and people meeting on clandestine hookups.  If dark but just dark enough to make everyone look a lot better looking.  I hate to break it to folks but corned beef is not Irish, its Jewish and this is in my top 3 favorite corned beef I've had this side of Dublin, er' New Yorks Lower East Side.  Jukebox has corny Irish music and pop music but hey this IS the suburbs after all.  It cant all be Charley And The Bhoys and The Nips can it?  \n\n\n\n\n\nfeicfidh mé ar ball thú
