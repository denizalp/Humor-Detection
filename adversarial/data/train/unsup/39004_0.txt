I recently had a massage from Bridgette.  I've had upper back tension for the past couple months and despite stretching and exercise I still wake up in the morning with my ears feeling like they're up by my shoulders.  Bridgette took note of that and worked on my upper back.  When I awoke the next morning, I noticed by shoulders and upper back felt so much better.  \n\nDuring the massage we also discussed yoga and I asked what poses and stretches I could do to open up my shoulders.  After the massage she demonstrated some - I'm glad to have more techniques to help with my stiffness.  Finally, she obviously paid attention to other areas I needed to work on - she pointed out that my right leg is much stiffer than my left and gave me advice on what to do to ease that muscle tension.  As a runner, I really appreciate this.  Thanks Bridgette!
