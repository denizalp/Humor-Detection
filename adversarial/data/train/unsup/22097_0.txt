I've only been to America's taco shop out in Tempe. That place is legit, though it has been a little bit since I've been out there. When I went in to the Camelback location they were out of the al pastor and the Americas corn. WTH?!? They have like three items they serve. THREE (It used to be just 2-the carne asada and al pastor meats) How do you run out of one of the MAIN things you serve on a Saturday night? Definitely Poor management. I won't be back. And on a side note-I did leave after finding that out. I went to their seventh Street location and they were also out of corn. The quality was also definitely lacking. Whats going on ATS?? You used to be one of my go-to's where I knew I would get some solid grub. I'm going to seriously have to rethink going back again bc its simply not worth paying 2.75 for a tiny taco thats luke warm and didnt even have all the fixings on the Al Pastor taco (missing the pineapple). I think now that ATS has become a chain, the quality and portions have taken a sharp nose dive.
