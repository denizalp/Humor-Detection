Excellent service! \n\nI dropped my iPhone on the ground last week and completely shattered the screen. It happened a few hours before my trip back to Philadelphia, so I was a little panicked. I found this place on yelp, and it was a good thing they were still open. I arrived at 4:00pm and the guy said he would try and fix it before closing time. I came back at 5:30 and lo' and behold. He got it done in a jiffy.  My phone came out looking like nothing ever happened!  It was incredible how fast he got it done. \n\nOverall, great customer service and excellent work at competitive prices. Would recommend this place.
