This particular McDonalds is situated right beside Ranchmans. Within the recent months, the good corporation of McDonald's Restaurants decided that operating 24\/7 in selected locations would be a great a idea. God have mercy on the poor souls of the employees that still work in this location at the late hours of Thurs-Fri-Sat\n\nI mean it, I would've quit the moment I learned that I would have to deal with drunkards fresh off the mating grounds..err...dance floor.\n\nWhen we walked in the lineup was already long and was in complete disarray, and the only thing keeping the rowdy drunks at bay was a friendly old lady wearing a security jacket. Clearly she was the night shift manager trying to establish a presence of importance. I will give her points for doing a good job in preventing the place from turning into post apocalyptic raider's camp.\n\nSo while, ordering and getting food was a little annoying, eating it was just as annoying. Mickie-D food is Mickie-d food, it's the same everywhere and staff are trained to make Big Macs under any nature of duress. So by default, it was good. But the dining experience itself was annoying, which begs the questions \"why didn't we just get the food to go?\" and to that I reply \"it doesn't matter, shut up\". For security reasons, they made sure that every door except the main entrance made a LOUD alarm that made people think something was on fire, when it truth, it was just Glenda going out the back for her smoke.
