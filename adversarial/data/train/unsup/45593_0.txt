What a CRAPPY DISHONEST PLACE!!! Do NOT buy anything from this store. \nWe bought a few pieces of furniture, 1 came broken and another chipped a few days after receiving it and continues to chip. We have been lied to by all sources and have been given the run around 4 different times. I would NEVER recommend this store to anyone! 1 star is too high!
