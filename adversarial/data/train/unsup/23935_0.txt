The 1 star is a review for our lunch on Friday, June 13, 2014. \n\nWent here for lunch with a friend! I only have one complaint-- our server, Rafael A.! \n\nRafael was very unprofessional, unfriendly, and boring!  We always say \"Thank you\" and not even a single word of \"You're welcome\" is mentioned! He did not even bother to ask us how our lunch\/food was. He just ignored us the entire time ! \n\nAnyway, the view is breathtaking ,\nFood is great, and other staff were nice!\n\nLast time I went here was on my birthday dinner with my boyfriend! Everything went great! It was wonderful, especially when my boyfriend surprised me with dozen of roses and one whole cake made by their executive chef!\n\n Oh  and our server, John was awesome---- way better than that boring, incompetent, Rafael!
