The concept of this place is great, but it's really kind of a dump... and WAY overpriced.  The lady today told me that \"it is easier to cut when it's clean\" (because he was a little sweaty), but failed to mention that she would be tacking an extra $3 for an already overpriced $16 haircut.  What a rip off.  Not to mention, the store is dirty.   My kids love coming here, but sadly this is our last time.
