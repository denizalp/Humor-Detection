Coming here with a couple of friends, I expected amazing food but it's really not all it's cracked up to be... I thought with all the 5 star reviews the food will earn it's keep but it's honestly just OK... We tried most of their tacos and about 6-7 small plates (including the crickets). The food lacked flavor and nothing we ate was memorable. \nHowever, a friend of mine who frequents this place said that it may have been an off night as food is usually a lot better. I will try them again at some point, they have some good drink specials and great d√©cor. So may be on another night, El Dorado will impress.
