You can book a cheese cellar here for private events.\n\nThe above statement is enough to garner this place five sexy stars without hesitation. \n\nEnoteca Sociale is some of the best Italian food I've had in Toronto. I went in with a colleague and we started with some whiskey cocktails, red wine and their fabulous house made bread. I had the rigatoni with red-wine braised beef. The meat was soft and exquisite. The portion initially seemed small, and I knew I was going to want more but I was perfectly full at the end. We over serve pasta on this side of the pond, and this place keeps it real. \n\nIt's definitely a date night kind of place, and I'll bring my sweetie back here. Not that I didn't have a lovely candlelit meal with Yelp's Biz Outreach manager... I just recommend this joint for couples over colleagues. \n\nYou can book a cheese cellar here for private events.
