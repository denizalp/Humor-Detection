I just moved to this side of town Halloween weekend. I came down to get my nails done and seen Rod Works.  I recognized the store from a reality TV show, and thought I'd go in and have a look around. OMG! !!! This store is my new favorite! !!! I am obsessed with all the beautiful things! I have been in this store every weekend since! Prices are great and the staff is super friendly! !!! \nI HIGHLY recommend this store!!!!! Tell you're friends!  I plan on decorating my entire house with the items in this store!
