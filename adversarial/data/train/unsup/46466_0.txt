When I next go to Vegas, I plan on staying in the Venetian because it's the most beautiful of the resorts in my opinion. Beeeeeeautiful inside. But then, I'm a huge fan of the for reals Venice -- which I went to after I went here and was astounded at the accuracy they put into this hotel. Like when I saw Notre Dame cathedral in Paris ten years after having seen the Disney movie and was floored at how great the animation had been. Thank you, pop culture. Not that either the hotel or the movie live up to their respective influences, but the attention to detail makes me appreciate them in a completely different way. But I digress.\n\nAnyway, this place is beautiful and massive and amazing. I'm sure the rooms aren't quite as grand as the resort itself. Or, rather, I'm sure the rooms that *I* could afford aren't quite as grand as the resort itself. But it's a great place to set up your base, and really, you don't spend much time in your hotel room in Vegas.
