Even though it was a hot day out, my dogs deserve a play date with their friends at the dog park. Boy did they have fun.\n\nEven though it was supposed to be hot outside, there are so many trees covering the general area. All of us can walk and sit around comfortably while dogs running around to play with others. I enjoy the small dogs area that is completely fenced in. There are several obstacle courses for dogs who are up for a challenge. my dogs walked around them and I ended up being the one jumping over them Lol.....\n\nOverall I do enjoy this dog park. Very relaxing with plenty of shades.
