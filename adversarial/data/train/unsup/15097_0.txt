My coworkers and I Love coming to this place to get Hawaiian food! So much better than Onos bbq! The BBQ chicken is to die for! it is so much food for such a great price! Only problem i have with them is they don't deliver and i am 90% of the time the food picker upper. So once they get delivery goin ill be more than happy!!\n\nI cannot force myself to get anything besides the bbq chicken because it is just that good, the luau pork has so much in there i only ate a few bites and was stuffed.  And i have an appetite believe me.  My coworkers tend to get the crispy shrimp and the katsu chicken or teriyaki and love all of the food they ever try besides these as well.\n\n\nThis place does not use MSG to my knowledge otherwise my boyfriend would be throwing up every time we order since he is allergic to MSG. \n\nMy coworkers happen to love the crispy shrimp and the bbq short ribs as well along with the potsickers.
