Terrible terrible, extremely small and super crowded. They need to stop letting people in. The water was so filthy it had a film on it. EBC is much better! Prices are ridiculous but that's everywhere in Vegas. But it was sooo crowded it took hours to get a drink from the bar, you couldn't stand anywhere, let alone sit is forbidden. \nTheir security is ridiculous. Went into all the little crevices of my purse, tampons, hair ties, wallet. We were treated as if we were smuggling pounds of drugs. They threw out my newly purchased, unopened gum. Needless to say, I won't be going back there.
