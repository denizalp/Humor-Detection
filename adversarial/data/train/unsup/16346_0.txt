You've heard the warning: \n\n\"Gurrrrl, you better know exactly what you want at Memory Express... or be prepared to be treated like a dumb-dumb!\"\n\nWell, I know what I want :). And I've never been treated like a dumb-dumb! At least, not at this Memory Express location. The staff here is exceptionally friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. A complete 180ยบ from other big box electronic stores, where it can occasionally feel like the staff has just challenged you to a \"let's see who can read the back of the box faster!\" contest. \n\nThe layout is sensible, and this store is always clean and well-stocked. When I call ahead to look for an item, I get an actual person and not a machine that takes 23948239487 years to re-direct me to a department flunkie who can't wait to get back to their busy schedule of Staring-In-To-Space-While-Scratching-My-Coin-Purse. And most of the time, that actual person has already done what you're trying to do, and is eager to geek out about it while they walk you through the things you'll need to continue your project. \n\nBest of all, I've never had to spend more than 15 minutes in here, including the wait to pay for your things at the till. Four for you, Memory Coco. And none for Best Buy Wieners.
