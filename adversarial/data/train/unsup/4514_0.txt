So was getting my smog check for my car. I notice Spicy Mama. I never been before so figure why not give it try for lunch. When you walk in the door it throws you off. It tiny place not really dine in place because there very limited amount of tables think only three in all. It more take out. Honest it set up just like Panda Express or other Chinese spots find in shopping malls. They have all the different selection in steam tables all ready to go. You pick bowl, one or two entree plates, and really the concept the same. One thing must admit that makes Spicy Mama stand out from fast food Chinese versions. They also have different specials look on the walls daily. You could get whole fish fried. Sure you have your typical choices from fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken, and on. The thing I found is the food more authentic, lot more vegetables in certain dishes, and other things like the sesame pork ribs (winnah). The prices are about the same. Spicy Mama they are very generous with the portion. It not like other places you get two entree combo and the to go container closes nicely. My order it was full full. \n\nThe service was great! She was friendly, explained everything being my first time, and really nice. If in the area looking for Chinese to go that inexpensive, nice portion, and solid Spicy Mama is a great choice. I will be stopping by again.
