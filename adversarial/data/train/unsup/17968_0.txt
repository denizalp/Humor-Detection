-UGH!! Poor quality, inconsistant bagels! Why are my bagels different thickness? I didn't order \"thin bagels\". When did Asiago Cheese become a \"cheese pancake\"???\n\n-Cashier tells me that the \"Asiago Cheese\" has always been thin...(um, no they haven't!) This shouldn't had been served to customers.\n\n-Saw the young high-school employee dude throw some bacon into the microwave...euw! No napkin, no plate, no wax paper...WTH?\n\n-Slow service! Stuck behind an indecisive lady...ugh! C'mon lady chose a damn bagel and ice tea and move along! \n\n-The cashier was a young (inexperienced) gal who had the IQ of a potato, it was obvious she didn't know how to work the register either...why bother having people like this handle money transactions????\n\n-Parking is ok\n\n-It was way too much of a hassle to run in to get a bagel here...poor food quality, terrible service, Inconsistant food quality, and inexperienced employees. :(\n\n-Next time, I'll go into a Safeway to get a bagel...less hassle!\n\n-WORST Einsteins that I have ever been to! Is this one a franchise???
