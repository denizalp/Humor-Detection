Our group of 10 ate at N9NE last weekend while visiting Vegas to celebrate hubby's 40th birthday.  I made reservations 6 months ago and I was looking forward to eating here for a very long time.  We were not disappointed.  This is truly an outstanding and beautiful restaurant and I would highly recommend it.  \n\nWe started off with cocktails and between all of us, we tried most of the signature cocktails.  I had the sangria, which was very potent, and the ciroctail, which was very tasty.  Once we moved to our table, the service continued to be excellent and very attentive.  We had 4 appetizers- lobster potstickers, avocado fries, oysters rockerfeller and calamari.  All were great, but most of us especially enjoyed the avocado fries and the potstickers.  The gratis hummus and chips were not really memorable, but everyone really liked the bread, which I did not have.\n\nHubby had a caesar salad and someone else had the wedge salad, which they liked.  Entrees included the sea scallops, surf and turf, organic fire roasted chicken, bone-in ribeye and the filet.  Everyone raved about their food. Sides included the green beans, creamed spinach, lobster mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and hot potatoes.  Again, everything was excellent, especially the lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nSo after 25 cocktails, 4 apps, 10 entrees and 5 sides, we were given gratis carrot cake mini cupcakes, which were the perfect end to the meal.  All together, it was $1100 well spent because how often in life do you eat that well and receive such amazing service?  The manager also gave us free passes to Ghostbar and Moon, so we ended up hanging out after dinner and everyone had a great time.  I would highly recommend this restaurant as it was one of the highlights of our trip.
