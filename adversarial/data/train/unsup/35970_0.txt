This place just wasn't for me.  I get the idea, but you really have to be in the mood for this type of experience.  The food was actually pretty good, I just was not into the game.  I should have not gone there if I wasn't ready for it.  Have a few drinks, then go have dinner.  It will be much more enjoyable.\n\nThey do have a great draft beer selection and the service was pretty fast.  The place can be a hoot if you are ready for it and want that experience.
