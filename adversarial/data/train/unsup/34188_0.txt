Order delivery to our hotel during our stay in Pittsburgh .... The fries were good but it wasn't buffalo fries with cheese and bacon .... It was cheese fries with ham., wasn't what we ordered but was good tasting.  The cheesteak ordered was good, the hot buffalo wings were flavored nicely, pizza boat was very good and the crab Rangoon was good just like Chinese place makes them. But pasta with olive oil and garlic was bland not much flavored but overall the food was pretty good for just winging it after a long day to get rest and being hungry
