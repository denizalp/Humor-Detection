3 words...\n\nSUNDAY.\n\nNIGHT.\n\nSWIM.\n\n--\n\nWords truly can't describe the greatest party on earth but maybe this video will give you a glimpse at the madness.  Trust me its even more fun than it looks.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=imnI_Gd8NGk\n\nNow if that doesn't excite you I don't know what will cause I'm STILL BUZZIN.  Hell if I were you I would get on the phone with your promoter right now and ask him to put you on the list for this Sunday because this party only happens in the summer time, and we've only got a few more dates left fellas!  \n\nHit me up if you want my guys number and I'll call in a favor.  Who knows he might even hook up a few drink tickets.  Just make sure you've got your ratios right cause ain't nobody got time for a group of dudes LOL. \n\n#vegasproblems #noragrets #bestclubever
