I had the opportunity to visit Breadfruit in the company of a good group of friends who were all willing to share bites of the dishes they ordered. I brought a bottle of champagne to share and it seemed all of my friends brought bottles of liquid treasures themselves! We had so much to drink, that the champagne didn't get opened. With a reasonable corkage fee of 5$ it was easy to bring a ton of wine! \n\nFor an appetizer we shared the plantain avocado spring rolls. They were so-so. Nothing overly impressive to me. I was actually wishing for a spicy sauce to dip them in. For my entree I had the Brown Stew Chicken dish. It's a marinated and sauteed chicken dish served with rice with peas and some steamed veggies. Again... no spice with the dish. I actually asked for some hot sauce to go with the dish. Despite the lack of heat, It was still very flavorful and I enjoyed it. \n\nI would like to give Breadfruit another try. I think their simple menu lends for getting a dish just right and making it well! I look forward to trying their other menu items!
