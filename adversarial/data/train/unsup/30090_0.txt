This is one of my favorite parks in Madison. It's a LARGE circular park with three walking paths, and an open area in the middle that has benches and shade. There are usually lots of dogs here so your dog will definitely have a buddy. Sunset from the top of the hill (middle of the park) is also an amazing view!
