I have been going to various eye doctors for over 20 years and these folks are BY FAR the best.  Dr. Virnig and the entire staff are awesome.  I honestly have never met a friendlier and more helpful group.   I live in Uptown and the location is perfect, but honestly even if I lived an hour away I would still come see them.
