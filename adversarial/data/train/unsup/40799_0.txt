I had walked past LAN sushi dozens of times and kept thinking to myself, \"I will go back there, some day!\" And of course proceeded to continue forgetting that it was there.  Finally, one day, an insatiable craving for sushi hit me, and somehow it jogged my memory of this place. Upon arrival, I found reasonably priced rolls and very fast turnaround for takeout, as well as lots of Japanese goodies for sale.  The restaurant is spartanly furnished, but it does the job.  Staff are friendly and like to ration napkins, soy sauce and wasabi (frankly, I agree with that as many restaurants throw in a handful of packets that get thrown out!). The menu is mostly sushi focused (there isn't a wide array of other Japanese foods) but it hits the spot.\n\nThe name, I'm not sure of its significance, but it sounds like an IT help manual.  Barring that, I would say that this is the best place (or maybe even only?) place to get sushi in the junction, and I would say it's a good option at that!
