I used to live on this side of town and would stop in this Starbucks because it was conveniently located near my house. The staff were always very friendly and personable, but I must agree with the other Yelpers when they comment on the slowness of the store. They are terribly slow for some reason, inside and drive-thru. I wouldn't recommend stopping at this one before work, or anywhere you need to be on time for that matter. It's more a \"weekend, I-have-nothing-better-to-do\" kind of Starbucks, with no sense of real urgency.
