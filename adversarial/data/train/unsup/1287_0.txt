Overall, the Metropolitan Hotel delivered a very 3-star experience. Average accommodations, convenient location, and fairly inexpensive. There were a couple of things though that really ruined my stay. The biggest one was the complimentary town car service. The driver was such a jerk! He didn't even say hello and didn't speak to me except to tell me that he'd be dropping me off a block away from where I was going because it was outside of his perimeter. I gave him a tip despite his rudeness because I am too nice. The next morning I got delayed in the elevator and was a few minutes late. The guy flat out refused to drive me. I'd much rather that the Metropolitan Hotel not offer a \"service\" if they are going to do it badly. The other thing that could have been better is the remote control. I'm not taking off a star because the TV was old as dirt, but because the remote was crusty and dirty. I didn't want to touch it, but then my aunt, who is a flight attendant and has stayed in tonnes of hotels, made a brilliant suggestion to take the shower cap from the bathroom and wrap the remote in it. Problem solved, but c'mon Metropolitan, that's just nasty.
