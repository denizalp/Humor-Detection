I have no idea where all these positive reviews are coming from! All I can assume is that most of their reviews are from college kids (which we all know will typically eat anything). This is the absolute WORST Chinese food I have ever had. \nWhere do I even begin?\nWe ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Crab Rangoons, Hot and Sour soup, and Edamame. Not a single thing was satisfactory. The chicken in the Kung Pao chicken was tiny little pieces and breaded. You aren't supposed to bread the chicken in Kung Pao chicken. They probably did this to increase profits as breading it makes it look like there's more. Also, the vegetables in the Kung Pao chicken were merely celery and carrots, nothing more. The flavor was okay but the ingredients were just crap!\nThe crab Rangoons were soggy, not crispy. \nThe absolute worst was the hot and sour soup. It had the consistency of saliva, not soup. And the flavor was atrocious. I wouldn't even feed this to a homeless man for fear of bad karma.\nFinally, the edamame didn't have salt on it. There are two steps to cooking edamame, boiling it and salting it. They couldn't even get that right.\nThese people are obviously out of their minds.\nI would only eat here again if it were my last option as a starving post-apocalyptic version of myself, even then I might reconsider.
