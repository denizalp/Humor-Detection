I really enjoy sushi samba even though I don't eat seafood or sushi! I like to get a variety of appetizers. The waygu goyza are really great, as well as the different tempura veggies. I don't think they are on the menu but ask for the waygu mini tacos, they are awesome. The absolute favorite and a must have is the waygu beef hot stone. They bring out thin slices of waygu with different oils and spices. You get to cook yourself and the beef is so juicy and tender! It's a must have on the menu. I have brought work groups here and they all rave about the sushi. My largest issue is the service, sometimes is great and sometimes not. We once had a reservation for a large group and Ty somehow lost and took an hour to fix, my issue was they really didn't seem to care about the large inconvenience even though we had a table of 15 and spent thousands of dollars. In anycase I plan to return again and double check reservations!
