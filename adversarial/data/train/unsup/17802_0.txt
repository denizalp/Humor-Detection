OKAY. So there's a big reason why I am giving Tacos El Gordo 1 out of 5 stars...\n a couple weeks ago my friends and I visited the establishment late at night. This was my first time coming and I was so excited because I have been hearing great things about this place. They didn't have everything on the menu since it was really late at night and I can understand why so that wasn't a big deal. We got what we could be able to get. I got 1 taco de lengua and 2 tacos de asada. They were absolutely delicious and they even give you the little onions on the sides. For my first time, it was amazing and I was absolutely looking forward on coming back again.\n\nA couple days later, we came back and I decided to try 2 tacos de pastor, 1 taco de cabeza, and 1 taco de asada. The thing is.... I FOUND A TOOTH IN MY TACO. I was shocked. I'm not one to be grossed out about things... but a tooth in my taco??? They tried explaining to me that it's normal and they tried offering me free food but honestly after that experience I didn't want to ever come back to eat tacos there again. I've had many tacos in the past from authentic places and this was by far one of the most shocking experiences while eating at an establishment. YUCK. \n\nOn top of that, the cashier and the employees on the floor had nasty attitudes after I asked about the tooth in my taco. I'm better off making my own tacos at home.
