The folks at iPhix went over and above for me when my iPhone 4 finally died. Initially they installed a new battery, and when that failed to correct the problem (my iPhone was way too far gone) they refunded the charge for parts and labour. iPhix only charges a $5 assessment fee, uless you walk away with a working phone. $5 is not much when you consider they spent several hours over two days working on my phone. They even went so far as to load my pictures and contacts onto a key drive for me. The staff were courteous, and didn't give me any I-told-you-so's when it turned out that I had caused the problem in the first place. Apparently, using a second-rate car adapter with too high voltage melts your gear. Good to know!
