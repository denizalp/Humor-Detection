Now, I'm not one to really tear into a place with a scathing review (ANYMORE) so I will choose my words carefully for this place.\n\n*Stares at blank review spot... 3 minutes pass*\n\nWell...\n\n*4 minutes pass*\n\nErrr...\n\n*7 minutes*\n\nSo, I got nothing.\n\nI will start at the parking garage. We parked at the red 2 section and ended up having to go to orange 4 so we could reach the elevator to the building. Upon leaving we had to go to orange 4 to cut through green3 wind up back at red 2. BTW what is with the hundreds of foot prints across the ceiling of the parking garage? The place looked kind of dingy already and this just made me break out the sanitizing wipes.\n\nThe Adventuredome is what I believe to be the main attraction. A huge glass structure with rides and attractions and oh so much fun for the family. If this place was actually clean it would really be great for kids. Lots of fair foods like cotton candy and plenty of cute rides they would all love. I think the older kids and even the parents could have fun too. \n\n\nEverything is just SO dirty!\n\nYou just don't want to touch anything. Blah...
