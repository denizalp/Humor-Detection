2 stars because I would never come back,  there are better ways to consume 10000+ calories.   \n\nI am sitting in the restaurant writing this review.  I've passed this place several times and the parking lot is usually full.   I figure with 4 starts on Yelp,  it might be worth a try.   I ordered the western burger and fruits.   Maybe I should have tried the sliders.  I'm not sure.   The burger patty seemed like it was pre-made and frozen.   But what really killed this was the bacon that was as tough as jerky.   The French fries were uninteresting.   I wanted to enjoy this so bad.   I'm a little disappointed I came here on a whim,  especially since I had left over Salmon cooked at home.   Oh well...   \n\nI feel like I've been cheated out of \"cheat calories\".   \n\nReturn factor: 5%
