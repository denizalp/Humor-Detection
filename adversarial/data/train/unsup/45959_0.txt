I loved eating here. It was one of my favorite stops on my trip to Vegas. The server was really friendly and the food was well prepared. I was a little nervous since it was off the strip, but it was better than expected and then some. We ordered the fish and chips and salmon with seasonal veggies. Definitely worth the trip.
