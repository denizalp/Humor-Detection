This is the most unprofessional lab I have ever seen. Staff complaining about other staffs work ethic in front of patients. Three people at the desk waited 10 minutes and was never acknowledged. there was one for woman in front of me who comes here every month Who was very elderly. They could not find her records. They could not find her orders. They asked her a question after question while she stood there with her oxygen tank. Just sad I will never come here again
