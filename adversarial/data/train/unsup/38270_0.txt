Spent $18 for brisket and 2 sides. The portions are humongous! The Mac and cheese was okay. Nothing special. My primary complaint is that the brisket portion contained one really nice slice of delicious brisket and the rest was edge fatty pieces. So I got one piece of amazing brisket and a pile of fat. Pretty disappointed.
