I love hot dogs. Love. So why did it take me so long to visit buldogis? Location. It's almost a 30 minute drive for me (which is far for Vegas), and the hot dog isn't exactly a meal I plan out way in advance. \nThat being said, the hot dogs are awesome. Great selection of specialty dogs with American, Korean, and Mexican toppings or you can always go plain Jane. The dog itself is really high quality - all beef with plenty of snap, and if that doesn't appeal to you, they have a spicy one, a veggie one, and I think one that's more like sausage. We tried the bulgogi and east coast (pastrami and sauerkraut) dogs, and both were great. About $6 each and very filling. The munchkin likes her corn dog, but it wasn't anything special. We went for plain fries instead if one with all the toppings, which was good because the dogs were way filling. \nThe ambiance is a little lacking as almost nothing was changed from the old Quiznos.  They even use the same Q open sign!\nOverall I loved it, but it's a little far to be a random lunch spot for us.
