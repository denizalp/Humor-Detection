I can't beleive the High Roller is bigger than the London Eye.  But, supposedly the specifications say it is.\n\nIf you're a Total Rewards member, you get a discount, or use the points to pay for this.  At night the cost is $35 to ride this, and during the day they have a different price (cheaper, I think since no one wants to see Vegas during the day) and then a multi use ticket to ride the HR during the day and night.\n\nThey suggest booking a reservation time, but on a Saturday night, no one was in line. It was very empty.\n\nI'm giving it 3 stars because its an A ok attraction for Vegas, but I can't pay for such an outrageous price, even if I used my Comp points.  \n\n$2 off for a Total Rewards Platinum discount also isn't enough.  Maybe a $5 discount, but $2? Nope.\n\nThere's so much to see and do in Vegas, I'll think about riding this if I am utterly bored.
