This place is terrible! I drove in late tonite 10:30 ish the guy didn't want to take my order ok I think ge must be busy no biggy but i asked him for tge blast that the commecial advertises and i said with peanut butter cups and peices... he kind of rushed me an I know what I want i seen it in the commercials for sonic and I believe mist oeoppe go there because of these advertisements but tge own employee's never seen them? He had no clue at all! I said the small chicken hot dogs so i asked for the one with beacon and bar b que sauce... tge gut comes out hands me a cup and and a bag tells me my order. Then I adk about the happy hour after 8:00? Blasts and cream shakes\/slush are not even in the menu I was upset cause tgese people have no clue and are not at all friendly... I leterally feel like crap cause when i get home each of the chicken dogs are drenched in bar b que sauce!!! Dripping wet with spicey bar b que sauce! I fidn't even eat them the blast was the wrong one!!! Some coockie dough one that taste like hell!!!  I feel like suing Sonic for my $7.75 back! My gf told me to stay away from all Henderson fast food spots very poor service!
