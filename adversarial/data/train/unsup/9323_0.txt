Worst. McDonald's. Ever.\n\nI don't normally frequent McDs on those occasions that I order fast food. However Tim & I were super busy when we were moving into our new house. Since we didn't have time to cook, he stopped to grab something quick on the way home. He ordered me a grilled chicken sandwich with No mayo. When he got home & gave me my sandwich, I discovered that they DIDN'T PUT THE CHICKEN IN MY CHICKEN SANDWICH!! \n\nSo he goes back the next morning to complain and he was told that \"some people order it that way\". He politely told them he ordered a chicken sandwich with No mayo not with no chicken & would like a refund.\n\nThe \"morning manager\" said it wasn't up to him,  and that Tim would have to go back at night to speak to the \"night manager\".\n\nWTH?!\n\nNeedless to say, we would never give this store our business again.
