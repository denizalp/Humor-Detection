I really enjoy the pho here and often get it to go for lunch when I'm in the area.The restaurant has upgraded inside and is more warm and welcoming than the plain white walls they had in the past.The people that work there are still very friendly and are more than happy to help answer any questions. They make fresh baguettes there daily, so the bahn mi sandwiches get extra yum points for freshness. \n\nWhat I like most about this restaurant is that they give plenty of fresh side fixings to go with the pho or noodle soups. Either for take out or dine in, they give lots of bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves, sliced jalepenos, and sliced lime. However, if you do want more chili sauce or hoisin sauce to go, just ask for it. Otherwise, you get one small container of each. The bun bo hue was decent. Not too spicy and had a decent amount of meat. The regular size pho was enough to split for two or one really hungry person. They do offer the King size pho for about 3 dollars more and that can feed 2 hungry people. Don't forget to order their Vietnamese iced coffee to keep the food coma at bay after eating!
