Two thumbs up!!!!\n\nPho (soup) and their Banh Minhs (sandwiches) are to die for!!! Not to mention their Chinese Food choices!!!! This place is a hole in the wall but their food choices are awesome!!!\n\nLocated 5 miles from the airport, no traffic, parking is not a problem either!!!!\n\nThe staff are courteous and gets your order right!!!
