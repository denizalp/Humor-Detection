Yelp is just one of several places that I'll be leaving a review for this place so more people know. Here it goes....\n\nLook at the average stars for this place!!!  I bought a showroom 2015 corvette 7 months ago from the sales manager himself. Since then, I've taken my car in 6 times for warranty issues, the latest being today. \n\nUpon dropping it off, I was given a loaner car (Chevy Malibu).  I give them a corvette, they give me a Malibu, but anyways....I also have a grand Cherokee that I've been looking to trade in to get a pickup truck. So while I waited for my vette to be done, I went shopping to other dealerships for a pickup truck. When I took the Malibu back to pick up the exact same corvette that I bought from this dealership, the sales manager said to me \"let's just do us both a favor and bring your car somewhere else from now on.\"  \n\nSo I was told to bring my car to a dealership other than the one I bought it from and further from my house. He ended it by stating \"Have a nice life.\"  \n\nSo as soon as I left, I called Chevrolet customer service to file a complaint, who told me that they would forward the complaint to the dealership and have them handle it directly. I asked if that was appropriate since the dealership will obviously be biased on behalf of their employee and was told that I was correct. This is not the first issue that I've had with this particular dealership's service. \n\nSeveral times I've spoke with customers who were waiting for their vehicles and also are not happy with them. Bottom line is.....choose a different dealership, don't buy a Chevy since their customer service does nothing for you, and don't buy a corvette since mine has had nothing but problems since the day I took possession. \n\nThis dealership has been a nightmare to deal with and so has my car. Stay away from Autonation Chevrolet in Gilbert.
