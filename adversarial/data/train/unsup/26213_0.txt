Read up on Shabu if you aren't familiar with it. It helps to have an idea. Went here for my birthday. My friends thought we would try something different. It was nice to change it up. I'm not an expert so I can't honestly say how this place compares to other shabu restaurants. I can only say that it isn't a place that I would frequent. The service was excellent. I'm just not a fan of shabu, but the overall experience was a good one for my birthday.
