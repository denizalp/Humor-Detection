I work in Downtown Summerlin & have passed this place more than a few times so I decided to try it out. I got The Pit combo. Fried chicken sandwich with cheddar, bacon, & bbq sauce with fries & coleslaw. The sandwich was really good! The chicken was moist & flavorful. Good bun & crisp veggies. The shoestring fries were nice & salty. The coleslaw was the only thing I didn't care for. Incredibly bland, but you only get a little portion of it anyways. I'll definitely be back again!
