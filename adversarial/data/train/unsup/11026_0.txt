AKA.= The new Los Tacos\n\nNo, just kidding. The food at Tacos El Gordo has a completely different flavor than its neighbor, Los Tacos. Ordering your tacos may be a little tricky, but do not be intimated: The cooks speak English too! Place your order and then take it over to the cash register, deli style. \n\nI recommend the suadero tacos (it's brisket), my favorite. The tacos are small but tasty! They are traditional Mexican tacos. Two homemade tortillas, your choice of meat and toppings. I also recommend the tostadas. \n\nThe place is clean, the staff is friendly and there are no vegetarians in sight! This place holds a special place in my clogged heart.
