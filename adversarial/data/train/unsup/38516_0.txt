Very awesome gym! This place is very nice and clean, contrary to other gyms in the area. The machines are top notch and are kept in good condition. This place has very nice locker rooms and some large multipurpose areas. I haven't taken any fitness classes here yet but I have heard great things about them. I really like the basketball court and the rock climbing wall, both are a blast! I would definitely recommend this gym as the best in the Surprise area.
