I was to the Bacchanal shortly after it opened over a year ago for a Yelp Elite event.  Some friends from out of town decided this would be a good place for a late lunch and it was.\n\nThere is a wonderful selection.  My favorites were the oysters on the half shell, the lamb chops, and the oyster shooter.  I could have been blissfully filled with those three items but I tried several other things.  The lobster bisque was very good.  There were also some nice salads.\n\nI did notice that there were a couple of things missing from the opening.  There was no tomahawk steak and there were no macarons at the dessert station (that's almost an unforgivable fail!)\n\nThe Bacchanal still is one of the better buffets on the Strip.  It's pricey but when you have friends with a comp, it's just great!
