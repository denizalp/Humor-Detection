i'm usually a much sweeter kind of gal but this place is run by people who are dumb as rocks.\n\n2 young gals who fall into the uber granola category but without any knowledge of nutrition.  i get the low pay grade but at least feed me some bs when i ask a question or look it up.\n\nthere were 3 kinds of manuka honey - 2 of which i was familiar with and one i was not sure of their grading system - ie. what is \"silver\" = ? amber such and such?\n\nconvenient since they are close by but my next purchase will be from amazon - at least i can read up on the reviews there and it is cheaper.
