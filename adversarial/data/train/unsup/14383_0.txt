This is the place me and my LV Fam crew usually come to eat on a tuesday night. Its 2 for 1 pizzas at around 9pm or so.  Great place to eat but to people not from vegas, the location of this place might not attract most.  \n\nTheir pizzas are okay, just average.  The interior is really crappy compared to other Boston Pizzas I've been to, so expect something different if you've been to other Boston Pizzas before.  Good appetizers and other side dishes though. When you order wings, 20 will be enough for 2 because their wings here are pretty huge.  My favorite appetizer is their fried mushroom, really goes great with the pizzas and wings.\n\nThis place is right across of the big OG strip club though which shares the same parking lot, which I use as the legend point to find this place easier because I guarantee you will miss the Boston Pizzas sign if you'v e never been here before.  But the OG sign is big and bright which is pretty hard to miss and shares the same parking spot.  So ladies, if your man is taking long to use the restroom, he might be in OG's using the restroom there.
