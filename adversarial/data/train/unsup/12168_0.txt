I called and explained that I needed a very small tattoo on my finger removed. They said they had a fast top of the line laser removing system.  Consultation would be 75.00 which goes towards the price of the removal. I currently have been going to another place which is great and his prices are awesome and does a great job. This dermatology place said their machine was faster and better. After going in for my consultation. They quoted 8-10 sessions at a total of 2,025$. I currently pay 125 a session and get 3 tattoos removed at a time and it works. This consultation was a waste of money and would be the same quantity of sessions where I currently go. Picosure is not a faster tattoo laser system . Do not go here.
