I've been to both Grand Lux and I swore I would never go back, but somehow I keep ending up here.\n\nThe servers there were nice but service was slow. And no matter what time you come here, the food just sucks. I've had breakfast and late night. For the price you are paying... I'd rather go elsewhere. \n\nI ordered the pasta carbonara with chicken and it came without the chicken. The pasta was nasty. I tossed a whole capful of pepper and Tabasco to help the taste. All I taste was olive oil with bits of peas and bacon as decoration. No flavor... \n\nI also ordered the \"Fresh\" garden omelette. It comes with Mushrooms, Tomato, Avocado, Green Onion, Zucchini, Fresh Spinach, Havarti Cheese and Sour Cream. Sounds good right? Well, my question is how does anyone that works in a restaurant industry not know how to cook a proper omelette? And if anyone gave you food at 4 AM when you are starving, it wouldn't be a tough decision to eat it right? \n\nMy omelette was served half cold. The egg was rubbery and dry. The menu made it sound so savory and yet I taste barely anything. I couldn't even finish. \n\nI really regret coming here and it will be my last.
