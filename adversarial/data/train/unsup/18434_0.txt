I usually hate on Tao Beach, but I recently went again this past Memorial Day Weekend and I think Tao Beach deserves one more star!! Though it's stil not on top of my list (and the pool still looks very... unsanitary) the party itself was definitely better than my previous experiences! Why? I have no ideaaaa... Maybe it was the FAKE TATTOOS? The DEEEEELICIOUS FOOD? Eh, come to think of it, it was probably the unlimited alcohol from just about every cabana we came near. What a generous crowd that day :)
