Jim and his team of mechanics do a great job at Meineke.  I've been taking my company car here for the last 4 years and have never left disappointed. They're so efficient here.  My regular car maintenance is usually completed a lot sooner than their original quote.  They're honest and will tell you exactly what's wrong with your vehicle. I recommend this Meineke for your regular car maintenance. \n\nTIP:  This location is only a 6 minute walk to In-N-Out.  You're welcome. \n\n2017 Yelp Review #73
