Made a late night stop in here for a post dinner cocktail with friends. My order was simple. Vodka soda. \n\nI'd love to spend more time here. It's gritty, cool, and has a little edge. My drink was strong. The clientele eclectic. You could disappear here for a bit if you wanted. \n\nI'll definitely have to make this a place I frequent to get a better feel for what else it has to offer. In this case, for the simplicity needed of a cocktail I've enjoyed since college, it's left me saying, \"Please sir, I want some more.\"
