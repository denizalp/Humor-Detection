If you didn't know already, this is a restaurant opened by the former mayor of Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman, hence the name Oscar's. \n\nLocated on the 2nd floor of the Plaza hotel, it faces the beginning of the fremont street experience. Upon entry from the MAIN ENTRANCE of the restaurant (not the back elevator or whatever), there are photos of some \"famous people\" who had dined at this restaurant including the current (sigh...) and the former 3 US presidents as well as some others like Celine Dion, etc.\n\nThe restaurant has a huge dome like design with glass panels so view is barely hindered by anything. The restaurant is really brightly lit by natural lighting during the day and looks a whole lot better inside than it does outside. \n\nService was really fast as soon as we were seated. My water cup never went below 50% empty. Our waiter, Bobby, was fairly attentive to us during our visit. There was a little confusing part when we were ordering but was clarified pretty easily. Bobby even apologized for it even though it was not entirely his fault. I asked him for the \"bone in specials\" as directed on the menu, and that had my friend, who was also the birthday boy, change his decision REAL FAST ! lol he originally was dead set on getting the bone in rib eye. The second the waiter had mentioned a special on a 42 oz tomahawk steak, i saw his eyes and smile widen !! Him and his friend opt'ed to get the tomahawk with lobster tail combo. I dont remember the prices exactly but the tomahawk itself was in the $90s. I dont remember how much it was as a combo. \n\nI opted for the bone in rib eye steak ($64). We had saw they offered a \"special\" (not really) of any 3 sides for $22. Why i said not really is because it was printed on the menu. so its not really a \"special\" per se.. But it still saves you money if you intend to get 3 sides. Their sides average $7-9 dollars each, so  if you get all $9 ones, saves u 5 bucks. Other things ordered in the party were the \"Spicy Flame Charred Spoilotro Steak\", \"Sally's New York Strip (Prime)\", \"Johnny Quinn's Crab Cake\" (by recommendation of a couple who were leaving the restaurant while we were waiting), \"Jasper & Hunchy's Tomato Salad), and some sides. \n\nSIDE NOTE - so apparently they give different knives. A larger knife for the males, and a smaller knife for the females... LOL REFER TO PICTURE ! \n\nTomahawk Steak w\/ Lobster Tail - to be honest, it didnt look like 42 oz when it came out. Probably more in the 30s. Bone is a little shorter than i've seen for tomahawks. The steak was ordered medium. The center was borderline rare. Cool red center. The birthday boy loved it though. He had no complaints !\n\nOscar's Bone-In Ribeye ($64) - Not sure the size of the steak but id probably say around 16oz or so. Ordered medium rare, came out a towards medium in the center. The exterior of the steak had a really nice char to it. The cap was really tender. Overall the seasoning was really good. Wished it was slightly less cooked as i had ordered in the eye portion though\n\nSpicy Flame Charred Spilotro Steak ($29) - A well seasoned skirt steak, as described ! Infused with garlic, red chili fakes ! The kick it had was actually much more than i had expected from a steakhouse. As my friend and I love eating spice, we were both quite surprised. Seasoned well. Well made skirt steak ! \n\nJohnny Quinn's Crab Cake ($19) - this was recommended by a passing couple that just finished their dinner as they were leavin the restaurant and we were standing in front. They highly recommended the crab cake as it was a \"crab ball\" and is one of the best they've ever had. They weren't kidding. Two large balls of a crab cake arrived with some stone ground mustard and a pepper remoulade. The crab was very tender and sweet. Not overpowered by any veggies or seasoning some others may do. The crab was definitely the star ! The ground mustard was subtle and not overpowering as some may be. Paired well with the crab. Preferred the mustard over the pepper remoulade. \n\nJasper & Hunchy's Tomato Salad - seasonal (red, yellow, orange) tomatoes with burrata cheese, EVOO, and micro greens. (drizzled with a balsamic reduction on top). YUMMY ! apparently burrata is a combination of mozzarella on the outside with 2 other cheeses in the middle creating a soft interior with the \"normal\" mozzarella outside. very clean, simple, but delicious dish ! \n\nAs for sides, we got the \"Jose Leonardo Roasted Corn Brulee\", \"Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese\" and \"Steak Fries\". The roasted corn was the best of the 3. Fresh chewy corn, not mushy. Was a bit saddened there was a lack of \"brulee\" part. Was hoping to crack through something when i first dug into the side dish. The mac & cheese was most underwhelming. Using gemelli pasta, it was yeah a rich creamy pasta but nothing too special. The steak fries were fried well with a soft, fluffy interior. I'd probably prefer the fries over the mac. \n\nOverall, good experience ! Good place to try in downtown !
