Not a big fan of buffets except for this one.\nI Heart Village Seafood Buffet! A trip to Vegas would not be the same without making a stop here. Oh snap, It's one of those places I like so much I would have no problem dining here by myself =]\n\nMy Favorites: \nCrab Legs\nBaby Langostinos\nFreh Peeled Shrimp\nOysters\nDesserts ( All of it )\n\nI'm also a fan of there Sushi & Asian station. I don't do salads. Can't you tell?!  Also, I passed up there Prime Rib because it looked a lil too blody. Yikes! \n\nService was attentive. Never had to ask for anything. Love it!!\n\n Looking forwards to coming back to Sin City, not too party but to eat!!
