Had an excellent experience here. We came on a Wednesday and it was half off fajitas!! What a great deal! We also tried the chicken quesadillas as the appetizer and they were also good. There is a good amount of tvs with a variety of things on. You'll always be able to watch the game you want. \n\nIt's really in a good location. It's surrounded by other night life locations so this place gets pretty poppin on the weekends. It's definitely a good place to hang with friends or as a pit stop for a night out on the town.
