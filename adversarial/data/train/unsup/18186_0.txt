Oh lordy has this place become an obsession for me. Whenever i am near one of their locations and they are open, I HAVE to stop. It's like a requirement at this point. \n\nThese little pillows of deliciousness are always fresh when when I stop here. So my absolute favorite and one that I grab every time I come is the Razzle Dazzle. So so so good. I recommend it. But I have yet to find a flavor that I do not like. Hot Cocoa, Samoa, S'mores, Maple Bacon and Woodstock are also just a few of my favorites.\n\nThe girls are always nice and patient (sometimes you just don't know what you want). They are very helpful too for when you can't decide on a donut. I was also offered a free hot chocolate my last visit and of course I wanted to try it so I accepted since it was absolutely freezing out. It was delicious as well. This location also offers different kinds of coffees and iced coffees.
