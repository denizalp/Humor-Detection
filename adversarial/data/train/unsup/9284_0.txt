I absolutely loved the atmosphere here. My bff had her baby's birthday cake ordered from here and told me that the bakery is very close to my house. After months of procastinating  I finally went over to indulge my sweet tooth. Boy oh boy do they have a selection. I started off with the lobster tail pastry which I had no idea what it was but had something to do being an Italian pastry. Bang on cream level. I also tried their death by chocolate and his and kisses cake. Guys I can't tell you enough how good their cakes are. They're really super creamy and if you're like me who loves buttery cream frostings then this is the place for you. Big Bonus: they have a nutella crepe cake! woohoohooohoo
