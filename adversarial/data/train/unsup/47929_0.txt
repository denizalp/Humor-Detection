HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  wow nothing good to say at all about this dump. Ordered a dinner dish. A ceaser salad and spaghetti. They gave me iceberg lettuce (crap) with a side of ceaser dressing. About 30 minutes later my meal comes out.  Sauce was cold.. Ten min later they finally bring it back...ABSOLUTE garbage for being in seven hiLLS. OH and you get to see the employees smoke cigs outside while your eating right in front of them. Its all can good food..i'd rather eat at pizza hut or cicis
