This review is based on their Polynesian Luau Buffet every Saturday evening. My family and I have been homesick and was looking for a place to enjoy a Hawaiian style dinner. We have been reccomended by fellow 9th islanders and my parents stumbled across an Ad inside Las Vegas edition of Kama'aina magazine and with the help of Yelp we decided to give this place a go. We haven't been to Silverton in years so we were bit surprised to see the upgrade throughout the property.\n\nOnce we arrived at 5pm, there was a long line with the familar Pidgin accent that was spoken among the many customers in line. The Aloha spirit was present including the many Ohanas(families) that filled up the Buffet. It took approximately 30min. when we finally got seated inside plus it didn't help that they we came across alot of Uncles and Aunties, Lol. \n\nThe food items that were present was abundant in selection and typical to what you would find in Hawaii. FYI, Hawaiian food is influence by 5 cultures that includes China, Japan, Philippines, Korea and Portugal. This unique blend of cuisine is known locally among Hawaiians as, \"local food.\"\n\nThe items that we had were,\n-Roasted Pork w\/ the head of the pig.\n-Ahi Poke\n-Tako Poke\n-Lomilomi Salmon\n-Pork Laulau\n-Teriyaki Beef\n-Seaweed Salad\n-Cucumber Salad\n-Kimchi\n-Poi\n and various items.\n\nEverything was fresh and delicious with a few items that could use a little improvement. The Teriyaki Beef was a bit dry and the Ahi Poke was a bit salty but consistent with flavor. I personally like the Pork Laulau, which is pork meat that is wrapped up in Taro leaves and steamed. The staff was pleasant and the atmosphere felt like we were back home! It would've been nice if they had a Hula, Polynesian and Tahitian Dancers to set the mood, Lol. Even having island style music play in the background would've been nice to have. Then again I could wait for the Pure Aloha Festival for the Entertainment. Overall, I would personally come back and take family and friends to check this Buffet out.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #16
