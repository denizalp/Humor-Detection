Mystic Muffin is a classic hidden gem in Toronto. It really looked like a rundown convenient store that also sells muffins, but when you enter into the tiny store, they are fully equipped and prepared to make you a quick breakfast. The muffins are amazing, and I think I'm slightly obsessed with the raisin and bran. Loads of bran that makes me feel no guilt eating the entire thing.\n\nThe guy (owner?) here is hilarious. Makes this place even cooler and better. You wouldn't believe, but they also have their own merch. I need to try the apple cake!
