came here to have dinner with some other friends that happened to be in LV and am glad we came here.  It was probably the best meal we had in our 4 day NYE stay.  The meals are pricey but you get what you pay for.  Average food price was close to $100 per head without alcohol but we did let it flo so it was closer to $175 a head.  Would I come back?  Yes I think I would.  The Rib Eye and Scallops I had were some of the best quality I've had in awhile.  Worth the drive off the strip to Green Valley Ranch.
