I first tried these guys when they first opened a couple years ago. I wasn't impressed then and definitely am not now after another visit yesterday.\n\nSince Yogurty's in McKenzie Towne closed last fall this is now the only self-serve froyo place in the area. My pregnant wife was wanting some froyo so we stopped in here. \n\nEven though it was 32 degrees yesterday, the place was empty. It was clean which was good too. There were no signs that maybe we had missed a big rush or something. This leads me to wonder why almost half of the flavours of yogurt weren't frozen. I tried 3 different flavours and they all came out in a puddle. There were no signs up to say they were temporarily unavailable or out of order. We've all been to a 7-11 on a hot day and gotten a less than frozen Slurpee, but at least in that situation you can see that the syrup isn't frozen. With this, you're pulling the handle and hoping for the best.\n\nThe employee working seemed less than interested in anything that was going on. So now I am also less than interested in giving this place my money.
