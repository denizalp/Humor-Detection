Late at night pizza is when I got here. 1,2,3 am in the morning this place hits the spot. I mean who doesn't like a late night slice or two?\n\nI usually get the pepperoni and sausage or pepperoni and jalape√±o slices. I like the thin sliced pizza and the flavor is good. \n\nThis place has some of the best ranch!! I love ranch on my pizza and they have good ranch. \n\nI rated it 4 stars because the guys in the back are cool and always nice. They are quick and know how to deal with crowds whether nice or a little loose. The pizza I actually like and they also stay open super late. \n\nIt is a smaller place but they have outside seating which helps for the late night crowds. So if you have a huge group it might not be a good spot to go unless you take it with you. The prices are fairly reasonable too and not too crazy. \n\nI will obviously be back and getting that ranch with the pizza.
