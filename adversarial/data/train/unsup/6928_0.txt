No idea why but this location has always had the most suspect service of any Starbucks I've ever been to. It was recently ask redone inside but it's mood is to somber and the acoustics are terrible. \n\nThe location note serves the reserve blends and had a \"Clove\" brewer. The closest used to be Toronto and it may still be. This location didn't new out up to the level of quality I expected. If you've been to the Roastery in Seattle then you know how it should be!  Part of the blame I think is due to the machine and general work area not being the cleanest. \n\nFor any type of detail I believe in a 3 strike policy before complaining. This review is strike 3 fir this location. I've avoided it over the last year and will continue to but sometimes it's the best choice for where I am. I hope things improve our the next 3rd strike is s complaint to head office.
