Mother's Day Brunch, complete with Mimosas, Champagne, and Shirley Temples. Sounds great, right?\nIn my personal opinion, the mimosas being strong was the only good part about brunch other than our server being an absolute sweetheart. \nThe eggs were undercooked, prime rib was tough, and the wait was nigh interminable.
