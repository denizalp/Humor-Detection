After reading the reviews, I'm hoping we just caught them on a bad day. We got seated right away, server came by shortly. I didn't really understand her explanation of the menu or how the \"rotation\" choices worked but she did seem friendly. \nOur food cam out cold and the service was very slow. Took 15 minutes for drinks. It was 5pm and they were not that busy. \nThere are many food options in Downtown Summerlin, we would probably choose to patron somewhere else next time.
