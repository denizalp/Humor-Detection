Been wanting to try this place and had the mushroom and bacon omelette which was very good. The cinnamon roll was good along with the meat scramble. One of the better breakfast places we have been to on Phoenix, I liked the self serve drink bar and how you can get your items yourself. Overall I will come back to this place.
