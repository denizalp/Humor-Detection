About the only positive thing I can think of about this office is that it was clean.  Which isn't saying much.\n\nMade an appointment for x-rays and cleaning. It wasn't until after I was in the chair for x-rays that someone told me that my teeth were not going to be cleaned that day and I needed to schedule another appointment for the following week. I was informed that it is their standard practice to schedule x-rays and cleanings on separate days. Considering that when I scheduled the appt, I was explicitly told I would be getting x-rays and cleaning, this was very frustrating.\n\nI was equally frustrated when I went to pay cash for the x-rays and found that this office charges an insane amount just for digital x-rays-- between $200-300! Just for x-rays!\n\nLooking back, I feel like I should have known better. While sitting in the lobby, I could very clearly hear Dr. Samandari asking patients about their sexual activity, if they have HIV, hepatitis, etc...  These patients were in chairs in a room that is wide open to the lobby--no walls,no doors, no privacy, nothing.  When it was my turn, he asked me all the same questions.  Questions about sexual activity are very inappropriate for any dentist to ask, let alone ask within very clear hearing range of other patients. This is a very significant HIPAA violation.\n\nMy girlfriend also visited Dr. Samandari earlier the same day.  She had even worse feelings about her visit.  She said that Dr. Samandari was extremely slimy and condescending. The said he kept calling her \"princess\" and \"sweetie\", (despite the fact that she is 29!).  She said she got a very creepy feeling from him and that he seemed like a sleazy d-bag from an Old Town nightclub who has very little to no respect for women.\n\nI can not recommend highly enough that you avoid this office and Dr. Samandari.  He has to be the sleaziest, shadiest, most untrustworthy dentist both my girlfriend and I have ever been to.
