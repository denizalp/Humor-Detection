When your Yelp reviews are good and I walk into an empty restaurant, someone is lying! In this case the Yelp reviews were false! This place is horrendous! \n\nOur server was a lot on the slow side and not just physically slow. The bread was cold and the butter was frozen! A clear sign of a bad restaurant. But still we decided to stay and give it a try. \n\nShe ordered spaghetti and meatballs in a garlic and oil sauce and what arrived was the most pathetic excuse for pasta I've ever seen. I will post pictures so you can see how incompetent the people cooking in this place are. Picture a soup with meatballs floating on top! It was DROWNING in oil! \n \nMy Chicken Frances was no better as they clearly use low quality frozen chicken. We ended up paying over 30$ for disgusting pasta. I would never recommend this place to anyone! \n\nTHEY'RE HORRIBLE!
