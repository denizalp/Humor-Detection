Went shopping last day of trip. Decided to stop by the food court to eat not kidding was extremely gross floor was dirty all available tables were dirty. Went to mall office and blasted the operations director on the grossest food court I have ever seen.  Quite shameful. \n\nDec 28,2016. Had a call from Victoria from the Mall managers office asking about what had happened that day. She also spoke about how she was going to rectify the issue and apologized. Victoria was very professional and courteous I look forward to shopping at the mall next time I am in town.
