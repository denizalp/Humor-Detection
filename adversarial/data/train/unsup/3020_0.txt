Pretty frustrated. I'm sitting in the restaurant writing this review. I was excited to have some GOOD or above average Asian cuisine. I should have also looked at Yelp prior. Both didn't happen. \n\nI am staying as a guest in the Wynn and have many times before. I wanted to grab a quick late lunch prior to going out and eating at SW later. So that's two places I'm deciding to spend my money out of the hundreds and thousands of places to go on the strip. \n\nI got the crab rangoons, lettuce wraps, and Mongolian beef and a drink. First of all, the crab rangoons were actually good. No issues there. The Mongolian beef was ok and good spice level. PF Changs has better lettuce wraps and bigger portions than Red 8. I also waited over 8 minutes for water refill and had to flag down a waiter to get me it. I was checked up on one time and almost just left alone my entire visit. There were 3 people standing by the walls and staring at everyone, but must have forgot me. Service and lack of food taste\/quality for price is the main reason for the low rating. \n\nI'm pretty annoyed that 2 appetizers, an entree and one drink came to $71 for mediocre food. Overpriced food that doesn't satisfy my is my biggest pet peeve especially that I have thousands of choices. I wasn't raving when I left. I absolutely love the Wynn, it is my favorite hotel in all of LV, but Red 8 missed the mark for me.\n\nThere were also gnats and a few flies that came by our table which is interesting since it's tucked away and I never see any of that throughout the rest of the casino.\n\nTo end on a good note. The ambiance and where we sat were great. Hope SW tonight is a better experience.
