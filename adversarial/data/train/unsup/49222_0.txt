I have been seeing Dr. Art Louis and Dr. John for the past 10 years that I've been in Vegas. They just moved new offices on eastern near the 215  which makes it so much easier to get to. Dr. Louis has been putting me back together for so many years I don't know how I could possibly live without him he is amazing hands-down the best chiropractor I've ever been to I highly recommend him I wouldn't be able to get through Massage School without him
