The tea flavours did not disappoint! They were very strongly flavoured because they used real brewed tea. I got the Jasmine milk tea scoop, and my friend got the Hojicha. We also sampled the Thai iced tea soft serve.\n\nJasmine milk tea: the flavour was strong and milky, but the ice cream was a bit strange. It was harder on consistent, but had a semi-chewy\/chunky texture that confused me. I looked into the issue and found these soft white blobs that looked like frozen lard. Wasn't sure if that's supposed to be normal, but I wasn't feeling social enough to inquire. \n\nHojicha: tasted like strongly roasted milk tea from Chatime. \n\nThai iced tea: I should've gotten this one. It was a soft serve so it takes less effort to scoop, and the flavour was strong. Thai iced tea is usually my go-to, but I decided to change it up today. \n\nSeating: not many. There were maybe 3 small round tables and 5 single seats facing the window.
