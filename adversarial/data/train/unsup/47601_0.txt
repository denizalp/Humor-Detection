I was in Charlotte for a business trip and I was really craving Korean. I saw this restaurant was relatively close to my location. I was greeted by attentive staff and the food was delicious. I ordered Grandma's Bibimbap (it came with sides) and a lychee martini. Both were very delicious and if I'm in the area again, I'll definitely stop by.
