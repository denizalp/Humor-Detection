The TI Buffet is a solid two and if this were in any other major city, would be a three star. It's a little overpriced for the quality of the food which was quite ordinary. We went here simply because it's across the street from The Venetian and my hubby was \"too lazy to walk down to The Bellagio.\" A highlight was the dessert station. Best of all the offerings. If you're in an Uber, Lyft or a traditional taxi or your own wheels, drive the 215 to North Las Vegas and try the Medley Buffet at The Aliante. Cheaper and the food was much fresher and better tasting.
