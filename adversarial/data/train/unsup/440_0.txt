No matter how snobby you think old-town Scottsdale socialites can be, the truth is they like to get hammered and stuff their faces just like us real human beings. In the indiscriminate hours of 2-4 am, you can dine by the slice, or if you gotta have it fresh like yours truly then reject the premade meal and get yours made-to-order.\n\n$20 for an 18\" with two toppings is a bit pricey by some standards, but after shooting Patron all night like a rich bitch I could overlook it. They're busting out the dough and making my pie FRESH in the middle of the night, so tip them well. Crust is legit, cheese is REAL, stringy mozzarella. Staff is kind and quick; the manager keeps the young guys running around, working hard. This pizza is quality hangover protection.
