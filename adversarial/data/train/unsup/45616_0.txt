We called the Scottsdale office for a rekeying quote and spoke with Dwayne (?) who was friendly and was able to schedule a tech to come out the next evening. Jacob called to inform us of his ETA and arrived as promised and knowledgeably gave us a quote that we accepted. He was able to start and finish the job that evening, going above and beyond to find the match we wanted. He was fast and efficient and gave us useful tips. We highly recommend  Diamondback Lock And Key and Jacob in particular.
