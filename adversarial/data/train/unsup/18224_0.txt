My dad is addicted to McD's I think.  Every time after my test and scans at the Mayo Clinic it is let's go to McD's.  We found this one pretty close and easy to get back on the 101.  This location was clean and the staff was friendly.  They walked our order out to us.  :)  Of course the food taste the same.
