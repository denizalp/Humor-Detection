We used to love this place customer service has always been bad but the good was good. Now both are horrible and gone way down hill.\nMy daughter asked for a cold drink since the one on the conveyer belt was warm . The waitress told her it was cold enough. \nDon't bother ordering off the menu if you get the chance they food will never be brought to you.
