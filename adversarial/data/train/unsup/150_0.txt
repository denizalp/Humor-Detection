I ordered a cake from here after getting several quotes and went with Lesley's because she quoted me about half the price compared to the other places. \nI can happily say that I got way more than I paid for. The cake was absolutely perfect. It was super moist and delicious, the decorating was was beautiful, and it was ready for pick up on time.  I would highly recommend Lesley to anyone else in need of a cake!
