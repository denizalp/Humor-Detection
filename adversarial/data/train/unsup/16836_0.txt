We've gone to this place numerous times and all our experiences were really bad. \n\nOur first time, we ordered Lechon Pakswi. We were given left-overs. I mean really.. you can tell which pieces of meat are the fresh ones, and which ones are the dark-looking, hard, left-over meats are. \n\nThe second time, we ordered a take-out of their Lechon Belly. LEFT-OVERS! \n\nThe third time, we ordered Sinigang na Lechon and you betcha..  LEFT-OVERS.\n\nI honestly think that on those occasions, whenever their Lechon doesn't sell, they just mix it with the new and fresh ones. I am all into recycling, but maybe when I am at the comfort of my own home. NOT on a restaurant where I literally buy and pay for service and satisfaction. \n\nWe have given this place chances over and over again, since it's pretty close to the house. I hope that this review would have people on the look-out for those \"hard and dark pieces of meat \".
