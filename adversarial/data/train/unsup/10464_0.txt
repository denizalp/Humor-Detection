Okay, okay, not bad- this place is actually nice considering the outside looks dated. The Meadows Mall has two levels full of shops, four department stores, (well 3 considering Dillard's is closing,) and an okay food court. \n\nThis is a good place to go if you need to buy a quick outfit or two, plus the prices aren't bad. It's basically a typical mall, no big thrills- just a place to shop.
