Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci! (what the heck is Fiorucci)\n\nThe Shops at Crystals is a beautiful looking mall decorated inside with high end sculptures and fountains. A breezeway between the the Aria & The Cosmopolitan, its a nice way to stay cool and window shop. I happened to make a purchase at Tiffany, I felt like a rock star. They have all of the highest of the high end stores squeezed into this one mall location. \n\nDarlin' I love ya but give me Fifth Ave no longer applies. The Shops at Crystals is where you need to go if your looking for a high end purchase.
