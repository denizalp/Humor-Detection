I ordered the Vegetarian Plate. t was the most processed-looking plate of food I've had set before me in quite a while. The cheese, which covered half of the plate, was very sweet, creamy and rich. The first couple bites were OK, but after that it was just too much so most went uneaten as it wasn't worth taking home. A corn tortilla was served that was piled high with iceberg lettuce and a few diced tomatoes. Bland yet overly sweet is the best I can say about it all. \n\nMy glass of water remained empty for 20 minutes before I finally flagged down the waiter, who spent most of the time chatting with a fellow waiter down by the bar. The place was practically deserted the entire time and he was certainly not busy with work - he was simply not doing his job and consequently demonstrated disrespect to the customers.\n\nI had reservations about eating there and told myself that maybe it was a family-owned business taking advantage of the purportedly cheap rents at the mall. But after experiencing such uninspired food and careless service I'm sure it must be a faltering corporate\/franchise outfit.
