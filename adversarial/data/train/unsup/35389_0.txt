Do not go to this place. I waited over an hour to be seen and when I asked if this was the norm they told me yes \" that some patients require extra time\" just to be seen by a nurse who told me that I was not in as much pain and I thought I was.... Which I may add she had not even looked at my records. Then told me that pain is something I have to learn to deal with because I am my mid 20s!!! She also completely downsized everything I had to say and compared my pain which I have been handling for a year now to her spraining her wrist picking up her child. This place is a joke and a complete waste of time. This place needs to shut down they do more damage then good.
