Came here on the recommendations here on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed. Very friendly and quick service. I had the hot stone pot bibimbap which was served with no less than 6 banchan sides - very generous, and the kimchi was topped up as soon as I finished the first bowl! Worth splashing out a little for the delicious Chung Ha sake too. Will come back next time I'm in the Annex!
