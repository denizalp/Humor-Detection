This place was AWESOME! We did the Alice in Wonderland room with 5 other family members and it was so cool. The owner was super informative and helpful, even after the room ended he asked if we had any questions and gave us cool, positive insight on how we all contributed in certain ways to solving the riddles. Right after we left, I loved it SO much, I booked the Lost Friday Night room literally 5 minutes after. It was so cool and I highly suggest doing it with family members or friends! Each room was totally different but still just as fun!!! Definitely going back for the Pharaoh room! :)
