Yes - full service gas stations still exist!\n\nI didn't know this until I pulled up to Bridwell last week and was greeted by Charlie.  He chatted with me and asked what I needed, to which I replied that I was just thrilled to have made it to a gas station before my tank hit empty!\n\nAs Charlie proceeded to fill my gas, my windows were getting cleaned by a colleague of his... and I was getting a full education on Bridwell... who knew that they are a family owned business that has been around since 1970?  That's before I was born!  Way to go, Bridwell family!\n\nThey offer full service, tune-ups, oil changes, and all kinds of work -- even without an appointment.  Charlie became even more of a hit when he offered up Gatorade to which my kids sitting in back immediately responded \"yes, please!\"\n\nThis was such a different experience than my normal stops to get gas... definitely more expensive, but you do get what you pay for.  $65 later (before tip), I drove away with a full tank of gas, clean windows, and two happy kids - each with a cold Gatorade in hand.\n\nI will definitely return to Bridwell for future automotive needs.  Thanks again, Charlie!
