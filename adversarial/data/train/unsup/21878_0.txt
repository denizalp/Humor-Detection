I have delayed writing a review of this place but after four visits and about two months of consideration, here it is:  \n\nThe original owners, husband and wife team, do not know anything about running a restaurant or bar.   Literally nothing. Examples of this include;\n\n1) the initial menu being pages deep and covering almost every type of cuisine possible barring perhaps the African and Australian continents.  \n\n2) when asked the owner what type of place they wanted to be, he answered with ALL of the following;\n* casual bar\n*lounge\n*Neighbour cheap eats\n*destination restaurant \nThis is obviously very confusing and that confusion is apparent in the entire atmosphere of the place \n\n3) the first time we walked in there, they had Dora the Explorer playing on the TV - please note this was late evening on a Thursday, maybe he meant to add family restaurant to his litany of other restaurant goals\n\n4) they had no idea how to make cocktails -\nOld fashion or bourbon sour as two examples.  \n\n5) when I asked what type of wine they had available, they answered red and white \n\n6) the male owner lying to us when we asked what \nitems are made in house and he said \"everything\" to which we replied \"everything?\" and he said, \"yes, everything is homemade\". We knew this wasn't true after eating there but it was also confirmed by the lovely waitress on our next visit who told us everything came frozen and most things came from Costco.   I am not exaggerating.  We were very clearly told most things come frozen from Costco.  This included their hamburgers which were claimed to be homemade, or house pressed, or something along those lines \n\nI say the original owners because it seems this unfortunate adventure has been passed off to the wife's cousin to try and correct.   She is lovely and makes very good Asian food so I am giving HER three stars.    The original owners get zero.   I do not respect them at all \n\nThe mans blatant lying made him come across as a con and I do not support these types of establishments in my neighborhood
