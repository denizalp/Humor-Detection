Phoenix Restaurant might be a little boring for some. For me I find it is A-OK as there will never be any surprises and I always get good services and decent food.\n\nMenu has not changed and the selections are the same as the other 2 locations. I can tell you even the fish soup noodles I ordered tasted identical to the other locations.\n\nBoring......but reliable.... That make Phoenix a good choice for me when I don't feel like being adventurous and just want a quick bite!
