Here is an email I wrote the business, it should be self explanatory:\n\nI'd like to make you aware of a situation. You have not gained a customer. I would say lost a customer but I was not a customer to begin with. \n\nWhile looking for a new place to order food, we came across your establishment and was ready to try bases on other customer reviews. \n\nWhen I called to place a pick up order, I stated as much and asked if there were any specials first. What happened next is appalling as a potential customer: I was told \"Im too busy\". I was stunned and relied \" excuse me?\" And was told \"I'm too busy to talk to you, go to the website\". \n\nIt was said so rudely, I was immediately turned off from even wanting to place an order. I replied with forget it. \n\nFirst: what if i didnt have internet? What then? How am I as a potential new and repeat customer supposed to pay money to your business for your product? \n\nSecond: I had been on the website, however how do I know if there might be an in store special I am not aware of. \n\nThird: the level of disrespect that came across was such that I will never parton your establishment, I will actively advise my fellow \" foodie\" friends of this first and most negative encounter, and I will be posting negative reviews online. \n\nJust making you aware of this situation in hopes that you will in future have a little more respect for your paying customers. \n\nIf you don't have time to take telephone orders then don't answer. If you prefer customers place orders online only, then don't have a phone at all.
