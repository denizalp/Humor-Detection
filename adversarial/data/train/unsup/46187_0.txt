I normally don't write reviews on Yelp, but since I had read so much negative stuff on DAS, I thought I should share an experience that wasn't bad...\n\nWe moved two cars across the country.  In both cases, a contracted single vehicle flatbed came to our home, picked up our car and took it away.  At the other end, another contracted single vehicle flatbed brought the vehicle to us - freshly washed and in undamaged condition.  I know others have had a different experience, but we saw no issues, major or minor with the delivered vehicles.  \n\nMy only complaint was that there was very little information as the vehicles traveled across country.  You can track your UPS package as it travels, but with DAS, I was told the car would be delivered in less than 10 days and had no intervening information until I was called the day prior to tell me the vehicle will be delivered tomorrow and where do you want it!
