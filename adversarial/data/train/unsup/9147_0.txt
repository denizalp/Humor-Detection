If your loan gets sold to Roundpoint, know that I'll be your commiseration buddy. If you think it can't get any worse, don't worry Roundpoint will defy the odds not once or twice but every time you call them, that is if you are willing to wait on hold long enough to speak with them. If you're only on hold for 30 minutes you should be elated. \n\nMy issue is Roundpoint paid the taxes for the unit below me which means my neighbor can't pay their taxes because roundpoint paid them already. My taxes are unpaid and racking up the late fees, but why should they care its only my escrow account. I have called 4 times to resolve the issue and every time I've told they have escalated the issue to their manager it will be solved in 24 hours. They even commit to following up with me, which would be great if they actually did it. So, about every week I end up calling them and explain the same issue and am told the same thing. \n\nI am sure this company is fine if there are no issues, but if you need to speak to someone consider yourself SOL. But if you need a should to cry on, I'm here, probably on hold with my favorite PO box company.
