This is about the 4-5th time coming here for breakfast and the food is absolutely amazing. The smoked salmon puff pastry is my go-to, it's an incredibly creative dish. They have an amazing side salad with lots of colours, with beets and a great and simple balsamic vinaigrette that doesn't over power the simplicity of the salad. \n\nThis time, I ordered just plain eggs with a side of halloumi cheese and marinate peppers. I asked for the eggs over medium and they were inconsistent, one was runny and the other was completely hard. My boyfriend got the pulled pork eggs Benny, pork was succulent and sweet, hollandaise sauce was just perfect and eggs were cooked beautifully. \n\nThe only reason this restaurant is not getting a five star is the wait time for food is a bit too long for being just a breakfast\/lunch joint. The wait for a table varies depending on the day and time but almost every time I've had to wait 10-45 min, although I would never let that affect my ratings as that is beyond the restaurants control, but wait times for food are. Also, the washrooms were pretty messy with pee on the toilet seat and toilet paper everywhere. \n\nAside from that, great restaurant with plenty of variety in choices and fantastic service staff. Just be prepared to wait a lengthy time for a table and your food.
