As happy as a pig in...well, you know.\n\nReferring to me. And my visit to what has got to be the best place around Charlotte to get that Eastern Carolina style barbecue....The destination for and culmination of my NC quest to find the best. And it was a bit of a search, as this has moved from the old Matthews location mentioned in all the previous reviews. (Now closed, so make sure you take Hwy 74 over to Monroe.)\n\nThe pork? Smoky. Moist. Full of little blackened bits of smoked edges, and pink meaty strands of deliciousness. Deeply flavorful, tongue-tender. Perfect.\n\nThe sauce? Tangy. Garlicky. (And if you like Memphis style, they offer that too, so you don't have to be a Carolina aficionado to enjoy your visit here. It's a great version: not too heavy or sweet, which makes it actually tasty to combine with the vinegar sauce.) Plenty of, right there on the table for you.\n\nThe pulled pork dinner? Bun? Check. Two sides? Check. Which would be, for me....Red (vinegar-based, or if you MUST you can order white, mayo-based) slaw? Check. Smoky baked beans? Check. Mound of perfect pork (see above)? Check. Combine. Savor. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Holy God....\n\nAnd you can sit inside, or outside on the covered porch. \n\nMy man knew I was in another realm when I was double-fisting it: a bite of pulled pork sandwich in one hand, and a forkful of pork, beans, and slaw in the other, barely stopping to breathe this was so damn good.\n\nSmiling, smiling even still. It's not often that a food search with no determinate end finds a blissfully definitive one....
