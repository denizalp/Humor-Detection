This place is a lot of fun. The games range from classic old school pinball to the very latest pinball. I discovered new favorites and games I used to play and had forgotten. There were also some olde-timey games that took a nickel, the kind you used to find at Disneyland in the Penny Arcade on Main Street. A great break from gambling.
