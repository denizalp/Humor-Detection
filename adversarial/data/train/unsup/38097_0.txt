I love Luna's. I am a raw food chef myself so this is the only place in all of North Carolina where i have found my people! My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the cacao pudding. I also give a big thumbs up to the manicotti. its perfect. so much to choose from but i fall in the habit of repeatedly ordering the same few items because they are so good. I also enjoyed the rich tomato tartlet. The atmosphere is high ceiling open air ambiance. This is the type of place to go when you can share with others adn try lots of dishes. The portions are ample and they mostly use organic. I feel at home here and could make anything on the menu on command but its nice to be served and have someone else uncooking for me! :) By the time i have one of the fresh squeezed juices, a main dish and the cacao dessert(which i will get everytime)...the bill is already pretty high for one....but its worth it for the quality. plenty of parking....next to the train in charlotte Atherton Mill farmers market.
