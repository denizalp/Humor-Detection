Just plain lousy!  The car was fine, but the agent at the desk ( young, crew cut, chubby, male) was a monster salesman, trying to get us to upgrade, purchase insurance and return the car with an empty tank so we would purchase gas at the Thrifty price ( .40 higher per gal than Arco right up the street)!!!  I used gas buddy to Check the prices.  Liar, liar.  Who needs or wants this??  Not I!
