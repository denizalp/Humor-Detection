This local car was gets it done.\n\nTook the sled down for a bath today, and was warmly greeted by the manager, who helps you pick your service level. I wanted to use a coupon, but couldn't get my printer to work, so I showed it from my iPHONE, and the woman didn't bat an eye, and said no problem, I could use it as a coupon.\n\nThe car wash is well done and thorough, and the price point is ok. I think the one thing they are missing, is that they don't offer rain checks. This is a problem, because that is a pretty basic expectation. Phoenix is a desert, and the definition of desert is that it rains less than 10 inches a year. We know that equates to very few rain days, so Los Olivos needs to offer a rain check.\n\nOverall, this is a good spot. Today when I was there they were letting girl scouts sell their cookies, which I thought was sweet. Too often businesses get too big and forget about the kids, and helping out people. Well done Los Olivos.
