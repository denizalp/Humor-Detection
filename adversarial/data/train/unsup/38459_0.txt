This place. This god damn place.\n\nIt's literally perfect. I'm almost angry because I know that I will never have meat that tastes this good ever again. Yes there was a long line, but we were given water and some free samples of their sausage while waiting. Then when we were about to order, I got to sample the fatty brisket and I just started giggling. It literally surpassed what I thought was the best bbq could ever taste. A two meat plate was a lot of food, and I'm a 6'3 athlete, and with a root beer it put the damage right at $20. That price is EASILY worth it. I'm telling you, their meat is literally worth any price that they put.\n\nFor now, two hours after eating, I'm still giddy about how delicious their brisket was. Hands down, best bbq I've ever had. 11 out of 10. I would have this as my last meal.\n\nHopefully all my favorite foods don't taste like dirt now in comparison.
