Pink's was one of the cheapest meals we had in Vegas! $26 for three people was a nice change of pace from spending triple & quadruple that at other eateries. \n\nThis was my first time eating at this Vegas location but I'd been to the original So Cal one a few times. I ordered my usual: a veggie hot dog covered in chili cheese & onions. Completely messy & totally heavy in the stomach; exactly what junk food should be. My companions ordered polish dogs. \n\nEven though I don't eat meat hot dogs, I like that I don't have to be excluded from dining at Pink's with people who do because they serve veggie dogs. Brownie points for that. Pink's food is kind of 'eh' but it's fun to eat outside, under heating lamps & surrounded by lights on The Strip.
