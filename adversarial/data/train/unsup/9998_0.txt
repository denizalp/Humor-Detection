Let me start out this entire review by saying that I am not really what one would describe as a \"vegas\" person. My idea of a fun night nowadays typically revolves around dinner parties, a single glass of malbec, a movie, all in time to make it into bed right as the clock strikes 11PM. But alas, as they say (or do they?)...When in Vegas...\n\nI'm pretty sure that when Katy Perry wrote \"Waking up In Vegas\" she was really referring to the Mandalay Bay Resort, all its lavish las vegas luxuries and particularly  Daylight Beach Club and Light Nightclub. My stay at the resort was nothing short of rage-tastic, 3 hours sleep total over the course of 3 days and nights\/days at Daylight Beach Club and Light Nightclub turned our weekend vacation into your quintessential movie-like \"classy mess.\"\n\nDaylight Beach Club is a, surprise!, beach club that ho-downs hard during the day, and has solid grasp on not only what the haut couture crowd of day drinking and day partying is all about; but goes above and beyond to provide the quintessential \"waking up in Vegas\" ambiance. We were at Daylight for the Krewella Get Wet tour sequence; Krew has a residence there and performs EVERY month. Acoustics of the stage are great...service is consistent and attentive.\n\nThe clientele are typically post grads in the 25-30 age group-- but you'll feel somewhat like you've transported back a few years as the laid back atmosphere catalyzes such an aura and vibes.\n\nAll and all...FAB spot. Check out their shows. Get there early to establish real estate or a locker. Enjoy!
