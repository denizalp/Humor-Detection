This was my first visit to have lash extensions put on so I was a little nervous about where to go and who to let touch my eyes. Sarah contacted me personally to set my appointment after I requested and appointment online and she was very sweet and professional. When I arrived to ilash Lab, the atmosphere was extremely comfortable and relaxing. The beds were very comfortable and clean. Sarah didn't just jump right in and start on my eyes, she gave me a nice consultation since this was my first time and let me know everything I needed to know, how the procedure works, what to expect, good and bad, then asked if I had any questions which she answered with honesty and without hesitation. She asked me how I wanted my lashes to look and I explained that I wanted them to be full but natural. They turned out PERFECT! I am extremely happy and have already made my appointment for my two week fill because They are booked solid....why wouldn't they be? She's awesome!
