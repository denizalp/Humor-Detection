Timo's Monday night special was a hit and I'm now almost positive I have found the perfect dinning companion. David and I are eating our way through the best of Phoenix and I'm secretly creating my own list along the way.   We decided on Monday night to take advantage of the flatbread and wine special. I had no Idea we would practically close out the place, two flatbreads, two bottles of wine and 6 tapas later. Wow, what a meal. David selected the wine, he's great at that and I selected the flatbreads and we both had dibs on a few tapas.  The lamb chops, tamarind drumettes, smoked salmon, warm figs & prosciutto and a salad. I specially liked the lamb chops and warm figs, David went crazy for the salad. \n\nWe were both drunk ; )
