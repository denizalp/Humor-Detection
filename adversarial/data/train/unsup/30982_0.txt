I visited Scramble for breakfast with a group of coworkers and I wasn't really impressed.  The food came out fast but the taste was just ok and I felt I paid too much money for it; at least the Americano coffee was the best part of my meal. \nSo I thought ok let me give the \"popular item\", the cinnamon roll, a chance.  That was a disappointment since the frosting was cream cheese and I had to scrape off the mountain of it. \nI suggest they notate on the menu that the cinnamon roll comes with cream cheese frosting since they typically come with vanilla icing. Over all the customer service better than the food.
