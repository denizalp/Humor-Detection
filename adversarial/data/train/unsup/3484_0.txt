I'd give this store negative 5 star if I can. We walked in 2 black guys and one little Filipino dude just standing behind he counter, dead silence and that's not the worst part, this place smells like weed OMG!!!!!! Really people. Walked in and walked out. This place could of made a big sale from us, because my boys loves the undefeated store  from shoes to jacket to everything.
