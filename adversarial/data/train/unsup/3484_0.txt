This place confuses me.  You walk in, and think that this is a pretty decent sports bar.  Then you get up to go the bathroom, and see all the hidden rooms and lounge areas.  I don't understand it, is it for the people who get bucket of beer service?  Why do you need to section it off?  Is it a club later at night?\n\nFood was pricier than it should have been for a half-assed sports bar.  And there was no creativity in the menu, which there should be for the prices!  This place gets a pass.
