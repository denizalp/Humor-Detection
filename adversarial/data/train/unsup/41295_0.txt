I've never had malaysian pad thai before so didn't know what to expect when I headed in with a group on. The restaurant (I've been there a few times now) never seem to have more than 1-2 tables filled, hopefully most of their orders are pick ups or delivery. \n\nI have had their pad thai (Monday special=buy 1 get 1 free), the texture is good and the taste is flavorful but there's way too much noodles vs meat\/tofu ratio. I almost wish for a smaller portion so I don't have to waste the noodles. 3 meals and I still haven't finished the take out box. Good to share for sure!\n\nThe lemon grass soup was delicious the first time I had it in restaurant with a lot of fresh veggies and clear broth taste. The second time was via pick up and it tasted just like salty water with a few little chunks of cabbage floating around. \n\nThe appetizer plate we got was delicious, fresh rolls, mango salad, fried mushroom spring rolls and shrimp chips! \n\nI'd go back again to try their roti (never heard of malasian roti) and curry!\n\nThe woman who i think is the owner is very friendly and efficient.
