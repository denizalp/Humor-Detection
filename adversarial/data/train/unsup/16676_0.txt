This is probably the WORST club ever. I don't understand why there is a lot of hype for this place. I had a lot of expectations for this place since I've seen a lot of people on social media going here. \n\nThe place is literally a basement with bad lighting. The entire night turned into a competition to see who can pop the most bottles and have sparklers going all night long (sooooooooo annoying). \n\nMusic wasn't that great and half the club was pretty empty. The only thing I will say is that a lot of the girls were hot (yay for the men) but the men looked like wannabe rappers. \n\nNEVER AGAIN.
