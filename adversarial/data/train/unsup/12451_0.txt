I really had high hopes for this place since Chef Johnny Chu's restaurants are generally no joke.  This place was rated by Phoenix Magazine as a top 10 Asian restaurants!\n\nWell unfortunately, the jokes on me I guess.  I think the place is pretty hip and cool.  Ambience is classy with a club vibe.  However, on a regular day this place is displaced.  Located on Central off a strip mall and next to Lenny's Burger is an odd location it seems.  Once you walk in it's like a new world that you didn't expect looking from the outside.  I'm sure during the weekends this place can be popping.\n\nI attended with a foodie friend this lovely Sunday evening hoping we would be impressed!  Great reviews from my fellow Yelpers!  We ordered the Crispy Fish Papaya Salad, Red Curry, and Crispy Fried Sole.  Our papaya salad too light on the spice and seasoning.  Needed more lemons and definitely more spice and fish sauce.  The fried sole, well was fried but overly glazed with the sweet and spicy sauce - seemed pretty generic to my taste; just add water taste.  Finally, the curry was okay.  Again the spice for it was sparse and I really didn't get a taste of traditional curry from it.  \n\nNeedless to say, I'm disappointed!  Sorry gang I really wanted this place to work for me, but it didn't.  It's not to say I don't have respect for Chef Chu, but I'll have to pass on this place.  I don't know who came here from Phoenix Magazine to vote, but really; really!? - Enjoy!
