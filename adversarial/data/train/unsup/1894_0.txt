I rolled into Las Vegas on Tuesday.  I had three days and a hundred and eighty-five bookmarks.  It was time to get busy.\n\nI was hungry AF, and I wanted to try somewhere new.  808 Mixed plate was at the top of my list. What a great discovery!\n\nStepping up to the counter, I told the counterperson it was my first visit.  Then it got a little weird.  Without saying a word to me, she turned around a told the kitchen \"Give me a garlic!\"\n\nSomeone's To Go order had just come up and she grabbed it and started packing it up.  Meanwhile I'm standing there, a little confused.  Another counterperson was nearby and I tried to ask him a question.  He totally didn't hear me.  So I'm standing there for like a solid minute or two while everyone behind the counter is doing their behind the counter duties.\n\nI've read about a million reviews that describe something similar.  Usually the customer just gives up  and leaves.  Then they go home and writes a scathing review of the customer service.   \n\nBut that would've been a douche move.  Super douchey.  I would've missed out on a really great meal.\n\nBarely two minutes had passed when Joy, the counterperson, turned around and offered me a little sample cup.  \"This is our Garlic Chicken,\" she explained, \"this is what we're known for.\"\n\nGarlic Chicken?  Who the hell wants Garlic Chicken?  I didn't come for Garlic Chicken.  I'm all about Katsu Chicken.  I don't even want to try Garlic Chicken.\n\nBut Joy is super cute, and like most men, I'll do just about anything for a smile from a cute girl.  So, I politely try the Garlic Chicken.\n\nHoly hell, that sh$t is good!  \"Wow!,\" I exclaimed.  Joy laughed at my reaction.  \"It's kind of like I punched you in the face, isn't it?,\" asked Joy,  \"No kidding,\" I replied.   I couldn't believe how good that garlic sauce was.  Joy explained about how it was made, something about garlic and mayo and something.  I can't remember exactly because talking to cute girls gives me amnesia.  And I had just recently been, like, punched in the face.\n\nSo, you know, I was on a mission to score some Katsu, and I needed to follow through.  But at the same time, I needed more of that creamy garlic sauce.  I asked about  getting a half katsu and half garlic chicken.  Joy said, no problem, you can get a half and half.\n\nNow, if you are a dumb ass like me, you might think you're going to get a regular-sized order of food with half katsu and half garlic chicken.  But if you've been around the block, you know that a combo at a Hawaiian food place means two full orders of whatever it is you pick.  So when I pick up my food my eyes just about bug out of my head.  Dang, that's a huge pile of chicken!\n\nYou know how a dog's leg starts to shake when you pet it just right?  If there was a camera on me in that restaurant when I was there, I'm pretty sure the video will show some serious shaking.  \n\nThe Katsu and Garlic chicken are prepared a little differently than at other Hawaiian places I've visited.  The chicken isn't pounded flat.  The pieces more closely resemble actual pieces of chicken rather than flattened cutlets, or whatever.  The chicken isn't at all dry, like Katsu sometimes can be.  It's moist as a prom date and every bit as delicious.\n\nThe mac salad was atrocious.  I could only eat one bite.  The rice wasn't much better.  That's all I'm going to say about that.\n\nThey have a self serve Coca Cola machine, but no Mr. Pibb.  They have styrofoam cups, and I love me some styrofoam cups.  \n\nI will definitely be back for more of that crazy good Garlic Chicken.  Thanks for turning me on to it, Joy!\n\nMikey C says: 808, baby!
