We had really high hopes for Smoke. The place is pretty nice and the food was good but I don't think I'll be back much. Although the food was good, it's just BBQ. Overpriced BBQ. I think Mac's or Lancaster's does a better job for a much better price. The server was very nice but the timing of the food was rushed and then the actually BBQ items were cold. One person at our table had a very poor cut of ribs. The server replaced them very quickly and the new cut was delicious. Drinks were ok. Again, overpriced. In the end, I left feeling like I ate good BBQ but paid way too much. Their pork was the best BBQ item and all the sides were great (although there was a lack of greens). I see myself coming back to sit on the patio for a beer and ordering a pulled pork sandwich with friends before a movie or karaoke at the kilted buffalo.
