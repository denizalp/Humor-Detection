If you like flowers this is a great place to go. I went here with my pals this weekend after we had some coffee next door. They bought some really pretty flowers. I bought some airbrushed record\/magnet thing of a lady with exposed breasts. It is now on my fridge and looks great! The owner is a really nice guy. The walls are curved and painted so you think there is a 90 degree angle yet it is curved like a half pipe. It really threw me for a loop. I shouldn't have even wrote that because now I gave away the secret! If anytime soon I make the mistake of catching feelings for a woman who will ultimately disappoint me, I will come here so I may present her with flowers to express my feelings of wonderment\/bewilderment.
