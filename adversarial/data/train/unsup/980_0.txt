Driving down I-10 from Phoenix to Tucson my car always finds a way to exit and visit the Chandler location of Rudy's. I don't care that it's a chain. I don't care that there is a store in the restaurant. I don't even care that they don't have plates. I only care about how incredible the smoked brisket tastes. If you like smoked meats and are picky about how it tastes and is made then I encourage you to head to Rudy's, where they do it right.\n\nMy recomendation - 1\/2 lb Pulled Pork or Brisket, side of slaw, and a 30 minute nap. Your welcome.
