In search of a new local spa, I took to Yelp to check out A Touch of Las Vegas, which was located just minutes (literally 2) from my condo. I kept seeing that the Spa, as well as \"Rebecca\", got rave reviews so I tried it out. Rebecca, who I am sure is a wonderful therapist, was off but to my incredible good fortune KORINNA was my scheduled therapist. Professional, caring, skilled, friendly...everything about my massage and this whole experience was 5 stars and then some!! Samantha, the receptionist, was a sweetheart and the ambience is very relaxing. I plan on making this part of a monthly routine thanks to Korinna
