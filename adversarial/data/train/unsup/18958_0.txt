After my recent, sub-par pretzel the other day at the Robinson Township Mall, I was quite amazed to get such a delectable treat at the Ross Park Mall.  There are at least three different \"stalls\" at the Ross Park Mall, but they all have their own ovens to cook the pretzels.  People know this and each of the locations is packed.  The salt pretzel that I got was soft and slightly sweet on the interior with a slight crunch on the exterior.  Just the right amount of salt.  This is what a pretzel SHOULD taste like -- when blown up to exaggerated sizes.
