So I have to give the owner of Sundrops credit. She reached out to me, not sure if this was prompted by the yelp review or she genuinely was calling customers. I gave her honest feedback about everything that happened. \n\nShe did send me and my friend gift cards, so has any girl would do we decided to give it another shot. First the nail techs this time around were way better. Just the same blah service. \n\nThe girl that works the front counter has got to go! I stood there at the counter trying to check in for 5 minutes!!!! Finally my friend chirps up and says were hear for appointments, She replies back \"I know\" Come on, really - Why don't you greeat me after I walk in the door.  SALES 101\n\nThe last point I am going to say, is that everytime I call on the weekend they are booked and there are no walk-ins. On my 2nd trip, I called ahead to make an appointment and I was told they had a big party coming in at 1 so it had to be 11:30. When we got there, I think their were two customers. There service just doesn't warrant the prices or the appointment setting. Sorry I really wanted you to be my new nail salon.
