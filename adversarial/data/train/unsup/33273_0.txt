4-star review, and I highlight the below comment by saying that I will definitely go back.\n\nOn my first visit here, I had the Bruce's Bowl, which I would recommend. It was slightly on the undercooked side-- the onions were crispier than I'd have liked. The reason I cannot give it 5 stars is the portion. It is generous and healthily portioned with a small bowl filled to the brim, and I was full leaving there nevertheless. However, it isn't quite what I look for when I go out to eat Breakfast\/brunch. Maybe it's an American thing, but I love to get a giant serving of breakfast when I go out to eat! I'd rather pay a couple more bucks per dish to make that happen. Bruce's Bowl was very affordable at $9-ish, but this is literally right next to Fleming's Steakhouse, so I would say that they would be better off charging $11 or $12 and giving more food.
