This is the first West Elm in Phoenix, and it is right in Uptown Plaza next to Creamistry! I came here for the store's opening party, and what a blast. The furniture is contemporary but bright and colorful, and though I've been to multiple locations in NY and California, this one has to be my favorite. I'm a huge fan of West Elm for their distinct styles and pieces, but this particular location had a whole shelf dedicated to local artists. I could find art pieces by Paige Poppe and wooden cacti earring holders that I thought I could only purchase at Bunky's. In addition, there's a DIY air plant area. I was the first person to try it! I picked out my vase and put soil, my two succulants, and white rocks all around it. It felt super fun and zen to do it, and any customer can make a custom one if they want to. The staff was super friendly. I understand it was their first day, so even if I had a question they couldn't answer, they always came back to find me to answer it once they asked someone else. Finally, their giveaway for the night was a tote by Paige Poppe. I believe this is still available for purchase, and it is just super cute and super Phoenix. Overall, I have to give my hats off to this particular West Elm as they definitely know how to target their customers. I can't not love a store that supports local artists and has a DIY air plant area - that's just too cool to hate on.
