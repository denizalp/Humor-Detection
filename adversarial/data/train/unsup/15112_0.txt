I avoid flying US Airways at all costs.  I have had a sub-par experience every time i have flown.  The employees are never very helpful for friendly, they always load the plane too quickly and back everyone up way into the jet way.  They always run out of bin space and force you check your carry ons and the plans are always fairly dirty\/out of shape.  This past trip, we were stuck on the plane for an additional 30 minutes after the plane landed (part of this was without power in the Vegas heat).  The staff told us that they were having trouble lining up the jetway with the plane.  I have NEVER not had a problem when flying US Airs!  Fly Southwest.  ..at least they are friendly!
