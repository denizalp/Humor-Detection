The Butter Fish is one hell of a dish. 5 mother stars! \n\nWe tried various appetizers and I do not plan on ordering any of them again. I was particularly disappointed with the lobster potstickers because they were so overrated! I'd say the appetizers are in the edible 3 stars category.\n\nI ordered an old fashioned and it was terrible. I'm guessing their bartenders are not real bartenders but some random staff? The old fashioned is the most basic and one of the oldest drink so I'd think a restaurant like Roy's wouldn't get it wrong. Hence, I will rate them as a 1 star in this category.\n\nThe service was standard and around 4 stars because our waiter was on his game with all our dishes. \n\nI'd definitely come here again for the Butter Fish. Nothing else, just him.
