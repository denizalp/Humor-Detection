The new owners have done a fantastic job of saving the memory of this classically weird Tempe hangout.  The main 'barn' retains all the kitschy crap that made Minders so different (and somehow they cleaned off 40 years' worth of dust the stuff had accumulated).  The rest of the property has been modernized with new bar areas, two nice patios, more bathrooms (yea!) and a 2-story buffer between McClintock road.   Bummer tho - no more sand volleyball!  This is clearly a labor of love for the new owners!  I spent a whole beer just wandering around, remembering the old, and checking out the new.  \nThe place has lots of areas still under construction during the daytime, and therefore only opens at 4:00.  They only opened on the 18th of October, so some of the staff aren't quite up to speed, and the service wasn't great.  I expect that'll change once they're 'officially' open.
