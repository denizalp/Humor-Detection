Echoing the sentiments of many before me, ignore any of this \"the New Golf Game\" crap. It's a farce. Launch USED to be a super innovative approach to the driving range, with a well-manicured grid helping golfers to improve distance and accuracy training in a new exciting way.\n\nNow it looks like it should be condemned, it's falling apart and has basically being left to die. Much like when explorers visit Jurassic Park years after the disaster at the original park you can see sparks of what once made this a premium facility.\n\nThe caveat here is that they still charge one of the highest prices per hour of any driving range in the 905 or 416. The trade off is you ONLY pay per hour and it's unlimited balls. \n\nIt's sad I remember when this place was new and it was all the \"range\"... get it? Sadly when we were paying our bill and we asked about the grid system the guy working the desk even said \"yeah, it hasn't been like that in like 8 years, just badly maintained now). If your staff are saying that... well, then I don't need to say anything else.
