You can't go just once to Chino.  It just doesn't work that way.  Your first time there they'll walk you though the whole process and let you sample all the different flavors they have of meat and even rice and beans.  You're thinking - wow this is great - free appetizers.  Oh no.  What really just happened is \"they got you\". Oh yes.  Because no matter how good your food was, you'll be wondering... Hmmm... I wonder how that would have been as a burrito?  Or, wow, that other one might have been fun as a quesadilla.  Or, wow, I didn't realize I'd burn my mouth on that, maybe next time I won't try to look like a big dog in front of the honeys.  Something like that.\n\nKids love going to Chino.  The giant panda bandito statue is meant to be climbed on and loved.  They have a kids menu too - which is so important. \n\nSue, the location kinda looks like a hole in the wall, but who doesn't love hole in the wall places???
