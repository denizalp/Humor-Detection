I have been to La Palapa twice, an intimate and unassuming little place that serves the most exquisite Mexican food that will ever grace your day. From the home made chips and salsa through the taco and burrito plates, I doubt you will find such tasty and authentic food anywhere in Pixburgh. An additional treat is the fresh fruit beverage concocted everyday, at least in the summer. If you are served by Alberto, you are in good hands. I would think that the great dining here would could only be matched by being a guest at a dinner at a friend's home in Juarez or Tijuana. It's that authentic and that good. In fact, stop reading now and head on to the SousSide for the fish tacos or the potato flautas. Thank  me later.
