I gave two stars only because we didn't actually eat any of the food. This is simply a customer service review. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, the food is probably excellent. Sadly, the hostess was so incredibly rude and uninviting, the mood was ruined before we even met the server. \n\nUpon our arrival (party of 2), I asked to see a menu. 20 minutes later we had still not been acknowledged. 4 other groups came came and we're seated as we stood there, looking toward the hostesses expectantly. After quite some time the hostess stared at me, I suppose waiting for me to greet myself. No 'Hello' no 'may I help you?' Finally a curt 'have you been helped?' to which we responded 'no'. The hostess brusquely grabbed two menus, didn't ask whether we were expecting more people, didn't ask whether we wanted a booth or a table (every other patron was offered their preference) and stated FOLLOW ME. She literally threw our menus down on a booth passing by, didn't stop to await us take our seats, didn't introduce or even mention our server or anything. Simply threw our menus down on the table and left, not a word spoken. We didn't remain there long enough to meet our server, which is unfortunate because I was really hoping to have a nice meal there. I will not return.
