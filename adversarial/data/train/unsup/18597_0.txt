It took me a while to bring myself to stop by this place.  From the outside it looks questionable.  I finally went for a splurge on my bday this year and dove into their huge apple fritter.  I go into a sugar coma afterwards but I don't care, it's way too good - so soft and crunchy and appley all at the same time.  I stop by every once in a while when I'm feeling naughty.  The only other thing I've tried was the croissant ham & egg bfast sandwich... it makes a great hangover bfast.\n\nI'd recommend bringing cash though, they charge for using cc.  About $10 bucks covers everything the hubs and I want including drinks.
