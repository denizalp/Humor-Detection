As you can see in my reviews I really enjoy BBQ. We decided to stop in and try it. Had the Brisket. It was Amazing. Also tried the 3 Rib plate. Ribs had a lot of meat on them and you could really taste the smoke. This location smokes the meat right on site. Tasted so fresh. Then to top it off. Ummm ya, free ice cream. Lol give this place a try. Did I mention free ice cream. Lol \n\nWife had the Turkey. I tried it and could taste the smoke in it. I ended eating the rest of hers also. Ahahaha
