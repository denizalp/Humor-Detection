They do not deserve a single penny of your hard earned money people! This piss poor of a company deserves NO stars and not one positive comment. Please do yourself the favor of avoiding massive frustration with a moving company and find a less hassling alternative to shipping your belongings. The fact that they call themselves \"Executive\" is a damn joke. They are nothing but an executive scam. Karen White. Absolute Scam. She will sweet talk you til your reservation and deposit are secured and once your belongings are picked up, all of a sudden she is no longer the point of contact and it is now some low class, no shits given ASHLEY ROYBAL. And she is the absolute most unprofessional, classless, business ignorant human being I have ever had the disgrace of encountering. \nEvery review is completely telling the truth. This company is shit. They bump up the original price quote, take over 30 days to deliver your belongings, and do it all with no remorse, and the worst level of customer care and service I have ever experienced. They don't deserve a penny of your hard earned money. You will have the most aggravating time trying to get in touch with Ashley Roybal, and once the driver has your belongings (which they switch drivers out in Vegas so whoever picks up your things will not be the same person who drops it off, go figure) they become a double taking, two timing, slime ball of a so called business. Don't even think twice about giving them your valuable time and money. Please find a better business to move your valuables with!
