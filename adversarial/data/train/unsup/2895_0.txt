This place is horrible. The line to get in is super long, and the staff there are a bunch of stuck up pricks. They make you feel smaller just because they take care of the place. You need to realize that without the people who pay to be there, you wouldn't have a job at all.\n\nI walked through the first couple of securities fine, until I was just about to walk in, this one guy said I need to change shorts or I can't come in. I had to go all the way back and BUY new shorts. Thanks bud.\n\nWe went to se Hardwell on labor weekend Sunday. The pool is disgusting, I saw beer cans, huge plastic straws, and band aids floating everywhere. There should be a limit to how many are allowed it there, no room to sit, stand, walk or swim. \n\nThe concept would be great if they just had a tab on how many people should be let in. I didn't even bother going to the bar, it was a hectic free-for-all. Drink prices, oh man. You're better off drinking before and maybe grabbing a beer inside. \n\nI won't be coming back to this place.
