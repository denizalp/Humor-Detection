I had my brows microbladed by Maria and it has been such a life changing experience! Having gone through multiple rounds of chemo plus having TTM since I was young, I have very little brow hair left. I had thought about getting my eyebrows tattooed on for years but was always so afraid they would look like bad Sharpie marks. So when I found out there was a semi-permanent and natural-looking alternative I started doing my research. Maria was amazing in taking the time during the first visit to ensure we got the right shape. Even though I draw my brows on everyday, I still could not get the right shape. She stenciled them on before to make sure I liked the way they looked. Once I gave her the OK, the microblading began. She numbed the area which made my pain almost next to nothing. This part goes by pretty fast and voila, you're done! I HAD EYEBROWS!!! This may seem silly to the average person, but for someone like me who can't leave the house without putting on a full face of makeup just to feel like a human, this is HUGE! It is such a crazy feeling that when I take my makeup off for the day I still have brows. When I wake up I have brows. I can go swimming and still have brows. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MARIA!!! You did such an amazing job! She even followed up with me afterwards and helped with any questions I had after. I was in extreme need of brow help, but even if you just want perfect brows without the daily maintenance and hassle, seriously think about microblading!
