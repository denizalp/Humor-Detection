Recently experienced by way of catering, a meal that managed to impress both colleagues and sponsors by way of healthy, fresh fare plus a bevy of Desserts, it was finally on Saturday that a visit was paid to Bronze Café at the Market, renovation to the shopping area doing nothing to diminish the quality of food or service in a place that undoubtedly qualifies for \"hidden gem\" status in Downtown Las Vegas.\n\nNow the center of operations for Bronze Café since late-2016, the Restaurant's time at The Center coming to an end some nine months ago, it was just prior to 10am that staff was found along a lengthy counter, a variety of races and sexes represented not only by the employees but diners seated indoors or on the outside patio.\n\nToqued by Peter Bastien and managed by David Mozes, the Café's focus on Vegan or Vegetarian options accommodating health-conscious clientele while certainly not skimping on splurge-worthy options for those so inclined, it was with eyes on Weekend Brunch and new selections from the Pastry case that dine-in choices were made to go with several Pastries for take-away, a great cup of Cold Brew Coffee served over Ice sipped slowly while waiting for the Entrée. \n\nPlaying low-volume Pop overhead, a Television and Library both also available to pass the time, it was after roughly self-plating a wedge of Vegan Pie from its plastic Clamshell that first bites of the day were taken, a Crust which is expectedly dry given the lack of Lard or Butter still doing an admirable job of holding up to thinly sliced Apples while Carrot \"Cake\" eats more like a Granola Bar than Dessert but still achieves great results by way of dried Fruit and Nuts plus plenty of Spices and natural sweetness.\n\nHaving already discussed most of the Pastries in previous writings, a Jalapeno Scone doing a remarkable job of showing the ingredient without scorching the palate, it was also in a second style of Monkey Bread and Cheesecake each made with Almonds that new items were tasted, the later particularly delicious even when compared to May's Double Chocolate version and as creamy as any in town despite being 100% Vegan.\n\nPriced comparably to any of DTLV's best casual spots despite using mostly Organic ingredients, the full array of Salads and Sandwiches available from open to close, it was after perhaps ten minutes of careful preparation and plating that Bronze Café's Vegan Fried Chicken and Beignets was served, the fact that Wheat Gluten Protein is likely not everyone's textural \"Cup of Tea\" rendered moot by a crisp and oilless exterior plus flavor not far from real Chicken while the Beignets are a bit flatter than some, but still nicely textured and far less greasy than the versions served beneath a mountain of Powdered Sugar at World-famous Café du Monde.
