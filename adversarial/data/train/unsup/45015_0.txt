I recently stopped by to celebrate a birthday with a group of 7 and our waitress was great. \nWe had several orders with various changes and all of our orders were correct.\n\nWhen we arrived for our 6pm dinner and the dining room had a lot of availability; however, within the hour, the tables filled up due to the games that were on that evening.\n\nGreat location with meeting people, with easy find.\n\n-Wally
