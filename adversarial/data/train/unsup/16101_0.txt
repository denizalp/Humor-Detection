Who knew there was a Wildlife Habitat in the middle of the Strip? I didn't!\n\nBeer, Washington Apples, shots, beers, and then we ended up at the Zoo????????? hahahaha.... I was falling all over the place and laughing my ass off. \n\nI was like WHOA! Where are we? \nBitches! You guys took me out of Vegas!!!!\nAre we in SD? San Diego Zoo?\nhahahahahaha... \n\nThere were Flamingos, swan, tiny headed birdies, cute but weird ducks, and huge coi fish. Eventually I realized we were at the Flamingo hotel since I kept seeing the Flamingos.\n\nIt was nice to sit outside in the cool air at 5am, drink more beer, and then walk around and see the animals. It's better to see the animals during the daytime though. Oh! There's a waterfall too!\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo!
