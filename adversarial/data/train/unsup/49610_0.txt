I went here based on yelp reviews.  Summary:  Cheap, quick meal with the same concept and price as Chipotle but enchilada style.  You pick flour or corn, what type of fill, what kind of sauce, cheese, toppings, etc.  They heat it up for you and you are good to go.  \n\nHere are the issues I encountered:  I went here with a friend and we had no idea how to get started so we kept reading the chalkboard(s) to figure it out.  The first person on the assembly line was extremely rude asking questions as if she was annoyed.  Can't she freaking tell we have never been here before and we have no idea what the hell we are doing?  Then, the next person - same thing.  The guy asked me what type of sauce, what cheeses, toppings, etc and seemed annoyed.  Last position - the cashier.  We had asked for the meal \"to go\" as I usually expect to not eat my whole meal even though we were planning to eat there. I tell her that we plan to eat there even though we ordered \"to go\" and she too had this annoyed look on her face.  \n\nMy friend and I started talking about what just happened.  He asks, \"Was it just me or did it seem like they were annoyed with us?\"  We then start watching the assembly line with other customers that came in after us to see if it was something with \"us\" or in general.  So of course, the first batch of customers walk up the assembly line.  The worker starts asking the customers if they have ever been (and they have not). She starts explaining how it works, etc.  So it was a completely different treatment.    \n\nThe food was ok.  They could of heated the enchilada a little bit longer.  However, based on the customer service, me thinks not.
