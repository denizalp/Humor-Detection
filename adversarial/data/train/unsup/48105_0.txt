It was good to locate these guys again... I thought they were gone forever when they disappeared from the  Alma School and Baseline area. I went in and it seemed a lot like the old shop. Slightly updated.  Odd that they are right down from Freedom board shop but hey if it works great. I wondered around and was treated good from the start. I purchased a hat which was a much more pleasant experience than going to Zumiez or Tillys in which I cannot stand due to the lack of respect from any employee in either one of those stores, let alone being able to hear myself think with the blaring music...  Glad to see Action is still around after all.
