Yoga Factory Pittsburgh has a really prime location, especially with the juice bar being right next door. \nEveryone was very friendly, students and teachers. This was my first time trying bikram yoga, and I feel as if everyone was very welcoming at the studio.\nThe facility is clean throughout (including locker rooms and bathrooms). \nI would definitely recommend giving it a shot!\n$2 towel rental and $1 yoga mat rental if you happen to leave yours at home.
