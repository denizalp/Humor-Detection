I have something to admit... I'm not obsessed with bacon like everyone else is. There, I said it. But... I do love Bakn! \n\nThe Cheddar Burger is probably one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh. The meat in the patty is excellent quality, cooked perfectly. The other thing I love about Bakn is how fresh everything is. Even down to the arugula dressed on the burger. Speaking of arugula, their salads are also great. They have this house made lemon dressing that's killer. I've had both the salmon salad and salmon quinoa and again, fresh and tasty.\n\nIf I were to have my perfect meal here I'd get the burger and then the salted caramel cheesecake. Dear lord that thing is good. It comes in a huge mason jar and definitely needs to be shared! It's delicious at every layer. The whipped cream, the caramel, the cheesecake and then the homemade graham cracker crust. Hmmmmmmmm. \n\nRecounting how many great meals I had here makes me realize I've visited quite a bit! I only had one miss, which was the pork belly reuben. The pork was pretty tough, so it was hard to chew through the whole sandwich. But everything else is so great, it was probably an off day. \n\nWait, can I add the bloody mary too? Because theirs is the perfect mix of spice. So maybe you'll just have to go back a couple times! Rest assured, if you love the bacon, you'll love it and if you don't, you'll be just fine!
