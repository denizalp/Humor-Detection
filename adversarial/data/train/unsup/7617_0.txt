Really thankful for Yelp to leading me to a good PHX dentist! The staff is friendly, they took my insurance (I know, I know, that's mostly luck, but still) and my appointments have started exactly on time. I made it very clear I needed to be out in an hour to make it to work on time one day and they happily worked with my schedule. I'd be quick to recommend this group.
