What a relief to find something somewhat healthy in this food court.  With a name like Tropical Smoothie i was expecting to find a slew of smoothies on the menu, and nothing else, similar to Jamba.  This place, however, had sandwiches and wraps.\n\nI had a wrap and a smoothie.  Both the wrap and the smoothie were good but not memorable.  The smoothie was really cold and I remember getting a headache after my first few sips, but it went away fast and I learned how to drink it comfortably.\n\nConsidering that the restaurants aren't very good at this resort, and that typical fast food is plain bad for you, I would highly recommend this place if you were stranded at Red Rock.
