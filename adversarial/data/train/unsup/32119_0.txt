Great place! I loved their food. Pricy but worth it. The owner are from Taiwan China too. The only problem I had was that it was a little hard to park on the weekend. The restaurant does not have a parking lot, and the lot next to it is private. We had to park up the hill and walk a little bit to get to the place. After all, it was worth it! I highly recommend it!
