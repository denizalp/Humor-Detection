Excellent service, decent banh mi sandwich with chicken, and one of the best boba milk teas I have had in the Valley!  \n\nWhen I walked in, the gentleman behind the counter asked me how my day was going.  He seemed sincere, which was nice!  We exchanged some pleasantries before I ordered...  and then I got down to business.  It was lunch time, I was in a hurry, and I knew what I wanted (other than asking which drink was their signature milk tea -- more on that in a moment). \n\nI ordered the Vietnamese chicken sandwich (it's a banh mi with all of the usual suspects as toppings).  It was packed with chicken and toppings, but the sauce that was on the chicken was not my favorite.  I would have rather just had lightly seasoned grilled chicken on it... but the toppings were all fresh and tasty!\n\nThe Royal Milk Tea is their signature black tea without added flavors (because I like it best when it's simple and a leeeeetle bit healthier).  With added boba, the 24oz size was still reasonably priced and I'm sipping it and loving on it still a couple hours later!  Fantastic!  And if flavors are your thing, then Urban Boba Tea House has you covered - many many flavors to make that drink the way you like it!\n\nI will DEFINITELY be back!  \n\n*****FIVE STARS*****
