As good as it can get. The atmosphere of the restaurant is hip and modern. The service is pretty good. Your table gets assigned a group of servers and they all coordinate to provide good service. However, their food was just amazing. Their speciality is steak. I ordered the kobe steak and it was delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and full of flavor. This dish comes with mashed potatoes which were also pretty good. I wished there was more potato as the dish needed a larger side. For our appetizer we ordered some tuna which was fresh and delicious. Both items were very good but also small. This is definitely a great restaurant if you are craving a good quality steak.
