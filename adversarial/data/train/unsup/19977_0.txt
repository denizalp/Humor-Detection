Upon arrival I was told to remove my hat, which I totally respect. They told me to leave my hat behind a curtain and it would be safe. While inside, I noticed a few people with hats which was really just an added frustration. When we went to leave the hat was gone and the bouncers claimed nobody went back by the curtain and then ignored any further questions. Ok... it happens, people steal things that are left unattended. On our way out a group of girls grabbed my girlfriend's purse and tried to walk away with it. Luckily she had it around her shoulder and neck. When confronting them they punched her in the face drawing blood. I have lived in SouthEnd and NoDa for 6 years and have never felt so violated. Maybe it isn't specifically the fault of Oak Room, but this is a preview of the type of people who frequent this place. Something to consider before spending a weekend night there.
