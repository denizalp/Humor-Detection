BEWARE THE GRAVEYARD MENU.  Typically I have a great meal and time at shucks. living close by I have been there quite a few times. Last night a buddy and I shared some fried clam strips and peel and eat shrimp. When the clams arrived the first thing I thought was \"what the hell is this?\" I have never seen clams that were almost 5 inches long. Was very unsettling, but I thought to myself, \"who am I? I don't know if maybe these are different from every other clam I've eaten, so what the heck\" tasted OK, were very chewy, I still wasn't convinced these were actual clams, but kept eating.  About 5 hours later I woke up with stomach cramps, proceeded to vomit all of the food I had eaten, and dry heaved for another hour or so while I began to become feverish. I lost a day of work and needless to say they have lost a customer.\n\nThe plus side of the story is that my buddy did not get sick, I checked with him but apparently he did some heavy drinking afterwards so not sure if that affected his toxicity levels.
