2nd time trying Koi Salamanca Ramen House. I've ordered tonkatsu ramen and my boy friend ordered vegetarian tonkatsu ramen.  ramen portions are pretty generous and they came with 2 thick pieces of Pork belly but it has a weird taste to it. soup base is saltier than the house tonkatsu ramen but it's just right for me. The egg is a bit over cooked so the yolk is not runny anymore and it's cold.
