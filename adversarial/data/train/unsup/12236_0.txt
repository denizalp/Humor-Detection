I'm not sure what all the hype was about, but this place was definitely overpriced, rather bland, and what is with the wait on the line to get seated, to order,  to get your food?!\n\nAlrighty. 2 stars. \n\nI applaud them on their seating system. If you're a party of 3 or more, you stand in one line,  if you are a party of 2 or less, you're in another. The turnover for 2 or less is much faster. Don't be crabby. It's a long wait.\n\nService is friendly,  kind of slow because it seems like they give 1 server what feels like 10 tables. It's probably because everyone gets seated at the same time, get their food at the same time, and leave at the same time. It was a long wait to have the server come take our order, to get our food, and to get our check. \n\nFood in itself, don't get the truffle fries. I love truffle fries.  This was regular fries with what appears to be a drop of truffle mist on the fries. It was more parmesan fries than anything else. The ketchup and garlic sauce was good. I can't even remember what burger I got. It wasn't memorable, but I took a picture of it. \n\nLastly, not sure on what the theme is, but why are all the female staff required to wear a hideous skin tight one piece dress that barely covers their crotch? All women are beautiful.  Please don't subject your female staff to wear a hideous uniform that hugs all the wrong places.
