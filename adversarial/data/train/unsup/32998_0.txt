Must try! The corn hushpuppies are AMAZING!!!  The BBQ Sammy w\/ slaw, bomb shniggety!!!!!  Chef John makes his own pickles and makes them right...soooo good.  We found them parked out in front of Velveteen Rabbit, Downtown on Main, on a Saturday night. What a great pairing. Order food, and then go in for a yummy cocktail.
