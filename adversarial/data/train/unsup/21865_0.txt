When I grow up I want my basement to look just like this place! The lounge is like something you'd see in Vegas, and it's not your Tempe beer bar so make sure you have $$. They have three levels of liquor from all over the world (they need a library ladder to get some of it), large tele's, ash trays that are 100% marble and weight 50 pounds, and nice leather couches. It's a drive from south Phoenix but always worth it. \n\nGet here soon because it's the last of the big boy hang outs until the f'n liberals of this state make it so people can't even fart in public (they're in litigation as we type). Where's the world coming to when you can't even smoke in a CIGAR BAR!
