Today is one of those days where I was in such a hurry to enjoy the outdoors that I forgot something important. It was my belt.\n\nBy the time I got to Peet's Coffee it was apparent that I forgot to wear my belt. Then by the time I left Peet's it was apparent that I was going to have to buy a belt.\n\nJust up Town Center Boulevard where Peet's is, there is a relatively new shopping center featuring TJ Maxx, Burlington Coat Factory, and Stein's. These three softline retailers that sell belts.\n\nAt the same time that this was kind of an emergency, I was not up to spending Macy's prices on a belt. My intention was to purchase an inexpensive belt that I would put on immediately then keep in my trunk to prevent a future repeat situation. Evidently TJ Maxx was the wrong choice. They feature a paltry selection of belts. Despite the fact that this is supposed to be a discount softlines retailer, their belt prices are in the Macy's price range. $50 for a Calvin Cline belt!? Cmonn! There prices started off at $14.99. In this situation, I was foolish to be picky. However, their limited selection of belts failed to include a size 34 or 36.\n\nBased on their belt selection, I am so not impressed. Good thing for competition. After leaving the retailer, I'd walk a few doors down to Burlington Coat Factory where I picked up a size 34 belt for $9.99 and ditched an awkward situation.
