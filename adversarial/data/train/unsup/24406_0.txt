And so, my 200th review takes place.  And what a place to review.\n\nI found this place by pure accident.  I mean, who actually goes inside the Neonopolis anymore?\n\nNo, I was in Insert Coins meeting the founder of Intellivision (long story) last night when I saw this guy with a \"Toy Shack\" shirt on, talking about them being featured on \"Pawn Stars\", they just opened....\n\n\"Where are you guys located\", I asked, not expecting the forthcoming answer.\n\n\"The Neonopolis\", he replied.\n\n\"What, here\", I asked incredulously, which in retrospect was silly, as how many empty places do we have called \"Neonopolis\" in town?\n\nSo after my jaunt, I went.\n\nThey just opened last Sunday, and they said they only have 20% of their stuff out as of this writing, but I heard the angels sing as I stood in their doorway.\n\nActually, a better description of seeing this place for the first time is: How many of you remember that old Daffy Duck cartoon where he saw the genie treasure, got that crazy look in his eye, then proceeded to shove people out of the way screaming \"Go!  Go!  Go!  Down!  Down!  Down!  Mine!  Mine!  Mine!  MUHUAHAHAH!!!\"\n\nI'm not saying I was that bad, but it started growing the longer I stayed in there.\n\nThe place is colorful as can be, and even not fully done, they are wall to wall toys already, and some of it I was getting twitchy for, as it was already a virtual tour of my childhood.  And no, I'm not telling you what I liked in case I want to buy it later.  THERE'S my \"Daffy Duck Moment\".\n\nThe two guys running it were SUPER nice.  Very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Of course, I'd imagine that it's easy to be pleasant when you work in a business based around fun.  I took a liking to the manager (Boyd) and his co-worker immediately, warning them that I am going to simultaneously love and hate them for this place.  They seemed okay with that.  Sadly, so did I.\n\nApparently, they have their \"Grand Opening\" on September 5.  I can only imagine what this place is going to look like when fully stocked, and how much trouble this place is going to get me into.\n\nAnd while G.I. Joe was not my usual toy of choice as a kid, seeing that 7 foot long aircraft carrier (one of the Holy Grails of being a kid in the 1980's) still in box....  These guys are already taking the kid gloves off for awesome.\n\nDamn it.  Just... damn it.  My wallet weeps.
