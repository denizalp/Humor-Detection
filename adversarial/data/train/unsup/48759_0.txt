Have been reading reviews of Charlotte's Chuy's.  A lot of the reviewers seem amused or perplexed by the decor.  Taken out of its historical context, the interior is completely obnoxious.  I've been eating at the original location in Austin TX since 1988.  It's been around since 1982.  The original location is even funkier, catering to the UT college student. It may seem a bit cheesy these days but back in the 80s the decor was revolutionary.  The new restaurants still pay homage to the original. \nTheir menu is best  if you avoid the standard Tex Mex dishes.  Try the stuffed sopapilla, chicken Chuychanga, 911 plate, crispy baja fish tacos, chicken flautas, deluxe chicken enchiladas. In general, their sauces are king.  Find a sauce you like and try pairing it with different dishes. The menu is deeper and more satisfying than it might appear at first glance. \nAnd I agree, their beans have always been sub par, the borracho beans are a bit better.
