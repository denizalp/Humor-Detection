Jerk chicken - nice people. It's Caribbean food joint that doesn't stick to tradition, but doesn't get too crazy with the fusion either. It's a delicious equator mix that doesn't exist anywhere else in Calgary (as far as I know.) - all at a very approachable price point. Of course you're going to want to wash that tasty food down with a beer, and they've got a small selection of Village brews.\n\nIt's a good place to go for a casual dinner and they've got table service. I don't think the feel of the place really suits the food. But I also think there's a certain authenticity that comes with having a space that hasn't been decorated to the 9's around some sort of a theme. I see myself ordering a huge amount of takeout coming from here in the future.
