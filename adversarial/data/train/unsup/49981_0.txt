A friend and I are sushi hoppers - we may have found permanent sushi delight in Tsuki Japanese!  We went on a Friday night, early (before Pens game early).  We were concerned because the place looked deserted and went in anyway, armed with our BYOB wine.\n\nDefinite remnants of Mexican decor. Very clean, not modern, but not shabby - well tended.\n\nThen we got our first order of sushi and it was fantastic!  So fantastic that we ordered a total of (4) rolls...  each roll had (8) generous pieces - and we declared each to be our favorite!  Cannot wait to go back.  If you're looking for great sushi, don't wait--
