Completely disappointed and dissatisfied with the terrible customer service. Flight 1293 5:30 pm to MDW 7\/19\/18 at gate C3 LAS. Angelica the gate agent was not at the gate and the door to the plane was completely unattended for 3 minutes or more. When I saw her at the bottom of the gate she was extremely rude and spoke in a completely unacceptable manner. I didn't expect to experience this level of poor behavior from Southwest Airlines. Perhaps I have unrealistic expectations for this airline and this is just the level of customer experience to be expected and consistent with SWA. It's a shame, my suggestion is to take a different airline for all that prefer good manners from airline employees.
