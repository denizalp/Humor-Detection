I got a recommendation from a friend about this place because she bought a coupon on groupon and tried it. She told me this was amazing and now that I've tried it for myself, this is the best damn cookie I've ever had! And I bake all the time! Not only that, it's only open at night??! Omgosh I love this place. Don't really like how long the delivery takes, but the cookies are definitely worth the wait. ;)
