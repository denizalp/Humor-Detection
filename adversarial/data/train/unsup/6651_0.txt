Maybe I have an abnormally high expectation of customer service, but this place really got my blood boiling. PItt's Dogg'n It doesn't, in fact, have anything to do with hotdogs. Okay, that's fine. But if I had to force you to take five seconds out of your precious phone conversation to tell me that, then there's a serious problem. And when you didn't in fact audibly say the word \"No,\" when I asked you, \"Do you have any hot dogs,\" and instead mouthed the word \"no,\" then we have an even more serious problem. I was in the store for about 15 minutes looking around. On top of that, I made a transaction. Did the guy helping me get off the phone once? No. Did he greet me, ask me to sign my receipt, tell me to have a good day, utter the tiniest of annoyance in my direction? No. In fact, when it came time to sign my receipt, he pantomimed signing with a pen all while talking loudly on the phone. \n\nIf you can't even be bothered to get off the phone and greet the people who are spending money in your establishment then, frankly, you don't deserve any of my own or anyone else's money. \n\nLearn how to run a damn business or at least employ people that will show your business in a decent light.
