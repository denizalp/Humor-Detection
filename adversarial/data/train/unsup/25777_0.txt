Worst customer service ever !!!! I understand I came in pretty late but Matt didn't give me any kind of help at all. He was rude and unkind , I honestly feel he should probably think about getting a new job because his attitude really sucks. He is the true definition of why sprint sucks in the first place. I ended going to two other sprint stores, only to have to get online and help my self.
