OMG!! The carnitas were out of this world they come served with a freshly made corn tortilla grits and a black bean paste the pork was soooo tender and savory but also had some crispy pieces mixed in also. The service was prompt and the wait staff plus the manager came over and asked if everything was good I couldn't be happier A MUST EAT PLACE IN VEGAS!! WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!!!!
