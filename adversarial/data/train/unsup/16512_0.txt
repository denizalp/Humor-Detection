Best Tip, Bring Goggles or stay out of the pool\n\nProbably will not be coming here again. Comparing this to Encore Beach Club is Night and Day. The pool was so dirty. I mean I understand everyone sweats in the pool but the pool was so TRASHY. You can get hurt stepping on beer cans and shit. They did not have enough towels and some bars even ran out of ice. Are you kidding me? Pool was medium size, however I prefer the four small pools at Encore. Life guards were w.e. Crowd was majority caucasian. \n\nThere was a dude in a borat swimsuit with his Whang and Nutsake hanging loose. Why have they not kicked him out. \n\n-1 Entertainment Tax on things like Red Bulls which were like 9 dollars a pop (WTF?)\n\nTax\nTip\nand entertainment tax on a red bull. Time to just sneak in multiple flasks. \nDid I mention there was three lines? The security pretty much went through my whole wallet and probably event counted the money to make sure nothing was in there... but he didnt even check my pockets. I guess hiding things in plain sight would be too obvious. \n\n-1 people are immature as hell here, splashing ERRWHERE, god damn, your eyes are going to be closed half the time. I get splashing but this dude took his beer tub container and was going crazy with it.
