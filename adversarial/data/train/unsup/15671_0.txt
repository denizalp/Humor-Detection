Extraordinarily vibrant, colorful, well choreographed show!!!\n\nAttended on the heels of the unfortunate KA death of acrobat just 2 nights prior. Stage has unique angles. Delicate and sensitive homage to the Beatles and key songs.\n\nEnjoyed all of the color. Neat little effect with theater transformed into a billowy cloud, with illusion that a bed was floating atop it.  Rollerbladers were a delight! Some actually squealed in the audience!\n\nDancers are amazing. This performance, like Elvis Cirque (now concluded) is more dance and song than acrobatics. See Mystere or Ka or O for more athleticism.\n\nRight amount of everything. Being as old as I am, appreciated seeing interpretation of so many songs.\n\nLast act and dance was so fun!
