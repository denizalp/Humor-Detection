This is a good place if you want to chill, have some coffee and use their WiFi. The food is decent, too. They're also super bike friendly, which is a high point for me. My only annoyance with it is that they seldom carry any Splenda-type or other non-sugar sweetener for their coffee, so I usually either just have to take it home to add that in or remember to pack my own. Either way, cute place, good bike rack, decent coffee and food and they have WiFi.
