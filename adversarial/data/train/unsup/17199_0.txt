Walking into this location I felt the decor was much more welcoming and suitable than its sister location at First Markham Place.  It didn't have that OPEN emptiness and pretentious feel.\n\nThe SERVICE was just as good as their sister location, which isn't really a COMPLIMENT unfortunately and if it was some impatient unsatisfiable customer they would definitely be in a contest with the wait staff to see WHO can piss who off more.\n\nTip #1 - The service bell can be HEARD by everyone in the restaurant except for the staff working here.  Simply wave to a wait staff and ask but DO NOT expect a response or smile however your request will be satisfied.\n\nThe Pork Bone Soup came out FAST and the portion size I'm quite happy about.  The MEAT was falling off the bone however in comparison to the soup of other places it lacked the additional seasoning but was still flavourful and spicy.\n\nThe Seafood Pancake was the last to come out and like the same item from other restos, it is just as DELICIOUS as ever and I will always order this wherever I go.\n\nThe Dolsot Bibimbap I'm just going to say it was nice.  I'm not much of a RICE person so I cannot comment on it extensively.  I have nothing bad to say about it at the same time its the same thing I've had anywhere else.\n\nThe Big Beef Rib(Kalbi) dish #46 (approx. $19) was tender and tasty however it was a bit out of the norm of my expectations for the same item.  This one was on a Hot Plate with 2 Rib Bones mostly meat removed and with Meat Chunks scattered on top.  \n\nI love seeing this dish at other restaurants with BIG pieces of meat ATTACHED to the RIB bone itself.  It also has a bit of a Soya Onion Sauce\/Slurry.  I think their sister location does it this method that is more common.  2 different methods but I love them all the same without bias.\n\nI have to say it was a BUSY place for a Tuesday night and we even saw guest waiting at the doorway which is nothing like their First Markham Place location could ever imagine.\n\nTIP #2 - They provide each guest with a glass of watered-down Tea which you'll drink often to clear your tastebuds from one dish to another however if you remember the service, you should ask for a TEA POT of Tea so you can serve yourselves rather than wait to get their attention and for them to take your cup inside to refill.\n\nWould I return? I probably would now that I have the KNOWLEDGE and ARSENAL to make my own experience more enjoyable.  Sometimes I just like to TORTURE myself but at the same time good service can be just as scary.
