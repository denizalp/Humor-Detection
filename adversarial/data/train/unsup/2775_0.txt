Would strongly recommend NOT coming here. \n\nValue: High price, low value. Came with a large party and was pretty much told that we were expected to get the five course set dinner. It was $55 per person + tax + 18% tip. I was thinking WOW five courses?! Big mistake! Several of the courses had to be shared - 3 plates for 10 people, I had no idea how to split it. This was also the first time I ever had to share a plate of papardelle with four people. \n\nFood: I'm not a food critic or picky eater, I'd say the food was average. Nothing special, definitely not worth the $$$$ I paid. \n\nAtmosphere: It looked like a shack on the outside and not much better inside. The music in the background wasn't bad, but it was so loud that I had to shout talking to the person sitting across from me. Bonus: There were FLIES everywhere. My friends and I caught about FIVE that night - one got stuck in the butter and two flew into our drinks. \n\nService: A bit arrogant - kept telling us how lucky we were able to get our table and how we got a great deal with the five course meal. Kept asking us if we wanted to order more, which was okay for the first two hour before I started wondering where the food in the kitchen was going.\n\nLast, but not least, it took almost four hours for all the food to come (we didn't eat slow, since each course was so small). Definitely not a good place for a date or chilling with someone that you have less than 10+ years of history with. \n\nCouldn't pay me to come here again. Life is short, I don't have another four hours to waste.
