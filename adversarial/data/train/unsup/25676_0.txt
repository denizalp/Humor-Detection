At first when we came in; it looked very spacious and the atmosphere was very clean and comfortable. The Xiao Long Bao was great, however the pan fried buns were a big disappointment, the steamed bun part was mushy and hardly crispy on the bottom. The Dan Dan soup noodles were watered down and was tasteless. We also had the Spicy Eggplant dish and was very greasy. We also have Pea shoots with garlic which was pretty good.
