we were comp'ed 2 buffet passes \/ 2 days and let's just say thank god they were comp'ed because:\n\ndinner:  food poisoned...  the source of food poisoning came from either the seafood or the undercooked prime rib, but either way, it was not pretty.  and what's even sadder is that the king crab leg and prime rib quality were SO poor compared to other buffets and on top of that i got food poisoned from it?  augh, steve wynn, what did i ever do to deserve this?\n\nbrunch:  terrible.  the food quality was just as poor as dinner.  my fish & chips were basically rubber.  and NOT worth the 1 hour wait.  they don't offer a separate line for hotel guests, which created a terrible customer experience.  we waited for 1 whole hour before we were seated for a terrible buffet. \n\nwe're not quite sure why everything looks SO good but tastes SO poor.  \n\nwe can't believe the amount of people who gets tricked into eating at the buffet @ the wynn...  it is THE buffet to avoid.
