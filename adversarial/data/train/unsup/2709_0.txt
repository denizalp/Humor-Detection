I've been drinking boba for the past 8 years. I've had some great boba and some very bad boba, and this place is LEGIT!\n\nI have a little brother and sister and I'm the cool older sister that gets them boba. (Our other sister is the queen of chicken fingers... not as cool.) I love that this place is super close to Green Valley where they live so I don't have to drive all the way out to Chinatown to get them good boba drinks.\n\nOne of the first things you'll notice are the strange cup shapes. The super size is more than 24 oz. and is like drinking out of a little bucket. \n\nPrices are AMAZING. Unless you're getting a bunch of add ins, your giant drink is going to be less than $4.50.\n\nThe shakes are great and I am partial to their unsweetened peach tea. I will eventually end up trying a bunch of stuff just because my brother and sister ask for boba every time I visit. (Boba shakedown.) \n\nThere's not a lot of seating, but there's definitely room for more seats if they wanted them. Oh well. Regardless, I will be back.
