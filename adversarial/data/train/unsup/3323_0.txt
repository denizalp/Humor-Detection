I spent $8.11 on two of the most DRY-A$$ cupcakes ever. \n\nEVER!\n\nWhen I say dry, I mean, when you take a plastic fork and cut across the frosting into the cake, you can feel a slight crunch as your fork goes down. I'm not kidding! I had the Kir Royale and Strawberry Shortcake, both looked enticing on display, with sparkly glitters on perfectly piped frosting and looking oh so beautiful behind the glass case. Both disappointed me.\n\nIt's like staring at that hot blonde chick walking oh so sexy in her tight white dress with 38DD boobies about to pop out and she sits down and you see her NUTS hanging.  (Trannie! Fierce!)\n\nWhat a waste.
