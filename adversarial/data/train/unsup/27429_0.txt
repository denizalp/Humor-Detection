We ordered for our Halloween party over a week in advance. Food was delivered on time however we got no BBQ Sauce and one cup of gravy to feed 40 people. My parents went to the location and was told they were out of gravy. They were given BBQ SAUCE AND A SORRY. ONLY reason they get a star is the food is amazing.
