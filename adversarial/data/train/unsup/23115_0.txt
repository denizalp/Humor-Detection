Yes, five stars for this popcorn place.  This spot is in my neck of the woods, but I never had any desire to check it out in the past.  But, in the past month, I've had gourmet popcorn from two other shops in town and it awakened the popcorn monster inside of me.  Uh oh.  I visited on a Sunday afternoon and I was greeted first by bins of taffy.  Unique flavors include maple bacon, cupcake, red velvet, cinnamon bun, cookie dough, and root beer, $2 a pound.  After choosing a couple from almost each bin, I made my way to the counter, where I proceeded to sample the popcorn.  I tried: sea salt caramel, Butterfinger, peanut butter chocolate, Puppy Chow, Cinnamon Toast, and kettle corn.  There are so many flavors available, but I got full.  I didn't even get to try half of what's available.  The kind young lady who helped me would disappear into the back and come back with my requests; I think she did it three times.  I finally settled on 4 \"mini\" bags:  cinnamon toast, kettle corn, peanut butter chocolate, and the sea salt caramel.  The \"mini\" size is approximately 3 cups, according to Popcorn Girl's pamphlet.  Four mini bags plus the bag of taffy came to $13.66, which I don't think is bad at all.  Guess where I'm going before I see my next movie in the theater?  Shhh, don't tell anyone.  You should come here and sample some tasty popcorn, too.  I'll be back!
