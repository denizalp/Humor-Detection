Generous owner just like in Tanger!\nGreat food, tea is amazing!\nYou have to try this place, atmosphere is great, don't forget to stare at the ceiling it's just like in Morocco.\nCouscous was rich with vegetable And fresh meat.\nBread was fresh, salad \"za3louka\" was delicious.\nIt's a unique place with rare food you won't be able to eat unless you travel a broad.\nKudos for opening such a place and serving amazing food.\nFrom your Tunisian Customer :)
