I love the flow of entering the arena and how there are very few times in general that you will end up bottlenecking. The sheer volume of workers and concession stands as well as drink\/food options was enough to win my heart.  There is rarely a wait more than 10 mins and you'll always be able to get a drink or snack between periods \/ intermission.  The prices were competitively priced for a arena and reasonable.  IE: mixed single shot cocktail for $18(?) and a double for $4 more, $8 giant box of buttery hot popcorn, $6 spicy garlic fries, etc.\n\nThe bathrooms are clean and there was always an attendant cleaning or stocking in the times that I went.  Stairs are a little steep on the upper level seats but that's my only gripe.  \n\nP.s.  No cup holders.
