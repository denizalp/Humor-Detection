Amazing. The food was delicious. The waiting staff and bartenders are warm, funny, and friendly. All around, this eatery is on point. Try the Fireball Wings.. the bomb. The pork shoulder sandwiches on pretzel bread makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The ahi tacos.. some of the best mini tacos I've tried. See you next time we visit Vegas for sure.
