When I first saw my finished hair, I wasn't totally happy with how it looked (the way it was blow dried made my head look a bit odd). But after I washed my hair I realized the actually cut was fantastic -- probably one of the best I've ever gotten.\n\nUsually it's the other way around: you look fabulous walking out of the salon, but no matter what you do, you can't get it to work when you style it at home.\n\nI'm definitely going to return here. But next time I'll be more specific with how I want it styled.\n\nAlso: they feed you delicious popcorn, which to me is a huge bonus.
