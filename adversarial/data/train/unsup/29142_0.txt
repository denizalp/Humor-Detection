It's really called Morning Glory Cafe.\nIt's on a farm that's all organic. My sister asked \"Do you think they spray for flies?\" but immediately noticed the incongruity.\n\nThe sausage at the breakfast place was really good.\n\nAn admin at Yelp needs to move these reviews over there. I give it a 5 mostly to counteract the one-star. Otherwise, I didn't pay, but I'd give it at least a 4 on taste.\n\nLook for the rest of the reviews for this place here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:YAbb2MOxdLvD4qkvlO7Wug\/src:search\/query:The%20Farm
