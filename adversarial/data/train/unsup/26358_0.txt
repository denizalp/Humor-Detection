I was in town to attend my graduation ceremony at GCU.  I paid around 160$-170$ per night for this hotel room. Rude receptionist Gabriel coldwell. The \"operational\" Manager Cassie lanagan  mad because few things didn't operate and I complained. And when I made my last complain she threaten to call the police. The sink drained slowly in our hotel bathroom. 2 out of 3 pools were dirty. My guest and I had issues with connecting to wifi.  We were told our floor, the 7th floor, was and exclusive floor because you have to access it with card for the room. We were able to get to the 7th floor using our hotel room card but was unable to get into our room with the same card, we tried both cards. Went down to the front desk and was yelled at by The above mention receptionist.
