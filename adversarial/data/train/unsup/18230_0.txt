Located in the middle of Monte Carlo Casino, Brand is easy enough to find :)  Although this is a typical upscale steak house it has Vegas style open seating meaning you can sit along a half wall and watch people go or have people watch you eat as they walk by, not my preference.  Fortunately there are more secluded booths farther back in the restaurant.\n\nDecorated in dark wood with dim lighting Brand certainly looks the part of \"steakhouse\" There is a full service bar and lounge area as well which showcases half priced apps and reduced drinks for Happy Hour.\n\nWe ordered the Prime Rib and added a lobster tail.  The normal cut 12 ounces was $35 and the lobster tail was an additional $25.  I ordered the large cut which was 16 ounces and cost $39.00.  The prime was tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, seasoned well and just darn Yummy.  Au Jus and creamy horseradish came along with the prime.  The lobster tail was about 6-8 ounces and also steamed perfectly.  Accompanied by melted butter, there was a hidden surprise inside the lobster tail shell was a cornbread type stuffing flavored with lobster bits.  The stuffing was scrumdelicious and made for a perfect bite paired with the sweet lobster.\n\nSides averaged $9-12 each and they had a special of 3 for $25. We tried the loaded potato, mushrooms and green beans.  The potato and mushrooms were good, but the green beans were way to \"Al Dente\" for us, our server swapped the beans out for creamed spinach.\nAll the sides were good and the mushrooms in particular were very good :)\n\nAlthough we didn't have room for desert, we did look at the menu and prices are only $10 per desert so don't worry about desert breaking the bank if you have room to order some.\nService was prompt and friendly without the \"attitude\" you sometimes receive in more expensive eateries.  I highly recommend trying Brand if you are looking for a good steakhouse in Vegas.  Brand has quality food and service and very reasonable prices to boot!
