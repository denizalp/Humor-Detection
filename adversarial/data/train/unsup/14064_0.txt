Ok first let me get this out of the way. I think the people that created this show have never done psychedelic or hallucinogenic drugs before. Bubbles? I can't believe people pay $100+ per ticket to watch the dancers on stage blow bubbles around. Glad we got free tickets for this.\n\nThis was not like other Cirque shows I've seen. It's mostly dancing. The females are ballerinas but done in a modern interpretive style, and the males are mostly artistical breakdancers. There are only a few Cirque type acts, and watching the aerial girls get tired after so much of the same.\n\nThere was not one single time I was holding my breath afraid a performer would fall and die.\n\nThere are speakers in the seat headrests that are way too loud and didn't sound good.\n\nThe stage is very small, so get a seat further in the back to see everything, but there ARE bad seats. We were all the way in the back in seat 1 and 2. You can't see when they come out. You gotta crane your neck.\n\nI like Beatles music but I don't LOVE it. I guess you really gotta be a huge Beatles fan to love this show. Overall I felt it moved too slowly, and the acts didn't really connect to one another.\n\nThe stage is cool, but not as impressive when compared to the stage of Ka and O.
