What kind of place makes anorexic nachos like these? \nWhat is the point?\nI understand this is a burger joint, but why sell nachos if you're going to be so frugal with the toppings. Your burgers are only decent...so at least make these overpriced nachos (same price as burger) above par. It is ridiculously easy to make bomb a$$ nachos! Please give your nachos an upgrade (loads of melted cheese, sour cream, onions, more beans, etc.)!!!
