Had I been a visitor to Charlotte for the first time and had this meal, I would have rated Pinky's 1 star, never to return.  It was the service and vibe that pushes me to an otherwise generous second star.  The meal was just that freakin' bad.\n\nI know, shame on me for not sending it back immediately.  I was hungry, in a hurry, and had places to be.  My bad! \n\nThere were probably four other choices I could have made to let this be a strong 4 star rating.  I had to pick, at my waiters assurance, the Fish Tacos (three $10.25).  The Gorton's Fisherman has served me better \"beer battered tilapia\"!  \n\nThe menu described it as having honey-cilantro slaw, spicy ranch, and served with a side of black beans.  Apparently they were out of honey, cilantro, and spicy ranch.  At least none of those flavors found their way to my plate.  Had I gone to a supermarket, found the cheapest can of black beans, and heated them up in a microwave adding nothing else for flavoring, they would have been better tasting than the black beans that were part of my meal.\n\nI really wanted to love this place!  Maybe another time I will....
