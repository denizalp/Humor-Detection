Been coming here since I moved to Vegas over 10 years ago. This location was my second office. The food and service were great. Irish Sean was awesome. I used to book the back room for private meetings.\n\nI moved to Summerlin so this location became a mid-point for meetings. Great location but due the food quality and lack of personalised service I had to moved from 5 stars to 4 stars. \n\nWith that said, I have to present with three stars due to a lunch I had there yesterday.\n\nWe came in and sat in the section closest to Jones. Nobody approached us for over 5 minutes so we moved sections. I ordered the Chopped Cobb Salad. If you are a Cobb fan or chopped salad fan stay away from this.\n\nThe greens they used were like those wild green salads you buy in the store. You know, the ones that taste like dirt? They were not firm and this was hardly a chopped salad with minimal ingredients.\n\nAs I dived my way deeper into the salad I stated getting a funky taste like some of the salad was turning.\n\nI only ate half of it and we had to leave. I complained to the server and she told me she would tell the chef. She made no effort to make this right and I am a club member hence the three star rating.
