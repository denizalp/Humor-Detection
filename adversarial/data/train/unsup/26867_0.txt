Had a great time here!  People are so shocked when a chick wants to go to Hooters!  I freaking love Hooters wings. Obviously, I'm pretty confident with myself that I have no problem heading over to Hooters and whipping down some wings and a few root beers.  Sorry, I don't drink.  The waitresses are actually pretty fun.  My wings were awesome and I had a side caesar salad that was delicious.  No problems here whatsoever!  Loved it!  It was walking distance next door from my hotel.\nI played a ton of slots in the casino after dinner and had a blast!  I thought it was cool that it was mostly Hooter Girls dealing at all the tables.  My boyfriend was totally jealous..Oh well, next year he'll have his chance when we come back!
