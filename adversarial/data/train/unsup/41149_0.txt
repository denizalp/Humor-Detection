Stumbled in and ate very expensive avocados and smoothies. Our waitress was lovely, the restaurant is beautiful but the food was just nothing special and overpriced. We had the brimstone burger and it was just okay. The smoothies were $8.50 each and pretty basic. I love the idea and really hope to see this concept grow in the city but it needs to either be tastier or more affordable.
