The lady at the service counter, Toni was very kind and helpful. She also seemed to be a really good multi-tasker.  She kept the line moving swiftly.  The bank itself is where my problem is. No one, over the phone or in the drive through seems as if they know what's going on. They are not helpful when a problem occurs and basically make you jump trough a bunch of hoops for simple tasks. You are unable to change you PIN over the phone, they make you drive ALL the way into a branch to do it. Very inconvenient. Also I lost my bank card and they sent me a new one in the mail. No one told me, nor did it say on the letter or new card that my old PIN wouldn't be valid. I was out of town and stick on a weekend not being able to get money out.  Horrible!!!!!!!!
