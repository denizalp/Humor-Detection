I live in Indiana; my husband and I come out for a few months every winter. We found this spa on a visit to old town Scottsdale. \nEverything they do is professional and luxurious.\nI have been to \"medspas\" in Indianapolis and never had a great experience. I have been thrilled with all the beauty services I have had done here at Pearl. The staff is friendly, attentive and always remember who I am and where I live, even though I only come out twice a year! I highly recommend coming here and indulging your inner beauty!!
