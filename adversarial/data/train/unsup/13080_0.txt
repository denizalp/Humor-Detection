I should have bought a Chanel instead....\n\nDon't they pay people to do more then stand around talking to their coworkers? I wanted to give them a piece of my mind at this point....Until I blatantly pointed out to them I wanted to see a handbag that's when the only male in the store decided to help my mother and I. It was a nice slap in the face to the other b*tches, I mean women, who worked in the store when that $3000 rang up. \n\nAnyhow this seems to be a trend at every Versace store... Vegas, LA, & NYC.... Hire better people please!
