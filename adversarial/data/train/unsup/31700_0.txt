They were awesome!!! Got a 1 hr massage and a reflexology foot massage. Best massage I have had in a losing time. Perfect way to end the trip. Don't be thrown off by location... I was sketchy for a second but the manager and staff were great and we were very comfortable. Did not seem like \"one of those\" places. Thumbs up. They even drove us to the airport after our services. Two thumbs up. Worth every penny!!!
