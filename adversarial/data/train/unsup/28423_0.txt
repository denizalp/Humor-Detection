Unplanned, we ended up on a double date here last night at the Stable Bar & Grill yesterday. For those of you are not familiar, Quivey's has an upscale restaurant in the historic landmark house and then they have the stable bar and grill that is more casual right next to it on the same property. Additionally, there is a cool tunnel that joins the two if you want to get a drink at the bar and walk under to the nicer restaurant.\n\nLast night, we went bowling at Ten Pin Alley, right next door, and decided to get a drink. Well, a drink turned into dinner. We were seated right away in this cool, restaurant in an aged old stable. We ordered drinks with our waitress and when she returned with them, we ordered our meals. My boyfriend and I, ordered an order of fried pickles to share as an appetizer and then also wanted side salads before our meal. The waitress brought the pickles, salads AND their free bread all at the same time. It was really overwhelming and in poor taste. We all received our entrees and they were good, but i felt really overpriced (entrees are $17-$25) for the quality we received. My boyfriends $20 pork chop, was nearly all fat. I ordered the trout, that was good, but they put so much garnish under the meal, that i actually had to work to remove the trout from the garnish to eat it. Additionally, at the end of our meal, the waitress split our bills. We didn't' even look at our receipt and sent back our credit card right away. Well, our friends got charged for our salads and when she came back with our card, we told her. Instead of just letting it go, she asked for our card back to charge us for her mistake. Now, we are anxiously awaiting a double charge from this restaurant. \n\nI feel bad writing such a poor review. I have eaten at the main restaurant, and it was a memorably great experience.
