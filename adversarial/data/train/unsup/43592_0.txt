Pretty disappointing. I've been going to the US Egg in Tempe and Scottsdale for years.  \n\nI'm not sure if I caught Scottsdale on a bad day or not but this weeks experience was awful. Genuinely unfriendly hostess, mediocre service and I had to send back the food (something I've done less than three times in my life).\n\nI really doubt I'll be back...
