I was really impressed with this great bakery. It's a hidden gem in old Henderson situated across the street from the newly opened Lovelady Brewery. \n\nThe bakery selection is nothing short of amazing. Not only the number of items offered, but the variety of items offered. Baked goods include breads, tarts, tea cookies, cupcakes, French macarons, cake slices, frangipanes, crumb cakes, and the list goes on. There are too many good options for just one visit. \n\nAs difficult as it was, my husband and I narrowed to four items. My very favorite item was the Princess Cake. I wasn't familiar with princess cake before, but this reinvented cake for me. I loved the white cake, strawberry jam, Bavarian cream, and oh, the marzipan on the outside. My husband already knows that this is what I want as my birthday cake next year. The Blueberry Crumb was buttery, tender, and had the perfect amount of blueberry. The Key Lime Tart had a tender crumb crust with tangy key lime filling. Lastly, my assortment of Tea Cookies were tasty as well. They reminded me of my favorite Italian cookies with a nice buttery taste, some being dipped in chocolate as well.\n\nI'm already dreaming of my next set of treats from here!
