This place hasn't changed since I remember in the 90's. And no my friends, that is not a good thing. Everything needs an update. The circus show just kinda made me sad. The entire experience made me question my childhood. It was all a sham and now life has no meaning.\n\nThe place also feels dark. Even though there are flashing lights from the carnival games throughout the Midway, you feel like you have been transported straight into Fear and Loathing. The dirty red carpeting from the 80's, sounds of bells and balloons popping, the smell of chemical butter from the popcorn, the dilapidated clowns from the circus show...I can go on but I really want to wipe this memory from my head.
