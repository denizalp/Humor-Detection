After two back surgeries I was referred to Dynamic Spine on Pecos in Green Valley.  Everyone I met was professional and made thorough evaluations and a therapy plan. After the first 8 visits,I had remarkable improvement in my walking.  I still have a great deal of therapy to do and I wouldn't want to do it anywhere else.
