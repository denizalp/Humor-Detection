My wife and I had been regular patrons since 2013, and the food and service was always good to great.  It was our regular place to go for date night.  Since the beginning of the year though we notice a significant change in the vibe of our favorite sushi restaurant.  The food started to be more good and never great.  The servers who made our nights fun were gone; replaced by a brigade of food schlepers.  Worst of all, the decor went from a quaint experience to a video wall extravaganza that was better suited for East Freemont than Centennial.  \n\nEven with that, we wouldn't give this a 1 star or write a review about never going back.  Not until our LAST visit.  They changed the menu without changing the names of the rolls.  They continued to send item after item to our table that we didn't order, but didn't get items we actually ordered.  And to put a creamy dreamy topper on our craptastic experience last night: we both got food poisoning.   We didn't make it half a mile from the restaurant before having to yank the wheel, dart out of the car, and spend 5 minutes giving back to the world.\n\nThank you Krazy Sushi.  You lost two loyal customers.  You ruined our date night.  Hopefully we will be able to enjoy sushi again from a place that knows the difference between fresh product and spoiled product.\n\nMay Gordon Ramsey show up with a video crew and show the world what really happens there.  Maybe he can find out what that smell is!
