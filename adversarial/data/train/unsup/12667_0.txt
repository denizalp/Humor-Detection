After visiting this place frequently for the past month and a half and trying multiple beverages I decided to write a review.\n\nAtmosphere: Flying Machine Coffee is very clean and inviting. There are high ceilings, wood floors, and both long wooden benches and smaller tables. \n\nService: The staff here is AWESOME. Typically when you walk into a coffee shop like this there is an air of pretension however, there is none of that happening here. The people working behind the bar are excited about what they do and excited to have you try new drinks and preparations as well explain the processes and where the drinks come from.\n\nDrinks: The drinks are delightful, try everything. They are also reasonably priced (You can easily escape this place spending less than $3. \n\nVerdict: Come to this place often, stay a while!\n\nSide-note: There have been multiple times when I've been here and they've been playing an entire Jimmy Buffett album. At first I thought it was to be ironic but now I genuinely think that there is a dedicated parrothead behind the bar.
