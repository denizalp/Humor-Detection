I went with a friend recently and had no expectations one way or the other upon arrival. I knew - literally - nothing about the place. We gave the menu on the window a once-over before entering and the manager came out to invite us in - I like that kind of hospitality.\n\nThe interior is dark with lushly-upholstered lounges, dark wood, wrought iron, and sliver and gold accents. It has a very alluring, adult appeal that a lot of places shoot for and miss completely. It was on the crowded side so we pulled up a few stools at the bar.\n\nThey have a fairly large wine list, priced like you would expect to find in a by-the-glass establishment. The expected is there, as well as a few hidden gems if you look hard. The beer assortment is thin, just enough to satisfy the beer drinker, and they also have a cocktail list. The mixed drinks are prepared fairly well and were nicely balanced. Wine pours were not on the skimpy side, either.\n\nIt seemed, though, that the entire staff that night was hired based on being young, fit and blonde than on knowing anything about wine. These ladies were incredibly kind and hard working- don't get me wrong. I just question the owner's motives behind that decision and the kind of crowd he hopes to attract.
