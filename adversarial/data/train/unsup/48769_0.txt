This place is definitely one of my favorite places in Vegas!!! The watermelon slush is dangerously addictive, I've gone almost everyday for the past week the guy cashier, which is super friendly and helpful, knows me by name now  definitely recommended coming here and trying the popcorn chicken as well!
