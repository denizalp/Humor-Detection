2.5 star\n\nKori Sushi is a small family restaurant that serves both Japanese and Korean dishes.\n\nHidden at the corner, you will not even see the restaurant storefront when you drive by. I knew exactly where it is since I been to the traditional Korean restaurant that used to be here.\n\nLunch Sspecial till 4 pm on Weekdays.\n\nSushi Lunch Large ($11.99)\n\n-  8 pieces of Nirgri Sushi with 4 being Salmon, wish there more variety. \n- California roll has a nice crunch \n- Shari rice though not Japanese rice was well prepared with nice bite and good seasoning\n- no wasabi in sushi\n\nOverall experience is average. Not good enough for me to want to go back.\n\nMaybe Korean dishes tastes better? \n\nService though nice and friendly and seems to doing well with takeout.
