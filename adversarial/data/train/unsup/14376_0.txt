Interesting, and on a good day probably great, but today and the last visit was unimpressive.\n\nSmall, intimate coffee shop located in the Highland Creek neighborhood that offers coffee, tea, and a couple of food offerings. If you're looking at the front of Harris Teeter, it's to the left.\n\nToday I got the same thing I did the first time: House (Ethiopian) coffee with about 2tbsp half & half and 2 packets of sugar. The roast is great, and it tastes well brewed. The problem is it almost tastes watered down. Not watered down as they used too much water while brewing, that would over-extract and emphasize bitterness. Instead, it's like they took well roasted and fresh coffee and added water afterwards... Maybe I'm wrong, but it had a very weak, watery flavor.\n\nI also tried the Pecan Pie square and good God do they need to warm this before serving.  The flavor was good enough, but I'm pretty sure I loosened a bond on my fixed retainer behind my teeth! Texture like set concrete. The nutty flavors would probably be more pronounced heated as well.\n\nI may come back to try a different coffee, but I'll skip the pastries... It definitely isn't their Forte.
