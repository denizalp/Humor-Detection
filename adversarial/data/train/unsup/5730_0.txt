I just had to respond to Leeann T's unpleasant review. We can all read between the lines. Ew icky poor people! \n\nJoke is on her though, because Heinens DOES take \"food stamps\" aka the Ohio Direction card, in all of its stores. Most of the people using the card at Heinens are her neighbors and friends as the urban poor don't have the resources to travel to Heinens locations. Hopefully other Yelpers are educated enough to know poverty can be found in the suburbs and not all poor people are slobs.\n\nThat being said, like all Heinen's stores this one is fabulous. These stores are paradise for a foodie (Ohio City Pasta? Check . Mitchell's Homemade Ice Cream? Check ). And the prices are not really much higher that Big Bird. Plus, they are a locally owned company headquartered in Cleveland, while Big Bird is a chain from Pittsburgh. Now that  is truly icky.
