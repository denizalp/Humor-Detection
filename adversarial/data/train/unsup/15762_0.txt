I had only experienced a cut with Bao before and fell in love that day.  I returned to try highlights, and it turned out FABulous.  Bao took the time to get the right color.  Most ladies with black hair know how hard it is to get the right color when your hair is lightened.  If you are asian, go see Bao.  If you have thick hair, go see Bao.  You know what...if have hair on your head...go see Bao!
