Their pizza would be great... If they only took the time to finish cooking it :\/ Walking thru the halls of this place to get to the games area, all you see on the tables are unfinished left overs, at times half-pizzas just right below the crunched-up napkins. So that tells you people don't come here for the pizza.... But they should, because theyq are generous with the toppings & cheese, and in my personal opinion is pretty good. The stars off is because I asked for well-done pizza, but my pizza came out almost white.... With no'done' look at all, and when I reminded them that it needed more cooking they tell me \"that's well-done!\" I didn't laugh because I have a hungry kid waiting on the table and at this point this is not funny. But after the pizza came out later it looked much better and tasted great! So if they only knew... all you need to do is cook your pizza Peter!
