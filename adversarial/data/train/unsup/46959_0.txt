Jade Palace has the best Chinese food in town! We are not even big on Chinese food but whenever we want it, we come to Jade Palace.  We were here last night and the weekend before as well. Our waitress Sarah did an excellent job and she remembered us and our food allergies.\n\nLast night we started off with egg drop soup. It was excellent! I had the filet and shrimp in brown sauce and my husband had the shrimp with lobster sauce.  My son had the rice noodles with beef. Everything was very good as per usual.
