Forget about anything videogame-related on the Strip.  For a twenty-buck cab ride to the University neighborhood, you'll be treated to pinball (and some classic video arcade game) heaven.\n\nI actually enjoyed playing the older machines better than the newest ones (and there are some NEW ones...Tron Legacy for example.  I seriously had no idea these things were still being built!) simply because getting a thousand points is a challenge in itself.  I really felt like I had accomplished something after gaining a replay on the Carnival machine (1957, one of only 300 ever made).  \n\nIt's cool how the scores on pinball machines over time have reflected the bullshit that is inflation!  I will ALWAYS come back here when I visit Sin City.
