My Jeep Patriot wouldn't start and my husband is out of town.  I ended up leaving it in the WalMart parking lot and taking a cab home.  (Meltdown city!)  The Jeep is out of warranty so I didn't want to take it to the dealership, but I had no idea where to go.  I looked up the AAA preferred repair shops, and then I checked Yelp.  Tony's had great reviews, so I called them.  I spoke with Jennifer and explained my problem.  She said there would be no problem for them to look at it once I could get it there.  It took a few hours to get things set up, but when I walked in just ahead of the tow truck, Jennifer knew who I was right away.  She was super helpful and said she'd call when they knew what the problem was.  She called 20 minutes later to let me know it was an easy fix, and my car was ready.  When I got back, she went through all the checks they did to make sure it was taken care of.  The rates were reasonable, and I couldn't be happier with the customer service.  I would definitely recommend Tony's to anybody who needs auto repair.
