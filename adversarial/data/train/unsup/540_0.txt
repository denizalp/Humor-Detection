A coworker brought me so I could try pupusas. The Salvadorian main entree. Its like a tortilla stiffed with a variety of options. I got to try 3 different ones. All very good. \n\nThe pupusas were small in size but quite filling. Topped with a cabbage and hot sauce, the meal was unique and one I'd love to try again. \n\nExperiencinnew foods is always fun, especially when its good. \n\nLoved the orange soda and fruit drink. I apologize I don't know the names, my coworker ordered everything for me.
