All around this place was just horrible to live at! Even when you visit the office the staff(four women situated in each corner) will continue whatever gossip and issues they have while you wait standing in the middle of the room. And even when they do get around to you they are always aiming to push you out the door as fast as possible.\n\nThe late fee if you are a few hours late on rent? $60!(luckily i was never late) On top of my paying $800 for my crappy one bedroom.\n\nTo get to my front door i have to go through three different gates... but security is still a huge issue here, a few of my friends used to live here and they both had there apts broken into.\n\nWhenever my A\/C Unit kicks on it starts dripping in the middle of the hall, I know have to leave a bucket underneath it at all times so it doesn't ruin the carpet anymore.\nThe dumpsters are ALWAYS full w\/o fail. If you plan on throwing out your trash you either have to be there right after they take it or throw it on the side(in which case people come and pick through it for some reason).\nMy neighbors were a wonderful hispanic family, the wife constantly cooked and would invite me over all of the time. BUT, when she would do the dishes and use the garbage disposal it ended up in all of my sinks and the shower, if i left anything in the sink it would have chunks of whatever they ate the night before. The shower was even worse,(i'm a guy w\/ almost no hair, and for some reason the tub manages to have hair in it every morning, along w\/ a very nice black film of things that backed up into it)\n\nMaybe i was unlucky w\/ this place at every turn and everybody else loves it, but judging the last review i doubt it , I would have avoided this place like the plague if I had known what i would be getting myself into.
