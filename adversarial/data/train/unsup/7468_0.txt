********************* 1249 **********************\n\n    BARDOT Brasserie, Las Vegas' debut French concept from James Beard award-winning chef Michael Mina, is now open for dinner and weekend brunch at ARIA Resort & Casino. Paying homage to the skillful culinary techniques, celebrated libations and sexy atmosphere for which The City of Light is renowned, Chef Mina has created a stylish and unforgettable interpretation of a Parisian brasserie in the center of The Strip.\n\n    Created by Bishop Pass Interior Architectural Design Studio, BARDOT's space exudes a dark and sexy, almost enigmatic atmosphere. I couldn't believe this was former American Fish's space, it's lavishly beautiful, chic, and elegant at the same time. \n\n    BARDOT's main dining room offers a traditional yet luxurious dining space. Walls of black lacquer are paneled with gold pen striping, surrounding a series of Parisian columns. Burgundy leather booths and bistro-style tables spread across a pristine marble floor, where guests can sneak a peek inside the restaurant's show kitchen as they watch their meals come to life.\n\n    Sidewalk Café - A nod to Parisian sidewalk cafes, BARDOT features intimate seating outside of the restaurant for an entertaining dining and people-watching experience. Situated in the courtyard overlooking ARIA's second-floor promenade, the locale's French-inspired storefront and high windows transport guests to a 20th century literary café in Paris.\n\n    Innovative Cocktails by none other than Mina Group's Director of Cocktails Carlo Splendorini and ARIA's Mixologist Craig Schoettler salute French drinking tradition with an inventive beverage menu. The restaurant's cocktail program combines the best of French culture and Las Vegas style. Signature sips include And God Created Women, a satisfying layering of French spirits and egg whites; and the Voltaire, a cider-based cocktail that dazzles the senses with baked apple bitters and housemade ginger syrup. \n\n    Finest Wines - Wine Director Kim Wood curated one of the most extensive by-the-glass programs, as well as the largest selection of French wines in Las Vegas at BARDOT, highlighting the finest small production and rare vintages from across the globe. \n\n   Happy Hour at Bar and Lounge 5-7 PM daily, very reasonable at $2-$6. Try these dishes: \n\n- PRIME STEAK TARTARE $6 sauce verte, slow cooked egg, gaufrette potatoes\n\n- ESCARGOTS $6 toasted hazelnuts, chartreuse butter, puff pastry shells\n\n- DUCK WINGS À L'ORANGE $4 wood grilled duck wings, seasonal citrus, sauce maltaise\n\n- BONE MARROW $5 roasted bone marrow, red wine onion jam, grilled country bread\n\n   The brunch menu is pricier, of course, but dinner is by far the best. \n\n- FOIE GRAS PARFAIT ruby port gelée, grilled country bread - delicious\n\n- ONION SOUP GRATINÉE you must add Périgord truffle, braised oxtail & soft poached egg. \n\n- HEARTH-FIRED MARROW burgundy onion jam, grilled country bread, so tasty!\n\n-  CARLSBAD MUSSELS MARINIÈRES garlic butter, dolin vermouth, warm baguette, this broth was flavorful, well balanced, and the mussels were perfect in size. \n\n- Les Steak Frites - a must try, with filet mignon and  foie gras butter sauce, ummm it was so tender and melting in your mouth good!\n\n    And don't forget to try the Champagne Cart with my favorite Champagne KRUG GRANDE CUVÉE REIMS is only $38 by the glass! \n\n    Service by the same GM of American Fish before, a Michael Mina Group veteran Roberto Liendo, always a pleasure to dine here. I'm looking forward to return and try other dishes.
