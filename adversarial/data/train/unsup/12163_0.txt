We went to the bank on a friday night, getting in before midnight. \n\n- Doors open at 1030. With VCard, you'll get in at 11. \n- No chairs. without bottle service, you'll be standing in your high heels the whole night. \n- Lame music. huge thing for us. \"everyone's favorite jumping up and down, fisting pumping energy\" dance music. \"here's my number! call me maybe! :)\"\n- For those that enjoy hip hop, you'll get lucky around 12:30. Not long. be sad. get a drink. \n- \"free\" birthday cake shots. tip required.\n- gets crowded. big girl jumping and fist pumping explains lots. \n- looking at the demographic and the size of the club, i guess it's appropriate to play what they did. not where i'd spend my friday night ever again. rather stunt at rain.
