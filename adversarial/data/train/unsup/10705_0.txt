ATTENTION YELPERS: A QUALITY BOBA SHOP IN HENDERSON HAS ARRIVED!\n\nI've been here two times already and have tried like 7 of their drinks already. WHUT. Well, none of them have disappointed yet. My favorite concept of this place is their bottles. You can literally order a couple and bring them home, store em in the fridge, and save for later... you can sneak em in the movies in your purse (but I didn't have a purse on me so I wrapped it in a jacket)... you can store it away basically... unlike other boba drinks where you have to finish it before you go in a restaurant or at a place where you can't bring in drinks... just put it in your purse, backpack, satchel... and hide it away, no spills, no nothing! Also, one price for all. I hope this doesn't change. But the pricing is pretty good for what you get. Their boba is yummy too, thank goodness.\n\nTheir specialties are definitely worth the try. My favorite is the vietnamese coffee. It's super delicious and strong. I'll definitely be heading here for more... except I still have coconut thai tea and another tea in my fridge still.......... \n\nOn the plus plus side, they've got a star program... which we all know is the best thing ever to frequent customers. Thank you for coming to Henderson... I'll probably be seeing y'all there.
