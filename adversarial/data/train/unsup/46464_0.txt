We visited for Happy Hour with our 2 toddlers. We ordered the Shrimp & Avocado crisp, Calamari(smallish portion) from the HH menu both tasted great. Also tried the Louisiana Pasta dish and I was NOT impressed by the overwhelming pepper flavor. We tried the Coronita Margarita and the Fins Mule both were fine. We will be back to try other entrees and Sushi because others we noticed looked pretty good. Check it out for yourself!
