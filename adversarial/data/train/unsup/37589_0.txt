Tom has disconnected his mobile phone and removed his personal and business profiles from Facebook. He took thousands of dollars from us. Although I believe him to be battling personal demons, it does not excuse taking money from people and then disappearing. I doubt he is working at the moment. I like Tom. I liked the way he handled our dogs. But despite his personal struggles, he took our money and did not provide the services promised. My wife and I will be taking all appropriate action to recover monies paid as Tom did not fulfill his end of our contract.
