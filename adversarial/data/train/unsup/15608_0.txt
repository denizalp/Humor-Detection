If there's one age-old lesson this place taught me, it's not to judge a book by its cover. I've driven by this place many times, thinking it was nothing more than an average dive. Boy, was I wrong. This spot may look like a shop you'd find on the 8 Mile (okay, that's an exaggeration, but the exterior is pretty dated), but the food and experience deserves all 5 stars.\n\nI dropped by on a Wednesday afternoon at noon for lunch, and was taken aback by how warmly the owner greeted me. Service was so warm, genuine, friendly - you don't find owners like this too often in a big city. I ordered the Vegetarian Platter, which comes with rice, potatoes, 4 types of salad, a pita, and two falafel, topped with a generous dollop of hummus, and spices. I thought the potatoes and rice were just okay, but everything else in my overflowing container was delicious - the hummus and falafel were definitely the highlights for me. That hummus is magic. \n\nElias also discovered that it was my first time visiting, and offered me, ever so famously, a piece of apple cake. So moist, soft, delicious, not overly sweet, and paired perfectly with the coffee I grabbed after my meal. \n\nFor all that food, plus a piece of apple cake on the house, I paid $9.00. Cash only. Great value, especially taking into account the portion size. If it wasn't such a trek from work, I'd be here more often. But nevertheless, I'll definitely be back. Thanks to fellow Yelpers for helping me find this gem!
