All of the men in my family thoroughly love Mexican food and I enjoy a good margarita so on our recent trip to Vegas we decided to try this restaurant which was described to us as \"upscale\" Mexican.  The food was good but not great and not what I expected from two Top Chef Masters.  The good -  Service was very, very good.  The margaritas and cocktails, in general were fabulous and the guacamole was among some of the best I have tasted.  One of my guys had the oxacan strip steak and said it was delicious.  Now the bad -  I had the taquitos and they were tasteless and small.  My husband had the fish tacos and his verdict was that they were \"OK\" but no better than what he can get at home (which is Dayton Ohio - a far piece from the border).  I forget what my Son had but he agreed with my husband that the food was just good but nothing he could not get at home.  That would be OK but this place was pricey for what we got.  Now for the ugly - The place was dirty and the seating was uncomfortable.  We were also promised a \"view\" when we elected to sit on the patio; however, the only people who get a view are the ones who sit in the very front of the patio.  We were at the very back of the patio. The overall appearance of the place just seemed to be chaotic and disorganized.  Not an enjoyable experience at all.  We will not be visiting again.
