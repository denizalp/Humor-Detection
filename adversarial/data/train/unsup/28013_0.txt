I choose this dentist as a second opinion for my daughters teeth. The 1st dentist office I went to wanted to do a crown and root canal and fillings on my daughters front teeth. at the time she was 2. So i wanted second opinion  I went to Just for kids dentistry and all they said that she needed was one filling. They did that one filling without sedation or numbing her since it was not that deep of a cavity. My daughter did fine. I felt comfortable with this dentist. \n Now my daughter is almost 4 and needed a few fillings on her back teeth.They did say they will sedate her with demerol and laughing gas. As a mother of course I'm scared and worried... But, I know she needs the fillings. I also know she wouldnt sit still enough for them without sedation. I trust them to do the work. They were great. Very quick. My daughter did well and didn't have one problem. As a mom it was a scary experience, but it went great. The staff is great. \n  The front office is clean and it is very kid friendly. The staff was polite and answered all my questions even before they were settled in.\n Only part I would think might help them out is if they could convince the staff to come in 30 min to an hr early to get settled in and set up for the day. ( just looks better.) i plan on going back for their cleanings in 6 months.  Im a happy parent with their work.
