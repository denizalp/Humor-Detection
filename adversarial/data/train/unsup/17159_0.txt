My 2 kids go here for classes and seem to enjoy the environment. Will not be renewing!\nI brought them on a Saturday for a $7 hour of do-it-yourself practice. Immediately after I paid, my 4 YO decided not to participate. So literally within that 3 minute timeframe I asked for a partial refund. They told me it wasn't possible but they would give me a credit. It was very easy for them to take my funds but apparently impossible to return them for services not rendered. It is my opinion that the female with the breast tattoo peering through her outfit hasn't taken a customer device class, or she might have actually smiled once during the entire interaction.\n\nNext I overheard her give someone else a refund. So I re-approached the counter and asked her how it was possible for them to get their money back but impossible for me to do the same. Then she completely changed her story and blamed me, saying I didn't provide her enough time to explain the refund process possibilities. That was untrue. She gave me no options to choose from.\nThen she asked for my card back yet never took possession of it to process the refund...?\nNow she is hopefully processing a refund, but can't do it for 48+ hours.\nTime will tell whether I get that refund, but I'm not holding my breath that she will do anything to help move this forward.\n\nLive and learn!\n\nMy advice to them - provide the customer-facing staff with service training, teach them how to smile and interact properly with the folks who provide the money to fund their paychecks, and maybe dress in a professional manner. We don't all want our kids using your breasts to learn how to read English.
