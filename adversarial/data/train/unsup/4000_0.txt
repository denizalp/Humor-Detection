I had the prosciutto sandwich, and it was delicious. That's all I'm going to say about the food. \n\nDude, the service...it sucked. I am low maintenance, and am equipped with low expecations to match, and it still sucked. All I need is a smile and maybe, I don't know, a polite greeting of some kind, and I am satisfied in the service department. Totally didn't happen here. \n\nThe restaurant, per its website and posted hours, opens at 10:00 AM. I can't imagine anyone actually goes there that early, but, okay. It's when they open. \n\nNow, as anyone who has worked downtown for more than a week knows, if you want to go somewhere and get in and out and back to your desk in a manageable amount of time, you need to adjust your lunch time aim - shoot for 11:30, or shoot for 1:30. Anything in between will only bring you lines, misery, and a bitch of a time parking...especially on 7th Street. \n\nSo, I mosied on over to La Piccola Cucina at exactly 11:20...an hour and twenty minutes after they opened, mind. I walked in, and was greeted by a scowling, irritated-looking girl at front counter in a hot pink sweatshirt and super tight black pants, (the owner's daughter, I was able to ascertain from newspaper clippings posted on the restaurant walls). She looked at me and said, in a very put-upon tone...are you ready for this...\"Yeah? What do you need?\"\n\n\"Yeah? What do you need?\" You're working at a restaurant...it's 11:30 at this point...I've approached the counter to order...and you're copping an attitude like you can't possibly imagine what I would be doing there? Right. Keep on keepin' on, girl. DIVA FOR LIFE!\n\nI said, \"Um...I'd like to order something to go...\" No menus are to be seen...I later discovered that the sandwich menu is posted on the wall somewhere, but this wasn't pointed out to me. Good thing I read some Yelp reviews before I went, so I had some idea of what was available...oh, PS - the gelato cases and the food cases were empty. Totally empty. \n\nAvoiding eye contact with me, she fumbled with a bunch of papers by the register, still looking completely annoyed by my existence,.\"Uh, we're not even really OPEN yet.\" I look behind me at the clock on the wall, and the front door that is propped open all the way. I had no idea how to respond to that, so I didn't. Just awkwardly stood there till she took my order.\n\n I ordered the prosciutto sandwich, no wilted greens. Of course, it came with wilted greens, which would be forgivable if I hadn't been treated like a leper. While I was waiting, another couple came in and was helped by the owner's wife...food\/gelato cases were still empty, and she wasn't super friendly, but she at least acknowledged them as human beings and pointed out where the menus were.\n\nThe owner, so often immortalized in Yelp reviews as a loud, friendly, brusque gentleman, just kind of lumbered around the restaurant, frowning, without a smile or word for anyone.\n\nMy sandwich was awesome, but there are too many other mom-n'-pops downtown to even bother giving business to a place where the staff cops an attitude. Really and truly. Sucks for them, because I'm the kind of person who goes back to a place over and over again, and tries everything. I tell my friends and family, I write nice reviews on Yelp. \n\nIn this case, several co-workers wanted to know where I got my sandwich from, and I lied. \n\nSorry, guys. Attitude matters.
