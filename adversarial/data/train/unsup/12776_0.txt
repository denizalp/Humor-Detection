This place has been here for over 35 years, not a lot of time on the East coast. But, here in AZ where no building lasts for more than 60 years , it is astonishing!\nTrue right up front, it is in a rough hood. But, maybe you should just go during the day.\nThe selection here in the Groceries is without comparison. \nThey have everything Italian you could want.....Imported from Italy. Of course.\nThey make their own sausage there,(you can buy it in the meat case.) \nIt is by far, THE BEST we have ever had any where.\nIt even drove the dog crazy when I just brought it in the house. The smell is so good! \nThe choices for the food and cook ware,as well as gifts are fantastic. \nI have not been able to eat lunch there but ,next time we will. So far the first 3 times have just been Grocery shopping.\nI live just over 50 miles round trip from this Deli , Bakery. Every mile is worth it.\nI cannot believe I had never been here till October.\nI have since recommended it to every Italian I know. Oh yes, it is that good.\nIf I could give them 10 stars ,I would.
