I stopped in to have some good food and was super disappointed that this place is closed due to some accusations.  I hope you can get this resolved soonest.  This place is always the cleanest, most courteous and the most delicious, it must be some kind of misunderstanding.  Best wishes. They Are reopen I'm so happy be back for dinner tonight.
