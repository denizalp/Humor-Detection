We went for a friend's bday party. Unfortunately, by 9:00 pm, Over by Stuch was sold out of the whole fish entree and prawns. Instead, I ordered oxtail stew, which was rich and flavourful. The goat stew was also good - not tough at all. The chicken and vegetarian rotis are very filling and such good value - I think both were under $7.00. Great prices, tasty food, and something different from the usual Japanese\/pizza places.
