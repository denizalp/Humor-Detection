Yummy Grill & Sushi is my usual spot with my girls when I don't feel like cooking, or we're celebrating something...or just because we can have one more bite of sushi anytime, after all I must raise them well.\n\nI've known chef Eric's passion for sushi for over a decade and he is still surpass my expectations all the time...graciously extending lunch specials until 4pm when a Happy Hour starts up. I appreciate that they are considerate of the various Vegas lifestyles and schedules. I love that you can order high-quality and hard to find Nigiri and Sashimi in the same place that you can get happy hour rolls...very thoughtful approach. For lunch I often order their sushi special with 6 pieces of fresh nigiri and choice of spicy tuna or California. One of my daughters appreciates the tempura roll...so nice to have such a variety at one place. You can try all of them yourself and in the process define your taste for Japanese Cuisine...who knows, maybe eventually decide to take it next door to Kame Omakase...at least that's my hope for you...just like my love led me from Yummy to Kame.\n\nMy girls are more venturous in trying new rolls...also providing my opportunity to try rolls I otherwise wouldn't. Today they got sweet heart roll with sauce on the side.  Sauce is rather sweet for the girls being teriyaki based sauce with spicy mayo sauce, so having them put it on the side was good thing for them.\n\nSo the conclusion of this review is Yummy grill is good for everyone who loves Japanese Cuisine and if you like to raise up your pallets, step into the next door to Kame Omakase with the same chef, who awes me all the time, Eric.
