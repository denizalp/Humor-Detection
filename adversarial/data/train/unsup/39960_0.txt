So I received a call today from the service manager at Volvo of Tempe regarding my recent survey I had filled out. I stated in the survey exactly what I stated here on Yelp. He said this wasn't a call to make excuses for their poor service and he apologized for the poor experience both times visiting the store. He requested that I tell him what happened again, even though I already had written the entire experience in the comments box of the customer survey. I repeated my entire experience again and while apologetic, the only offer he made to correct the poor service was to give me a free car wash! You have got to be kidding me!? The only thing that would have been appropriate here is to offer a free oil change on my next visit. I politely told him no thank you, that the dealer was entirely to far out of my way for a car wash. When he offered his direct phone number if I had any other problems, I told him it wasn't necessary and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I actually thought they were calling to try and correct their poor customer service. Offering an already included, free service is not making anything right in my book. It seems harsh to give them a one star because they did make an attempt but they still deserve a 'Eek! Methinks Not' over a 'Meh. I've experienced better' rating. I will never return here and given there is only one Volvo dealership in Phoenix, I probably won't be buying another Volvo when my 2008 T5 needs to be replaced. Not only this store, but Volvo, lost a customer today.
