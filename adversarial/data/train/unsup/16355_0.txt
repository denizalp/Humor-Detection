Mr. Mamas has been serving the Vegas community for years on the Decatur side, until their semi-recent expansion to this part of town in the good ol Spanish Palms retail plaza (aka strip mall palooza). They haven't lost a beat with their newer surroundings, as they serve some of the best breakfast in the city while providing incredible service all at the same time.\n\nTheir new spot is one giant dining room space; complete with the retro black and white checkered floor tile (#1) and a number of tables for all groups and sizes. There is a TV playing in the corner for the morning crowd and the staff is usually warmly greeting folks as they come in and leave. The hustle and bustle in the back kitchen becomes hard to ignore; a subtle reminder for what most people (and I) are here to eat.\n\nTheir menu is practically exclusive to the quintessential American breakfast experience while featuring a decent number of other diner classics such as salads, sandwiches, and soups. I've been a sucker for hashbrowns and theirs is as good as any. Perfectly crispy, aromatic, and extremely complementary to any additional breakfast item. My last go around here was a magical plate of corned beef hash with two smooth and silky eggs over easy. I ordered a side of avocado to smear onto my toast, which was glorious in itself. Everything was so delicious, I was secretly cursing at myself knowing nothing like this exists where I live.\n\nI took my time, polished off a glass of orange juice and just marveled how simple and wonderful these foods are. Sure, I had just finished a stint on the other side of the world and was basking in the nostalgia of hashbrown glory that I was experiencing at Mr Mamas, but the food only made me think of every other time I've been here in past trips, which were all excellent.\n\nA huge shout out to the owners \/ management who go out of their way to make sure as customers that we feel every bit as wonderful as we did regardless of how many visits. On the front of their menu there is a (extremely cheesy) quote that reads: \"Our Place Will Put A Smile On Your Face.\" Truth.\n\nReview #3100 is in the books. To 5 stars and many more adventures in hashbrowns.\n__________\n(#1) Presumably from when this place was the 50's Diner: https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/50s-diner-las-vegas
