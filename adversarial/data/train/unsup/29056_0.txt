Do you love lamb, schwarmas, or hummus?  This is the place to be.\n\nStart with the fried lemon cauliflower or an order of hummus with olive oil dribbled across for an excellent beginning.  For lunch, their sandwiches are priced well and delicious.  Instead of stuffing a pita with ingredients that explode all over the place, they wrap them fully and panini them close for easy eating; fantastic idea.\n\nFor specialities, try a few Kibbe bites.  Balls of beef fried with a mixture of spices that fit perfectly with an order of their cucumbers & yogurt dish.  Just drop the kibbe right in, it's a great mix!\n\nI've been on a number of occasions and have always had fantastic service.  Great food and atmosphere keeps me coming back so it's definitely worth a visit.
