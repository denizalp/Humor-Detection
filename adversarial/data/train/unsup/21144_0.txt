Kazu is a small Japanese restaurant that is known for their inspired Japanese eats with an open kitchen.  Their menu offers appetizers (beef carpaccio, calcium salmon, edamame, egg plant dip, etc.), main courses  (teriyaki burger, onigiri, bibimbop Japanese style, etc.), grilled items (yakitori, tuna belly, pork neck, etc.), fish dishes (traditional sashimi, tuna tartar, etc.), daily specials, as well as desserts.  The hubs and I came here for lunch, and I was super excited that we were the first ones in line (yes, the line forms quickly!).  We sat up at the counter, as I love seeing the action as well as to not be seated at the cramped tables.  We started off with a Home Made Kimchi Tofu Salad (luscious homemade tofu that were delicate, soft, and silky, covered with fresh kimchi-style pickled vegetables, fresh lettuce, and a lovely dressing - this was absolutely delicious!!!).  With our entrees, we received a complimentary soup (clear broth) and potato salad (it was okay).  For our meals, we tried the Ramen Noodle (homemade chicken-based stock with perfectly al-dente noodles, pork, and a soft-boiled egg - the broth was flavorful, soothing, and clean-tasting, and we both enjoyed this very much!) and the 48-hours Pork Bowl (a bowl of rice topped with thinly-sliced pork that had been simmering in a soy sauce-based sauce for 48 hours; I wasn't really much of a fan of this dish, as while the pork didn't have a strong pork flavor, I thought the flavor would have been a bit more savory; the hubs enjoyed this dish, though).  Service was super friendly, and the place gets filled up fast during the lunch rush.  I'd love to come back and try out their homemade teriyaki burger, their homemade shrimp burger, as well as their Bibimbap Japanese style bowls.
