Why would you ever stay here? \n\n1. The theme is ridiculously cheesy.\n\n2. All the casino patrons are really angry old Filipina grandmas (no hate, I love the Filipinos, but man y'all get mean after age 50 or so).\n\n3. When you enter the room towers, you literally feel like you've been transported to a prison camp in the jungles of 'Nam in '68.\n\nAs a young lass, I once tried to meet a group of female friends-of-friends at the IP to keep the party going after hours, only to find that they were all Vietnamese and looking...rough. Given point 3, you can understand why I ran away as fast as I could and haven't been back since.
