I work in a near-by office building and I started seeing bags of flavored popcorn popping up at desks!  My coworkers are officially hooked on this popped-corn-crack.  We've sampled almost every flavor and OMG, you can't go wrong.\n\nThe coolest thing about the options here are that they are endless when you start mixing flavors.  Do yourself a favor and ask for samples.  I mean, buying a bag is an investment!  Also, remember that the staff gives you mixing options:  you can layer the flavors or completely shake it up and integrate flavors.  If you are not creative, you can just order the signature Scottsdale mix. \n\nThe pricing is very fair on the actual popcorn product.  I wasn't a huge fan of the pricing on the decorative containers for the popcorn.  I guess it's just premium \"convenience pricing\" -- fair enough.  \n\nHere are some of my favorite combos: \nSpicy Buffalo Wing + Ranch\nSpicy Buffalo Wing + White Cheddar\nBeer Cheddar + Ranch\nSouthwest Jalapeno + Ranch\n\nRemember:  this stuff makes GREAT gifts!
