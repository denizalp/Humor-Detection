Finally had a chance to try this place last night and really enjoyed it!  I'm known for advocating for local ingredients on menus and was thrilled to see mesquite woven into more than one token recipe.  I very much enjoyed the mesquite-laced chicken and dumplings.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought the food was a little bit salty.  That may be what helps keep it true to its Southern cooking theme, it's just hard on my body the day after.\n\nI will definitely go and try other dishes though, it's good enough to not let that stop me!
