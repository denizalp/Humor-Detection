I recently purchased 5 ceiling fans from Arizona Fans & Blinds.  The customer service from Clark was outstanding - Clark was \"no pressure\", allowing me to take my time looking at the store displays as well as the catalogs.  Installation (included in the price of the fans) was scheduled within about a week - installers Logan & Patrick arrived on schedule and were friendly, professional & efficient.  The fans not only look great but they are all \"whisper\" quiet.  I was so happy with this experience that I have ordered vertical blinds from the store (Clark came out the next day, measuring the patio doorwall and presenting me with several sample blinds, again allowing me to take my time as I chose the blinds style that I liked).  I would highly recommend Arizona Fans & Blinds to anyone looking for these items.
