As many times as we have been to Vegas I can't believe it took us this long to check out this iconic restaurant on the edge the strip. First things first! That decor! It harkens back to a better time. I felt like I went into a time warp. The portions are huge and everyone loved that you could choose a muffin instead of toast as your side. P.S. you have to try the muffins they are amazing! Make sure you go. The menu is literally like 20 pages long(JK but not quite) and sure to have something there for even the chooseiest of eaters. Check it out! You won't be sorry.
