I don't even want to know how many times I've gone to IKEA since I've been down here in Phoenix. IKEA, for being as gargantuan as it is, makes me claustrophobic: you step in, go up the escalator, and then try to find your way out which is pretty much akin to a hedge maze, while there are wood hangers for $1.99 and wall clocks for $2.99 and cheaply made hand towels which begin disintegrating as soon as you bring them home for $3.99, all to throw into your complementary huge yellow plastic bag.\r\n\r\nBut, as a guy who hates shopping, IKEA pretty much has everything you could need to fill your place up so that you, too, can feel like an upstanding descendent of a wayward Viking. In fact, I think I'm going to brave the Sunday crowds and go back there today. I may be a glutton for punishment, but I think I need a rug.
