I was pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. I got the tuna melt with fries and holy cow was it good. The tuna was tasty and you could tell it wasn't some cheap garbage tuna paste - it was quality tuna, done perfectly. The fries were crispy, delicious, and absolutely perfect. Will definitely be going back.
