Three words:  Ten.  Cent.  Roulette.\n\nThe restaurant isn't open anymore.  The blackjack tables are also closed now.  But roulette, oh ever so loving, ever so cheap, ever so wonderful way to kill time while you're in Vegas.  And of course, you get drinks - while you play ... TEN CENT ROULETTE.\n\nI hope this place never closes.  We go here everytime, just to make sure.  Just to make 'one last visit.'  In case our next trip doesn't grant us the luxury.  Don't worry about it being far from the strip - your wallet will thank you.\n\nMost of the staff has been transferred to Jokers Wild already, so they do have some new ones in, but well, you can't blame em.  After all, they are getting tipped off dimes, not dollars.\n\nThey also have the Leroy's kiosk for your UFC bets (or whatever other sports you must bet on).
