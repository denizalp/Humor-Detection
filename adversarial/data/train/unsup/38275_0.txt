They have a beautiful dining room. They have the prices to prove it. I just wish the food was better.\n\n Ordered the chicken tom yum soup. I ordered the small for 8 dollars. I thought I would get more than just 1 3\/4 cup of soup. It was REALLY sour. I ordered it medium spicy and it didn't taste spicy at all. The broth was flavorless and the chicken was tough.\n\nOverall, If this place wants to charge Lotus of Siam prices for Lotus of Siam portion sizes, they better have amazing food... unfortunetely its subpar. You'll get better portion sizes for a cheaper price with better quality food at the Pin Kaow down the road on Eastern about 3 minutes away.
