The place could have changed but my memory of it was of flavorless food surrounded by tasteless people with flashy gold jewelry (I'm talking the guys here...the girls were a little too brassy blonde). Maybe the place has changed though...I'm only giving it two stars because maybe it has gotten better but Crescent St was always...well if you can't say anything nice. For good food and a great time, there are a gagillion better places than here like L'Academie on St.Denis.
