This is the hotel closest to my house and I frequent here a lot. The feel of this casino is so laid back with a home style feel. One is not so close to the strip here so all the glitz and glam is more reserved for the main part of the strip. Here I feel the customer can play some bingo, which is not just for older folks. I enjoy it too! Gamble at the many casino gaming machine where they still offer black jack. \n\nThis last visit to the casino I took the twins to see Dead Pool 2 and the Century theater is so great here. We always enjoy the movies here. We also ate at the buffet and it is one of the best that I have been too. It is so huge and they offer so many different types of food. Wow! So when I need chill time they cater to us adults too with a cafe that one can enjoy a great steak dinner under $10 and 24\/7 too great way to pass the time.
