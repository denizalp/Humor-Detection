This review is long overdue. We got here around 1pm, and all I saw in line were:\n\nbeautiful caramel,\nbeautiful coffeepot,\nbeautiful chocolate,\nbeautiful toffee,\nbeautiful pecan,\nbeautiful licorice.\n\nShades doesn't matter, heart makes the lover.  However, our group was looking for a mixed crowd and with a line of 50 people at 1pm, methinks not.
