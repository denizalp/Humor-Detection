Service here has been a consistent struggle clearly for management.  Lot's of mass production food and process sold as made to order.   Food arrives half hot...half cold every time.   Staff not trained to keep pace with the complaints heard coming from other tables.  Profuse apologies abound.  \n\nIf not for my father-in-law who loves this abuse, and complains profusely at every visit... I would not eat here.  \n\nPerhaps it's just this location.  I would love to eat at their flagship store to compare.  \nIt's not working here, that's for certain.
