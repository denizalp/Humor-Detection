Protip: Sit by the kitchen! I got some really good cooking tips. Also you can pretend you are a judge on Iron Chef in Kitchen Stadium. Allez cuisine!\n\nMy husband and I came for our anniversary and opted for the Chef's Menu and a fancy cocktail. Overall, we had an awesome time and the food was worth it!\n\nA few things that stoodout:\nThe bread- The bread with tomatoes was simple, but may be the best bread I have ever had. It had the most crisp crust and softest feather bed inside. Wow!\nThe Paella- I've made paella, and a pretty good one at that, and I was very impressed. Well balanced flavors, a good variety and quantity of shellfish and the rice was the perfect texture. Socarrat perfection!\nThe Basque cake- Whoa... just whoa! The cake is so moist, but also has a slightly crispy crumbly caramelized layer around the outside. The sour cream custard was outstanding and paired perfectly with the tart fruit compote. Flavors and textures are light, but very complimentary and harmonious. I want to eat this everyday forever.\n\nI am so glad I finally got to this place on my Dream Food List (what, you don't have one?! Make one now!), I definitely had a 5 star experience. I will be back and you should too!
