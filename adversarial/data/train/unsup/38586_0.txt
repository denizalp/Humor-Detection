This was my first time at this location and also my last. I understand today is Easter Sunday and no one really wants to work that day, but both female employees were incredibly disrespectful regarding my experience. After placing my order of two items, I immediately got a blank stare from the cashier and a snippy \"what?\" after I read what I wanted word-for-word off of the menu. Despite wanting to order more, I left my decision at that not wanting to piss off the girl any more despite the very short line at the time. I then had to wait 5 to 10 minutes for my Coolatta to be made, not sure if they forgot about it but when the other female employee was alerted about it she said \"Oh, that stupid Coolatta\" right in front of my face! I don't know what happened to customer service at this place but it was certainly lacking. They did give me a larger size Coolatta, whether that was intentional or not I don't know, but that does not make up for the display of unprofessionalism that these girls exhibited.  No apology was made and the girl who made my Coolatta was completely silent upon giving me my drink. The male employees were fine, but the ladies need to learn to be much more lady-like. Terrible.
