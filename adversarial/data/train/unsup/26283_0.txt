As far as places to eat on the cheaper side on the strip this place is a good choice. The pizzas are definitely bigger and have more toppings than your average 5-minute create your own pizza adventure place. So you can probably get away with sharing one here. The tartufo was really flavorful and definitely should be tried if you like mushrooms. The fresh arugula at the end really balances out the richness. If you're looking for a casual place to dine where you don't want waiter service you should try here.
