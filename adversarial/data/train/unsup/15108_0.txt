FOOD POISONING\n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, especially after being a huge fan of this place. But 3 out of 4 people in our dinner party Tuesday night ate the hamburger sliders. My fiance..who has an iron stomach had a little stomach ache Wednesday night, but my friend and I at about 2 am both were doubled over in severe pain and I finally went to urgent care. All symptoms I have been experiencing point to E Coli...if I am wrong on that its still definitely food poisoning bad enough I was put on antibiotics and told not to return to work until Monday (I work in a kitchen and its health code) besides I barely still have enough energy to walk my dog let alone work. I have lost 600.00 in wages due to this and been completely miserable. I called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and tried to be accomodating saying they would take care of us the next time we came in...but I am still out basically a whole months rent because one of their cooks didn't abide by proper cooking procedures and health codes. I am worried how many other people are sick from them this week and IF Firefly did in fact take the sliders off the menu until they could investigate the situation as they told me. Please contact me if you see this and were also hit with a case of food poisoning or better yet contact the health department. If FIREFLY is resolving their situation and fixing this then they wont have a problem with the health department. But if they disregard this issue then more people could be at danger which is why they must be contacted. More than 2 cases of food poisoning from the same item on the same day is considered an outbreak...I have 3 cases already. Lets protect our tourists so they want to come back. I promise that if I find out they have fixed and followed proper procedure I will update my yelp and encourage people to go back but for now I just cant.
