Loved this place!  We were there for dinner last night and it was a fantastic experience.  We started off with an awesome server (thanks Adrian!) who was not only well versed in the details of the menu but also extremely thoughtful and fun to interact with.  Followed by craft cocktails, which were both great, you can't go wrong with half off at happy hour either.  The food was just as good, we shared both happy hour plates and dinner, all which were excellent.  Wrapping up the night was the best experience I've had with restaurant management since I've been in Vegas, Katie Strzelec worked out a complication we had using a gift card and could not have been more gracious or easy to work with.  All around great experience, we'll be back.
