This tiny park has the basics: a walking loop, dog pop bag stations, a covered pavillion with BBQ pit, and a playground with adjacent seasonal splash pad. The parking lot is really small and the nearby school causes it to get pretty busy with waiting parents in the afternoon, so it's not the most peaceful place to chill. However, it's right across the street from a fire station, so it's very clean and safe.
