City living without the city traffic.  The rates are reasonable for young professionals moving to Pittsburgh, who work downtown, etc.\n\nIt's a short walk to the Penguin's hockey arena and to the heart of downtown.  Several grocery stores are within a five minute drive.  It has a 83 walk score (very walkable, see walk score website for more details).\n\nQuiet neighborhood with mostly UPMC employees and Duquense University students as your neighbors.  Recommend if you're coming from a big city and want to transition to a smaller city like Pittsburgh.
