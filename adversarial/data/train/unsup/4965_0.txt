This is a really nice store.  I had never been in there and just popped in when I had some shopping to do at a neighboring store.  Good thing too, because I actually found a few things my husband has been looking for and hadn't had any luck finding in his recent searches.\n\nThe store is huge and has a lot of stuff to look at.  It is almost overwhelming, but is saved by each individual sports section being labelled so you can head to cycling without having to search through football to get there. The store itself also flows nicely.  Some sporting good stores seem to cramped and just stuffed full of everything you can think of.  This store is laid out nicely and you don't feel like you are on the show Hoarders.\n\nThe also stock a lot of different sizes.  My husband is 6'4\", so finding clothing items for him can be a challenge.  This store had sizes from XS (I wish) up to XXL,  as well as petite and tall sizes in both mens and womens, in the areas I was looking.  It is a nice change from many stores that only have the smaller sizes. Chubby people like my family play sports too you know!\n\nThe only down side was that there wasn't many people working the floor.  I had a question about an item, but I couldn't find anyone to ask for help because the only 3 people I saw were helping others.  I waited for help and eventually got some, but for a store as big as this one, I would have thought there would have been at least 3 more people on the floor for customer service assistance.  It was the same at the check out area.  There were only 2 cashiers with a line of about 6 people ahead of me when i got up there.  It moved slow, but the cashier I had was very apologetic of the wait, as well as happy, so that made it a nice note to end on.\n\nOverall, good store and we will be back for more stuff in the future.
