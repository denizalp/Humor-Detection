Hash House a Go Go? How about Hash House a Yeah Yeah! As a foodie, I'm appalled for never knowing about this place, even if it is a chain. My cousins turned us onto this joint and it's one that will go on in the memory book.\n\nThe food is freakin' fantastic! The portions are huge! The price is quite affordable! The menu options are outstanding! And now I'm freakin' hungry!\n\nWhatever you do...next time in Vegas, go visit the Hash House. Especially if you ever crave Chicken and Waffles! YUM
