What an amazing place. My mom said that I had to go here and she was right on the money. The service was great, my waiter was super nice and took good care of me. I had the chicken and biscuits and a side salad, perfection. The pepper jam had me nervous but it was spot on. Nice place, reservation was ready when I got there and the food was spectacular. I'm excited they are opening on in LA.
