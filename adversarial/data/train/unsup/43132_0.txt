Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Super friendly people who welcome you and send you on your way with a smile on their faces.  Hands down the best potstickers we've ever had--the layers of flavors were apparent and they were downright delicious.  Crazy noodles and Pad Thai were super yummy.  This is our new favorite place.  Mint Cafe is head and shoulders above Ty Fun in Tremont and I thought Ty Fun was the best Thai I had found in Cleveland.  Now Mint Cafe is!  Rock on.
