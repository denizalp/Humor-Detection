Tables, Chairs, Linens, Umbrellas, Utensils, etc... these are things you rarely think about but when you go to large events, they do come from somewhere.  And these are things I've had to think about recently when I've planned larger scale events for the Yelp Community.\n\nLuckily, Andrew's Rentals has been great for supplying the basics that I've needed with wonderful customer service, decent prices, delivery, and more.  They've made my life a lot easier - yes, I know I get stressed, but imagine if Andrew's Rentals were not there to help?!\n\nAnyways, I've used Andrews Rentals for the high top tables and the plastic tablecloths at the Heard Museum event, and most recently, Andrews Rentals supplied the six foot tables and black linen table cloths that the vendors used at the Yelp Rocks! Martini Ranch event...\n\nBoth times, they delivered as promised with no major problems... \n\nIf you're in need of anything for a house party to a wedding or major corporate event, give Evelyn at Andrew's Rental a call... she's a doll and I guarantee from my experience that you'll be in good hands.  Party on!
