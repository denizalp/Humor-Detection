Great neighborhood gem with an intimate atmosphere. Everything we ordered was perfect and the specials were fantastic. The scallops were my favorite along with the mushroom fricassee side. The chef greeted us at the door and also checked on us after the meal; great guy with a passion for the food. Service matched the caliber of the food; very knowledgeable servers that have been at Terra for years\n\nThis is the place to impress your friends and family.
