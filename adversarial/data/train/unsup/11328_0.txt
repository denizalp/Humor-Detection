I cut a  my nerve in my finger and had it operated on and it never healed . After my physical therapy ended I was in so much pain so I looked for alternative treatments . I called this place and saw they offer some electric stem treatment . I said how is it different  from my physical therapy electric stem , they said  we use these cups and it's more power . When your in pain you will try anything.  I drive over an hour several times a week for months to get this treatment . After so many treatments it didn't work, so I stopped going . It's basically an electric stem I was getting in physical therapy , no different . You can also buy them at cvs. \n\nI Recently received a call I owe a very large amount of money . I said but  before I started coming you said my insurance covered it and I payed $25.00 copay plus additional $15.00 on top of that .   I said why didn't you  tell me , I've been coming for 5 months . She said they did cover it , $2.00 of it . \n\nBe cautious , they lie and tell you your covered up front  , then they wait  wait until you stop going to bill you so you never know . You will get huge bills in the mail . Insurance companies don't cover there electric stem treatment or any of the Dr . Visits . Don't take advantage of people because eventually you'll get caught !  Especially people in pain who are not working because of an injury .
