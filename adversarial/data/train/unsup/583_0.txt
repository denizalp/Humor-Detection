I really wanted to like this bbq place in the new neighborhood, but it was just lacking in the food and terrible on the customer service side\/caring about customer policy. \n\nFood was ok, nothing too amazing. After I tried it, I said to my husband, I thought it would be at least like Famous Dave's- not a very high bar in my opinion to start with. \nEspecially for a non-chain!\n\nPulled pork sandwich was just meh. Pork was dry and portion size was lacking. Mac n cheese was ok- but pretty sure it's the velveeta packet that got it there. Creamy, which is yummy, but nothing special. Sweet potato fries were good. But NOT worth the upcharge! (See below- they have a case of the upcharges) I think they care about the money over the food-- what genuine BBQ joint puts a bottle of ketchup on the table and NOT a bottle of their BBQ sauce?? I would bet you an upcharge that a side of BBQ is an upcharge! For shame. \n\nHubby wanted the smoked chicken, but they were out. To which the waitress suggested they could sub 2 chicken breasts. Cool. She also said they had green bean casserole. Awesome. \nHis meal came with 1 and 1\/2 chicken breast. GBC was straight up school cafeteria style from a can. Corn bread muffin could be used as a pelting object- not quite concrete grade to knock out a tooth but would leave a mark. \n\nBut the worst part-- the BILL!! Turns out Bubba Q's has a case of the upcharges!! I hate this so much in a restaurant. 'Here are all our sides: $2.50. OH-wait- you chose THAT one!! $1 upcharge!' \nJust put it in another category!!! \n\nOr when it is not on the menu- the waiter better say it or NOT charge it. Only gets me more pissed that it's for dumb stuff like green bean casserole! Why would that cost more than baked beans? They act like someone handmade the casserole! Oh yeah- the probably did open all those cans by hand! Upcharge!! \n\nI even brought it up to the waitress, who knew it was our first time there and she was like- oops, I should have mentioned the upcharges! The meal we wanted was $12.99- the subbed meal with 'two(read 1 1\/2 small chicken breasts) was $14.98. Why?? Because upcharge baby!! \nShe even said 'gee, you probably think Bubba Q's is all about the nickel and diming' but didn't fix the bill. So yeah, I don't think it, I know it. Insult to injury when she knew she should have told us and didn't, and then copped to it but didn't fix it. As a note- I still left a classy tip- 15% rather than my usual 20% and above. \n\nI won't be returning. I hear Wendy's BBQ pork is better? yikes-- bar has been lowered further!!
