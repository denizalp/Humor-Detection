I used to shop at this store when they were in Chandler and I was so bummed when they moved to Scottsdale. Then fate stepped in...I moved to Scottsdale too!\nSome things have changed for the better in the new location.\nThe staff is always so sweet and they remember me each time I go in. They have everything from affordable costume jewelery to unique pieces I've never seen before. They also carry a small but very cute collection of clothes, hats, scarves, etc. They also have a great selection of purses. \nI most recently bought a $30 watch that looks like its works $100's. I get so many complements and its great quality.\n\nThis is a great place to find the perfect gift...and they have lots of BLING!
