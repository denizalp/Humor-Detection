Eating here, was an experience to say the least. \n\nMy friends and I got there around 10 one night, and we were the only customers there. We sat up at the counter, and got greeted right away. \n\nFirst thing the three of us notice? His gloves. He's wearing gloves,... but with the fingers cut off. Finger less playtex gloves. WHAT? He cooked with the gloves. He washed his hands in those gloves. Actually, 'washed' is the wrong word. He didn't even do that... he rinsed his hands. \n\nHe SMOKED in those gloves. Yep. Keep in mind that sitting at the counter, you have a full view of the back kitchen. Right after our cook\/server was done cooking our food.. he went into the back kitchen area and lit a cigarette along with some other guy, who I think was the delivery driver. WHAT?!? Who just smokes in the kitchen of a restaurant? Super unsanitary. \n\nFood wise, it was bleh. I got the chicken fried steak - as it's still my mission to find the best in Vegas. It was pretty tasteless and chewy - the gravy wasn't bad though. One friend got the hot pastrami. The cook took a little package out of the freezer and then proceeded to microwave it for five minutes. Threw it on the grill for a minute and put it in between a couple pieces of bread. My other friend got a burger. It was so so. Nothing special, nothing too bad. \n\nWould I come here again? Not if it's the same guy cooking. Smoking in the kitchen? Please. He could easily step outside to enjoy his cigarette. I like to go drinking downtown, and it's one of the few places open late. So, I'll probably end up there again - if I can get myself drunk enough.
