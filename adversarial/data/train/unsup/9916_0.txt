Hipster kids are taking over everywhere ... from Mumbai à Montréal ! I'm pretty sure a couple of monied Indian expat Millennials who study Chemistry at McGill tripped balls on some new laboratory\/designer party drug one fateful brunch, saw the Universe as it is, and decided to open up a restobar smack dab on the corner of boul. St-Lau and rue Sherbs.\n\nThese folks are go-getters. They make a pretty mean chana samosa. I also had their shahi paneer thali which was also legit. \n\nWhen you're hungry after hangin' at the bar or club and you're on your way home ... stop in late at night and have a hearty snack to soak up all of those libations and night caps. You won't regret it. \n\nNothing tops the evening like a nice piquant midnight snack at 3 o'clock in the morning. \n\nAsk the kindly proprietor to tell you about the thesis of her doctorate in Chemistry from McGill University! It's pretty much like Breaking Bad, Big Bang Theory and every single Bollywood film combined up inside of this piece.
