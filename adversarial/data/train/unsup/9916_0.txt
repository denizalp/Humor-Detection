I needed some stationary as a gift for my mother, so I went to Weldin's.  The lady who helped me was rude, and she had breath that smelled like old cheese, and top of it all she has three teeth, barley hanging on, pure meth mouth. \n\nWow, I felt like I was in the movie \"Deliverance\".\n\nI hate to go to Office Depot, but in downtown Pittsburgh, there is no option.
