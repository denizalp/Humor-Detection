I just had their classic burger with pepper jack cheese and sweet potato fries.  It's a half pound, grilled however you like it, and I must say it was delicious!\n\nI almost went to the Fatburger in the food court, but I figured I would give the cafe a shot, I'm glad I did.  I liked the food much better than Fatburger and it was a better price in a clean and comfortable place with excellent and friendly service.\n\nI will happily be returning to this cafe again.
