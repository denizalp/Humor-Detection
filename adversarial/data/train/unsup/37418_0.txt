This place is wonderful! It's very casual so the younger crowd will enjoy the atmosphere while the older ones will enjoy the deals. I ordered the two 18in one topping pizza, one cheese and the other with bacon. This New York style pizza is amazing on its own and for $21.95 you just can't go wrong. I'm a picky eater when it comes to my pizza (specially my crust) however I couldn't find one complaint. The sauce is incredible and the bacon was cooked perfectly. Most reviews I've seen give it a 4\/5 but I think it deserves a 5\/5. From the huge menu selection from pizza to the pasta, salads and sandwiches. I'm also giving a 5\/5 due to the fact that if you're simply wanting to stay in they offer delivery. I highly recommend this Italian restaurant to everyone. I promise you will not be disappointed. Love, Bug
