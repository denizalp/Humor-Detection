I've been here several times. And the food went DOWNHILL about 2-3 years ago. It's overpriced like crazy. It was blacklisted by me a long time ago...the breaking point was when i ordered some kind of vegetarian stir fry type dish and there was fucking birds eye frozen vegetable medley with peas, carrots and CORN in my dish. Corn, seriously, I didnt know that was a part of Asian cuisine. $14 for shitty frozen vegetables and rice. Save your $
