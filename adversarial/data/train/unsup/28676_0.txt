On Girl trip we spent the weekend in Old Town Scottsdale. We just by chance found this place. Obviously you need a reservation even in the 100degree off season. Were told a 45 min wait for an inside seat, 15 min for outside. It was 110degrees outside, yes we will wait for inside. Didn't have to wait the entire 45 min when paged our table was ready. We were taken up stairs to a 4 top. As we were being seated the hostess informed us there was a reservation for our table in 1-1\/2 hours \"Would that be enough time?\"\nUummm....that will depend on your service!! We've never been here....Just Wow!! She should've just said \"Heads up ladies, in an hour and a half we're going to be asking you to leave this table.\" It really put a bad taste in our mouth from minute one. The food was good, the drinks were OK,  but the policy of informing guest that they're going to have to leave in a certain timeframe doesn't sit well with most people. It didn't with us. So if you decide to dine here, make a reservation....
