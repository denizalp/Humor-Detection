Seriously Consider The Summerlin Enterprise Location For Your Next Car Rental!\n\nEric (manager) Is A PERFECT Example Of An Employee Who Strives For EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE\/SATISFACTION!!!\n\nThis location delivers awesome customer service everytime we have visited. \n\nWe called ahead ( about10 days ago) to request a certain vehicle to  accommodate our needs. It's not always guaranteed that the staff will be able to find exactly what you want, however the fact that they try is indeed appreciated.\n\nWe were extremely  pleased that on this particular rental,  they were able to provide a vehicle similiar to our request. \n\nI left happy and so did my husband. :)\n\nA Location That Goes Above and Beyond.\n\n5 Star Service With A Smile.\n\nAll associates here are friendly, helpful and  professional! Why rent anywhere else?!\n\nI definitely recommend this location for your rental car needs!! Enjoy!! :)
