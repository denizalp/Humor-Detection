Went in here for lunch the other day and was pleasantly surprised. I had the veggie Harvest sandwich and it was mouth watering and so flavorful! It was a good portion and it came with an unexpected pickle and side of popcorn, a definite bonus! I also really loved the house made garlic ketchup.\n\nThe staff here are friendly and my sandwich was made quickly. I'm not sure why this place has such low reviews. I would definitely go back. I only wish they had more sit down seating as it could be a nice place to stay a while.
