Went here for dinner on a Friday night around 9. Surprisingly it was not busy. We were seated at the bar section in a booth. We ordered the 2 for $20. \nApp=Texas cheese fries \nEntree 1-chicken pasta \nEntree 2- honey Chipotle chicken crispers\n\nTexas cheese fries are ok. French fries with melted cheese and bacon. How could you really go wrong with that? I like the house made Ranch that accompanies them. The chicken pasta was warm, almost cold. The chicken crispers didn't taste very good. I always love getting the chx crispers because the honey Chipotle sauce is good and its different. On this visit, I wasn't impressed. Service was fine. Nothing special. I probably wouldn't come back to this location.
