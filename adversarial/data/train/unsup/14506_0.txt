You don't have to be from another planet to appreciate the nutritious deliciousness of their Alien Burrito! Previously, I had never sampled the hearty fare available at Sunrise, but yesterday, I was in the hood and needed to eat. The Alien Burrito is a vegetarian creation that can also be made vegan. It is served up on a spinach wrap with refried beans, crunchy greens, avocados, hummus, cous cous, ranch, cream cheese... I am sure I am forgetting something, but I am not forgetting that I loved it. In Vegas, it is hard to locate quick, healthy eats, so this is a stellar find. Their menu is not large, but it is fresh and vegetarian\/vegan friendly. The burrito was more than enough for lunch. I washed it down with an iced coffee, and the coffee was perfect without sugar or cream. No bitterness. \n\nMoral: Don't underestimate their food!
