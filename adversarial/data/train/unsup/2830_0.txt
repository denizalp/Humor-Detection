This is our second year at Delta West Academy (DWA) and I couldn't be more happy with our choice. We researched many private schools before deciding to attend DWA. What appealed to us was the small class size, the sense of community that the school has and the fact my son could attend pre-K to grade 12 at the same campus. \n\nWhen talking to parents whose children do not attend DWA they are always surprised at the activities that my son partakes in. What other school has swimming 2 times a school year, skiing at the elementary level, Cooking class, Bring your parent to school day just to name a few. DWA is a fantastic school and I can not find the words to express how truly amazing the administration and teaching staff are. I would recommend this school to anyone who is interested in offering their children a superior education and school experience.
