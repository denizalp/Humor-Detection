Ordered a whole spread for a group of us for takeaway. \n\nThey claim to make Indian food. They do not. \n\nEvery meal plate was 90% rice, 10% order. Told me it would be 45 minutes to ready... Took just shy of two hours, not to mention luke warm upon arrival. \n\nFood was bland. Wouldn't save it for leftovers - and I love leftovers. \n\nTotal disappointment, would find it very hard to go back.
