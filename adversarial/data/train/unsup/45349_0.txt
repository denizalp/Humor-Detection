Very authentic for the area.   However, I wouldnt exactly call this \"100% authentic\".   It is definitely the most authentic we've had in NC.   There was a line out the door and only one server so we waited over 20 minutes before even speaking to someone.  We were seated but only received one menu so we shared it.   We were served after four other tables that arrived after us.  We ordered tea and water and our server forgot my tea.  The tea seems powdered.   Husband got Shoyu Ramen, and I wanted chicken katsu curry, but the chicken katsu is $8, apparently it's five additional dollars for the curry sauce.  So i ordered the Tempura instead.   It was very good.  We also got pork shumai, but there was hard bone bits my husband almost cracked his tooth on, and the consistency of the rest of the shumai was complete mush.  The gyoza I recieved with my Tempura was very good.   We ordered an additional side of gyoza and those came with barely any sauce and were burned black on the bottom.  His noodles were very good, firm, stretchy, chewy, delicious.   Very good flavor in the broth.  \n\nWe will be back to give this place another shot, they just seemed a bit too busy and a little understaffed.  Also, we wont order the shumai again, it just didn't seem right to us.
