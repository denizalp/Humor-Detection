My coworker and I were searching for ugly Christmas sweaters for a funny Christmas card photo. Savers and Goodwill were fabulous, but this store was a huge disappointment. It was dirty, smelled terrible and the clothes were by far the nastiest I've seen at a thrift store. Shirts had pee stains on them for crying out loud. Just EW. 2 stars because the pee stained shirt we bought was only $.75. You get what you pay for I guess. Goodwill down the road on Sahara is inifintely better people! No weird smells, better mechandise and much larger.
