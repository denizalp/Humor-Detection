day 15 - damn its already the third week??? where did the time go! do the la yelpers even notice i am gone??\n\nall these questions but beyond that, where to eat comes first. i went to arizona charlie's and signed up for their players card. and then came to the sour dough cafe. please note they no longer have the player's card meal deals. but they do have 3.79 steak and eggs or ham and eggs combo still served 24 hours. it was worth just a lil more than the price so it was great. i was filled, but i had too much gravy ingestion with my biscuits and was sick for a lil bit. i've really been eating like crap this trip. \n\ntip - if you sit on the counter, you don't have to wait in line. and you don't have to sign up for the player's card to eat here. the food comes fast and it aint bad. it gets 4 stars just cuz of the cheapness. ive had food this cheap in vegas before and it was really worth 2 bucks. this actually is worth 6.99! so you are getting more than you pay for!
