My girlfriend and I have come here a handful of times, I have not had one bad experience here due to the fact that their food is amazing and so delicious. The restaurant is basically a house so it's kind of close quarters and is the main reason why my girlfriend and me prefer to sit outside. We haven't had to wait long for our food so that's a major plus. We recommend it to people and I'm just waiting to go back to grub on some more food.
