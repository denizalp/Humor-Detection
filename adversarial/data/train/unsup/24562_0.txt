Think I had to do at least one star, as negatives weren't an option. Total, complete epic fail. I can forgive neon green \"fakearitas\", I can forgive that most of the menu items come with beans with the viscosity of hummus on diuretics. we're from the midwest... We know it's coming. However they obviously disregard our intellect for rudimentary Spanish. on the bottom of the menu, in Spanish, is a very terse invitation to \"our Spanish speaking friends\" to order all of the cool stuff ( menudo, tripe I think, etc) but kinda funny, all half dozen times I've asked to order from it I've been told no emphatically. tell u what amigo-bro, my money spends the same even if u don't think I can read Spanish. don't support these arrogant buffoons. Oh, and as to not hide from my perhaps jaded and infantile hostility to being reverse- profiled... food SUCKS
