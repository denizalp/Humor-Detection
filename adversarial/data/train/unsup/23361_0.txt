If I could give this place more stars, I would. Brew tea bar has the best tasting teas and cold brew coffee I have ever had in a boba shop. Not a fan of boba \"tapioca balls\/pearls\"? Their boba is a game changer: chewy, not too sweet, and not hard or soggy. The other toppings are equally amazing: egg pudding and grass jelly being some of my favorites. \n\nAs a loyal customer (since the Rainbow location!), I have tried many of their drinks and they all tasted so good! The quality, effort, and thought they put into everything makes a difference!  \n\nHighlights of my favorite drinks:\n - Cold brew with sea salt cream. Delicious smoky taste without the bitterness. The sea salt foam has just the right creaminess and the light salt enhances the flavor of the coffee, while balancing the sweet. You will be wired from this!\n\n- High mountain oolong latte. This is my go to if I don't get coffee. This tastes so good to me. Very balanced. If you're not a big fan of green tea or strong black teas. Try this! You'll be pleasantly surprised. \n\n- Okinawa milk tea - Brown sugar milk tea. I like 100% sweetness, but you can always ask for less. \n\n- Hokkaido milk tea - Creamy milk candy taste with a hint of toffee notes. A sweet drink that can be adjusted.\n\n*****You can even get a 50\/50 version of Okinawa\/Hokkaido*****\n\n- Rooibos - Earthy. Not sure how to describe this, but it can be an acquired taste...but! It's perfect for pregnant, breastfeeding, or anyone looking to try a non-caffeinated drink. Kids can even drink this tea.\n\n- Mocha slush - Another fave! Love the chocolatey goodness and perfect mocha taste!\n\n- Taro milk tea\/Slush - This is the real deal! Real taro! Elevate your drink with some egg pudding. Bomb!\n\n- Hot teas - Perfect for this upcoming fall\/winter season and anytime you're sick. I like the hot chamomile with honey and lavender brew with honey. Such a clean taste. \n\n- Iced teas - I like the kiwi and cantaloupe. Choose green or black tea. \n\nThey also have wintermelon tea! Just ask, last time I checked it was not on the menu. \n\nThis new location is spacious. I love the interior and the teas on display. What sets them apart is their amazing customer service. Every now and then you'll see familiar faces like Sou and Dennis. The new staff is doing great, especially with Julien there to run things smoothly. Thank you guys for being so good to your customers!!!
