Did not have a good experience at Green Valley Ranch.\n\nThe premesis are beautiful but that's where it's allure ends.\n\nFirst off, we were ripped off by some hidden $30 a night Resort Fee which they didn't tell us about when we booked.\n\nWhat were we supposed to do, refuse our nonrefundable room after we had already driven 6 hours to Vegas?\n\nNice scam. You got us! I could have stayed at a nicer hotel closer to the strip for what I paid including the hidden ripoff scam resort fees.\n\nSecond, I'd requested a nonsmoking room. We walked in and right away we wanted to vomit, because it smelled like smoke. You aren't going to trick a nonsmoker. We KNOW when someone has been smoking. All you are going to do is waste our time and yours by trying to pull that on us.\n\nWhen the bellhop came to give us new keys, he didn't even make sure we got to the new room or knew where to go. He pointed in some direction and then left. He was very rude.\n\nThe pool burned my eyes. Usually you have a strong odor or stinging sensation when they put too much clorine in. But after 90 minutes in uncomfortably COLD water at their pool (how you manage COLD water when its 105 out is beyond me) I got out and my vision was completely blurry. Someone told me it was \"chlorine burn\". This is very dangerous to have something in the water which affects your eyes so badly and yet is undetectible. I had halos and fuzzy vision for the next 12 hours. I have never had that problem ever in my life and I am practically a fish, diving in the ocean, pools, etc quite often. Their pool is dangerous. Don't expect to be driving or going anywhere afterwards until your eyes are normal.\n\nTheir drinks are a RIP OFF. They tried to charge me $28 for two weak, small pina coladas at the pool. When I questioned them they changed the price to $21 because \"I didn't get the puree\", whatever the hell that means. They tried to pull fast one #2 on me. Or are we at #3 now?\n\nThe cleaning lady was very nice. They must treat her horribly and completely overwork her. Because when I let her into my room and all she had to change were the towels (I'm a dude, what do we need room cleaning for?) she bowed at me and said thank you like I was some great, merciful master or something. Treat your cleaning people better!\n\nWe checked for bedbugs. Didn't see any signs in the sheets but my friend had bites a couple days later.\n\nOverall I had a very negative experience with this hotel. Unless you like being ripped off, nickled and dimed to death with hidden fees, and treated poorly, I highly suggest you stay far away from this hotel.
