My husband and I visited this store after reading about it in the Wisconsin State Journal. I regularly buy almond flour and raw nuts, the latter for my own trail mix. I was surprised at how much cheaper this store is than others. My only concern is that they don't have no- or low-sugar dried fruit (nor do other stores I've searched); however, I was assured that, with others expressing the same desire, it is actively being sought. Another positive is that they have spices at a much lower cost than grocery stores. Plus, the place smells heavenly! We will definitely be returning.
