We went last year and had a blast so we bought our tickets pretty early this year for the discount. We got there yesterday at 3 and left at 430. Why? Because it was too freaking hot for anything. Even sitting in the shade. I kept drinking water and misting myself and that didn't even help. Last year it was later in September so it wasn't nearly as hot but this year it was MISERY. It wasn't fun. The few booths we did get to no one was really trying to pull you in because I bet they were hot too! And there weren't nearly as many free swag and contest things. I was so disappointed and we'll definitely pay attention to the calendar and line up (really? No Hilary Duff last minute so you add an American Idol nobody??) next year before we buy tickets.
