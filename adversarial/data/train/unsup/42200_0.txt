Pros:\nA good variety of options\nGreat quality and ample quantity\nCreative menu with very visually appealing food (its red velvet pancake is a must!)\nCozy and well-designed interior\n\nCons:\nLong line ups (It took us 45min till we were seated! Be aware of extra waiting time for groups more than two!)\nA bit pricy! \n \nOverall recommended for sure! You'll get a memorable experience!
