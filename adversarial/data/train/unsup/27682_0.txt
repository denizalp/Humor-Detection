This place was decorated beautifully. I went in when it was kind of busy but got my coffee pretty quickly regardless. \n\nI ordered a regular drip coffee. Tasted average. Prices are a little more than other places but it's in a nice area so I suppose that's to be expected. With the price however, I expect a little more. There were various options in the  fixins area (sugar, sugar syrups, milk and cream), but it would be nice if they offered agave as an alternative to sugar. Or real honey (and not honey flavoured syrup) for people having tea.
