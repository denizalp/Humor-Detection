W Burger Bar is a hit if you're hungry, not poor and in the Yonge vicinity. It is far superior than heading to chain city at Yonge and Dundas, plus they have cheap beer. That's right folks, cheap beer and fancy burgers. Hard to go wrong. \n\nHow cheap is the beer? 20 ounce PBR for $4.50. That's dive bar prices in the heart of downtown. Unlike most high-end burger joints, W Burg Bar gets you with the food, not the drink. \n\nThe lamburger is $10 before a side and without any fancy toppings added. Some topping are free, but they charge for cheese, and things like avocado will run you an extra $2.50. Careful, friends, this can add up. \n\nThey have plenty of side options including various poutines and sweet potato fries. I had the panko crusted onion rings, and I will have them again whence I return. Love me some flaky rings. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For the cheap beer, obvi, and they have boozy milkshakes. Drink up!
