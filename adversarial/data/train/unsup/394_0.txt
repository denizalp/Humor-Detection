Oh Canada. You so crazy. Ice fishing right downtown, steps from the beautiful architecture and sweeping lights of Old Montreal is quintessentially Canadian and worth doing, even if you don't catch anything. We sat in a heated hut around the holes in the floor, jigging our lines and laughing hard at how freezing we were and how strange our life choices. My advice, wait for a warmer day, and plan on an hour or two, and maybe find out if the restaurant on the ice have got their liquor licence before you go.
