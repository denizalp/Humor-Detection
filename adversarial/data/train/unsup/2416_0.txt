I've been here a few times... Each time has been a different experience for me... All have been good... With the last being exceptional. \n\nThe Decor reminds me of a small cafe by the beach in Carlsbad... It's colorful and calming... Every table has an outlet... Which is perfect if you want to take a working lunch break or study... \n\nThe service is pretty good... Lots of friendly smiles. Menus and water are always delivered in a timely manner and the food always comes out quickly. \n\nThe food... I've tried the hippie chick burger (flavorful and exceptional... One of my favorite vegan burgers ever)... The nachos (I'm not a nacho person but they were good and full of all the nacho fixens)... the zucchini sticks (definitely good and crunchy but I'm not a fried finger food person), the Mediterranean dinner (amazing! And had everything a girl in the mood for Greek could ask for), the raw wrap (my favorite thing ever! Pesto was on point!!) the salads (all super fresh and crispy and large for sharing)... The black bean salad (I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, but it was really great flavorful and savory!)... The buffalo French fries (okay so I had only 1 off my friends plate because if I had any more I knew I wouldn't be able to stop eating them!) \n\nI believe they are currently in the works of getting a beer and wine license which is really exciting for me... I love wine.\n\nThey also offer a full smoothie bar... I've tried a few of them.. The blueberry is really good... Tastes like a blue berry muffin... And the coffee one is amazing... I bring my own protein and modify as needed. \n\nVegans and non vegans... If you haven't been to Violette's you're missing out...
