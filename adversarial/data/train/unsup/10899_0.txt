Honestly, Kyara is either a hit or miss and never in between. One day my skewers can be all oily fat with little to no meat and my takoyaki burnt around the edges and the list goes on with various misgivings... Other days I come in, and the food is just spot on perfect! \n\nWhat keeps me coming back are three things. \n\nIka butter\nIKA BUTTER\nI K A  B U T T E R\n\nJust so so good! I love to buy a salmon bowl along with my ika butter and use the left over sauce as an extra flavor in my bowl. It works wonders. \n\nThen there's the occasional diced beef steak and Kurobuta sausage which is always a winner too. \n\nKyara Japanese Tapas, no matter how inconsistent their meals, always keeps me coming back for its convenience. It's in the Southwest area, one of the only good restaurants open late at night, and has a poppin happy hour special!\n\nA great spot to grab some drinks with coworkers after a long day's work, eat your heart out, and have fun.
