If I could give this hotel no stars I would \n\n\nTo start off I waited in line to check in almost a full hour (only about 5 people ahead of me). Then once we were given a room, some of us were in bed sleeping, while some were changing and all of a sudden the door busts wide open and the lights turned on with an entire family standing there ! They had apparently been assigned to the same room that we had been given about 30 min earlier!!!! I was shocked and scared I no longer felt safe in my own room. We called the front desk to make them aware of the situation and it seem as if they really didn't care. Someone was sent us with a key to a new room, but it took them about a 1\/2 hr to get there and they just handed the keys and walked away, nothing was said! After about a 6 hr drive and checking in at 1 am, we were exhausted and ready for bed but instead we were dealing with packing up all our stuff again and this hassle. Once In the new room ( at 3:20 am!) we could barely get any rest due to that uneasy scared feeling we had. To top it all off at 9 am the house keeper knocked once and as I was getting up she came right in. I was in underwear and super embarrassed. It's ridiculous to think that an MGM property has such terrible security and service. The entire situation was dealt with terribly, it was so disorganized!  I've never had a bad experience in any other MGM property. \n\nThe manager we dealt with was Jessica. It seems as if that's something that happens often because they didn't really care.
