Damn good. Even though a lot of their customers are people who don't have time to wait in line at Chipotle, Guthrie's is always worth the trip down to the Steelyard. It doesn't feel like fast food and the folks behind the counter are way friendlier than anyone else serving fast food for a five mile radius. \n\nGet a box (not that you have a lot of options on this menu,) BUT DO NOT GET THE COLE SLAW. IT IS HEINOUS. Instead, you can get extra fries, another cup of dipping sauce, or an extra piece of buttery toast. It makes the box that much more satisfying. Then, take their dipping sauce and mix liberally with Frank's Hot. It's a dangerously good combination.
