This review is just on the 16 flavor ice cream\/sorbet tasting guessing game. What an amazing concept. There's beer flights, wine tastings, cheese tasting, tastin menus at 4-5 star restaurants, you have ice cream tasting! You are given a full plate of goodness, a sheet of paper to write down your answers, and when you are ready, the waiter goes over your answers with you. Such a fun guessing game. Interesting flavors and definitely some surprises that will hit you palate causing you to make faces of displeasure or decadence. If the ice cream tasting menu is awesome, I am sure the food here is too.
