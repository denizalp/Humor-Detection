This place is always super clean. The have someone always walking around making sure the tables are clean for the next client. The line can move a little slow but that's because they are making everything fresh. A few times I've had to wait when I'm the next person in line because the employees are talking which is a little annoying but the food is delicious. I lo e their fresh fruit drinks and their strawberries are amazing. I do miss their veggie chowder and I hope they bring it back soon.
