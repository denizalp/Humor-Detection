We are fans of Back in the Pack. More importantly, our pups LOVE IT there! If they could talk, they would have many stories of fun & hijinx with their buddies to share with us.\n\nBrian, Janice & their staff are true dog lovers. You can tell that as soon as you meet them.  Our Sadie girl was a bit of a chicken when we first got her - shying away from other dogs & sometimes people as well. She took to Back in the Pack immediately & watching her be so confident about exploring & being around other dogs (& people) was a fabulous moment for us.\n\nTheir facility is clean & well kept up. As owners, it is reassuring to know that all the dogs are screened to make sure that it is an environment that will work for them and the other dogs at the daycare. (We worry as much about the safety & comfort of our furbabies as we do our human ones.) We have never had a moment of worry or hesitation.\n\nBonus is taking home a tired dog! :) You know they have played hard and had a great time when they crash hard when they get home.\n\nAlso, they are fantastic at posting photos! Make sure to check out their Facebook page & Flickr account. Odds are you'll find some great ones of your dog.
