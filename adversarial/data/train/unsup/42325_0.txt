First the tow truck was two hours late. Then the tow truck driver recommended me to a \"reputable and fair priced mechanic\". The mechanic was obviously a friend to him but since I'm not native to Phx and I was obviously distressesed. His mechanic was not either reputable the store barely looked legal and his prices we not cheap. I ended up calling a different  tow truck service and having my car serviced by a mechanic I was able to do through research on. Do yourself a favor and never use this service.
