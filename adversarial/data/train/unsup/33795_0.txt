I didn't get anything done here because they wouldn't let me. I wanted to get my nose pierced and I'm only 17, so they said I had to have a parents bring me with proof they are my parents. I am adopted and was not going to bring all of my paperwork in to get my nose pierced. It was kind of ridiculous, but I guess it's the law. I went to south side tattoo who had no problems and didn't need to see anything but my moms license.
