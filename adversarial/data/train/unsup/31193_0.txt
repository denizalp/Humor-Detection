I've stayed at this hotel many times now. It's always clean as the staff typically helpful. The only complaint I have is that there no elevator, and when I have a lot to carry it's difficult. But clean and friendly trumps most things, so I don't mind. What's cool is that, though this is a limited-service hotel in and of itself, it's fully connected to the Sheraton. This means a bar, a restaurant, and even a Starbucks. Oh, and there's a Tim's right outside as well. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.
