Went to Lee's Liquor to grab drinks because it was convenient - we were there to grab dinner at the food trucks. When you walk into something that big it can be overwhelming.  I told the guy at the front what I was looking for and he had Mike help me.\n\nFirst, Mike in knowledgeable and super nice.  He definitely knows marketing and selling schemes and all I could think is I hope he is appreciatedby his boss.  Total asset to that business!\n\nEmployees like him are a reason businesses aquire a following.
