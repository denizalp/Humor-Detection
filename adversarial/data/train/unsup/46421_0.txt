VERY BAD EXPERIENCE\nIRRESPONSIBLE WAITERS\nWe made a reservation but after we got here they said there was no such reservation. We showed them the calling record, they admitted that this was their number but claimed that they don't know what was communicated on the phone therefore they cannot guarantee there is a reservation. IF YOH DECIDED TO COME HERE TO EAT, NO NEED TO MAKE A RESERVATION BECAUSE NO ONE CARES.
