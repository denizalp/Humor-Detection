I walked in there for the second time in the past 5 years, and I guess I'll try to avoid this place in future. I don't know much about shawarmas and they wouldn't even bother saying what the choices are that you can put in your wrap. I absolutely like the sweet sauce. I've had shawarmas in downtown places and they tasted much better. Sidewise A&A is better though. Overall I guess I kinda felt disrespected. Maybe they just didn't like me, but that didn't seem right. I didn't really do anything to deserve that.... Go ahead and try it yourself :)
