This restaurant holds special meaning to my husband and I. He was born across the street after his mom went into labor during dinner, and then we had our first date there 28 years later! We live in Mesa now but still make frequent special trips to this location because we love the food, the ambiance, and the service. Always greeted with a smile when we walk in, and when we bring our toddler, they try to seat us next to the fish tank for her enjoyment. I could drink their \"mild\" salsa from a glass and the \"hot\" has a perfect chili taste to it. My hubs will order the #1 combo without fail (taco, tamale, enchilada) and I go between the mini sampler, the guacamole dinner salad (not on the menu anymore, but ask for it!) or the Pollo a la Queso Crema. The Cadlillac margarita is great, too. A little on the pricey side for a casual dinner spot, but we've never been disappointed.
