What a nightmare folks...\nI was not going to write this review, but seeing that the 'guest services' attendant slammed the phone in my ear when I asked to speak to a manager, just put this whole situation into bad to worse mode.\n\nWe checked in at SLS last minute after bidding on priceline as we are due to go to the Trump Towers for the rest of the week, but they had no availability for us these first two days. \n\nMind you, we stayed here four weeks ago and had a great stay so we knew what to expect.\n\nWe checked in, the bell guys were amazing, dropped of our bags, got some amazing happy hour sushi at Katsuya, and then got back to the room to see what we thought was chocolate under our bed, only to uncover it was DOG POOP!!  \n\nA further inspection of the rug, determined that it was never cleaned!  Appalled, we called downstairs, and was greeted by a nice manager who moved us to the Lux tower into a lovely suite. \n\nExcited, we were going to post the lovely pics of the place, UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO GO TO BED.  That is where we saw pics of the unidentified 'items' when we lifted our sheets! I wont even attempt to identify what this is, all I know is that when I called and asked to speak to a manager (it being my 2nd time) the lady on the guest services line kept asking why. Mind you, its 130am and I'm exhausted from all this move with a big conference ahead. \nSo I asked more  sternly to speak to a manager and then she slams the phone in my ear. I then call back and another lady demands to know why to get to a manager (AT THIS STAGE SLS IS DEAD TO ME TO BE HONEST, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER). \n\nThe manager then comes on, apologizes, and says he's sending someone up.\n\nThe sad part is that this hotel has potential, but clearly they drop the ball on their staff and cleaning. I really enjoy the Beverly Hills having hosted a private event there in the summer, but this is just a horrible experience and the reason why we wont be returning here.\n\nThe rooms are gorgeous, but when u meet dog poop, and then 'unidentified items' on your sheets, and then the guest services folks are completely rude and disrespectful it spells a hotel that does not need my $$.  \n\nWhat a horrible night.\nThis was not worth the money or time.\nAs a million miler and super traveler, trust me you dont want to stay here, and if you do, check your seats and also rugs when you check in.  Beverly Hills ned to overhaul this place and shut it down before it destroys their reputation. Seriously this is nothing like LA.\n\nGood luck!
