My first time here was around 8:30 PM Monday January 30th. I ordered a rainbow roll and some tea. The rainbow roll was delicious and well presented. I can't wait to try their other sushi items because the rainbow roll was so good. I also ordered spicy chicken to go and some chicken potstickers. When I got home I just had to taste my takeout items which were supposed to be for tomorrow. Wow , I had to force myself to stop eating. The food is good. I saw some other reviews that indicated they didn't have tables, they are wrong now. They have plenty of tables. I will definitely be back for more. Bon app√©tit\nI just finished one of the best meals I've had in months. Chef James prepared for me the authentic Korean Version of BIBIMBAP . What I mean by authentic is that it was prepared with the crispy rice in the bottom of the proper hot bowl and topped off with an egg and his special sauce to pour over it to make it even more spectacular. Other restaurants make this dish however they just make it in a regular bowl and do not crisp the Rice the way it's supposed be prepared. They also don't have the intricate level of flavors that Chef James and his brother John puts in their dish. If you want to experience this dish you must ask for the authentic version. It does cost a little more however it's well worth it. Don't be in a hurry just come and relax enjoy some tea or soup and conversation until your food arrives. This is not a fast food restaurant, Everything is prepared from scratch so if it's crowded it may take some time. The sushi is great and so are the many other dishes on the menu.I normally don't write long reviews,but this time I'll make an exception since the food was exceptional.
