Taste for the love of food, Taste for the need to imbibe with outstanding cocktails, Taste to procure a culinary journey with a good friend, Taste to prime you up for a night of rip, roaring, rodeo fun! \n\nThese were all elements of my adventure with the Team at Taste! The husband and wife duo who work the small room with the extraordinary head chef, were an excellent foray for me, into the quaint culinary highs of small space eating in Calgary. Next time you are wandering around the 1st Street area, definitely duck in and see if there is a seat available. Oh, and make sure to order the chirizo meatballs... I think I dreamt about them last night!!
