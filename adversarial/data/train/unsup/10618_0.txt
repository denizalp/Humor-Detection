Located off the strip. I've been here a few times in the past. It's been a while since I've been here they definitely fixed this Casino up very nice. They have a nice layout. Some good eating places too they have a TGIF, Fuddruckers , Ondori and Prime Rib Loft and other small eateries. Overall a very nice Casino. And they are also part of the B-Connected properties.
