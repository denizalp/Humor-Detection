DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY!!!!!! The person who helped me was Mary Zhang, and she has a bad customer service and attitude.First, I asked her general ideas about applying for permanent residency about the requirements, then she gave me an answer \" why did not apply your residency yet? what are you waiting for\".I said excuse me I have not apply yet because I am looking for more information. After, I asked her to briefly take a look at my employment reference letter, and she said \"I cannot look at your forms unless you pay 300 dollars to review them\". So I asked her what the 85 dollars\/30 minutes consultation for? if you cannot briefly take a look at the forms and cannot answer question about how to fill up the forms?. She did not know how to answer and just told me if she wants me to review I would have to pay the 300 dollars fee, she has not professionalism at all. Their website says they would charge a certain amount for your application, but when you go there they give you a different price, and when I asked why in the website says a different price, she said \" depends in the case\". But on the website says specifically a price for the application. Mary zhang office is a cubic with no wall, anyone outside can hear what you are talking. No wonder the place is empty and has no customers.
