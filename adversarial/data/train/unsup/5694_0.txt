We checked in one evening and met the friendly registration host. He explained everything but missed one major detail (see below). We did not have to wait in any line for check in.\n\nWe were given room 505 which as a nice view of the pool that is under construction. This wonderful construction would wake us up before 7am each morning. We were not warned about construction noise by our friendly front desk.\n\nThe first night I was there, I was cold. So I turned up the thermostat. I woke up freezing so I turned up the thermostat to 80 and turned the fan on 'Hi.' Well, I woke up even colder. The next morning, I asked the front desk to check the thermostat. Apparently, the pipes either blow AC or heat. That night it was AC. Nobody informed me of this. Since the rooms have no central heat, they sent a space heater to my room. What a joke! A hotel that cannot provide central heat and AC at the same time.\n\nThe rooms are dated. The furniture is old. Some of the shelves on the sink were collapsing. There was mildew in the shower. The door frame of the bathroom was rusted through. The beds were not very comfortable and the linens and bedding were thin. \n\nThe Wifi was free and sloooooowwwww. \n\nThere is a nice Disney -esque fell to the lobby with fauna and a Koi Pond. The breakfast was not that great. The evening reception had free drinks.\n\nThe positive is the location. It is fairly central in the Biltmore area.\n\nOverall, this hotel was a grand disappointment. The location is good, but that is about it. I would never stay here again.
