Don't expect to be in and out quickly... takes a bit to cook the pie but it's pretty good.\nSat at the bar to eat with the girl because it was too busy to wait for a table so maybe our service was different but the girl was very nice and on top of things.\n\nBeing a Chicago kid... the pizza was good, better than most in Az but not better all.  Forgot what the cost was but wasn't that cheap.
