I didn't try the pho here, but their bahn mi is awesome. I'm originally from Seattle and I'm so happy to have found a place that sells Vietnamese sandwiches. Of course in Seattle you can still find them for a buck a piece, but I suppose beggers can't be choosers out here in the desert. My only complaints were that the restaurant smelled a little dingy and the young guy who helped me was kind of a jerk. Other than that I'd definitely go back for those sandwiches!
