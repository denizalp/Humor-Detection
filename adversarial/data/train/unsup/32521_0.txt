Lovely place for a business meeting or with a date. The ambiance is great for a romantic dinner but just as good for a professional gathering. I've been here 5 times in the last 3 years and have not had a single bad experience. Their service is top notch! Once you're seated, you usually get a presentation on what's available. The server would bring over a cart and showcase the fresh meats and vegetables they are serving that day.\n\nAs you may already know, this place ain't cheap! So, I usually come here when they have some sort of special going on. A few times a year, they feature a three course steak and seafood special for 2 for $120 or so. Its typically one appetizer to share, a choice of steak (filet mignon cut) with seafood (rather its crab cake, scallops, or shrimp), and two desserts (usually key lime pie or chocolate cake). Their steaks come out perfect every time I've been here. The steaks are flavorful and seasoned just right. They are grilled and then baked from what I can tell (you can see the their kitchen area). I also had their shrimp alexander which is basically grilled jumbo shrimp. The shrimp is flavorful and fresh (has a crunch to them). Their lobster tail is pretty good as well. The meal includes bread and dipping oil. The bread they serve is amazingly good. I usually pack it home!\n\nWould I say this is the best steak\/$? No, but their service makes up for their lack in value.\n\nOh, if you're on a date, (and if its going well...) you can ask to get your picture taken! They'll print it out and put it in a frame for you to take home :)
