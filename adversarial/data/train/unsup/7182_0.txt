Great Atmosphere! Wonderful artichoke dip. Nice wine selection. That's it. Leave after that. \n\nService was poor. The lasagna was reheated and served cold. The pizza was missing half the ingredients. My ice tea was left empty. We we never offered another glass of wine.\n\nThis could be a great spot! Just need some folks that know how to run a lil restaurant on a Friday night.\n\nWe won't bother giving it another try. To many great places in Phoenix.
