Great espresso, good baked goods, very slow drink service. When I say slow, I mean, I won't return unless I have ample time. The weird thing is that when I walked in I walked straight up to the counter and ordered.  Then somehow the guy behind me walked out with his latte before me.  Then the place filled up and there was a line of 7-10 cups on the counter and still no extra barista. If it took that long for my drink I can't imagine how long customer #7 waited.  They could have used another barista and\/or someone with front-of-the-house managerial experience.
