I really like Ho Su Bistro. I can only afford the higher class Japanese restaurants a few times a year but I really love Japanese food, so Ho Su for me is great for those times I really need an injection of Japanese cuisine. \n\nThe service here has always been very nice and accommodating. The place is clean and the atmosphere inside is warm but I wouldn't go too far and call this place intimate. The price and location make this place great for dates and tourist. \n\nThe last time I went to Ho Su, I ordered their chicken teriyaki, which was on special that night. I really like that with every order comes a few small dishes of edamame, kimchi and other treats.  The meal came in a bento box and had a few California rolls and tempura pieces to go with the chicken. The California rolls tasted okay but the tempura was simply delicious. Two large shrimps with a couple of yams covered in one of the lightest tempura batters I ever had. The chicken teriyaki itself was nice even though it was a little over cooked. I found it funny how I ended up enjoying one of the side dishes more than the main attraction itself. I also ordered an ice cold Sapporo beer with my meal. The best thing though was that I was full and it cost me about 20 dollars including tip and tax. \n\nOne time I went here I was dared by a friend to order a beer. Being only 16 that time and still looking like I was in elementary school, I was surprised that I actually got one. Maybe to the workers there I looked 19 but I was amazed I didn't get carded. With that story told, I recommend this place for all underage alcoholics. \n\nThere isn't a lot to hate about Ho Su bistro when you get good food for even better prices. If you want high end Japanese, this place is not for you but if you just want to chow down to kill those Japanese cravings, I would totally recommend you to Ho Su.
