I would recommend giving RJ Bolands a few weeks\/months to work the kinks out.  They still don't know how to function effectively as a restaurant\/bar.  Prior to an evening at the HOB, I suggested that we try RJ Bolands for drinks\/dinner.  We had quite possibly the worst server that I've ever had.  Aside from being rude, slow and brash, he even told us, \"You guys suck\" when we asked about separate checks.  That wasn't exactly what I was looking for when I recommended we try out the new place.  \n\nWhat makes me not give this place a 1 star - like it deserves, is that when I told the manager about our issue with the server, he could not have had better customer service with us.  I will try this place again, and may update my rating.  For now - I'll stick with my current assessment of the establishment.
