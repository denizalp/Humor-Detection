Just say you know Brandon.\n\n...Okay, don't say you know Brandon. Actually, to tell you the truth, I don't even know Brandon. But somehow, by name dropping some guy I don't even know, I was able to bypass the 2-3 hour line for Tao on Halloween, get in without cover (the guys in our group didn't have to pay cover either) and party it up on the dance floor with a bunch of guys in cow costumes.\n\n(Cow costumes? Wow, that's hot.)\n\nActually, I was never a huge fan of Tao, even though, both times I've been, I've gotten in without cover. The first time I went, the dance floors downstairs were playing house (not my thing) and I got into a huge argument at Tao Beach. (Yay for drama in Vegas clubs!...Not.) Considering that experience, I was a little apprehensive about going back to Tao again.\n\nBoy, was I wrong - Tao on Halloween was crazy! Like I said, I got to dance with a bunch of cows, the DJ's were bumping great dance music, they had Tera Patrick hosting\/emceeing for the night (although I couldn't tell if she was hot or not though), and it was just good times all around. \n\nNotes to remember: \n- Do not dance on the furniture (I found that out the hard way). \n- Do not bother going to Tao Beach - it's too crowded, there's really no room to dance, and the bathrooms are ridiculously far away from the general Tao Beach area (as I discovered during my first outing to Tao). \n- Worse comes worse, name drop Brandon. (Hey, it can't hurt, can it?)
