Friendly service, convenient location and comfortable hotel rooms. \n\nWhile many of the newer hotels on the strip might have stolen the spotlight for this once highly popular luxury resort, the Venetian remained one of my preferred places to stay.\n\nAll of their suites are spacious with excellent floor plans. The separate sunken living room has large sofa and a decent size dining table are great for having friends over. Be careful with the stairs though. The wooden floor could be slippery. \n\nRooms were in overall pretty good condition. Decor was slightly dated but amenities were well maintained. Ladies will love their bathrooms. The vanity table with the lighted makeup mirror really came in handy. You will have everything you need to look pretty.\n\nThe casino and lobby area were always busy with the main aisles crowded with  guests dragging their luggage around . Use the Venezia tower elevators if you could. It might be a slightly longer walk but you can bypass many of the traffic.\n\nThe location really can't get any better. It is at the heart of strip surrounded by the nicer hotels. Sephora and Walgreens were next door. Fashion show mall is just a short walk away and there are plenty of good restaurants to choose from.
