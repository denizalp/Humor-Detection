This place is hopeless. Every time I go in and ask where something is, the staff, who seem to speak very little English, look at me kind of helplessly. Without fail I have to say it three or four times, then explain in detail what the thing is that I am looking for, and then they say \"Oh we don't have it.\" Then I go look for it myself and eventually (usually) find it. Recently I went looking for the guy who does speak English, and when I said \"Excuse me...\", he barked \"Wait\"! At that point I walked out. Not worth the hassle.
