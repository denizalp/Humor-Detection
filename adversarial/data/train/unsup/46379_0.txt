Came here with a group of gals for a ..... girls night out on a Monday! Right by the water which was amazing! Friendly bartender and great cooks! Ordered beers and appetizers. Hmm. Let's see if I can remember correctly what's the menu?! Smoke fried chicken wings? It was yummy! Habanero chicken was freaking to die for!!! And the sampler. I didn't get to try the sampler because I had a party of hungry gals that ate it up but said it was yummy. Huge place!
