Never go to this place if you want a vch, the piercer doesn't know where the clitoris is located. I went in and was treated extremely rudely. The piercer, an African American \"gentle\"man, was rude and arrogant. He informed me he was the best piercer in Montreal, and then proceeded to try and pierce me with a broken glove. I was given a Christina and when I repeatedly asked him, \"are you sure that this is a vch\" I was told yes. I was also refused a receipt. \n\nI decided, after a few days, that I wanted a second opinion. I went to adrenaline, where it was confirmed I had received a Christina instead of a vch. They then proceeded to pierce me properly. \n\nI called 514ink to complain. The manager, who came off very ignorant, informed me that 514ink and adrenaline were apples and oranges. So I informed her that the clitoris and the apex of the mons, also, were apples and oranges and that it was unfortunate that their piercer was unable to locate the clitoris. \n\nRude customer service and an unclean environment. If you want it done right and clean, go to Adrenaline. You pay more but you get what you ask for, as well as, AMAZING customer service.
