Denny's has always been my drunken guilty pleasure. There's just something about the greasy diner food that hits the spot so a location on Fremont Street is perfect!\n\nI stumbled upon Denny's while looking for a spot to grab a late night bite to eat and I was immediately sold. I asked for an order to-go and told the hostess that I had about 15 minutes before I needed to be back at the limo for my ride back to the Strip. She assured me that she would tell the kitchen to put a rush on the order and, sure enough, it was ready in plenty of time. \n\nAs I was looking at the menu, I noticed that the infamous seasoned fries were missing. Instead, there was a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. But I asked the hostess and she confirmed with the kitchen that they do still carry the seasoned fries. I'm not sure why they're not listed on the menu but I really hope that Denny's never gets rid of them. They are my favorite! \n\nThe seasoned fries paired perfectly with my bacon-less Super Bird and the hostess even threw in two containers of ranch (score!). The Super Bird tasted so incredible that I've been busy trying to recreate it at home for lunch all week. Definitely one of my favorite sandwiches!
