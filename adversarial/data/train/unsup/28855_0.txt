I love Pastel! It's my go-to cafe in North York, and a great place for when I feel like spending some quality one-on-one time with friends. If you're important to me, chances are I've brought you here.\n\nThe cafe is small, cozy, and clean. My personal favourites are their smooth lattes and the brownie crepe. You get two scoops of the same flavour ice cream with your crepe, but you can always ask for different flavours.\n\nI love their coffee + crepe\/waffle special, and the cute chalkboard sign they leave outside in the summer. It's also nice to sit outside in the summer when they open their outdoor patio space.\n\nA huge plus is that they're open late, so Pastel is always there to satisfy your nighttime sugar craving. \n\nThe staff is always changing so there are no familiar faces, but everyone is always really friendly and smiling.\n\nA few things though (and I'm saying this cause I love you, Pastel!): \n\nThe fact that they're a cafe and use teabags is kind of embarrassing. I don't need to pay over $3.00 for a cup of hot water and a teabag.\n\nThey also need to put their Christmas decorations away, which they keep all year round. The nutcrackers are cute, but when you're there in the summer, it's weird.\n\nI think they also need to finally retire their second menu which is made like a photo album. It's outdated, and nobody takes the time to fully go through it.\n\nFinally, please stop using fake flowers out on the patio. It cheapens the place.
