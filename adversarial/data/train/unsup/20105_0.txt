This is one of the newer hotels, but people told me it was dark, for dudes, and not that great. The aroma is vanilla! I actually liked this better than the Wynn. The rooms were queen beds and the bathroom was nice and big. Although it is dark, but who wants to see the face of the guy\/girl you just picked up, the dark will just help with your beer goggles! \n\nOnly thing I didn't like, it was complicated using the technology in the room for the light switch, took us girls awhile to figure it out... but it was cool. I would book again.
