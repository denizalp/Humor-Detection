I thought that I had been to The Chip\" before but, not so fast ... Food with integrity Oh my what happened ?   Integrity  adherence to moral and ethical principles; soundness of moral character; honesty.. They throw stuff on a Burito shell  charge you $10.00 I am not a cheap person.. but Taco Bell with a Burto Supreme would have been alot better. even with Mystery meat. I see pretty high stars for a I think 92 health rating .. See my pictures if you want a Burito do not go here.
