Don't invest too much in the hopes and dreams of a bakery right here on Saint-Laurent, and you surely will not be disappointed. I was out in the rain, and happened upon a bunch of pastries in the windows, so I just popped in. I wasn't expecting anything special, and so I think that's why I had a nice enough experience. If you want an adorable French bakery on a street very near some iconic Montreal eats, teeming with Canadian charm and handcrafted goods... well... you've come to the wrong place.\n\nWhat you'll find here is a simple retail spot to sell pastries and other foods to passers-by. I seem to recall the woman there being from Croatia (?) and being nice enough. I didn't ask about the origin of the baked goods, but she did mention that she thought they would be busier that day and if she had known that they wouldn't be so busy, she wouldn't have ordered as many pastries. That leads me to believe they're a retail spot with a good location, selling pastries and other baked goods in a convenient spot. Which, you know, I have no problem with if that's all they're claiming to be. I'll pay for convenience.\n\nIn this case, I did pay for convenience. I selected a chocolate croissant, which the lady there offered to warm for me. We made polite conversation and I can tell she's an opinionated one. But she was sassy with me (in a good way) and I liked the banter. A few minutes later I had a warm pastry on a cold day, and I was back out on the street to enjoy. Simple, and convenient.
