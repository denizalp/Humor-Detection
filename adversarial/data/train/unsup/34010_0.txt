This is a small, yet charming bakery that also serves as a cafe. The drinks were delicious, they offer smoothies, milk tea drinks with boba and espresso drinks. The baked goods themselves are very good, I recommend the pecan pie, green tea macaroon, or the raspberry roll cake (although you can't taste the raspberries, it is still very tasty!).
