I love some fresh squeezed juice and jamba has been my go to place. I always get a citrus kick with spinach so yummy! \nAnd now I discovered the ginger shots that you can get with your choice of lemon or orange juice, if you like it spicy don't forget the cayenne! \nJessica is always here working the the register and is always smiling and nice. This location is always clean and has out door seating. \nThey also serve breakfast oatmeal until 11am so if you want to give that try get here early but if you don't make it by 11am try one of their delicious smoothie bowls (my fav is the island pitaya!)
