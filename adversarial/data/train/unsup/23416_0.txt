How you play me like this Sprouts? You give me a great deal on strawberries and then they grow fungus on them the next day? Second time this has happened to me. I can't be THAT awful at picking strawberries! I wish their strawberries were grown in the United States and not imported from Mexico. On the bright side, you always have great deals on coconut water....mmmm.
