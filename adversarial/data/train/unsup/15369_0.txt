Went for a classic Bun meal with vermicelli, shredded pork, a spring roll, and vegetables. Best spring roll I've had at a pho spot. End of the meal, someone informed me the entire menu is vegetarian. Mind Fuck. \n\nBig comfortable space, CP24 on in the corner, very friendly staff, and inexpensive. \n\nFree tea!
