A group of us celebrated our friend's anniversary at RM Seafood. It was such a treat to be in good company and excellent food. The service was incredible. Our waiter had us laughing, enjoying every moment, and just made us feel comfortable in an relaxing atmosphere. We skipped the appetizers and went straight to the entree. We started with the calamari. It was was cooked with the right amount of coating and not greasy. In a seafood restaurant, my friend's husband was craving for a steak and ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye. He was in heaven! It was so tender the juices were just pouring out. Then we were presented with our main event! Two orders of the kitchen sink! The presentation was overwhelming, but the fresh seafood flavor knocked us out!
