Just got driven home by a polygamist! Oh boy did he have an opinion! I am ok with people that have different views and ideas, but this guy just seemed crazed. I was actually worried and got out of the cab 3 blocks from home. I just didn't feel safe!!! I don't think he was drinking or doing drugs, though the second more likely, but I bet he has more cats then wives at home.
