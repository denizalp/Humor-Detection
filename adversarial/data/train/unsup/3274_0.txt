OMG. That slut was so good. lol\n\nI didn't know what to order, but that was what Yelp told me to order. Out of curiosity, I also ordered the homemade buttermilk biscuit. \n\nThe slut was so creamy and the perfect texture to spread on the toasted bread. Savory potato goodness. I loved it. So good for breakfast. The biscuit on the other hand was pretty plain. Nothing special about it. I actually prefer the one at Popeye's more so skip that. \n\nThe line is pretty long in the mornings, but moves quick. It only takes a while to get the food. They will call out your name or number. There is limited seating so you might want to take it to go.
