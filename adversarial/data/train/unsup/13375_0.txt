by far the worst complexes I have ever lived in. The price was right at first but now I'm wishing I had spent more so I wouldn't be stuck in this hellhole! the water trash and sewage fees are insane, almost 70$ a month for one person in a one bedroom. the apartments are old and full of crappy old appliances, even the toilets suck! parking is terrible and I usually have to park pretty far from my apartment, which sucks when I work late nights and usually don't get home till after midnight (I've never had parking issues at any other complex in vegas or henderson). The managerial staff is horrible and truly don't give a shit about the renters. One time a maintenance man turned up to fix my sink and reeked of alcohol. I was happy my boyfriend was home at the time. terrible terrible noisy smelly dirty place to live. cannot wait to leave!! wish I could warn more people about this place!
