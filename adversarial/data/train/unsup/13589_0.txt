We sat down upstairs in one of the booths by the bar area. We literally waited 15 minutes before my husband decided to hunt down the bartender and let him now we were there. The bartender said he'd said someone right away so we waited..\n\n10 minutes later and we're still waiting... My husband then went to hunt a waiter down and found out that they were just standing around talking. She then walks over and apologizes and takes our orders. We get food rather quickly and she barely comes around to ask if we're doing okay. Service was crappy and the only reason we stayed and spent our money there was because I work in the district and everything else was closed. I'm never coming to this location ever again. I rather drive to the Tempe Marketplace one anytime.
