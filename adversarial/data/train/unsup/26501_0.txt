This place only recently opened but it gets really busy. It's also pretty small so the tables fill up very fast. Regardless, you should dine in because the store is really nice and has good vibes. Menus are hard to read (maybe because I need new glasses) so they have a few mini menus in front of the cash register. The staff was nice but service could have been faster.\nI got a medium Iced Chai Latte ($4.65) good but very light chai flavour. I wish the taste was a little stronger because all the ice diluted the taste even more. \nThe Shakshuka ($9.95) was pretty good. It's two eggs in a warm red pepper and tomato sauce served with tahini and bread. It was tasty and very aromatic. I loved that the egg yolks were still runny because last time I got it at a different location, the yolks were fully cooked. They also gave more bread than I needed. \nAlthough I had a good experience, my friends did complain about the sandwiches being very small so keep that in mind when ordering them.
