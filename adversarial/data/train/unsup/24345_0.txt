Staff lies and then is rude afterwards.\n\nFirst the hostess could not understand our name 3x, and after finally getting it, still came back to ask it again. Apparently that was just the indication of things to come as he said that all tables are booked, but we'd have to wait about 10 minutes to get seated. When after 15 minutes I asked for how long should we still wait, I was told that it's going to be at least additional 15 minutes. When I asked why I was told 10 minutes when I arrived, hostess told that it is what it is, we should have made a reservation, and we could leave if we did not like something. Which we did. \nI will certainly never go to that place again.
