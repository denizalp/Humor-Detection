Great place for younger kids, older kids might be bored.  Our little one loved seeing all the lights and different characters.  We also got her santa photos taken here.  The wait was a little long for the photos and they didn't tell us about the photo options (i.e. digital downloads), so we were a little disappointed by that.  However, overall great experience for the family.  We got the unlimited pass, but I would probably opt for a regular pass.  The lines for rides is way too long to really do anything more than once.
