Here's an update...after repeatedly assuring me that I had $2000 in credit, I got a letter in the mail yesterday informing me that I was not eligible for any credit at this time.   Hmmm...do you think it was because, when they offered me their \"stellar\" deal, I walked out of the store?  Or maybe Big Brother is watching and saw the above review?  Either way, this company is dishonest and the name \"Conns\" fits them perfectly-what a bunch of \"Conn\"-artists!!
