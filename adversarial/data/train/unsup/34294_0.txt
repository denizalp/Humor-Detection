Came here with the bestie today for some adult time. We both had the 50 minute Swedish massage and lunch on the terrace. Both of our massages were relaxing and just what we needed. \n\nI always arrive early to take advantage of the sauna, whirlpool and huge lounges before my services. \n\nAfter the massage we had lunch on the terrace. I had the jalape√±o lemonade and we split the tuna tacos. We also each had the hamburger sliders, which were perfect after a relaxing massage, nothing too heavy. \n\nIt was a beautiful day so we took advantage of the private spa guest only pool and lounge chairs and soaked up the sun for a bit after lunch. \n\nThe whole experience was amazing and I can't wait to go back.
