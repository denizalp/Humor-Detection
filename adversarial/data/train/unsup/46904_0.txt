Well... you want to fly cheap, this is the one.  Even after adding the $30 luggage, it's still cheaper.  Bring your own water and snack (normal for any domestic airlines). The seats were spacious and comfortable comparing with other economy class airlines.  The only problem if you run into a problem (rerouting, rebook due to miss the plane, etc), it will take 2 hours to get a customer service picking up your phone.  They were very helpful though when you can reach them.  Check the name\/location of the airport properly as they fly the small airports.  Orlando meaning Orlando Sanford (1 hour from Orlando) not Orlando International.
