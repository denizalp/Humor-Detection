so we ended up staying here cuz the person whos name the room was under at mgm grand was a no show\/no call. not the worst thing to ever happen but definitely not something i ever expected. rooms were like $60 a night and damn they were small. alot of cops\/security around too... not sure if thats a good thing or not. we werent in our rooms hardly at all so it wasnt that big of a deal. It was what it was.
