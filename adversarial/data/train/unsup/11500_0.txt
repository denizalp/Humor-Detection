Finally tried this place out for one hour with three people at 1pm. Total cost was $40. You only need one membership card if you aren't really interested in keeping score or the other people  in your party likely won't be returning. It was fun, really nothing to complain about, except my golf swing. Only tried the chips with salsa and guacamole for $7 and that dish was worth the money. If you get the chance, go downstairs and they have the Wii and shuffleboard available to kill another 30 minutes. Will be back at some point, but plenty of room at the bar and food was good, so golfing is not even necessary on the return visit.
