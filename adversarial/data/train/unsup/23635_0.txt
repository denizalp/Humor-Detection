Legend Pot is a new hotpot place that I was looking forward to because a few family friends talked a lot of positive things about it.  I came here with 3 other friends on a Friday night, I was late, so I didn't have to wait to be seated, but I heard the wait time wasn't too bad.\n\nOther than the nice seating for this place and the individual pot concept, everything else were bad!!\n\n1) Huge communication barrier, all servers will speak to you in mandarin despite when you are talking to them in Cantonese or English.  If your customers cannot response back to you in Mandarin, it means we don't speak it!  So STOP ASKING us questions in Mandarin.\n\n2) First round of ordering was good, all subsequent orders, they tend to not want to bring the food out.  We asked for some meatballs and beef 4 times before they FINALLY come out with ONE plate of beef and one meatball per person.  WTF?!\n\n3) All soup base other than their \"water base\" requires additional cost, it's around $3 more, which is a big no-no for me unless the food you offer offsets the premium.\n\n4) Literally everything we ordered looked familiar, and after thinking for a bit, I realized everything is bought from T&T. No wonder they all look like the food I have at home when I do hotpot.\n\n5) My BIGGEST complain about this place is the misleading price they have on their menu.  When we asked for the bill, the server said if we pay cash, we will get 5% off.  So i was like, okay cool, we can pay cash.   The bill came and we did not see any 5% off, so we asked.  The server then said the price you see listed on the menu is for cash price, so if you pay with cards, you need to add 5% on top of that price.  WTF?! WHO THE HECK LIST THEIR PRICES LIKE THAT?!!\n\nNEVER EVER coming back here again.  Only positive for the night is, the Chinese deep fried buns which I will upload a picture to show.
