I came in today because I wanted to buy a new flavor for my vape. I almost walked past the place because I was expecting a different atmosphere, the interior looks like a tropical island! - NO JOKE.\n\nInside I was greeted by one of the associates and I told him I just wanted to look around for a little bit. He called me over because he wanted to see what kind of vape I had, and to my surprise he told me I had a knock off version of the Joyetech eGo C-Twist electronic cigarette. He showed me how genuine brands have the logo on the bottom, which mine didn't. I was astonished. The guy who I was talking with was busy with another customer, so he asked a different associate to help me out. This guy was very nice and was totally ready to answer all of my questions.\n\nI was there for the flavors so he started telling me which ones I might like. I tried them out and the flavors weren't as good as some of the other shops that I've been to, but it seems like this place is dedicated to customer service so I bet they will start to have a better tasting variety of flavors. \n\nUnfortunately I just could't taste the flavors that well, and I think it's because the tip that they use is extremely small. I'm wondering if they had bigger tester tips if the flavor would be better.\n\nNonetheless I settled on menthol.\n\nAs I was walking out, I noticed they didn't have any couch to sit on, just a round table with some chairs in the corner. I guess I was kind of disappointed there wasn't a better place to relax there, but maybe they don't want to do that.\n\nUltimately, I give this store 3 stars. I don't give out five stars unless the business blows my mind, so starting at 4 stars:\n- 1 star for having meh flavors \/ no bueno tester tips\n- 1 star for not having a better sitting area\n+ 1 star for phenomenal customer service & atmosphere\n\nAs always, I'll update my review the next time I purchase from there.
