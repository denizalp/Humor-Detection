Amelia C & Co is the answer to all your hair and makeup needs! Rob will swiftly and professionally handle all the details and coordinate the timeline perfectly!\n\nI had Amelia as my hair and makeup artist and she was absolutely amazing. She listened to what my requests were and then gave me the exact results I asked for and the results were fantastic. When we met with our minister prior to our ceremony he walked into the reception area where we were waiting and his first words were.... \"WOW your hair is beautiful!\" \n\nThank you Amelia for your wonderful professionalism, your witty charm and your beautiful artistic results! I would highly recommend for any woman wanting to look her very best to choose Amelia C & Co for her wedding or any other function where you need to look perfect. You won't regret it!
