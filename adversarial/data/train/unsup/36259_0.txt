This is my second time going to this nail salon. Being in the area tried several places and had given up. I found myself driving 10-15 miles to get by nails done . Once I found this place I read the reviews saw all the photos and I thought why not give it a try.. The first nail tech that did my nails was Adam didn't really understand him in our conversation during my nail session but he was really nice and made sure I liked my nails before moving forward.. The only thing I didn't like was after 3 days it looked like I needed a fill. He didn't fill or paint my full nail (if that makes sense). The second nail appt was with calvin everything was good. My nail shape wasn't quite coffin like I had asked.. But I was ok with it. I got home started cleaning my home and the gel started peeling off!!!! I called the salon, 2 hours later went back and they fix my nails by another nail tech a lady didn't get her name. So far gel color is on.... I will try once more see how it goes, wasn't so pleased with my last appt.. I will post a review soon
