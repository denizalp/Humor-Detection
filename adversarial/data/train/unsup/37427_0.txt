Really one of the best BYOB in Montreal. This little brother of \"Quartier general\" is a sure hit!  Service is very professional, and well informed. Menu is  varied and very well executed. It is in a rather remote location, but a fun area to visit, with easy parking. The prices are really decent. Bring on your good bottles, and you are sure to have a delicious great time!
