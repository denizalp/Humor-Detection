A friend of mine had just came to Vegas from Taiwan and I wanted to show him around and I thought Share would be the place to go. \n\nUnfortunately, the bouncer rejected his international driver's license and then tried to extort us for $80. His exact words were, you would have to give me some real money, not some 20 dollar bullshit, like 80 dollars to let him in. I could lose my job. The police could raid the establishment and demand everyone's IDs. (This like never happens).\n\nThe ID had a picture and a birthdate, and my friend had no problem using it elsewhere. After that we went to Piranha, and they let us in without any problems.\n\nNeedless to say, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\n\nPlease hire honest bouncers.\n\nAlso I have been here before, it is a little small, but still decent I guess.
