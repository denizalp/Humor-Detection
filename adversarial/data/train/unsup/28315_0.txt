There's something to be said about a balance of decadence and a parochial dedication to service that seems to be the mainstay of this pearl of Cleveland. \n\nDishes consumed: Bone Marrow, Scallops, Mussels, Calamari, Lamb Ribs, Charcuterie, Broccolini, Tempura Cauliflower. \n\nThe understated champion of the evening was the scallops. With their succulent flavor of the scallops with a celery pur√©e that made quite a power couple of the pair. \n\nEverything else had made due on its full flavor, however the muscles did leave something to be desired in regarded for people living in or visiting Cleveland.
