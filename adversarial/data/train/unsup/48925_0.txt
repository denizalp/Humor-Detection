I never write a negative review and but this time this office made me write it. So in sept in went to see Dr.Gratton and to me it looked like the appt was rushed and she didnot even had any blood test done on me before prescribing me a medicine for hair thinning. I saw the side effects of that medicine after like 3 weeks of taking them. Called the dr. office on Monday and left a message for the nurse. No response. Called again on tuesday and left a message as to should i continue the medicine or not? I was not feeling well at all. No response. Called again on thursday and left a message at the front desk lady and she told me that she will give the message to the nurse. Today is Saturday and still have not heard from that office.I would never go back to that office as they donot care about the patients.I decided to stop taking the medicine by myself.What if i got more sick? Find some other dr who can care for you.
