Came her for brunch last Sunday with some Yelper friends, \n\nI'm very traditional in my breakfast and stick with my bacon & eggs kind of plate. I decided to go all out and add some sausage, ham and french toast to it all (#3 Special)\nMost shocking of all is that the coffee was actually decent, unlike most breakfast places.\n\nEverything was tasty, the eggs were nicely runny and the meats were top-notch. The breakfast potatoes are so satisfying and the nice cup of fruit plates shows it's not an afterthought.\n\nDespite people waiting in line, we never felt rushed to leave as we were chit-chatting away even after finishing our plates. Nobody was in a rush today and it's all good.\n\nOur waiter explained he was new but was super friendly and fixed a mistake on my bill right away. Coffee refills and edits to the menu were very welcome.\n\nThe place is very noisy (at least on Sunday) so keep that in mind if you just wanna grab a bite before work and just read the newspaper.\n\nPrices are very affordable and it's not hard to find parking in the area.
