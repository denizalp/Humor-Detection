There's a difference between stores with no service, stores with good service, and stores with overbearing service. Best Buy is one of those stores with overbearing service. Stop for just a second to look at any piece of merchandise and you will be accosted by an overeager salesperson ready to tell you all about it, show you something similar, or just ask if they can help. And apparently somehow, they have been immunized to the magic words \"I'm just browsing\". As much as I appreciate the offers of help, and compared to some stores where you can't find anyone it's a nice change, Best Buy just overdoes it. Sorry, but when I say that I'm just browsing for ideas, I don't somebody trying to sell me something or direct me to something that I don't even know if I want. \n\nBest Buy... best leave me alone.
