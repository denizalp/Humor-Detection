There is a reason why this company has 5 stars and over 250+ reviews. They are top notch in professional I am and customer service. I have heard horror stories from a few friends that had their carpets cleaned by other companies and I was apprehensive when I was quoted by Richard, the owner of Carpet Monkeys. \n\nI messaged him over the course of a few days. Every time I messaged him, he would answer within a few hours if not sooner. The only reason that it took that long was because he waited for me to respond during my busy 6 day work week. \n\nHe advised me that he was slammed with work that week and said if I could wait for the next week he would be able to put me on the books. This would not work for me and I told him that I wish he could do it that day since my husband was off (he works also 6 -7 days a week between 3 jobs) and we needed to get out of our old house because we paid every day we had the keys.  I gave him Hubby's number for further contact information. As soon as I pressed send Richard called my husband and scheduled an afternoon cleaning for that day. Talk about getting what you wish for! \n\nI do have to say I was quite skeptical with the price he originally quoted. I had forgotten to mention one other room and was afraid that when he would arrive that the quote would change drastically (just like what I have had friends tell me happened to them).  It did not.  Richard was the one that showed up to clean the carpets and he did a fantastic job considering that we lived there for 6 years. \n\nAfter the cleaning, hubby paid him cash and Richard sent me a paid invoice through email. We will definitely use this company again for our carpet cleaning needs and will also try out their upholstery cleaning when out couch needs it which will be sooner than later since we have a drooly dog.  I HIGHLY recommend Carpet Monkeys for your carpet cleaning needs.
