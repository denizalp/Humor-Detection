You've seen the Apple\/PC commercial, right?  Well, I'm the PC guy.  Sure, I've used an Apple here and there, but I have never owned one.  I'm also not going to tell you that I suddenly walked in, found out how nice they are, and walked out with an armload of Apple equipment.\n\nI will tell you that the staff of the Apple Store is top-notch.  Even knowing that I'm a PC guy, and also knowing that the only reason that I was there (for three days in a row, no less) was to give the kids something to do for a few days during the summer - for free even, they were happy to do it, and they let me play with stuff the whole time.\n\nNow I didn't give up any passwords on the public computers, because I just don't do that.  But I could have.  Plenty of other parents did.  I could have sat there and used the free wi-fi all day.  But I didn't.  Instead I just watched in amazement as dozens lined up for a new iPhone, and dozens more came and went for their turn at the genius bar.  It's actually pretty amazing.  If I ever get an Apple, this will be why.\n\nIf you go in, say hi to D'Art and Noelle for me.
