Had dinner here last night with my husband for our wedding anniversary, they took over 45 minutes to serve us our food, we had to ask for the bread basket, and we ordered ours steaks medium rare, we got them well done. We were so hungry at this point and just decided to keep the food. We let our waiter know about the food (our waiter was amazing) he said he'd tell the manager to see what they can do for us. After almost 25 minutes (we were already done eating) the manager strolls by us, barely even acknowledging us, so rude and says he'll take care of our drinks and walks away. Didn't apologize or seem the least bit concerned that we were unhappy with our food. As the manager of a restaurant you should be friendly and attentive, we got none of that.   We would have been happy with a genuine apology but he was just plain rude and did not give us the customer service we deserve. Will be talking to corporate office about this manager.
