This restaurant is top notch! The food and service are impeccable. They have a happy hour that is from 4-6pm at the bar which has a vibrant feel. Then when you are ready to be pampered, the main dining room is exquisite and elegant. Be prepared to dress accordingly because when you are surrounded by crystal chandeliers, you don't want to look out of place in this restaurant!
