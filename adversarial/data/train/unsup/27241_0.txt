Made a phone call to inquire about whether they have certain items in stock. Got connected with John the store manager who was as far from pleasant as customer service standards could be. When he said the items were not in stock, I simply responded \"Oh, not right now?\" to which he followed with explaining that he receives phone calls like these 10 times a day and that he knows what he's talking about. This would be relevant information if I were questioning the validity of his statement. And I'm sorry if he answered 9 other people before me. I really hate that we have to make him do his job every now and then. Very unprofessional.
