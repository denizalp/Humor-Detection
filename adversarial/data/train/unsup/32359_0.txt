Yesterday I dropped off my boat after having difficulty with another shop. I will update this after I get my boat back, but until then I can only speak to my experience so far. \nOn the phone everyone at Boulder boats has been friendly and informative. Marty checked in my boat, it's obvious the man knows his job and is very professional. Their prices are fair and I didn't get the feeling I was going to be \"taken for a ride\", in fact I feel like professionals will repair my boat for a fair price. I hope that feeling is confirmed when I see their work and the bill. \n\n****update****\nAt this point I'm not sure if I will return to this place. One thing is for sure if I do it will not be during the spring or any other time they are busy. I was told I beat the busy time barely, yet it took a week to trace a power steering leak for which required only .5 hrs of labor and another week to finish their \"gold star service\". I decided to pick up my boat two days after the leak was located. At that point they couldn't even tell me if they had the replacement part in stock much less finish the repair. I do not blame Marty, he was clearly working his tail off. But, I would offer a word of caution to anyone that considers taking their boat in for service during a busy time.
