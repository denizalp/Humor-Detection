Maybe it was a bad idea to come on valentines but I wouldn't expect to wait 2 hours or more for food anywhere even on a day like today.\nWe made a reservation at 8 and got seated fairly quickly. The place was not packed but it wasn't empty either. We waited 15 minutes to get the menu and another 30 minutes to place our order. We even had to wait another 15 minutes for water...everything was completely disorganized!! It's funny because I've been here since 8 pm and I'm typing this all out as I'm still waiting for my food... It's 10:25pm. We ordered a Caesar salad, lamb rack, Ontario rib eye and the maple bacon Brussels sprouts. Literally still waiting.. We would've walked out already but who I believe to be the manager said he would cover our tab 40 minutes ago. Here we are still waiting what a nice valentine. We asked the server multiple times to check on our food every time he said a couple minutes. This is a review basically on the horrible service because I have yet to receive my food... VERY VERY DISORGANIZED.
