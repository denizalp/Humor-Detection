Must give kudos to the management here for hiring efficient employees. Went on a busy Friday night and, though the line was nearly out the door, it moved very quick and no one felt rushed. Samples were still offered, and everyone was smiling. The food was being replenished at a fast enough pace that there wasn't much being waiting on, too, which is a plus.
