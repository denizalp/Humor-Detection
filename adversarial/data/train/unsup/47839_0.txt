Wanna try this place long ago after reading the reviews.  Finally has a chance to try it with my friend and hubby.  Although it's a small restaurant but I feel it's quite cozy.  We ordered 888 combo with black dragon roll, chicken teriyaki & Sugar Mama Roll.  Overall I think all the sushi and sashimi r fresh and taste good.  The chicken teriyaki taste a bit bland, other than that I like this place.  Also price is quite reasonable too.  The only cons is limited parking as it is situated in a street mall.  But I will come more often when I crave for sushi.
