Best Southern cuisine West of the Mississippi? Just might be....\n\nPersonal favorites are the chicken biscuits, mac n cheese, wedge salad (best I've had), pickle plate, side of bacon, shrimp n grits, and pretty much any of the desserts. Also, don't miss the blackberry lemonade, one of the best mixed drinks on the strip. \n\nThe service was impeccable, just as it is in Miami. Wouldn't expect anything less from a 50 eggs restaurant. \n\nLong story short: Yardbird should be on your mandatory Vegas hit list.
