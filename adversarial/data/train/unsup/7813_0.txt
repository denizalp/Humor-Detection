Just because it's a little cold outside doesn't mean you can't brave Father Winter and grab some grub from a food truck. Fuku is all that and a bag of chips. Er....Fries.\n\nI've been twice now, and both times, I've noshed at lunchtime into a heavenly afternoon. The first time, I had the basic Fukuburger. Amazing. They don't skimp on the burger patty!\n\nThe second time, I had the SurrenderVegas special...named after one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas (per Yelpers and TMZ).  Yeah...they made a special burger named after a nightclub. Pretty damn awesome!\n\nThey take credit cards. If you want all the morbid details, read the 200+ other reviews, but take it from me...this is a fantastic spot to get your food on.\n\nA few words of warning: Go Hungry! You will be STUFFED afterwards. Also, make sure you have a gym membership before you go. You'll need it afterwards. Also, try the Strawberry Lemonade. \n\nLastly...be patient. As with all good food, it's made fresh...and it takes time. Don't be one of those overly anxious people. \n\nPeace.
