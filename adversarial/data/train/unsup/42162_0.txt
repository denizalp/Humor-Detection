Whenever I'm traveling I make sure to hit up a thrift store or two in the city. I'm not talking about a Goodwill but a vintage clothing store. Yes they are pretty much the same thing but I feel like when you have independent stores such as Hobo you get a better quality item and a lot less Relay For Life t-shirts lying around. \n\nWhen I saw Hobo was open I was really excited. Personally I love looking for cool vintage t-shirts so I thought I'd be in heaven, however I was pretty disappointed in the selection. The employee who I'm pretty sure was the owner was very friendly and the store for the most part was pretty well put together. My thought when I saw the store front was that this was going to be a trendy place to buy vintage (i like saying vintage instead of saying old trash no one wants anymore) clothing for a little more money than I'd pay at Goodwill. The prices being higher aren't an issue for the reason I just mentioned but I just felt like their wasn't much selection. I think total there were 8 racks of clothing and some clothing along the side but I really was underwhelmed by the selection. \n\nI'm glad there are stores moving in downtown and I'm hoping that since this store is newer that it's only growing, but if it doesn't do something to better itself I'm not sure it'll stay in town much longer.
