Maybe it's my aspirational New Years resolutions, maybe it's my general lack of self control around carbs, but I love any pizzeria that offers a by-the-slice lunch option: the version here comes with two slices and a drink (bottled, not canned) for $6, with the option to add on toppings at fifty-cents apiece.\n\nFound the crust to seem oddly premade given the uniformity of the thickness and turned-over crust. Did not have bad taste though. Cheese was quality, and I appreciated that the pizza here was not as greasy as most other by-the-slice places in town. Full-pie menu offers vegetarian specialty and carnivorous specialty topping versions, menu also has pasta dishes, sandwiches, and dessert.\n\nLocation has an open kitchen that is kept clean, polite service, and some minimal Italian theme d√©cor. I particularly like the grape lights lining the windows. Casual atmosphere or grab-and-go sort of place, also offers delivery.
