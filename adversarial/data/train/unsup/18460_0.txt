This kind of place is not my thing. I've just discovered that today.\n\nWhen we entered, they asked my friend and me to let our bags at the front counter to avoid shoplifting. I understand that, but I hate it when people take away my bag, it's my baby ):\n\nThe first floor is for the used clothes that people give away and there's food too. There wasn't really anything special, but what do you expect from thrift shop? There was also the renown \"1$ pile\", but I didn't find anything interesting. (I was scared that there were dead bodies underneath too so I left quickly. Seriously.)\n\nThe second floor is for the vintage clothes and the Eva B creations. That's where prettier clothes appear. Good price for cute clothes. I liked the terrasse, it was the only place where there was actually enough light for my liking. The fitting room is way too small to be able to change without bumping into the wall or the mirrors.\n\nThe basement is where there are costumes for rent, but I didn't visit it. I'll go when Halloween comes up!\n\nThe employees were nice and didn't hassle you. There was one that looked a bit bored with the customers though.\n\nThey should add more light and space. That's what really bothered me.
