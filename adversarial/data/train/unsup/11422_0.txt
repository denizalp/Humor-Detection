I do not recommend this place. The office staff is very unorganized. It takes to long to get an appointment. Dr. Richardson is no longer there and the quality of medical staff is not good. Verve medical group only offers a physician assistant now, not a Doctor. They have messed my appointments up several times and even turned me away from my appointment on a Friday! I had already waited a week in a half to get in, therefore, I  had to go to urgent care. The office is beautiful and clean but that's about it.
