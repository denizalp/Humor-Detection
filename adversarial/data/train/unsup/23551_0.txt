Check out is 10 a.m.   Don't rely on getting a late check out.\n\nThe parking entrance is from Las Vegas Boulevard. There's a public parking lot immediately adjacent to the hotel.  The parking to Polo Towers is literally on the other side of the low wall of the public parking lot.  \n\nParking is free but you need a pass that must be in your car.  There's a 15 minute parking in the rear of the hotel.  Park there, check in, and obtain the parking pass.\n\nI booked a room at the Polo Towers based on Yelp reviews.  The location is ideal since it's right in the heart of the strip.  If you're not going to spend that much time in the room, it's not a bad deal.  \n\nWe checked in on a Friday afternoon.  I requested a strip view, which overlooked the parking lot.  My understanding is that this is a time share so the rooms with the strip view are generally not available.\n\nThis is a lower grade hotel with a Murphy bed.  I would compare this to a Comfort Inn grade.  There was an odor in the room that bothered my bf.  It was a strong scent of chemical cleaning agents.  We ended up checking into the MGM instead.
