I love you so Matcha! \nMatcha Maiko is located in the same shopping plaza as all the other great restaurants right across of 168 market.  Parking in this area could be tough.  I arrived at 6 pm on a Thursday. It was quite full but I was able to get a parking nearby.  \n\nAs you walk in, they have menus that you could take a look at while standing in line.  They offer different varieties of their matcha.  They have their matcha soft serve, shaved ice, floats, etc.  they also offer mixed swirls with vanilla.  They have some single tables and one huge community table.  It was filled, but we were able to take a family's spot that had left.  They also have a photo booth area that is very Hawaii themed.  I think cafe maiko also exists on the Waikiki Strip in Hawaii.  I'm from Hawaii but I would go to a different matcha shop. \n\nI ordered the Maiko Special* with just matcha.  It consists of the soft serve, some azuki bean, mochi balls, jelly, cereal, and chestnut.  It costs about $8 and It took about 5-10 minutes to get.  I did enjoy the Maiko special, but I think if i ever return, id choose the mixed one with vanilla.  I didn't enjoy eating the mochi.... It lacked a bit flavor.  I don't really like mochi plain.  I also wish they served Hojicha because It tastes amazing!! It's roasted green tea and its my favorite.  Other than that, this place offers good tasting matcha.  The atmosphere is really hip and family friendly.  It's nice to enjoy some soft serve, shave ice, or lattes during the hot summer here in Vegas!
