NO WAY OUT\nOn the surface, Lifecenter Plus seems like a decent gym. It offers a kid-friendly atmosphere, a big outdoor pool for the summer, and close proximity to downtown Hudson. However, prospective members should BEWARE. If you use the fitness area, there a some big problems. 1) There are a few (4) newer treadmills but the rest of the cardio equipment is old and in poor condition. After using the only available treadmills (not the newer ones because they are usually occupied) only a few times, my knees and ankles were in pain. As an avid gym cardio-freak, I knew it was the equipment and not the user. 2) The weight equipment is also old and very limited. If you are looking for Hammer Strenth, forget it. Not only that, it is crammed into a small space making it difficult to comfortably complete a workout without people bumping into you to get by. 3) Management doesn't care what you think. I tried to give them constructive feedback only to have the representative \"tell\" me without taking a breath what a great gym it was. She didn't even listen to my comments. 4) Their childcare options are extremely limited if you have a child under 1 year of each. Don't count on having evening care because they only offer 2 a week. 5) Lifecenter Plus requires a full year commitment with no back-out clause. By the way, expect to pay the full annual amount because they are quite pernicious and will come after you if you try to back out. Any reputable gym - Powerhouse or Golds for example - charges a low rate with a month-to-month option. They do this because they know that what they offer is going to keep the customer coming back.\nDon't join LIfecenter Plus. You'll be locked-in to a miserable experience with no way out for at least a year.
