The food here is quite good - the ribs are a standout though, massive, saucy, meaty and delicious.  Just like how I like my men. \nThe onion rings were a bit too greasy for my liking, but the poutine was delish, with the right amount of pulled pork.\nDrinks are great, the vibe is great, and its a place where you can never go wrong.
