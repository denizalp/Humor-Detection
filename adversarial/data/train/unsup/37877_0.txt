Walking by this place, looked at the menu and decided to give it a try. Ordered the A1 house special ramen and A3 curry ramen. $8.99 each. I like the house special ramen. Not crazy about the curry one hubby ordered. Added the daily special drink $2.99 for 16oz. Not bad. Overall, the food is not extraordinary, not bad either. Drink is good for its price. If I am rating the drink only, I will give it a 4 star.
