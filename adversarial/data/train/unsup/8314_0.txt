Mickies Dairy Bar is a great, uber-popular breakfast joint right near Camp Randall Stadium. The food is delicious and the portions are gluttonous, so make sure you come hungry wearing stretchy clothes.\n\nI highly recommend their milkshakes and pancakes.\n\nSeating used to be a problem as it was a free-for-all: if you showed up with 4 people, you had to wait for 4 seats at the same table to open up and then hope you got to them before another group of 1-4 did. Luckily, they now have a host(ess) person who seats groups in the order in which they arrive, which is a GREAT improvement.
