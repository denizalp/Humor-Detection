By far the ugliest mastros I've ever been to. Honestly the restaurant was just sad. Went there for my bday dinner and I was very underwhelmed. It's located inside the crystal shopping center. Literally looks like the Starbucks located across from the restaurant. The food was not great. The service was ok and the drinks were filled with cheap vodka. It was basically eating at sizzer
