It's probably just me, but I remember when $3 bucks was steep for a small cold taco. Having traversed various bars for many years, this is the first place happy hour existed only at the bar, not for dinner guests. I guess 'hipstermex' has it's price, but when I'm spending that much for tacos the least I could get is the same price the bar squatters get on drinks.
