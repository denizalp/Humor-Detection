I want to leave negative stars. \n\nI waited 20 minutes for my number to be called for the food handler safety training card. No biggie.\n\nThey call my number, I go to the gentleman who is handing out the numbers. He refers me to the clerk. \n\nUpon getting to her window, the clerk says that she is already on the next number. She says I need to get a new number and wait in line all over again. The employees apparently lack communication or a working system.\n\nI go back to the gentleman who is giving out numbers. He says he is sorry and there is nothing he can do.  \n\n\nI am livid and forced to wait 20 more minutes in pure annoyance and anger. Rawr.
