Hmm...\n\nThis area is kinda devoid of grab and go options like pizza so when I needed a bite before a class, it was either this or Starbucks. \n\nI usually avoid Aroma because I find it hella $$$$ but I was desperate. It was $9 for a Canadiano (like an americano but more bitter) and a piece of mediocre Carrot Cake. \n\nThe sandwiches looked good but again they are a bit on the pricey side. While I appreciate that they are made to order , it's also tough when you just want to grab and go.
