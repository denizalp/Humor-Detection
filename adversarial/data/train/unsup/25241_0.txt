First thing that hits you when you walk in is the amazing aroma of fresh waffle cones. The place was pretty busy when we arrived around 8pm on a Sunday night, but the turnover was pretty quick.\n\nThe man behind the counter who I assume was the owner was very friendly and greeted us with a smile, so that's a big plus. We ordered the Maiko Special and got our order within minutes. The special includes gelatin, red bean, some sort of sponge cake, mochi, and the matcha soft serve. I'm sure there's more to it that I missed. The star of the dessert was the soft serve. I'll definitely be coming back for the soft serve, but I think I'll skip to extra toppings. It was great to try, but a little too pricey to get on the regular.
