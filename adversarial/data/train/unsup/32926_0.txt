Been here two times. Coffee is a bit pricey for what you get. The first time I went, I ordered a green tea latte and it was super watered down. I couldn't even taste the matcha. The second time, I ordered a regular latte and it was just average. The downtown location is much better. \n\nThe decor is nice and the staff is friendly but I wouldn't come back for the coffee.
