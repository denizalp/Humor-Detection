The FULL MONTAGU is where it's at. Among that one, tuna melt, and the caribbean jerk chicken, the full montagu is my favorite! It tastes better than it looks in their picture. \n\nThis place really is a must-try in Vegas! Open 24 hours and sandwiches are only $5.99 and they are hot and delicious!!!!
