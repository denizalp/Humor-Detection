I was ravenous for a juicy burger. The burger was pink and juicy with delicious mushrooms, The french fries were less awesome, but I am not much of a fry girl. Tho, now I want to be one, cause it just sounds cool - \"fry girl\".\nSomeone else described it as having the \"old Vegas\" feel. She's right. I've been here since '88 and I'm about to be 50, so I too appreciate \"old Vegas\" or was that being old in Vegas. They even have a salad bar that you can add onto your meal. There were many specials and a really nice menu.\nI appreciated that we were not rushed out as our party needed time to talk. I noticed other parties lingering at their tables as well.\nI forget about Ichabod's until someone suggests it. I will try to remember it more often.
