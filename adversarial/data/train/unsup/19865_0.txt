Since Vegas is only four hours away from Riverside, it was the default vacation for my family. However, not being of legal age to drink, gamble, or smoke, Vegas was not so much fun as a kid. \n\nDad: I think we're going to go Boston for Christmas.\nMe: Cool!\n(weeks pass...my dad hasn't really planned anything)\nDad: Uh, how about we do Vegas?\nMe: Again?!\n\nOn one of these many trips to Vegas, my parents decided to drive off the Strip. They wanted to get dim sum. \n\nWhat? There's dim sum in Vegas? Are my parents taking the oh so bountiful meth that's produced in the Inland Empire?\n\nBut if you drive 15-20 minutes away from the Strip, there's a Chinese strip mall, complete with its own 99 Ranch. Where the Chinese are, 99 Ranch will follow.
