1st time here and it was an overall good experience. Raymond price matched me from another shop in town. I had an S7 Edge screen and LCD replaced. Raymond told me to come in an pay a deposit so they could order the part because they didn't have it. The ONLY reason I gave a 4 star is because when we went to take in the deposit, the guy at the counter was quite rude. He was rude to the 2 clients in front of us, and then to us as well. He seemed very condescending and we left feeling not great about it, but we already paid the deposit and thought we'll follow through. \n\nWhen I dropped the phone off, that guy was FANTASTIC! He was so awesome. The part was in 2 days sooner than expected and he was very pleasant and awesome to deal with. Faith was restored! When I went to pick up the device a few hours later, the same guy was back from the day we did the deposit, and he was also in a much better mood. I'm thinking he was just having a bad day as it was really busy and he seemed to be working alone so I'm going to give him benefit of the doubt, so overall it was a great experience with a little customer service hiccup.\n\nI do recommend, and I'd love to come back again if something else breaks! Raymond and the one guy were great to speak with, and the second guy finished strong!  I appreciate the price match and the speediness of the repairs considering they did seem busy.
