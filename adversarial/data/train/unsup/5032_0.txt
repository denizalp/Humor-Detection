Whyyy have I not been in here before?? This place is fun! I stopped in during my lunch break to check it out, I felt like a kid in a candy store. I like how each aisle is labeled so I know what countries' items I am looking at. I picked up some green tea Kit Kats, Hello Panda cookies, and a few other candies from various countries. I also got a clamshell filled with an assortment of really yummy cookies from Leonard Bakery. Not sure if they are local or not, but those cookies were tasty. Note: this is NOT a candy store, but my sweet tooth got the best of me this afternoon. :)\n\nThis place has many different items including sauces, soups, condiments, fresh produce, frozen items, dry goods, etc. from many countries all over the world. They even have a fresh fish market. On my way out I noticed that there is a place to buy hot foods and a small dining area right in the front of the store on opposite ends. There was no menu posted, but they had boba and some kind of meat on a rotisserie. I will definitely be back when I have more time.
