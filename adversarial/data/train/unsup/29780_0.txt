This gym is pretty nice and well maintained. I like the layout with separate rooms that are usually completely empty for me to work out in, I usually come during off peak hours because it's pretty much completely dead. The girls at the front desk are always very nice and joyful and the manager, or the lady who runs this gym is very accommodating and not at all intimidating. I don't see myself changing gyms any time soon. However I do wish they would open up more locations!
