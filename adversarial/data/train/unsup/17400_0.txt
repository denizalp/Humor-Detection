After today's meal, I must say, this place deserves 5 stars! Even though service was slightly slow at lunch time (can't blame them with the amount of people that showed up today at the same time!), the food was so good, it was so worth the wait. The beef Ramen was super delicious today and my choice of veggies to go with it was just perfect. Also my Karragi chicken appetizer was so good, I think I will be ordering it every time I go! \n\nBrought my colleagues today to try this place for lunch and they thought it was great. We will definitely be back again and again and again!
