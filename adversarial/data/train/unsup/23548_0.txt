A home away from home about a half-hour away from Toronto and close to lots of good food choices and supermarkets. I stayed in a 2-bedroom suite for 4 days with my family of 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 2 and 4). Staff fulfilled my special requests of a crib and extra towels before we arrived. Check-in and check-out were super fast and easy. In fact, I didn't have to do anything to check-out.\n\nOur suite had 2 queen bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, and a common area with a living room that had a pull out couch, a full kitchen with prepware, cookware, dinnerware, glassware, and utensils and a kitchen table. There was plenty of room for my kids to run around and be free. Each bedroom and the living room had a TV where we were able to use our Netflix account to watch familiar shows and movies. There was plenty of storage space within dressers and closets and surface space on vanities and desks. Enough outlets were able to charge all our electronic devices. I brought a multi USB charger which helped.\n\nWe enjoyed the indoor pool which deepened from 3 ft. to 8 ft. and the relaxing hot tub. I was able to bring an inner tube and floaties for my kids without incident. These plus the features of our suite really helped make life easy.\n\n**A quiet coin-operated laundry room seemed to be on each floor.
