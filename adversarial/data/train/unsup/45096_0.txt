I've visited this brewery several times and each time their Front Side IPA seems to taste different.  However, this last visit it was not good at all.  The beer seemed flat and it didn't even taste close to other times I tried this beer.  So I'm assuming they modified the recipe and possibly used a different hops.  I've seen this happen before at other local breweries, but they disclosed it, so I knew what I was getting.  I love the whole Barnone concept, and I want this place to be successful, so please take this as constructive feedback.  I'm very curious to know if you changed your recipe.  If you didn't then someone dropped the ball on this batch.
