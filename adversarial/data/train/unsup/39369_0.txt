Recently, I started going here for hair products. They are cheaper than Two Cousins and, while the selection isn't huge, they pack a bunch of products in a small space. They have a decent selection of costume jewelry, scarves and hats too.\n\nThis past weekend I left the store without grabbing my bag of items. I called and found that they had put my bag under the counter. Something like that speaks volumes to me. It's not a normal stop for me but worth checking out when I'm in the area.
