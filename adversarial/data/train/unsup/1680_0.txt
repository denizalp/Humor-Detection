I'm an amateur when it comes to food trucks but my friend took me a spot that had 10 trucks parked for a weekday lunch. I chose to eat Filipino food and it was really good. The price is on the high side for it not being a sit down restaurant.  I had the pancit noodles and the lumpia and they were delicious. If you enjoy good Filipino food or you've never tried it, this is a good place to go.
