Night Club review:\n\nVery nice decor; bath (Lavo) themed.\n\nBar area is in weird shape. Bartenders were not very nice at all.\n\nDance area is small. Overall club is small.\n\nMore of a lounge type than club.\n\nToo many bottle service areas. This place needs more dance areas.\n\nPlace needs better ventilation & shouldn't allow smoking went it's so stuffy inside.\n\nThey play house & trance here. \n\nOpen bar for ladies from 11 pm-midnight.\n\nIf you know a promoter, they can usually get you in free & ladies free drinks & table.   \n\nDoors open at 10:30 p.m. \nFridays and Saturdays and 11 p.m. Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. \n\nCover is $20, and locals are admitted free Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursday
