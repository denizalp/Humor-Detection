My fianc√© and I stopped in last night and fell in love! Service was great- Clayton was on top of everything and did a great job describing items on the menu. We sat on the patio and enjoyed their chop salad(so fresh and a perfect amount of ingredients), frites, warm olives, and the Salmon entree. Nice having a great new restaurant in the hood that is open late. We will be back very soon!
