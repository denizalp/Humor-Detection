I went here for a lovely Sunday brunch with a great group of ladies. The Combine Eatery is a very nicely designed restaurant with a great atmosphere. Most certainly the best place to sit is in their back patio. \n\nThe service was attentive and very friendly, which was pretty important because the back patio can be quite hot and we needed those water refills. \n\nTheir brunch menu is fantastic! There is a marvelous selection of creative dishes. I even learnt that fried chicken and waffles are a thing! Clearly I have been out of the continent for too long. \n\nI had the open-faced pulled pork sandwich with pico de gallo and eggs. It was pretty darn delicious. If I was to be picky I'd choose another kind of bread (the one they use it's a bit too thick). But my friends had the fried chicken & waffles and the eggs benedict. Everyone was thoroughly satisfied and stuffed.\n\nMy only complaint with this place is that it is very expensive. The brunch portions were pretty decent (although they may seem deceptively small but believe me when I say it'll fill you up), but it's still about $15.95 for each dish and about $8 for each drink.
