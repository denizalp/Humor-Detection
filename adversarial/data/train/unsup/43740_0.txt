Went on a Thursday night around 9pm. It was freezing outside and warm inside. The place was packed and we awkwardly stood in the only walkable space while we waited for a seat.... it took a long time for anyone to recognize our presence and the waiter was constantly squeezing by us so I started thinking it might be a bad idea to eat here. \n\nA few minutes later we were seated at the bar and had drinks in front of us.  The bartender didn't pay any attention to us unless we wanted something, in which case he did it right away, the perfect amount of service. We had some kind of leafy salad, beefy wings, and squash poutine and oh dear me was it ever good. The tastiest of the tasty. Award winning noms. Mouth parties and all. We left happy as clams. Possibly happier.
