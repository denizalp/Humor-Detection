Dear Abari,\n\nYou are really starting to grow on me - maybe it's the NODA Par 4 talking. Maybe it's the warm fuzzy feeling about being a member at someplace cool as $hit. Maybe it's because when I'm strapped for cash you'll let me buy quarters with my credit card. Maybe it's the high quality selection of pinball machines: Fish Tales, Twilight Zone and Junkyard. Maybe it's because you're cool with my kids hanging out too (as long as they're gone by 5). I can't quite put my finger on it. Did you get a haircut? Is that a new shirt you're wearing?\n\nI really did have a blast my last visit. From now on I promise to stop comparing you to other Barcades and appreciate you for who your are - Deal? Deal. Awesome sauce!
