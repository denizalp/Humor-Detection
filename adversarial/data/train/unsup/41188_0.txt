I stayed here last weekend for my 21st birthday! I had an incredible experience.\n\nFirst, lets start with the room\/facility. We booked a 1 bedroom. When we got there, there was smell of smoke in the room. I called the front desk and they moved us right away. Both rooms were very spacious and clean. Large living rooms, nice views, moderately new. I really felt at home here. Fully equipped kitchens is a must so you don't have to eat out every night. It was also nice to relax in the living room or balcony instead of just a big bed like in hotels. \n\nThere is a little store by the poolside which has a lot of the essentials. Bagels, cereal, frozen pizzas, swim suits, etc. Reminded me of a smaller ABC store. There are a couple pools, lazy river looked fun there! We went to the gym in the mornings, it was a little small but very clean. The staff here is incredibly helpful! We sat in one of those seminars in exchange of a really good deal for a couple shows! Definitely worth it! That saved us so much money. They have a wonderful help desk too. \n\nThe shuttle service was a very nice feature here. Every morning at 10 am there was a shuttle that took us to the grocery store which we used. Very convenient. You can also give them your grocery list online and they will get you your groceries for you! Also there was a shuttle that took us to the strip every hour which can save a lot of money on cabs.\n\nOverall, I had an incredible experience here. I would most definitely stay here again next time I am in Vegas. Getting hungover or sick can be an awful feeling on top of being in a foreign place. Resorts like these really make you feel at home again. Thank you WorldMark!
