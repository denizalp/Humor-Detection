Power went out unexpectedly in half of my house. Called and spoke with Preston who said he could come over right away. He showed on time & was able to fix the problem quickly. Turned out a loose fixture was breaking the electric connection to the rest of the house. Price was reasonable & work was done quickly. I'll be giving Dodge Electric a call next time I need work done:)
