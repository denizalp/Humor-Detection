Updated 4\/13\/2008\n\nI've been back to Tottie's three times since I first reviewed it, and its gotten better with every single visit.  Tonite was no exception.\n\nPanang Curry: Must have if you do curry.  The vegetables are cut with care, and done to perfection.  Bamboo shoots, squash, and all. Tofu is great.  Chicken is fantastic, too.  The beautifully grown basil garnish could be the best part, too.  I love basil, and if you do too - you're in luck.  Tonight my basil was purplish green with a dusting of silver.\n\nPad Kra Pao: Must have, too.  Stir fried chicken w\/Thai basil in chili sauce, onions, red bell peppers & bamboo shoots.  Again, the vegetables were sliced and prepared with great care.  Excellent fragrance. Large portion.\n\nEdamame. 3 bucks & change.  Always nice.\n\nDo yourself a favor, too - and get the ice cream.  Tonight there were 10 custom flavors.  Peanut Butter, Lychee, Ginger, Apricot... can't remember them all. Our choice: Avocado.  Out of this world.  And the wafer? To die for.\n\nAs Roland W. recently wrote, I'm still somewhat up in the air, too, but tonite's performance may have convinced me that Tottie's is figuring out their new groove, and gettin' it.\n\nI'll be back - for sure.  And every other time it's gonna be the Panang, too...\n\n\n\n(Below is my earlier review posted from earlier this year: 2\/08\/2008)\n\nAlso going to mention that this place was formerly known as Shanghai Palace.  Same owners, new restaurant is twice the size.\n\nSo what is Tottie's take on Asian Fusion?  Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai.  Not really fusion, though... They just have a large menu that includes all four different cuisines.\n\nWhile I've only visited once, and it was for lunch, I was disappointed to discover that the lunch specials are limited to Chinese dishes.  I went in hoping for Thai and had to settle for Kung Pao Chicken.  Additionally, there was only one vegetarian option on the lunch menu, and there are few veg options on the regular menu.\n\nI will say that the lunch portion was well above-average in size, and it was good, however the hot and sour soup was a little iffy...\n\nIn conclusion, I'm looking forward to giving Tottie's another shot for some Thai food, but I won't be returning for the lunch special anytime soon... nice place, though!  And the owner is nice, friendly, and approachable!  Cheap for lunch, too!... if you like-a the meat.
