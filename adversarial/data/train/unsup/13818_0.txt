I was reminded last night of why I'd only been to this buffet once before. Twice is likely enough too.\n\nThis buffet is the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch, and it's similar to the Feast Buffet locations at other Station Casinos. It's also significantly more expensive at $14.99 for dinner w\/ Boarding Pass (the players' card, which is free to sign up for) compared to $10.99 at Sunset Station (which is actually much closer to where I live), and with little more to show for it than perhaps some more cooked-to-order options and desserts. It's probably a premium because GVR is branded as a bit of a resort destination compared to the standard Station locations.\n\nFortunately, my friend treated me with a soon-to-expire free buffet pass. We even bypassed the wait by using the line for President level Boarding Pass cardholders. Perks of having lost a bunch of money via gambling, I suppose.\n\nThe food is fairly basic fare, with proteins as fancy as some sort of roast beef, shrimp, and fried fish. I found it odd that they didn't have any sort of baked or more \"healthily\" prepared fish filets, which I see all the time at my preferred Feast Buffet. They do have various made-to-order cooking areas, and I skipped all of them (even the unique Cold Stone-esque ice cream) after recalling how tough the meat was in my bowl ordered at the Mongolian line. Plus, you're expected to tip on all of those.\n\nThe best part about a buffet is being able to try a lot of different food, so I took full advantage.\n\nFood that was relatively good: sweet and sour (battered\/fried) fish from the Asian area, fried sea bass (somewhat near the meat carving stations), fajitas (if you make sure to use the tortilla to mitigate the saltiness), fried chicken (Asian area), pumpkin ravioli (seasonal Italian selection), \"chef's special\" breaded and fried shrimp (really tiny but good), bread pudding w\/ vanilla sauce, apple cobbler (hooray, hot desserts), ice cream.\n\nFood that was just OK: Chinese BBQ pork ribs, Swedish meatball (tasted like Italian meatball but with gravy), shredded lamb (Mexican food station), stuffed pasta shells\n\nFood that was less tolerable: breaded\/fried butterfly shrimp (I must've gotten the old batch that had been sitting at the bottom, but that's still not cool), orange chicken (rubbery, yet not crispy), pork tamale (too little meat), menudo (decent tripe but underseasoned soup, couldn't detect any spices\/herbs other than chile pepper), chocolate pudding in a cup (trying to aspire to the chocolate mousse at more upscale buffets).\n\nHonorable mention (in mediocrity) for the beef at the carving station for looking so unpalatably gray that I skipped it, for how they ran out of some desserts toward the end of the evening (but still before closing time at 9pm), and for how all of their larger plates are hot (I changed my mind on getting cheesecake for dessert, but my frozen yogurt ended up melting).\n\nI haven't been to this Feast Buffet on one of the special seafood nights (with crab legs reportedly offered), but I still see no reason to try them again when I can find similar if not better offerings at a much cheaper price at my neighborhood Feast Buffet. Well, unless it's my friend treating me for free.
