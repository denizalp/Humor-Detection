I totally agree with the 5 star for ambience. The place is stunning. It is a bit of a challenge to find it, however.  Arrive in time for Happy Hour prices and enjoy the BEST martini! \nWe found the food average, and just incredibly over priced. $10 for a baked potato?  Seriously?  The steaks were average, nothing over the top.  The pork chop was undercooked and tough. Therefore, the food brought the rate down for us.\nAbsolutely a 5 star for service.  Delightful, professional and attentive.  A special dessert delivered to the table when they heard we were celebrating a 40 year tradition of joint birthday and anniversary.\nWill we go back? Not worth getting there from Vegas for us.
