I used to come here a lot to study, it's just something about the atmosphere that helps me focus. But now I just come here post up on my lunch breaks. They got these cute positive notes posted on the window. Hip modern relaxed decor. I just love the whole vibe of the place. If you try to come right when they open, just make sure to call cz sometimes the opener will show up late
