My sweet tooth led my boyfriend and I here after dinner on a Friday evening. Well, the good news - we weren't sugar bombed. The bad news - It was totally watered down. \n\nI was disappointed with the Frozen Hot Chocolate; I was really expecting it to taste like chocolate - rich and luscious. Can you blame me? Unfortunately, it was overly icy and the chocolate flavor was super mellow, watered down with a slight hint of sweetness. The massive amount of whipped cream on top was the sweetest part of the entire drink, but that's not saying much since the ratio of ice overpowered every other flavor we tasted. \n\nThe \"regular\" $13 sized original frozen hot chocolate was shared between my boyfriend and I just fine. For us, it was the right amount. They also had a size \"for two\" $17, but I'm glad we didn't opt for the larger size. It was bland, watery and not memorable. \n\nI would say the best part of the experience  was sipping the same cup as my date, it was really cute and romantic. So if you're not looking to be wow'ed by flavor or quality, I would suggest taking your date here for some cute ol' romance and that's about it - I don't see myself making my way out there for any other reason. \n\nThey also serve appetizers, lunch, dinner, shakes, splits, sundaes, coffee and other desserts which all looked average to me. \n\nPro tip: they sell hello kitty mini beanie babies here for about $10 (and change) each
