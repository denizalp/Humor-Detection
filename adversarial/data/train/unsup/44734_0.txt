These guys are great.  This is the second house I'm having carpet installed by them after purchasing at Home Depot and the installers always do a great job.  This company is professional to work with from beginning to end.  \n\nMy latest install has been a nightmare for me after Home Depot messed up the measure.  When the installers arrived, they realized that there was not enough carpet to do the two rooms I was having installed because of the botched measure.  They did one room and additional carpet was ordered.  By the time the additional carpet came in (special order), I was days away from my move in date and a bare floor in the family room. The did everything could to get an installer to do my install as fast as possible, so I can move as scheduled.\n\nEven though Home Depot has been a nightmare to deal with, Western States made the whole thing better, even though the goof was not their fault.
