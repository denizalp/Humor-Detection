Oh Zipps. I kind of have a mediocre relationship with you. I love the cheap HH, great patio and tons of TVs to watch a game. It's always an option for game day. But, everything else is just pretty run of the mill. And yet, over the years, I've found myself visiting more than I would have ever thought, but I blame my friends and a football game. \n\nI look at Zipps as the mainstream location to watch a game. When you hear there's a sports game on, immediately one of the first bars that comes to mind is Zipps. And why not? Like I said, games, great prices, large beers, wings, a patio and TVs make for a great game watching experience. But, the food isn't amazing. The only menu item on the list I tend to eat there is the Monaco Foccacia. The foaccia is fresh and warm and full of chicken breast, grilled melted cheese and ranch dressing. Add tomatoes for a twist. Other than that, just run of the mill food and it's actually better to go with the intention of drinking beer and watching a game. I think that's Zipp's intention as well and it seems to be working for them since it's always crowded!
