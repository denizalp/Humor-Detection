Went here last night with a friend for a couple beers and some food. They have a really good selection of beer on tap. I had a Desert Eagle and an Anchor Steam on tap, both were very good. I really like they have some things here that most places do not have on tap.  \nThe food is really excellent here and I have enjoyed everything I have tried. They have a real nice selection of small plates for happy hour.  When your in the area come here and try a few, they are all very good. \nSeveral of my friends rave about the quality of the drinks here, they have some of the best bartenders around so if you love a high quality mixed drink you really need to try this place!\n\nBarrelhouse is one of my favorites in the east valley. It is a nice upscale setting that has a friendly atmosphere, I love to come here when I'm in the area.
