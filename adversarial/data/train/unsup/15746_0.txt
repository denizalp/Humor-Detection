On the bright side, him and the staff is friendly.\n\nDownside, He filled teeth despite me telling him that I've been warned by a prior dentist the teeth need capped. This caused the fillings to be too large for the tooth (almost half the tooth was now filled, standard dental protocol is that anything over 1\/3 should be capped) and caused me pain, then wanted to charge me for a root canal and cap and have it done immediately, on top of the cost for filling the tooth. He also charged me for getting it looked at by him for his mistake, despite being told originally that it wouldn't cost anything (I see they had no problem charging my dental insurance 100 to look at their mistake).  I was also told by his secratary that the procedure would use up the rest of my dental policy, so my next cleaning would be out of pocket (Checked with my dental insurance and they stated it wouldn't be that my coverage including 2 cleanings even if the full amount of money was used).\n\nI went to my original dentist in Flagstaff (yes, I drove all the way to Flagstaff to find a dentist whose opinion I trust) an he stated that it might not need the root canal, but to give some time before the work is done. That the major trauma of having it filled and then another major procedure close together could harm the surrounding teeth. That as long as the pain was only when I bit something directly with the tooth and since it went away immediately once the bite was over to just baby it for awhile.\n\nSince then the pain has drastically reduced. Don't go to him if your looking for an honest dentist.
