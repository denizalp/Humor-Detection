Horrible service! We were a group of about 10 people and it took over an hour to get our  brunch food. They are not at all flexible in adjusting their menu. For example, I asked for their menu item \"eggs in a basket\" but for the eggs to be well done because I'm pregnant. They said they can't do it. A friend asked for \"eggs in a basket\" but if they can replace the sausage for something else. They said they can't substitute anything, so he ended up with a tiny portion meal and after waiting so long for it. Finally I ordered a \"herb omelet,\" well done with additional mushrooms. What I got was a not well done omelet with no mushrooms. They never refilled our water glasses. They ran out of whole wheat bread and fruits. The menu is also very limited and they don't have usual brunch food like regular eggs and crepes. We all had a bad experience. Would never go back!
