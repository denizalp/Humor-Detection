I thoroughly enjoyed my first  foot massage while waiting for my car to be serviced in South Scottsdale.  After a bagel at Einstein's I was walking around and noticed a foot and leg chart in the strip mall at Thomas and Scottsdale Rd.  I had no idea how many body parts are allegedly connected by nerves to your feet from the big toe to the heel.  Over the years I had thought about getting a foot massage, particularly after long hikes, but never did.  Just taking off my boots after hiking was good enough for me...\n\nSince I was spending a lot on the car I thought I needed to feel good this time.  Not knowing what to really expect from a foot massage I was pleasantly surprised with the price $28 for 45 minutes.  I was the only one there when it opened at 10 AM.  In asking the owner I found out \"Just Plus\" had opened at this location in December and was offering an additional 20% off until the end of April.  With time to kill I decided to take the plunge and commit to my first ever  foot massage.  \n\nThe owner sat me down on one of the four cushy chairs while I relaxed.  In a few moments Cindy came with the bucket of just the right temp water\/tea mixture.  My feet were wrapped in plastic and chair inclined.  I received a totally comfy head, shoulder and arm massage for ten minutes or so followed by the foot massage.  Each foot was worked on one at a time and felt good even with ticklish feet.  The only down side was a few moments of mild \"pain\" when the  arch of each foot was massaged.  Otherwise, I would now be more inclined to get another foot massage if and when the opportunity arises.
