This place hits home everytime. The noodles are homemade so you can really taste the freshness and the food comes out piping out. This is a really really delicious place that hits the spot whenever you are craving really good chinese food. The big downside though is the prices are jacked up the wa-zoo, but that's because it IS in the Venetian.\n\nIt is open super late so it's a good place after a night of fun...\n\nI've tired their congee, their beef noodle soup, their jelly fish, their tendon, and NOTHING disappoints. I actually crave this place everytime i'm in Vegas.
