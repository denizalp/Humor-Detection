Really enjoyed this place. Had a fun atmosphere and the place was packed on a Saturday night.  Food was good and managed to sample a few options from the menu.  We tried the Oysters, Sprouts, Gnocchi and one more special\n\nMy only slight issue was I felt you were rushed to look at the chalkboard menu, however the server really made up for that by talking us through it and giving us some tips.\n\nReason for 4 stars although food was all very good, nothing mind blowing... would recommend and go back.
