Went here with a groupon coupon. We ordered a kebab platter for the appetizers which was just alright. For the mains we ordered chicken tikka masala and lamb roganjosh with some naan breads.\nBoth the chicken and lamb dish were disasters. Gravy was full of bell peppers when they are not even supposed to go in the dish. Roganjosh was a tatal failure too with watery gravy.\nNothing even close to indian food. Naan breads were alright. \nWouldn't go back again to waste my money. There are some better options in the city so my advice is avoid if you can.
