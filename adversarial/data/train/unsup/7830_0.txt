I have a soft, medium-rare spot for burger-themed restaurants and this place does not disappoint. They play fast and loose with the term \"burger\" here, with a bacon-encrusted chicken sandwich, portabella melt & pork burger all falling under the moniker of the usually ground beef based sammy. Prices usually between $8-11; includes a side (indulge your inner Napoleon Dynamite & do the tots).  Build your own burger or go with the Frenchie (Turkey burger, brie, apple, bacon), Sam I Am (pesto, ham, fried egg) or any other over-the-top sounding selection on the menu. Jalapeno bacon? Bacon mayo? Yes please x2!!! The milkshakes are terrific, but a little on the pricey side, IMO. Pretty good tap beer selection. Fun atmosphere. Usually pretty crowded, even with outdoor seating. Ocassional celebrity sightings (I've seen Fred Couples & Jay Bilas here on separate occasions). A really fun place, with some of the most unhealthy burgers you could ask for. Bring your burger-enthusiast amigos and bask in self-satisfaction as they rave about how awesome this little place is.
