Won't Be Back! Just left Nacho Daddy because the waitress and manager REFUSED to honor my Yelp offer (margarita) unless they witnessed my Check-in. Ok Fine, I asked if I could please Check-in at the end of my meal (being female it's safer) NOPE!! She said \"No!\" I asked for Manager he said \" No!\" He said the owners set the rule he follows it. I said, \" I said I  will check-in  when leaving and show it, if not charge me for the margarita and  also showing him my reviews, explaining safety concern, and SHOWING him my legitimate Yelp Account, NOPE! \n\nOk, so waited and waited. \n\nWhatever,  the waitress was not going to give us good service after manager left our table. Her name started with an \"L\" not a common name. Her attitude and the manager's cost this company our business  tonight as well as future!! We walked out.\n\n We will not return. Way to go Nacho Daddy employees, $120-$170 a week $$$ GONE, because you didn't value my safety!!\n\nAttitude From Waitress Was Beyond Unacceptable!! Manager Is Suppose To Make Sure The Customer Is Happy Within Reason, This Was A Complete Fail!!
