I don't know why I keep giving Wal-Mart my business. I guess because it's cheaper than the rest and I still have a high expectation.\n\nWhen they have what you want, the prices on the basics are better than their competitors. A can of Folger's coffee or a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes at Wal-Mart are the same thing as at Bi-Lo or Harris-Teeter, but are way less expensive.\n\nBut that's when they have what you want. As usual, the items I wanted were out of stock. Specifically, the Sam's Choice Seltzer or Club Soda, and the Sam's Choice Belgian Chocolate. I have seen this store with whole shelves of \"outs\" particularly in the personal care areas. (Oh, and the \"spill station\" nearby was completely empty!) As in other reviews, I'd recommend carefully checking the store-made bakery items and I've brought home bad produce before too.\n\nChecking out, one of the four self-checkout machines was down. At one of the three remaining ones, two of my items could not be scanned. After a few tries, I gave up and left them behind.\n\nI have complained before and gotten a call from a co-manager, but it seems that they always settle back to low quality. Having shopped at their flagship stores in Bentonville, Arkansas, I know what a Wal-Mart can be, and these are a poor copy.\n\nAt least the greeter wished me a \"blessed day\" as I left. Sorry, Wal-Mart.
