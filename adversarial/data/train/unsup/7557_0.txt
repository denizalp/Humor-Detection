Would definitely recommend family and friends to eat here..  tacos taste just like they do in Tj but with out the kiddnappings,shootings and long border lines.. lol..  the lines there are kinda confusing but pretty much theres 4 stations , each one serving you different meats of the tacos you want... Once you get the tacos .you head to the register and pay...  just thought id put that  cuz we were confused on what to do..
