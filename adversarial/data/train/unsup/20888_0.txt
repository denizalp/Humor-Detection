Impressed overall. I didn't  think the food would be that good since this place is selling discounted prices on Groupon but I'm wrong. We started off with the big 5 appetizer which consists of mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, pretzel bites with cheese, nachos, and boneless wings. We substituted the boneless wings with mozzarella sticks so we got double mozzarella sticks. All items were tasty and well done. My girl ordered salmon with grilled veggies, fries and a side salad with honey mustard dressing and she liked them all. The salmon was well cooked and the fries needed a little extra salt but that's why there's salt shakers on the table. I ordered traditional wings with medium buffalo sauce. They were good but not the best wings in Surprise. Service was great. Our server Kristin did a great job as she was accommodating and checked in at the right times.
