Started with a couple tasty cucumber cocktails at the bar, then headed to our table on the well warmed patio overlooking the fountains. Food was fantastic, beginning with the beef carpaccio and stuffed squid.\n\nI had veal scallopine with a perfectly sized side of pasta luxuriously drenched in a buttery lemon sauce.\n\nEnded a great meal with tangy citrus panna cotta. Server was fantastic!
