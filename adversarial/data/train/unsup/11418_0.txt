The have a good selection of whiskey and various mixed beer drinks.  It's a large place with plenty of seating. \n\nAside from that there isnt much else going for it. It's a Seattle Seahawks bar, so depending on your NFL fandom, that either really cool for 1\/32nd's of the NFL fans or really douchey and annoying to the rest of us. \nThe food is below average bar\/pub food, the service staff is slow, lazy, lacking professionalism, and disheveled.  \nThe place just has a really awkward vibe to it.  No thanks.
