One of the most incompetent setups I've ever experienced for their Thanksgiving brunch.  \n\nThey created an 'Express Lane' in which you could be \"seated faster\" if you paid an extra $25.  I went for that.  Got in line around 2:45pm.  The line only slightly moved over the next 15 minutes because people were getting out of line out of frustration.  \n\nAt 3pm we were told it would be about 20 minutes.  35 minutes after that we were told it would be another 10-15 minutes.  I was only second in line during this entire process.\n\nThen somebody came around at about 3:40pm to say they weren't accepting express lane tickets.  People started complaining (obviously -- we'd been standing in line for close to an hour at this point) so they allowed us to remain in the express lane (that didn't move).\n\nFor another half an hour the \"EXPRESS\" line didn't move as the regular line moved past.\n\nAt 4:25pm they took my money ($118 -- they still charged me an express fee) and sent me to another line.  \n\nAround 4:40pm I still stand in line waiting to be seated after spending $118 on lunch.  \n\nHey, Caesar!  F U!  Your hotel is past it's prime and I won't be back.  Oh, and ditch the 'Express Lane' you incompetent twats because you F'ing bozos don't know how to execute it!  I mean, honestly guys, that was BAD BUSINESS.
