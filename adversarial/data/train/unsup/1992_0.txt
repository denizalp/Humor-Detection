This is a maaaan's world -- in my best James Brown impression.  This is also a man's bar, I think the term \"sausage-fest\" was coined here.\n\nThis is an awesome cigar bar with some tasty beverages.  I tried the Macallan 25 here and fell in love, we're getting married next week.  I'm not going to give you too many details because I want you to go there yourself to check it out.\n\nMy only gripe about this place is that they have two unisex restrooms.  There is no need for this, it's a small enough place where there isn't a stampede of men running to the restroom together.  C'mon, give the ladies their own loo.  Also, toilet seat covers are a must!
