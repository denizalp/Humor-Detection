I never really thought that I had a sweet tooth, but looking back at my past Yelp reviews I have plenty of \"sweet\" items. I LOVE Nothing Bundt Cakes! They have never disappointed me with their moist cakes and cream cheese frosting! Oh baby! I think my personal favorite flavors are the White Chocolate Raspberry and Marble. I think the individual sizes are perfect for a two day dessert for one person, but for those with a birthday bring on the 8 incher or 10 incher!
