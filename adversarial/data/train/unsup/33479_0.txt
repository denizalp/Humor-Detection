I took my hubby here for his birthday we had a great time. The restaurant wasn't very busy because it was two days before Christmas and not many tourists in town. So I told the server it was my husband's birthday hoping that that would get him a free dessert because one of the other restaurants said that if it's your birthday to let them know and that they would accommodate you for such things in Las Vegas. Well not the case here but it was worth it to spend the $8 for dessert we had that Dome cake thingy that has whipped cream and strawberries it was very delicious the restaurant put Happy Birthday in writing on his plate. The pasta was very good and so was the chicken that I had and my husband Seafood dish I forgot what it was called but he loved it. The chef came out to ask if we were pleased with the meal and yes we were. The prices are not bad and the quality is very good. Just don't expect a free be for your birthday or any occasion the waitress said They don't serve freebies for such occasions.
