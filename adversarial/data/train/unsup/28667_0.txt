i'm not a huge seafood guy but my girlfriend is.  thus ... we've been here a few times.\n\nrick and adam are two of the best chefs in all of las vegas.  that says something about them in a city that's known for service rather than ambiance (the opposite of los angeles).\n\neverything we've ever eaten here has been beyond amazing.\n\ndefinitely looking forward to the next time!
