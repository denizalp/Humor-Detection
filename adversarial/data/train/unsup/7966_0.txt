If the window's any indication, Nando's is the place to be among the younger civil servant set. \n\nEvery day around lunchtime, this place is packed with sharp-dressed 20-30 year olds, looking for different poultry than their Chalet-loving parents. Quarter chicken with dries and sauce? That's as old school as the finger-bowls they used to offer. \n\nNando's is hip. It's now. it's confusing. \n\nWe wait in line to be seated among the pretty young things of Bay Street, only to jump up in order to place our order at the cash. \n\nWe choose from a dizzying array of chicken and sides, and customize our birds with a choice of peri-peri sauce. \n\nMy colleague opts for grilled chicken breast with salad. I choose a chicken sandwich, extra-hot, with a ice of allegedly special potato wedges. \n\nFood arrives within a few minutes (a good thing, since we're on the clock to get back to our respective offices). \n\nThe chicken is...well, chicken. Cooked just a bit past juicy, it's nonetheless livened by the Peri-Peri sauce (which itself registers as more sweet than heat). \n\nMy sandwich arrives on hefty Portuguese bread, which may actually be the best thing about it (although fresh lettuce and ripe tomato are welcome surprises for late Fall). \n\nThe aforementioned wedges are the usual spice-dredged deep-fried slabs 'o' spud. My colleague salutes my willpower, but frankly I'd rather save room for the bread. \n\nNando's may be the new school in Toronto's chicken scene, but for fries and sauce that's truly boss, I'd rather kick it old school at the Chalet Swiss.
