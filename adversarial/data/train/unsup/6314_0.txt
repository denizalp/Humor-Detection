Another gift card review from me.  The trick I think we are finding with larger chain restaurants is to order off the healthy options menus.  They can't just drown your food in butter, give you a ton of it and call it a day.\n\nSo that's what we did.  We both had a chicken dish that was fine if not a tad forgettable. This was a couple weeks back now.  The service was prompt , polite and attentive.
