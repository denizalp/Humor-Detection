First, be prepared to pull out a wad of cash for this one. It's not cheap, but good food seldom is. I can't say this is a five star, because the service is iffy, and it's actually connected to the Courtyard Marriott next door - so the selection has to cater to travellers as well as those with a more educated palate.\n\nAlcohol selection is fair, with a nice wine menu and a fully stocked bar. Local brews including IPA beers are on tap, and served in what appears to be 8 oz glasses. So two are not a problem, until you see that they are priced at the usuall 12 oz price for only an 8 oz portion.\n\nSelection is good, but again - the portion size is small. Very small. I don't like to gripe, but when I get a plate of moderately priced food - I like to be able to see it and not most of the plate. While prepared well, I can't say it leapt over my tastebuds either. I had the pork and fillet mignon mixed grill selection - but what I saw my friends get for $22 was absolutely too little for a \"prok specialty\" dish. Three small, two inch round medialions, 3\/4\" thick is just not enough of a portion size. Even if you are on a scrict diet.\n\nThe decorations are nice, and it does make for a good impression if you are taking a dress model out to dinner. If you're taking a business collegue or a relative - you might want to think twice about going here. Good food, just not liking the portion size.
