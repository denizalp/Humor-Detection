Last week some friends and I decided we wanted to go someplace that had good pizza. This placed was rated the best on yelp and I usually can trust their rankings.  \n\nUnfortunatley, I was really disappointed.  The pizza was average\/ below average.  I'd say one step above fast food delivery.  Our server, Yoshi, was courteous when he was around but we had to go find him inside the restaurant when all 5 of us had no more water and had run out of beer.  \n\nThey would have gotten 2 stars but the owner\/manager was very nice and came out to talk to us a few times.  \n\nThere has GOT to be better pizza in this town!! Doesn't there?!?
