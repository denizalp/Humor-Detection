This was my first time coming here. The employees were super nice and totally sweet when it took us forever to decide. My sister in law got a pancake breakfast and I got the biscuits and gravy. It was all pretty good. It's kinda standard diner fair. The gravey was a little different than I'm used to, good but different. The sausage was yummy and the eggs were cooked right. My sister in laws pancakes were HUGE  it was in a mid price range.
