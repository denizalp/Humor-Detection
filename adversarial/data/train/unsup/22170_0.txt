I'm almost embarrassed (key word here is 'almost) to admit that the only piercings I have are one on each ear, and that I got them done at Steve's.  \n\nMy first go-round with ear piercing had been at a Claire's in the mall when I was 17.  My words of wisdom: Don't trust a teenager with a gun.  It was awful and over the course of two years, they were infected constantly and never healed.  The holes actually sunk to the bottoms of my earlobes, somehow.  I let them close.\n\nI got the new ear piercings a few years ago at Steve's.  The lady there was nice, efficient and professional.  Everything was very sterile, as you might hope at a tattoo and piercing parlor.  They used stainless steel hoops which lent themselves to the healing process immensely (and were cute and fashionable).  I healed very quickly and didn't get all disgusting and infecty.  Plus, they gave me a bumper sticker and key chain!  Woohoo, prizes!
