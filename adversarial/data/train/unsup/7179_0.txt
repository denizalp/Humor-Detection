If I could give this place 0 stars I would. They are liars!!!! I couldnt get my laptop to accept a charge and so I brought it there with the charger and asked if the charger was broken. They took it in the back for a minute came back out said the charger was fine and that it was probably my hard drive and told me it was going to cost a fortune and i should just trade the computer in they would give me store credit towards buying a new one. I told them I would think about it and brought it to my friends house. He happened to have the same computer I plugged his charger into mine and it started working fine. It was just the charger and either they are reallllly stupid or they were trying to scam me!!
