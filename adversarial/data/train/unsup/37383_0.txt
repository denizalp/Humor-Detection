My husband and I were in Vegas a couple weeks ago and wanted to visit the much anticipated City Center. We walked around the Aria Hotel which is totally fabulous, we're going to stay there next time we visit, and wandered over into Social House for dinner. The decor is sexy and romantic and the hostess was very friendly.  Their cucumber salad was pretty good but their Kalbi steak was not good - it was missing all the flavor that makes it Kalbi, so it was just plain. Their \"dessert\" are sushi rolls and they're alright. We've definitely had better sushi in California. The waiter was OK - he seemed a little pompous and as we told him it was our first visit, he made some recommendations but seemed really pushy. When we told him we wanted to order our own food he didn't seem happy. Food was 3 star, waiter was 2.5. It wasn't that great, I'd say you go there more for the atmosphere than the service of food. We probably won't go back again.
