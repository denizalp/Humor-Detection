First things first.. WHY does this place only have 1 star??? :( \nMy experience was GREAT!!! :)\nAlmost all the nurses and techs were GREAT!!! :)\nLucy (the night nurse), was AMAZING!!! :) Me and my Mom truly know that Lucy was an angel put near me to watch over me all night. Lucy was nice, really \"got\" me, and was willing to tell me about her life, talk about our beliefs in God, and be AMAZINGLY NICE and comforting to me in such an unfamiliar place.\nDr. Adelayo was AMAZING too!!! :) She understood me, and talked with my regular psychiatrist to collaborate and agree on what medications to give me. Her and my regular psychiatrist were both RIGHT!!! :) She also told me some helpful information that I have been looking for for 2 years.\nTessa & Ray (the admitting nurses on duty the night I was admitted), were VERY nice, cheerful, reassuring, and cheerful!!! :) They really cared about me and my Mom during this unsettling situation.\nMost of the staff at this hospital were AMAZING!!! :)\nI did not like one doctor that I won't mention on the Internet, but my Mom got that handled. :)\nThe whole team at Banner Behavioral Health Hospital were nice, caring, reassuring, and really wanted me to be well enough to be discharged. I finally did, after 12 days, many struggles and being put on contact\/droplet isolation precautions due to a virus I picked up. \nI wouldn't want to go back here because I was not in a good \"place\" when I was admitted, BUT I LOVED the help I received here to become the person I am today!!! :)
