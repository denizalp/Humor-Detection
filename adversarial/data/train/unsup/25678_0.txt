due to the hot weather i was really craving asian shaved ice (shaved ice, fruit, ice cream, and condensed milk) and found this place.  it was really cute, cozy, and the staff was friendly.  we went through their small selection of pastries and all chose a different one to try.  usually asian bakeries don't make their pastries sweet, but this place did.  four of us ended up sharing two pastries (custard and red bean buns) and saved the other two for later since it was too sweet for us.  the shaved ice was pretty large and was definitely big enough for four of us to share, but the quality of the fruit was disappointing since you could tell that half of it was canned fruit.  overall this place wasn't horrible, but next time i am in las vegas i will be trying out a different bakery.
