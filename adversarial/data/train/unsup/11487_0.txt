I had no clue that they opened a Burger King downtown, but of course I'm not always looking for fast food when I'm in the downtown area.  Looking for a quick bite to eat and this being the closest thing around, we decided to give it a go.\n\nIt's a rather small area when you walk in.  You can tell this is setup to be a quick format, quick turnaround location.  Not much of a seating area, it actually looks like a quarter of what you are use to.  However they do have a high bar type table that makes it easy if you want to eat your meal quickly and be on your way.  Another thing I like about this location is that they have two self serve checkout machines.  Bypassing the counter all together making for an easy transition to your food.\n\nThe food is basic, same as you can get at any Burger King in the area.  However, you may have to repeat yourself several times over to get the right order.  And from my experience, it still doesn't come out right.  Did I miss my onion rings I specifically asked for?  Of course, but I wasn't going to wait any longer for my food.
