Our Daughter lived and worked in Charlotte for five years. She wanted to change her career course, so she headed for NYC. We dined here during every visit and really enjoyed the meals--lunch or dinner. The sad news--this was our last visit due to our daughter's relocation.\n\nThe Pommes Frites are to die for ! One order was not enough--again, so we ordered more! Service is always excellent every time we dined here. I ordered the Fettuccine a la Carbonara and it was excellent--it was hot until the last bite. Drink refills arrived without a problem--a great sign of service. \n\nWe enjoyed lunch here over the years along with dinner. If you want a great meal with excellent service, LULU is the place!
