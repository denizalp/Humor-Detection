This is the casino of fast food.  You go in knowing the house is going to rip you off, but the novelty of this joint is what makes going at least once mandatory.\n\nMy wife and I went to an early movie and for the first time there was no line at around 9:30 on a Friday night.  I ordered a double shack burger and an order of fries, while the Misses had a single with a strawberry shake.  Total bill was $23 for four items.  The burger was tasty, but come on, $8 for a double burger ought to include the fries.  The wife's shake appeared to be about 12 fluid ounces.\n\nFor slightly less money, you can go around the corner and visit Smashburger which the food is about the same quality, or you could go over to Zack's Hamburgers and get a Zack Special for about half the price of The Shack.  As a matter of fact when we were watching the movie \"American Animals\" I told the wife that one scene looked like Zack's, and found out later that the movie was filmed in Charlotte and that was Zack's Hamburgers.  They don't make movies at bland establishments like Shake Shack, but they do at Zack's where you can go for the ambiance but stay for the food!
