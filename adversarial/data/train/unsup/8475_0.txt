WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nThe Tika masala, spinach paneer and goat currie are good options. The butter chicken is also very tasty. \n\nIt was different from the other Indian restaurants I've been to though. They don't serve the curries in the steel bowl. They serve the curries in a regular porcelain bowl. The rice didn't taste that great though. Good quality balsamati rice goes a long way for a good meal with curry. The naans tasted great though. I generally liked the curries we got for the table. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nIf you order the masala tea, it doesn't taste like masala tea. It tasted like regular black tea with milk inside so i wouldn't bother trying it. Just focus on trying the curries!
