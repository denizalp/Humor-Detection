After a pretty insane Saturday night, I needed something amazing to warm my heart.  When I think of hearty comfort food, my go-to is either Indian or Thai.  The problem is that I always have a hankering for Thai food on Sundays when most of them are closed.  Thankfully, Thai E-San is smart enough to be open on Sundays and I decided to call in a order this time.  I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Basil entree and the Spicy Green Bean entree (yes, I needed two entrees after this particular Saturday evening).  The spicy level can range from 1-5, so I went with a 4.  My biggest complaint last time was that it wasn't as spicy as I ordered.\n\nThey got the heat right this time so I was a pretty happy camper.  Both of my dishes were pretty amazing-I preferred the spicy green bean.  So, with the Sunday opening and the actual food, this place totally deserves another star.  The lady who took my order was pleasant, and told me that I had a beautiful name (bonus points, right?).  \n\nThey've only been around for two months, and they may become my go-to for my beloved Thai comfort food so try 'em out!
