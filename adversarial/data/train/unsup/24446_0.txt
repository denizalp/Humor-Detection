An awful, rude bartender cheated me out of $14 the other day. I had a coupon for a buy one get one drink free. He did not seem very happy about this. A vodka and soda and a mai tai were ordered and he said $14. I asked if that was correct. There's no way it was that much. My thought is the coupons help drive further business and people often end out getting a 2nd drink. I surely would have but not after he was rude and charged me that much. Also, he never gave me a copy of the bar tab prior to swiping my credit card so I couldn't even see how it ended out being that much. \n\nBad, bad experience and I won't be back. That's a shame because Planet Hollywood is my favorite casino.
