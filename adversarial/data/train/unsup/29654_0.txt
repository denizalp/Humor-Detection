Rockwood has outstanding service, an excellent bar and sommelier.\n\nWe arrived later at night, with a baby. The kitchen was about to close, but they kept it open to serve us.\n\nConsidering the situation the food was very good. Staring from best and going to reasonably good:\n1. Oysters were fresh, served with light, sweet mignonette. \n2. Calamari was lightly fired and tender on the inside.\n3. Pate Chinois was perfectly prepared, a bit on the sweeter side, but paired well with the potatoes. Just note that it's light if you're hungry.\n4. Hamburger was tasty, but slightly over cooked, for me. If you like your meat well done with a little bit of char, this one is perfect for you. We had it with fires and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n5. Risotto with scallops was the least impressive. Beet risotto was tasty, but scallops were a bit over cooked and chewy.\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant. The risotto with scallops doesn't seem to be on their menu currently, but if it comes back, I'd avoid it. Otherwise, Rockwood was 5 stars.
