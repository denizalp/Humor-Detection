This place is outstanding!  They were a breath of fresh air for a bride who needed pretty flowers on a budget! \n\nI went to ZuZu's Petals on a whim because my husband (then fiance) works near by.  I had been to four other florists who all treated me poorly or would not work with me because of my tight budget (one of those florists is also in downtown Mesa).  I was emotionally exhausted by the time I came here but Bess and her team were immediately cheerful and showed interest in working within my budget.  I was so relieved.  She even hugged me because she could probably see how mentally worn I was from dealing with not-too-nice florists and other wedding preparation hassles all day.\n\nMy mother picked up my flowers the day before the wedding with no problem.  The flowers travel well because ZuZu's puts them in glass containers inside small boxes.  The next day my flowers still looked great (minus one bouquet that my bridesmaid put in the fridge at the church and it froze because of the placement- my horticulturist aunt fixed it in a pinch!).  My bouquet was pretty and simple.  It was not exactly what I imagined but I was nonetheless happy with it and it looks wonderful in my pictures!\n\nIf you are a bride-to-be please skip all the nonsense at other florists and relax knowing that ZuZu Petal's will take care of all of your needs and work with you.  They are some of the most pleasant business people I have ever worked with.  Everyone agreed that the flowers were beautiful and that means a lot on your wedding day!
