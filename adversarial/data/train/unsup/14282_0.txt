Live in Ahwatukee and been waiting before going into Buddyz so they could get the kinks out. 6:30pm on a Thursday night stopped in for dinner and sat at the bar. The bartender\/server promptly came by to tell us they were out of toasted ravioli, fried mozzarella and their 10in deep dish pizza. OK then. Bar is sparse and they told us they have opted to only do wine and beer because they do not want a bar crowd- they want the family business. That's fine. Asked for a wine list and was told only one exists so it would be hard to find. He named off a few wines so I ordered and unknown sauv blanc and my friend a Stella. We decided to get a medium thin crust with onions, mushrooms and green peppers. The place was not packed but the pizza still took over an hour to get. When it came the green pepper was haphazardly thrown on the pizza... some pieces had it others had none. The pizza itself was fine and even rather bland.  Nothing special to keep you coming back for it. Sadly the service was slow. \n\nI would give it a try for yourself. But Ahwatukee has a number of good pizza places (Spinato's and Florencia to name a few) that you could skip the trip into the foothills and still enjoy good pizza elsewhere.
