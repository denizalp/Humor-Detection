My family loves coffee cake so when I saw homemade coffee cakes here I was excited to tke one home.  It was dry and extremely crumbly, very disappointing.  Our go-to coffee cake is Grandma's from New England. This didn't come close. We picked at it for a couple of days and then tossed half of it because it was stale.  They do have a huge selection of donuts cookies, bread and cake.  I will stop by and give something else a try.  The strussels looked really good. 5 stars for selection but didn't love what we ordered.
