When I'm craving Taco Bell this is my preferred location. Service is always spot on and I have never had any issues with my orders or being skimped on meat.\nTaco Bell was one of my favorite fast food joints in high school and I love that even as an adult I can still get the same food that I loved at that time, Nachos, Taco Pizza and the Taco Supreme!
