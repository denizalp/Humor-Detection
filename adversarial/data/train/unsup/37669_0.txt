I probably come here once every time I'm in Vegas because there's always a need to stock up on drinks\/snacks\/ramen or pick up some fresh kimchi or get some bulgogi in the food court.\n\nGreenland always has plenty of people because it's a nice oriental market (mainly Korean). \n\nMy favorite things are the pastries from the bakery, the food court, sac-sac grape drinks, mandoo, kimchi, and everything else in the place.
