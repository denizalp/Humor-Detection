The first time I went to Mesa Arts Center was one of the first times I had been to Mesa in many years, and I was skeptical.  As we drove down \"Country Club\" passing Beer World, The Pawn Man, and a check cashing business on every corner, I didn't expect much.  But as we got to Main Street, things started looking up.  And then we arrived....completely unexpectedly, this gorgeous modern building emerges.  \n\nFirst off, this place is huge.  With several art galleries and beautifully landscaped grounds, Mesa Arts Center hosts performances ranging from music, theater, and dance to comedy and National Geographic Live.  We've since returned for the Nat Geo series several times and never cease to be impressed by the architecture, the acoustics, and the staff.  On one visit, we had vouchers to exchange for \"whatever is left\" seats and were given seats so good, we try to request them now.  And I love that the parking garage is steps away and only $5!
