Probably my favourite sweet potato fries in the city. They're extremely thick cut - think one whole sweet potato sliced lengthwise into maybe four shards - and deliciously spiced with cinnamon, cumin, maybe cloves? They come with sour cream and also be sure to try the homemade jerk seasoning.\n\nGrilled cheese sandwich on focaccia with havarti, brie and aged cheddar and pesto spread is also otherworldly. Who knew I liked pesto?? I certainly didn't.\n\nIt's easy to be neglected on the patio and service can be spotty. If you can, try to get the hot, bearded, plaid-shirted server. He's also good for a flirt, so if you're out of practice, he's happy to oblige.
