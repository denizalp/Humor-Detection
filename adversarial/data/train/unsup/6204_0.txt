I'll be forced to be uncharacteristically short-winded in this review, as I had a very short overnight stay here.\n\nArriving late and shipping out early, I can say that everything from a check-in and check-out standpoint was very seamless and simple.\n\nThe room was very nicely appointed, in-line with the chain's other properties.  It was exceptionally clean, fresh-smelling and comfortable.  \n\nThe beds were comfortable and clean, the space was decent, and the bathroom was spotless.\n\nIn the morning, we had our invoice slipped under the door to the room, which I LOVE, and miss from my business traveling days.  It's a really professional, expedient, and trusting (on the hotel's behalf) way of handling checkout, and I love it.\n\nWhat got this location on this stay to the above-average four stars, though, is that even though breakfast was stated to begin at 6:00 am, nearly the entire buffet of solid options, including proteins, was available long before that.  Since our early flight dictated hotel departure far prior to 6:00 am, this was highly appreciated.  I would have been happy with fresh coffee, but was thrilled to grab a quick bite before a long morning of travel.\n\nThere's an outdoor pool, a solid exercise facility with lots of equipment, and ample parking.  \n\nThe only odd thing from our stay, and the reason I don't edge this to 5 stars, is that upon exiting the elevator at 5:20 am, my kids found a homeless man sleeping in the aforementioned exercise room.  Suffice to say this was slightly concerning from either a security and\/or management standpoint.  I'll assume it was a one-time slip, but felt it worth mentioning...
