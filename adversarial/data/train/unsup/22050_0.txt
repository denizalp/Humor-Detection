We eat here a lot. Pizza, wings, salads and calamari. All are yummy good!\nThe Pizza\nNew Yorkish crust but not cartoon huge slices. Their sauce is tangy but not overpowering. Their cheese isn't greasy and the toppings are always fresh. I'm a cheese pizza fan and I do like theirs.\n\nThe Wings\nI always order them the same, naked, extra crispy and medium sauce on the side. I travel all over the country and I have to say Lorenzo's wings are hands down my favorite. Perfect crispness, hot (temp wise) and meaty good. \n\nThe Salads\nTheir antipasto salad is another family favorite. Crispy lettuce, fresh tomatoes and fresh cut cheese and meats. I could eat it every day for sure.\n\nCalamari\nSlightly salty, crispy and perfect. Served with their marinara sauce it is again one of my favorite. \n\nWhat they lack in atmosphere they more than make up for in tastiness and price.
