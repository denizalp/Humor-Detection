This place is awesome!  Great food - friendly staff - awesome atmosphere!  Love the indoor\/outdoor feel with the garage doors and the set up is great!  Great for families or friends for late night!  Love the weekly live music!  South Charlotte needed a place like this!!  Try the Cajun burger or the Asian shrimp salad - yum!
