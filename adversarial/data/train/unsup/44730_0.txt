Husky Services - Las Vegas - Was fearful of having this company repair due to some of the reviews placed by home warranty customers. Nothing to worry about as microwave repair went very well. Repair person had to go to parts store to pick up part and was back in 30 minutes. If not for this company would have had to replace an expensive microwave. Also, they have been assigned by Landmark Home Warranty to repair our built-in Kitchen Aid refrigerator. Will update review after we see how the frig repair goes.
