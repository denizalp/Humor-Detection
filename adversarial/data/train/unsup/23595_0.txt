A few of us met David S. here for a quick snacky-snack. Love the vibe they have goin' on....waitstaff in Brittish Punk looking attire complete with Doc Martens, newspaper print dresses sported by the hostesses, beer kegs on the wall, sweet lighting and woodwork throughout the restaurant, very cozy and inviting.\n\nOur server Elise was awesome during our visit offering her expertise in food and drink selections, but the only bummer was that they were out of Duck Confit that day, so we couldn't feast on the very popular Duck Poutine..:( No worries though, we all shared the following off the Pub menu:\n\nDEVILISHLY DEVILED EGGS\nSelf explanatory, good, but anyone can make this at home\n\nSHEPHARD'S PIE\nA hearty mix of beef, lamb and veggies combined with butterylicious mashed potatoes...One of Ramsay's popular signature dishes,very good and comforting\n\nCLAMS AND MUSSELS IN SAFFRON BROTH\nCooked expertly, very delicious, and use the crostini to sop up all that saffron love!\n\nSHORTRIB AND BEEF CHEEK SANDWICH\nThis sandwich is in its own category, possibly one of the tastiest sandwiches you'll ever sink your teeth into...Perfectly braised shortrib, deep-fried beef cheek with arugula, aioli, and sweet onion jam served with gargantuan steak fries as big as my hand? Definitely the star of the night! the Innis & Guinn went perfectly with all of these selections too.\n\nDefinitely returning for the duck poutine, that is if my opu doesn't pull a jedi mind trick into getting another sandwich!.....ALOHA!!!\n\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(12\/100) \"Gordon's Gastropub\"
