The food and service was so great we went here twice during our visit to Vegas. The first time we visited Vegas we heard a lot of great things but didn't get the chance to visit. This time we made sure we had to try it. \n\nFried chicken is the best food ever and I am OBSESS with it. Really been looking forward to Southern style fried chicken. This place is not a let down at all!! The fried chicken is literally addicting, the chicken is moist and crispy. Their house made hot sauce is also very delicious. The price point is very reasonable to me, honestly, if you want a lower price fried chicken there is always .. other alternative but the meat is farm fresh. \n\nDefinitely get LEWELLYN'S FINE FRIED CHICKEN, CINNAMON APPLE HAND PIES, EGG N' HAM. All dishes were amazing. The dessert are also very delicious and cute. \n\nBottom line is, it's a must visit. Be sure to book a reservation, they get busy really fast.
