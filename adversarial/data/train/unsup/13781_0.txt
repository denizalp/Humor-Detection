This place has seen better days.  They had the opportunity to implode this thing and start from scratch in the late 90's....instead, they chose to renovate.  Now, it's just a shell of it's former self.....always has that \"empty\" feeling to it, unless there's a citywide event that sells out the city.\n\nThe casino is tired and the restaurants are just ok.  The best thing about it is the roller coaster.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend any of my friends to stay here.\n\nReturn Factor - 10%
