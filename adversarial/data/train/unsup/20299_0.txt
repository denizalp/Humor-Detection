Rename it Steak 'n Shame, because this is a Steak 'n Shake in name only! The name is reminiscent of my youth back in St. Louis, where Steak 'n Shake meant the most delicious steak burgers, awesome cheese fries, chili mac, and mouth watering shakes and malts, topped off with exceptional friendly service. \n\nThis place is wholly lacking in all of the above. If you are coming here thinking you are getting Steak 'n Shake, I can guarantee you will leave disappointed. The food doesn't taste anything close to the real deal, many of the staples like the chili mac are on not the menu, and even the shakes don't quite taste like a Steak 'n Shake should. I was happy to find the Frisco Melt on this condensed menu, but it tasted only marginally like a Steak 'n Shake Frisco Melt. My guess is the folks running this location have never experienced a true Steak 'n Shake, so food flavor and consistency is right out the window. Everything honestly tasted like it comes from an entirely different restaurant.\n\nThis was a tough review for me, because I wanted so desperately to love this place, but it's inauthentic.  I can only blame the company for allowing a phony quick-stop version of their brand to be out there diminishing what is otherwise one of my favorite places to eat. Service may be quick, but it's not friendly. In spite of the restaurant's cramped size, it's been dirty the couple of times I've visited, while the employees mill around in a poor attempt to appear busy.\n\nHeaven forbid anyone decides to open a pale version of White Castle out here just to try cashing in on the name and reputation. This Steak 'n Shake isn't worth the trip to ASU.
