OMG. garbage B.S. trash, Or maybe Im just getting old.  Horrible accoustics as the other shows music going on next door and upstairs drowns out the whole dialouge of the show.. Got the tickets free and hated it at that price. 2 of my guests fell promptly asleep. Some of the young kids sitting next to me were cracking up laughing though.   Pls. close down asap.
