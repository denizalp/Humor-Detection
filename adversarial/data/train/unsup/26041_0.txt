I was in desperate need for tile flooring in my home from owning 4 dogs. I started the search on yelp and came across affordable flooring.  They were my first company I got an estimate from, and after four other estimates I decided to go with them. Travis and lisa were amazing to work with.  They were very patient with my partner and I through all our changing of tile decisions. I didnt know much about this whole process, but  Travis and Lisa made me feel  very comfortable from the first phone call to the end. Not only was the price great,  but my flooring looks absolutely stunning!  Everyone who has seen my new floor has loved it! I'm glad I went with my gut feeling, and hired Affordable Flooring.
