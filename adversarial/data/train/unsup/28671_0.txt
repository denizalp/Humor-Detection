Went to Casanovas only because I had some time to kill before my hair appointment next door.  I just moved to AZ from FL about 6 months ago and STILL had not found anywhere good for pizza.  I ordered the white pizza with onions....OH MY WOW!!!  It was definitely the best pizza in AZ, maybe the best I have ever had.  Luigi was incredibly friendly and made sure I was good.  Great food, great people!  My new favorite place!
