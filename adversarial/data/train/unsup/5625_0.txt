Chevy's is fresh-Mex, not Tex-Mex, don't get it twisted. I was a fan of this chain when I lived in CA, and am glad we have a location in town- it's probably a good thing that it's far away from me, because I'd come in and eat their chips and salsa way too often if they were closer.\n\nThe combo plates are my usual go-to, the five piece is even enough for me and my guy to share- sometimes we add on the tortilla soup. The cheese enchiladas with meat sauce and their tamales are great options, and my BF always hogs the crispy tacos and chile relleno. \n\nWe recently came in with a group, and our server was great about getting our orders out quickly, constantly refilling the chips and salsa, and making sure we had everything we needed. She was really nice, too. Location is going for a cantina atmosphere but seems a little too dark to me. Easy exterior entrance and outdoor dining area are bonuses.
