\"In spite of all the hubbub, security at the airports has been surprisingly smooth. Oddly enough, 'surprisingly smooth' is what the TSA agent said after my last patdown. Ever seen a Ken doll?\" â€• Jimmy Fallon\n\nMcCarran is your standard run-of-the-mill airport. It's a bit dated and has seen better days but it's an airport: ticket kiosks, security checkpoints with super slow and long lines, standard airport food, et cetera.  One novelty that might be uncommon that McCarran offers that no other airport offers are slot machines.  Lots and lots of slots!  Feel the gentle shaking of your chair?  You're not getting lucky nor did you accidentally drop $0.25 into a machine to have your chair vibrate for your pleasure.  It's the tram!  They have moving walkways in certain areas to help get you where you're going faster [mainly to get you from your plane to luggage claim].  Need a ride?  They have taxi, shuttle, and limo accommodations just right outside.  This city is on the ball with their transportation so even if there's a line, it moves pretty fast.  Free WiFi is offered so enjoy!\n\nLike most airports, car rental companies are conveniently nearby and The Strip is ridiculously close --- $20ish by taxi and like $7 by shuttle.  All in all, McCarran International ain't too shabby although their bathrooms need a revamp.\n\nA tip to tourists heading from the airport to The Strip [and vice versa] by taxi:  Tell them not to take the freeway.  It's the difference of an $18 trip vs $30!
