We frequent this restaurant and all other Wynn owned restaurant for their world class vegan menus.\n\nThe last time we were there we took my in-laws for mommy in-laws birthday. I'll make this review about this particular night:\n\nShe had a prawn? daily special and seriously it was the largest and scariest shrimp I have ever seen in my life. That single shrimp was bigger than a small lobster. I did not take a photo of it because it grossed me out so much...anyway...she said it was wonderful. \n\nFather in law ordered a steak of some kind and he said it was the best steak he has ever eaten before. \n\nHubby ordered the roasted vegan mushroom entree and wow it was amazing. It had about $50 of beautiful roasted mushrooms. He also ordered a small house salad prior.\n\nI started off with the vegan mushroom soup which was a wonderful creamy delight. Thick, warm and yummy I crave this and try to replicate it at home. \nFor my entree I ordered the quinoa cakes. The portion is huge.\n\nI always love the vegan cheesecake for dessert and for this particular birthday night they brought out a huge piece of cheesecake for her. \n\nPerfection. Every time.
