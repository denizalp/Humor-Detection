So we made reservations at 10:15 but had to wait 20 extra minutes to be seated by the window for the most beautiful Las Vegas view.\n\nLago is a newest restaurant by Michelin Starred Chef Julian Serrano; located in the Bellagio, which is a new rendition of a contemporary Italian themed Cuisine which just opened in April, 2015.\n\nTHE STAFF -\n\nWhile our servers were not on their best behaviors, the food picked up their charm.\nThe tables are so close that the waiter's  butt kept jabbing me to assist the table next to me and he never said sorry, it almost felt like he wanted his butt in my face! \n\n\nTHE FOOD -\n\nPasta fagioli e cozze -  this soup with muscles which my dining companions couldn't stop raving about. It was delightful and had a bit of clean yet rustic flavor without being overwhelming with salt.\n\nI had their Cesar salad, and I rarely compliment salad dishes, but the seasoned sardines blew me away, it was really magnificent.  The texture of the vegetables and croutons was one of the, if not the best mixture I've experienced from a salad dish.\n\nRisotto di fruti di mare - My second course was the Risotto, which was probably the best risotto dishes I've had in Las Vegas, with elegant and aromatic flavor and impeccable texture of the farro. I hadn't distinguished what trick the kitchen pulled off, but the king oyster and maitake mushroom tasted almost like a flawless grilled meat, with smoked macadamia and crispy leeks to support the mushrooms. \n\nPesce fish - orata which was perfectly cooked but the reserved yet elegant flavor of curry broth added another dimension to this dish and the flavor was modest without being salty.\n\nI would definitely recommend coming here again.  It's my top 5.
