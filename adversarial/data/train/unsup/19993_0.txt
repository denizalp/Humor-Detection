I had an issue with my AC unit that was connected to ventilation with my swamp cooler. One summer the AC stopped functioning and my house got very humid and I couldn't get my house cool. I tried a few 'popular' valley air conditioner repair companies and was sorely disappointed at their ability to fix my issue. After a month of headache, I got fed up and called SRP, and they referred me to this repairman. Absolute Zero was like finding a glass of ice water in the hell of the Phoenix summer.\n\nThe main repairman who came to my house was incredible. He had more devices to test the AC and quality of air coming through vents in my home than Inspector Gadget. He took out my swamp cooler, calibrated my AC, and found out my dryer was not hooked up to the vent correctly causing excess humidity. As soon as he was done, I couldn't quite turn my AC down to the bottom of the Kelvin scale, but I could enough to see my breath.
