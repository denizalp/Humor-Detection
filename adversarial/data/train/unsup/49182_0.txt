Just had the best nail experience I've had in over a year. I had an appointment with Lisa who did an amazing job with everything I asked of her (which was a lot). We sat together for about 4 hours and she sweet and detail oriented the entire time. The salon is very clean and all I the girls were very nice and friendly. For the first time in a long time I am excited for my next nail appointment.
