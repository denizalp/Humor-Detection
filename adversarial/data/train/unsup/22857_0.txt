I'm going to waste my time coming here anymore. I bought an extra phone charger cord & a phone case, both were broken withing 2 weeks. I'm not careless with my devices so I know it wasn't due to misuse or abuse. The quality of the products here is cut rate, similar to what you find at a swap meet. If you wanna pay your bill here that's no problem but buy genuine products, not the cheap copies sold here
