I'm pretty familiar with sushi. By far, this is the best sushi I've had on this side of town. Melt in your mouth fresh. Presentation is lovely. Rolls are made with care. Atmosphere is nice and mostly quiet. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is a little bit slow service, I'd give 4.5 if i could. Once the order was placed food came out pretty quickly though, so the chef is on point. I have not had any of the other food here but I will definitely be back to try. Our dinner was about the same price as most sushi joints, maybe a little more, but well worth it. Was not disappointed as i have been with other restaurants. Highly recommend.
