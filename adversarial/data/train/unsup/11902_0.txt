This target is conveniently located in a shopping center in Silverado ranch. \n\nThe layout is not your standard target format. It takes me longer to find things at this location. \nThis store loses its target feel for me due to different format layout.\n\nI would say this place is shopped less than blue diamond but more than green valley. \n\nI still prefer green valley Iocation better. \n\nFresh food section. \nFood cafe.\nAnchor store in shopping center. \n\nEasily accessed from the 215
