3.5 Star\n\nHand pulled noodle is MAGIC!\n\nI love the sound of fresh noodle slapping and whipping, it makes my heart goes pitter-patter.\n\nMagic Noodle is a brand new noodle place that open in Scarborough recently. The deco is chic and young, the price is reasonable... MAGIC!\n\nWe ordered the following to share:\n\nHand-Pulled Noodle with Beef ($7.99)\n- Noodle perfectly done: great bite, cooked just right\n- The soup base was surprisingly good with a slight delicate flavor of cumin\n- This is what I consider as hand made ramen, the traditional way with no machinery\n\nBeijing Style Sliced Noodles with Soy Bean Paste ($7.99)\n- I always love hand shaved\/sliced because of the more chewy and heavy texture, reminds me of pappardelle\n- I found this noodle a lot more filling and would satisfy my carb craving!\n\nCold Flavoured Assorted Vegetables ($3.25)\n- Cold veggie was A-OK to munch on while waiting for your noodles\n- Cloud ear fungus, tomato, cabbage, cucumber and of course hot pepper!!\n\nGoubuli Pork and Leek Bun ($0.99)\n\nService is kind of awkward though. No tea was offered and when I asked for some, I got served with hot water?! \n\nRight now Magic Noodle is opens till 11 pm but in the future as their business card states will be opens 24\/7?!! Seriously, I can have Noodle anytime I want?!!\n\nThis must be MAGIC!!
