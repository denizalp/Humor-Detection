BS +++\n\nAs a trail racer\/hiker I enjoy anything with  mud, dust, and rocks, and the occasional rattle snake and bunny encounters.  This place has it all.  It has a nice path to get to the mountains.  You have to park on the side of the road but guess what? ITS FREE.  The entrance to the trail is kind of hidden but you can see it.  It's about 15 minutes from SILVERTON Casion. Not even far at all.  So just make sure of a couple of things \n1) Bring water and snacks But DON'T YOU DARE LITER OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND BEAT YOU WITH YOUR EMPTY BOTTLE!!!\n2) Do not go after 1pm in Vegas because it gets dark by 4pm.\n3) Unless you have a good watch or GPS system on your  watch DO NOT go off path.\n4) Bring a buddy or a pet rock to protect you from any  hungry animals (not mandatory)\n5) Wear hiking shoes not your cute hipster Yeezy or any dumb walking shoes.  Your ankles or toes will hate you!\n6) Smile and enjoy! Set a goal time and go for broke!\n\nI didn't really run it but it's a cool place to ride your mountain bike - 29'ers are preferred or just run or walk it.  Don't forget your phone for some amazing selfies!!\n\nTechnical rating  3 out of 5\nDust rating 4 out of 5\nSnake rating none since it's cool but look out anyway\nSun rating HIGH\nWind rating Medium\nFun rating  5 out of 5\nRestrooms NONE (go behind a cactus)\nParking NONE (park on the side of the road)\n\n* Boomsauce scale.\nBW = Dis $@% is BASURA!
