I actually really like this place. I haven't been to the one in Tucson but it's the same owners. Congrats on the Scottsdale location. \n\nI've been here three times in the last 10 days and I think the food is great, the ambience is very clean, and the service has been terrific. I remember Grace and Maddi and I'm so sorry I forgot the first one who served us. All three ladies very fun, smiling, actually were real and engaging in conversation. It helps with everything and I enjoyed it even more. \n\nTo see all the stuff I got just look at my pictures but I haven't been disappointed at all and have had several items on the menu. My favorite and new love is shishito peppers and in the sauce they do is pure bliss. I also like the steam buns. The crab and bird were both great. Street noodles are a hit. \n\nIf you are with someone, I would suggest getting a bunch of food and sharing to experience all. I will obviously be back to feast. And ask your server what's good they haven't steered me wrong and they know their stuff.
