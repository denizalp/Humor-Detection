The only reason I came to this spot was because a close friend of mine recommended it to me. I thought it was just like any other Asian restaurant, but I was completely surprised by how amazing the food tasted. Now it's a go to spot in Vegas for me if I'm craving Asian American cuisine even if it's a little out of the way.\n\nI highly recommend getting their baby back pork ribs with honey plum glaze and I assure you its going to knock your socks off. I wished I ordered more because we had to split 4 pieces monster the three of us. Another plate worth mentioning is their pan fried shrimp dumplings which is the dim sum dish with whole shrimp in a translucent wrapper better known as Har Gow was the best I've ever had at any restaurant. You can taste the quality over cheaper dim sum places I've been to and by adding that crunch factor it was top notch. All the dishes I had here exceeded my expectations and to top it off the service fantastic. Our waitress gave us helpful recommendations that led to a very memorable dining experience in Vegas and it didn't hurt that she was cute too ;)
