I did not like it at all :\/\n\nAsked for a vegetal ramen that took a long time to come, the taste of the soup was like egg water and the noodles wasn't that good either. \n\nThe place itself is super clean but noisy, maybe I choose a bad day to go there but either way I don't think I would feel comfortable if I went any other day
