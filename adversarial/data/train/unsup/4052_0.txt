I stopped over here for lunch and although I was offered a seat out on the front porch I declined due to the heat. I also wanted to see the inside. One of the specials they had on the menu was their tossed salad covered with smoked salmon, strawberries, and feta cheese. I ordered that and got it rather quickly.  For some reason the salmon didn't agree with me so I asked if they would swap it out for their chicken salad which was made the same way but with farm raised chicken.\n\nThe swap out was definitely much better and you could tell the chicken was fresh and moist. The staff was very friendly and attentive to my needs. The portion size was huge so believe me I wouldn't have been able to eat dessert even if they had offered it to me. There is also a small bar area.\n\nThey have a beautiful fresco art on the side which is worth looking at. I would advise if coming to get here early because this place does fill rather quickly. Open seasonal only during the warmer months.
