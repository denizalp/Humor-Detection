Yesssss - Whenever I'm grocery shopping at Asiana (which let's be real, is pretty much like every weekend), I try to stop at their food court.. Asiana Kitchen Tofu & Grill is so convenient, pretty typically priced, and SO delicious!!  I've loved everything I've tried so far, and I appreciate that they include miso soup, and a few ban chan dishes along with their main entrees.  I mean, $11 for dil-sot bibimbap is pretty reasonable for just the dish by itself, but is truly a steal with the thoughtful sides added in.. \n\nTheir service is very friendly and efficient, and they have a fast turn around for orders - I never have to wait long for my food, which is perfect because I'm usually close to hangry by the time I realize I need to eat haha  \n\nI'd definitely recommend at least considering giving Asiana Kitchen Tofu & Grill a try if you're in the area, and for sure recommend coming here for lunch or a fast dinner if you're already in the shopping complex.. you really can't beat the convenience and ease of grabbing something to eat, especially if you're already feeling hungry from grocery shopping :)
