This place is very rundown and we should have left as soon as we saw the state of the salsa that was placed in front of us.  The tomatoes looked like they had either turned or the salsa at some point had been made, frozen, and then thawed.  \n\nThe staff don't look to be excited to be there so why would I be?  Watched a busser spill a bunch of food and drinks on the carpet and then sweep it up.  Started realizing that the edges of the carpet are black which is probably contributing to the musky smell of the restaurant.  For how long this place has been open I can only assume that at some point management changed over and they don't value the business as much as the previous people did.
