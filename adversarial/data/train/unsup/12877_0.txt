[I wrote this three years ago but somehow never posted it here.  Never again.  Never ever ever again.]\n\nI've ordered from these guys a few times, and their gyros, while greasy, are pretty tasty. The service has always been more than a bit surly, but tonight takes the cake. Here's a breakdown:\n7:50 P.M. I order two jumbo gyros with no onions and no tomatoes. After giving my credit card info to the guy on the phone (who is ornery as anything) I repeat: \"I did say 'No tomatoes and no onions, right?\" \"I heard you!\" he snaps.\n\n9:10 PM I call back, reminding him that I placed my order an hour and twenty minutes ago. I had expected the standard \"It will be there soon,\" but was somewhat surprised to hear him say, \"The driver will be back soon and he will pick it up then.\"\n\n9:30 The food finally arrives. I bring it into my apartment to find two gyros with-- you guessed it-- onions and tomatoes. I call to inform the restaurant of this error. The guy on the phone adamantly insists that, having prepared the order himself, he is certain there are no onions and tomatoes, to which I respond that I am, in fact, looking at onions and tomatoes. Now all these shenanigans would have been enough, had I not received another knock on my door at...\n\n9:40 The delivery guy knocks on my door. He does not have my food. He is here to PICK UP the erroneous order! This is the sort of thinking that leads these folks to take two hours delivering your food. I ask him why he is stopping by for this food, but the question seems to go over his head. \"Never mind,\" I say, \"It's just that it's been two hours.\" \"Yes,\" he responds. \"But we are very busy.\" \n\n9:50 Still waiting for my gyro and saliva combo...
