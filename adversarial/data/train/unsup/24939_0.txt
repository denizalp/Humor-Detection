Lyrics - Modern Talking - Cheri Cheri Lady)\n\nOh I cannot explain\nEvery time that I sing\nOr when I Yelp it's for real\nTake my heart\n\nI've been hungry too long\nOh I can't be for long\nTake a chance for ramen\nTake a star\nYou need it so\nThere's no place\nI'll ever go......\n\nCherry Cherry Blossom\nIt's a Noodle Cafe\nPhoenix's where you'll find it\nListen to your belly\nCherry Cherry Blossom\nYakisoba Noodles\nAlways like the first time\nLet me take a bite\n\nCherryblossom Noodle Cafe has been a love of mines for all times! Ever since my move to Phoenix, I've heard of this place. As time pass and new places started to pop up; Cherryblossom was able to stand it's own ground and still pump out great dishes with consistency!\n\nWhen I'm in need of a good warm noodle dish I come here. Their Ramen is pretty solid in general, but I'm more of a fan of their fried Yakisobas and my new favorite Nabeyaki Udon hot pot! Packed with a variety of seafood from shrimp, scallops, calamari, hamaguri, white fish, and vegetables; this hot pot is steaming with flavors that mom used to make, if you lived in an Asian household! This dish is definitely recommended on a cold winters day in Phoenix....like 70 or below haha!\n\nOverall, Cherryblossom delivers when it comes to good o noodle dishes. They even serve pasta which I've ever tried. The ambiance is cozy and cute and service is quick for sure, but I can't say they're super friendly at times haha! - Enjoy!
