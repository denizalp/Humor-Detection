TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  DO NOT GO HERE WITH A LARGE GROUP.\nI wish yelp gave me the option for zero or negative stars. My friends planned an event for me at this place and it was the worst experience I have ever had with a business. \n\nWhen my friend was trying to iron out detail about the event, Bobby always insisted on phone calls and would not communicate hardly anything via email. They agreed on no food\/drink minimum, happy hour prices, a set two hour window, said we could bring in decor and a cake with no fees, and the have the entire upstairs space for the event.\n\nWhen we arrived, Bobby was not present but his sister, the night manager was. She was extremely rude from the start, would only let us have a few tables instead of the entire lounge and said she had no idea about the agreement or conversation my friends had with Bobby.  We were flexible, thinking they might really need the space. But next thing we know she is saying there is a food\/drink minimum, threatening my friends who planned the event, and saying we had to pay a cake cutting fee which we were told was not required.  Not only was she insanely rude but when I became aware of the situation and asked to speak with her, she threatened to call the police and walked away. Talk about bad management and zero conflict resolution skills!  I couldn't believe this!\n\nI left a note for the owner, Bobby, asking him to call me to discuss the situation. I waited a few weeks before posting this to give him a chance to make it right. He has not.  So, please don't ever go there with a large party. After reading other posts, I think they do this intentionally to bully more money out of people.  They refuse to email so you have no documentation of what was discussed, then they play good cop\/bad cop as Bobby is amazingly never there on nights or weekends.
