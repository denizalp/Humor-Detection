I'll preface this by saying I'm not a huge fan of Forever 21. The clothes are cheap and tacky for the most part. There are some gems in there, but damn I'm too lazy to dig for them!! \n\nI liked how big and nice this store was, but it pissed me off that they would have them same merchandise replicated 2,3,4x in different spots in the store? So if you liked a shirt but you couldn't find your size it was like a treasure hunt roaming around the store trying to find where else they might have hidden your shirt. \n\nThe lines for dressing rooms and check out were quick and painless. Overall if you like the clothes at Forever 21, it's worth a stop in.
