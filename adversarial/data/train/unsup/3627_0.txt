The Grand Garden Arena at MGM in Las Vegas is a large venue.  Been here a few times over the years to watch various performances.  \n\nFrom the \"nosebleed\" sections, it is a bit tough to see the performers on stage.  Fortunately every time we've been here, there have been monitors situated throughout the arena.  Makes watching the performances easier.  Seats are not the best, but comfortable enough to get by.   Staff is decent.  Sound system is pretty good.\n\nOverall, it's an A-ok venue.  Of course what matters most is the show itself!  Enjoy whatever it is, you'll watch here!
