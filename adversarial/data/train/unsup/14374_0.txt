Wost customer service ever.  I came here to purchase a brand new labtop on a wenesday night.  I stood around looking for about 5 minutes before someone asked me if I needed assistance.  After another 15 minutes of waiting the same worker asked if anyone had come over yet.  Finally someone came over.  At this point I figured they had enlisted their top notch elite to come assist me, I was sadly mistaken.  They sent some hourly moron who didn't know anything about labtops.  She just read the description right below it.  I asked to speak to the manager and they directed to some schlub named bill who just said sowwwyyyyy.  Thanks a lot idiots next time I'll go to fry's
