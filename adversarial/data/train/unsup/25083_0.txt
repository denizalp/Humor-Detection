Not a fan of Dennys, and try to avoid them.  Occasionally my wife talks me into it for a quick bite with family or friends in town.  We stopped here Saturday after doing a maternity photo shoot with our daughters and were pleasantly surprised.  Our server was amazing and very charismatic.  She and I were able to joke and they were very empathetic and catered to my over heating, pregnant, daughter in law.  The food was decent by Denny's standards.  You cannot go into Denny's expecting a Michelin star meal.
