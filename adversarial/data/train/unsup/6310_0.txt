I mean, Costco...come on they have nearly everything.\n\nBut thing I like best is that they change it up. I am the home chef and now that it's gotten cooler in the desert, I'm bringing on my 'soup troupe' recipes. They have 2 types of chicken broths one can purchase. And if you don't feel like cooking your own, you can choose from two types of corn chowder, turkey sausage & kale, chicken tortilla soup, lobster bisque, clam chowder, and some others whose names are slipping my memory...\n\nTo avoid some health challenges, I've noticed also the number of gluten-free products increasing....and these products still taste very good... (Gluten-free apparently does HAVE to mean taste-free!)
