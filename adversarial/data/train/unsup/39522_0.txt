I was slightly inebriated, so I THINK this is the restaurant I went to. hahah. I tried confirming on the Venetian website, but that thing has been down for like 2 weeks now.  Oh wait...I checked out the pictures on here and now I know it is the place I went to.  Phew. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nPostickers- good\nWonton Soup- didn't try it but it looked good\nSpicy Beef Noodle soup- it was above average, not that spicy though\nBeef Chow Fun- pretty tasty\n\nI'm not sure if I would be more particular about it if it wasn't 2:30 in the morning.  I would come back if it was late and that was the only thing open, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.
