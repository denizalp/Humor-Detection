My daughter brought me here after having attended a yelp event. I had the lobster roll and added the fries. The bread on the lobster roll is the best! It is just like you get back east and was perfectly toasted. The whole sandwhich was really great and the salad that comes with it had just the right amount of balsamic. The brown sugar butter sauce that comes with the fries is really tasty. I also had the lemon bar and fruit for dessert. It had lots of great flavor without being overpowering. \n\nWhat really stood out was our server. Allard was so helpful and nice. He brought us a dinner menu since I wanted to come back and try more and aswered all the questions I had about what was on it. He really took time to help us and kept our drinks full and was very sweet. I can't wait to go back and try more. It was all so good!
