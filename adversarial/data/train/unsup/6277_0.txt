Wynn's Buffet beats other buffets on the strip hands down (In terms of quality and price variables).\n\nI do believe their weekday lunch is a very good value ($23.95).  You get all those variety of meats and vegetables to choose from. The taste are decent to excellent for most.  My personal favorite is their grilled flank steak and seabass.  Its restaurant quality-like food!\nOther items worth mention during lunch:  Chinese Chicken Salad (Replaced by Smoked Salmon Salad during dinner time). Soup station. \n\nDinner starts at 3:30pm.  It includes the famous Alaska King Crab Legs, Prime Ribs, Jumbo Shrimp Cocktails, and more deserts to choose from including the made to order waffles and crepes.  Their seafood and hot food stations changes between lunch and dinner too.  \n\nService is attentive. I am quite happy with the service that they provided.  Its good to visit here again for lunch, or dinner, or if you can, sit from lunch TO dinner :P  But then you will have to workout extra hard after the visit from The Buffet.
