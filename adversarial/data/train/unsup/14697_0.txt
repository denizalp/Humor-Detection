In a former life, I lived near Montford and I would drive past this place all the time without giving it a second thought. Thank God for Yelp. 4.5 stars strong? I had to come see what all the fuss is about.\n\nDollar tacos on Tuesdays? Yes please! They do beef, pork, and chicken options for the special. I went with two spicy chicken and a beef. Sidenote: the woman in front of me got a salad. Listen honey, you're doing Tuesdays wrong. I love the long laundry list of toppings you can choose from here. I can't really think of anyone else who does this. I was really impressed by the size of the tacos. At a lot of places, a Taco Tuesday special is pretty skimpy. Not here. My tacos were loaded. \n\nAnother bonus: THEY HAVE A SALSA BAR!! You know my motto, all places should have a salsa bar. Hell, I would put one in my living room if my roommate would let me. Wonder what she would do if she came home one night to find a salsa bar in place of the coffee table? My tacos came with free chips, so I was super happy to try #allthesauces. \n\nIt was pretty warm in there for lunch, but it was 103 degrees outside. Every place in Charlotte is warm right now in this heatwave. I didn't mind it a bit. I enjoyed eating my lunch alone and watching all the action in the restaurant. All the workers were really nice. There was a pretty steady stream of people coming in and out for lunch. \n\nI don't live near here anymore, but I will definitely be coming back. It's well worth the drive. My only regret is that I never gave this place a chance sooner. However, that may be a good thing or else I would weigh 300 pounds.  Kudos, Burrito Factory. I really dig what you guys are doing here.
