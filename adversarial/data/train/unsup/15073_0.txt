Wow!  This is the true blue truck stop hidden behind Wendy's.  \nYellow and red placard on the wall announce all the specials and another sign lets you know that they have homemade macaroni and potato salad.\nAll the tables and booths were filled with truck drivers.  I imagined Large Marge coming around the corner any second.  They have an array of cheeseburger sizes and the 1\/2 pound we got seemed enormous.  The prices were beyond reasonable. It was a true blue truck stop cheeseburger served up by a sweet little old lady.  The fries were nothing spectacular and the side salad I had was good.  I  will return, if for nothing else to experience a true americana experience.  \nI will be back again for some rib sticking biscuits and gravy and apple pancakes.
