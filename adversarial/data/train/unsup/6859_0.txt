The menu sounded good, but the food didn't deliver. The chicken ramen was flavorless and lacked any seasoning; even adding Sriracha couldn't help this pitiful attempt at ramen. \n\nMy friend got the bahn mi and could only describe it as \"meh\" it was served on a giant loaf of bread and didn't have enough cilantro or veggies. \n\nIf I return, it will be only for drinks- overall I left Ninja City feeling disappointed and unsatisfied.
