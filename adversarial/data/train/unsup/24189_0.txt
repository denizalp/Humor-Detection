2.5\n\nMaybe coming to this Starbucks during March Break was not a good time! \n\nThis is the first Starbucks I been to that were infested with pre-teens. They scattered everywhere, on the sofas, in the doorway and everywhere. I don't really mind sharing spaces with them, but when they are cafferinated and on sugar high (eating those mini butter cupcakes like there's no tomorrow), they tends to get a little hyper jumping all over the place.\n\nEven the usual crowd in this Starbucks are different. Ladies with their tan, in their designer clothes flashing their Gucci\/Louis Vuitton handbags. \n\nDrinking my coffee listening to all the gossips and how to apply make up probably from all these ladies did make my stay at Starbucks a little more entertaining!
