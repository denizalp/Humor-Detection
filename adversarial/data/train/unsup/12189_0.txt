It's a gym. A gym is a gym. It has good amount of equipments, space, clean bathroom, etc.\nIt's equipped with a massage bed and chair & I believe a tanning bed, but have never used any since it's usually packed when I go. Everyone usually minds their own business and \"selfie\" addicts are about 10% so that's a bonus. I mean you don't want to be doing a workout & needing the mirrors to make sure you're doing proper postures & a selfie fanatic is blocking your way, right? Right! \n\nCleanliness: +1 star\nPaper towels & spray bottles located at every trash bins all over the gym floor. Bathrooms are always clean & even the fountains. \n\nEquipments: +1 star\nUnless you're a gym rat that needs this and that, this place has a good amount of what you need. You got your cardio machines that take about 50% of the main floor, weights, 30-minutes workout space, & abs & stretch area. \n\nStaffs: +1 star\nFriendly and don't really bother. They're usually behind the counter on their phones or sometimes walking around cleaning some machines. They don't hover, which is great.\n\nI often wonder tho when I go & always see one employee eating McDonald.....\nWHAT does planet fitness brand really stand for? I wouldn't necessarily mention to acquaintances that I workout regularly at planet fitness. It might come off as a total wanker, but from the outside it'd seem like a \"lazy gym.\" They even offer donuts and pizzas! If it weren't for my brother-in-law & sister asking me to join this gym so my sister had a gym partner, I would've never considered it. Especially seeing planet fitness videos and meme online. I've seen an employee constantly bring in his fast food and eat it in the front seating area. \n\nI tried other gyms before and never have I ever seen anything like this. I've done ymca that lacked equipments & selfie arrogant infested 24 hour fitness, but junk food & \"personal trainers\" that seems to NEED personal trainers gym? Put it this way, it's like owning a Vape shop promoting a healthier option & fighting the bill trying to ban e-cig, but your employees are out front smoking their cigarettes in front of customers. They should really choose their employees wisely. I mean, your staffs ARE the first impression for your company. Just saying. \n\nOverall, it's an okayish gym for in-and-out type of thing. Wonder how this planet fitness location gonna look once EOS opens around the corner.
