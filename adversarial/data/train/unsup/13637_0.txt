Staff is invariably friendly and everything I've tried has been delicious, but hoo-boy are the prices steep. On a recent stop four pieces of toffee came out at almost $9. I justified it by reminding myself that I am happy to pay $2 for a truffle so it's about the same prices for a piece of toffee, but I still had sticker shock. Also, they're a chain with over one hundred stores around the country - if they were a small local business the high prices would seem a bit more justifiable. \n\nYou won't leave disappointed (I mean, have you walked by and smelled the delicious sweetness wafting out the door?!), but you will be quite a bit lighter in the wallet.
