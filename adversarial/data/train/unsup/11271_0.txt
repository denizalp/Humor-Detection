I go to Tea Station sporadically when dining in the same plaza. They have large selection of drinks and snacks which makes for a good hang out spot.\n\nOne major reason that this is not my go-to boba spot is because of their bad service. It's completely lacking here. Non-existent. Zero. Personally, I feel a good service makes the experience better. \n\nMy typical visit here usually starts out with me walking in, getting ignored for 5-10 mins,  then when lucky enough to make eye contact with one of the worker, they come up to me with death glare and ask \"what you want\"\n\nAnother reason why I don't come here too often is because of its inconvenient location and price. This plaza consist of some good eatery meaning it's hard to find a parking space especially at night. It's also close to the strip = lots of tourists + overpriced. Getting some boba drink and light snacks, you are looking at about $20 easily. \n\nOn a brighter note, their drinks are decent in my opinion. I have tried a couple of drinks and my favorites are their rose milk tea (one of the most popular drinks here) and jasmine milk tea. Teas are aromatic and leaves a slight bitterness after each sip which I enjoy. Drinks are on the sweeter side but does get better as ice melts and dilutes the sweetness.\n\nI also like how they are open late. Late night boba craving is real sometimes so I appreciate that they are open past 11pm on week days. Tea Station is not my #1 spot for boba but I will visit once in a while.
