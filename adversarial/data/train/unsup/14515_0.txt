Finally some good BBQ in Henderson. There are not many tables inside since most are the oversize picnic tables so get there early. There are many meats to choose from as well as all the delicious sides a BBQ normally offers. They have sauces on a station near the register so its best to fill up some cups and grab utensils before sitting down.\n- I though the burnt ends were on point as well as the brisket. I would definitely get both of these when I visit again Pulled pork was average so I wouldn't get that again with the other options that I enjoyed plus the ones I have yet to try.\n-The sides. The mac n cheese was top notch. May favorite side at any BBQ place and would recommend it here as well. I was not a fan of the cole slaw or the collard greens. Cole slaw lacked flavor and the collard greens were drowning in the vinegar.
