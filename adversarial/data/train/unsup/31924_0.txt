I very very.. Very rarely leave negative reviews.. I went to this theater to see Logan in the cina1 auditorium.. Super excited, right. Whenever I go to movies I have to have my caption box because I'm hearing impaired. I can hear quite a bit but the caption box helps a ton. Well I put it in the cupholder, where it's supposed to go. And put my drink on it as well . Within two minutes, my drink spilled. I informed the manager, or whoever that person is, in the suit helping people.. And they said it was missing a screw. So they fixed that. The suit guy put it on for me. My boyfriend got me a new drink. I put drink back in it.. Fell again. Tell suit. Suit comes back. Does it for the third time. Boyfriend gets drink. I decide I'm just going to put my drink on the floor, because all the cup holders are taken. Even without the drink The caption box did not want to stay in.. So the entire three hours of the movie, I was holding it, to keep it in. It was so distracting and frustrating. When I took the caption box to the front for return.. I said it was a terrible experience for my first time there. NOT ONE PERSON TRIED TO FIX THIS AND COMPENSATE FOR THE THREE DRINKS MY BOYFRIEND HAD TO BUY, JUST TO TRY TO MAKE US HAPPY. Very frustrating. Definitely disappointed.
