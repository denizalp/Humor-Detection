Wow. WOOOOOOWWWWWW. \n\nI really liked my massage by Justin, I believe that was his name, to be honest, after the massage I was so blissed out, I was a bit dreamy and floated out of there without remembering much in the way of details like names.\n\nI found La Riva via a group deal - or, to be honest, how would I have known about this place hidden in side the Tuscanny Suites? Which, by the way was really a nice little oasis just blocks from the strip, I'm glad they had this deal as I may look into staying here sometime, it was really cute and quiet.\n\nAnyway, I loved that was able to schedule online and I specifically requested Ben as he was called out on previous reviews but to be honest, I was a little bummed no one even mentioned that Justin was taking the appointment instead even though Ben was there.  That's the only reason for a drop in stars, really.  But I wasn't sad at all once Justin got down to the massage.\n\nIt was really fantastic. He was throrough to say the least, and although at first I was a bit thrown by the vigor with which he was rubbing, I soon realized he was just extremely focused on giving me the most massage for my hour's time and boy, did he.\n\nI left feeling fantastic, with only the slightest sweet soreness over the next day, and overall, I was highly pleased with the massage and the experience.
