I recently visited the all women's Sport Chek in Chinook Mall for a specific Adidas running shoe which has been in the market for almost 2 years. The store did not have the size I was looking for (7.5). The girls working there are very young, are not very resourceful or good at problem-solving, and do not seem driven to provide good customer service. One had fake very long nails which gave her trouble navigating the store ipad. This is the second time in a row I have visited this store only to realize that they do not have my size (yet again) and lack the initiative to track down which store does without being prompted. I ended up yet again, ordering online from another athletic shoe store in Chinook Mall- a store who is passionate about their job, their shoes, and going out of their way to help me without prompting by me.
