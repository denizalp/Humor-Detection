Fair price for one of the best burritos Toronto has to offer. The place is tiny and a bit sticky, but you only spend 5-10 minutes in there thinking about your burrito. That perfect burrito with delicious chicken, rice and noodles, guacamole that is excellent, rice, beans, veggies, sour cream, cheese, salsa....get in my belly! By the time you are done day dreaming about your delicious burrito, your name is called!
