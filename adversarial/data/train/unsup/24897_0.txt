I'd like to give more stars to the *harumph* Arena, but I just find it too difficult to do so.  The first reason is the *harumph*; yes, I know that 95% of arenas and stadiums are now named after their sponsors, but please, could you not pick something better than Jobing.com.  To start with, it's not even a word - shouldn't it be jobbing?  And then having a 'placenamehere.COM' as the name of any arena is just weird.  Using such a dumb name forces everyone to keep saying Glendale Arena, just so they don't have to sound stupid.\n\nNext detraction is that it is waaaay out of town - felt as though we had driven for an eternity, and when you do get there, it's in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely nothing to do nearby other than to jump back into the car.\n\nOnce you get in, it is a pretty decent arena - not the greatest that I've been to, but it has a bit of character, the seats are good, nice view from most places in the arena for hockey, and the acoustics were also excellent for the concert we saw the night before.\n\nOK, so I'm feeling bad for knocking a star off purely for the name, but I'm sticking with it, and also boycotting the jobing.com web-site for having such a dumb name too.  Damn, I'm bitter!
