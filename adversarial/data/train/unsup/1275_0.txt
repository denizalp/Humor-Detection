stopped by this place for a quick bite to eat before heading out to XS! We walked in and got seated right away in the \"patio\" LOL which is actually just a space that is right by the casino. We got waters and after checking yelp, we got a free yelp check in of spring rolls!!! ....but they were not spring rolls, they were eggrolls\n\nAnyways, for an establishment that is in Vegas, I did not want to try anything Asian on the menu ... because they would probably butcher it.. I got the breakfast burrito which came with a side of green verde sauce and sour cream. My friends got the wonton noodle soup, Chicken club sandwich, and the chow fun. The breakfast burrito was very hearty and pretty good but i only finished half! My friend said the wonton noodle soup was okay but it looked like it barely gave her any noodles just a lot of soup. The chow fun actually looked pretty good from where i was sitting but my friend said it was just alright and he finished all of it! The chicken club tasted fresh and the fries were crispy.\n\nMost of the stars are for the very friendly staff who tried to accommodate us as much as they could. Our waiter told us that we were welcome back anytime and that they were open 24\/7 and breakfast started at 5:30am.
