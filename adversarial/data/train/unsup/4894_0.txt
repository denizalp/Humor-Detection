Hella long wait time for a to-go order: I was literally waiting 25 minutes. For a walk-up-and-order establishment,this isn't acceptable- either speed up or offer table service.\n\nChicken kabob platter came with two skewers, rice or fries, a side salad, and a side: opted for the dolmas. Everything tasted good, including the new cilantro sauce that I was encouraged to try at the register. Dolmas were served warm, the way I like them. Creamy house dressing on the salad is delish.\n\nSuggestions for management: rice is in a cooker, salads and sides should be assembled and ready to go so that only the chicken needs to be made to order. Even from a raw state, this shouldn't be a 25 minute meal. Especially considering you have two guys in the kitchen.
