Customer service is terrible. We arrived and were briefly welcomed, and then stood at the case for approximately 5 minutes while waiting on the staff and listening to them complain and discuss issues. Very unprofessional!\n\nCupcakes tasted just ok. Placing the 2 cupcakes inside just a brown paper bag having them blend together was disappointing.
