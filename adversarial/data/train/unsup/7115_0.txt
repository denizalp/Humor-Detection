Dec2012 -I  was in the jewelry department just browsing the earrings. And then I heard a security announcement saying security scan in jewelry department. I just got offended and felt uneasy shopping at Walmart since I was doing no wrong. Change your security codes! I didn't feel comfortable at all I should of complain because I was the only one in the jewelry department.\n\nI make more money than all your employees combined. And I don't appreciate it.  So the next time that happens to me when I'm alone in any department and the security code is called I am calling the supervisor as soon as possible because I don't appreciate being considered a shoplifter.
