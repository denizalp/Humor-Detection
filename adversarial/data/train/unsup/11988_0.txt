I have been hearing about this place ( fantastic reviews)  for a few years and finally tried it out. I was in the neighborhood and stopped in for some take out.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit dated, but like I said I was in for some take out. It wasnt overly busy, but I am sure its because it was begore the dinner rush. Ordered some soup, spring rolls, mixed veggies, fried rice, lemon chicken and ginger beef. I thought I would play it safe since it was my first time here.\n\nAverage prices you would find at any Chinese restaurant, so not expensive. My order came in at just under $50.\n\nEverything was ready in less then 20 minutes and I was on my way home to enjoy some Chinese food with my family.\n\nEverything tasted great. Loved the shrimp fried rice and ginger beef the best.\n\nWill try them again and next time will be dine in.
