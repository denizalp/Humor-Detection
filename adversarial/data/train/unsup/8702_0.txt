It can be a hard thing trying to figure what to eat when in down town Las Vegas. This was something that was decided because well the burgers are Flippin good right? Anyways it's a small bar\/restaurant with burgers and chicken sandwiches. Along with that they have shakes and malt type drinks. I was looking to get a malt and decided to try the apple pie cement. The picture looked a lot better than what actually came out because it was in a small sized plastic cup, not a regular sized glass with pretty presentation. But it did taste very good! I had gotten the farm burger which comes with bacon and egg. All sandwiches and burgers come with fries. The burger was good, again the presentation wasn't pretty but it was good. This is a good place to people watch as well because you're in Vegas and you know how people get on the streets.
