We walked into this place because I read all of the raving reviews prior. We were looking for a new queen mattress for our guest bedroom. The second we walked in, there was a line of 5 people at the counter with an employee on the phone. Needless to say he did not say hi and he did not even look up and wave at us. We walked around looking at the mattresses which by the way were all wrapped in plastic and stacked sky high. We couldnt lay on any of the ones we may have been interested in because the stacks of mattresses were all different and since there was only one employee working apparently.... theres no way we were going to be able to inconvenience him to move mattresses around for us. Also, unless you plan on spending at least $1,000 on a mattress, do not go here. There were none under that price.
