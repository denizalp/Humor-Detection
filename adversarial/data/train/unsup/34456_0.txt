Ok, so I did it know what to think coming here for the first time to do an expo. The facility itself is awesome and the kitchen space ample.\n\nThe chef and entire catering and banquet staff were overly helpful in getting me hot water, additional equipment that and directing me in the proper direction to find what I needed. \n\nThe space was much larger than I anticipated and this resort houses a large amount of Banquet and Catering space. My friend Tany I ran into (love this guy) runs the set up aspect of the Banquets Program. My other friend Mike, handles all of the audio visual needs here. I worked with Mike for years and he rocks!\n\nThis place is surrounded with dining and entertainment venues with Westgate at your fingertips and Jobbing and the Cardinals Arenas on the sides. Parking is not an issue and the Tangier Outlet Stores are within walking distance. It is fun way to check out the \"Westside.\" \n\nYou could spend a day here and Cabela's is just a 1\/2 a mile north for the outdoor enthusiast. Come check it out. There is a lot to see.\n\n#Irishcatv2 #Vino2 #Vino2ultimate #Vinosquared #Rebelfoodandwine
