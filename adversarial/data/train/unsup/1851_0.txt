As a regular of L&L BBQ in San Bruno, all I can say is, HOLY SHIT. But in a good way. Maybe it's because it's family owned, or that it was a good batch of chicken, or that I hadn't eaten all day, but that was the best BBQ chicken combo I've had. Ever. \n\nThinking back, it was probably because I was hungry as hell. But 5 stars until I come back and find out otherwise.
