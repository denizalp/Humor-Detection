It seems strange giving a \"topless\" optional pool only three stars, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped.  First off, the only topless people at the pool were dudes.  \n\nMusic was okay, free drink tickets to the ladies was a hit - geez, I got pretty toasted when my wife kept delivering drinks to me poolside.  \n\nMy favorite part of the pool scene was checking out the cocktail waitresses roaming around in their \"ass cheek-baring\" swim attire - WOW!  That scenery was absolutely amazing...some of the most perfect butts I've ever seen - anywhere!  \n\nI guess the most redeeming quality of Bare Pool Lounge was its absence of beached whales found at the Mirage pool - wow, there were tons of very fat people over there!  \n\nOverall, we had fun...3 STARS.
