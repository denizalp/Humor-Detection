This place is great.  Obviously they are missing the ambiance of a fancy salon, but they are also missing the triple digit prices.  My cut was great, it was only $30, and the stylist was efficient.  The juice boxes that they give you are also a cute touch.  Who doesn't feel a bit nostalgic for Five Alive?  \n\nI have only two small complaints.  First, I was concerned that my stylist did not understand what I wanted due to a language barrier, but we made do with lots of pictures.  To this end, you may want to take a picture with you.  Second, I have no idea what kind of shampoo\/conditioner they use, but it smelled really terrible and was bright pink (reminiscent of the soap in a public bathroom soap dispenser).
