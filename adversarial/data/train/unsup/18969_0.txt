#LatePost\n\nLove this place.  Small pool and just one bar in the back but the venue itself, DJs and service all tops.  Like everything in Vegas you get what you pay for and subjected to less than desired service if you don't tip out (or don't have a flappy labia) especially during a holiday weekend.  Give your host a good \"shake.\"\n\nI recommend Cabana #19 for its central location.  Cabanas can accommodate 15 and comes with a safe, tv, volume control for in-house performer, day bed, cooing fan.\n\nCan't wait to go back now that SCOTUS upheld same-sex marriages.  Buddies that are gay or beards in my circle will hopefully provide more opportunities to peer-pressure to return.
