Meh. Coffee was so so and food was food. Not worth a second trip IMO. Had a flat white that was  tad small and not that smooth. Also ate an omelet with fried plantains. Omelet was good, but unless I missed it, the menu said nothing of fried plantains (which I HATE).   Omelet was a tad meager on the portions too.
