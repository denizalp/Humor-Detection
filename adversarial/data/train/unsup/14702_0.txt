So Downtown Summerlin isn't really downtown in the usual sense of the word and really is just a shopping district. \n\nThe good thing about this place is there are a few cool department stores, more dining options in the area, and a new luxury theater. Currently, not every tenant is open and ready, though it's growing every week with openings. \n\nI went prematurely when only Macy's and Dillards were really the only things open, and we just kinda drove around to see what's building. Then I went a week after the \"grand opening\" with a few friends before dinner and we walked around and I got a better feel of the place. One of the things I don't like is the layout in places just is disjointed. \n\nSo on the west end (by Sahara) is this large shopping area with the shops on the perimeter of the square and right in the middle is a parking lot, then you can walk to the other stuff by walking on the side of Dillards to get down to the other shopping streets. If you are driving to a specific thing, I suppose that's fine, if you're walking then maybe plan on having a long walk if you have stuff to see on one end to the other. \n\nOne odd thing was when we went, we were struggling to find a coffee house.We were thinking that it seemed like a natural fit to have a few beverage stops, but none were found or no signs we noticed of any coming soon when we walked the main drag of Dillards and Macys area. \n\nIt has potential for a few things to stop at, but this place is gonna suck like all our outdoor malls come summer as the nice lovely lanes means - no shade. When are we gonna learn to make something desert summer friendly?\n\nEIther way, I'm happy for a Nordstrom Rack and TJ's since we don't have that many in town and Im counting down until Gelato Messina opening.
