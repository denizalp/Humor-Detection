This place used to be the spot for my friends and I to meet up at since we went to different high schools. Now that we're all graduated, we don't come anymore :-(\nI always ordered the Thai tea or the osmanthus oolong teaspresso with boba. The drinks were pretty good and the boba was good too.\nI did try their Hong Kong fried rice, the spam musubi, and the chicken Katsu. I found that they were very generous with the portions. The spam musubi was cooked fresh, and I seriously had to order a few every time I came. \nThe service was always consistent but it was always super busy. It kind of sucked having to stand around for your order and then having to leave elsewhere to enjoy your drink.
