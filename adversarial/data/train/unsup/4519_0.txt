When the U.S. Dollar outweighs the CAD, it means extra shopping and better than average hotels for this American traveler. Hotel Nelligan was a lovely home away from home for three nights while visiting Montreal.\n\nLocation, location, location. Two blocks from the river and a short walk to the Cathedral, plus close to cafes and restaurants. It's ideal for a first time visitor. \n\nJust like everyone else in the city, staff spoke perfect English and even humored my sad attempts to parler Francais. Guests get a free drink at the hotel bar- and though we didn't use our vouchers, it was a nice touch upon check in.\n\nRooms were pretty large and king bed super comfy, which explained why I was able to sleep in until almost 11 am. Rarely happens, even on vacation. Our room had an interior view, which stayed extra dark. Again, perfect conditions for those who want an extra hour or two of snooze time.\n\nKudos to the giant tub in the bathroom, which was put to use on the last evening. \n\nYes, there was TV in the room. Most of the channels were French or sports, but we made do with TLC and French Simpsons. Frankly, it's more fun to watch certain shows in another language. Case and point? Family Feud.\n\nThree nights averaged out to $600, which was pretty reasonable given the proximity to local attractions and level of service. A nice hotel for sure.
