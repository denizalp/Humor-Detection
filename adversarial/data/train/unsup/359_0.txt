I had an appointment for redeeming a groupon. 5 minutes before the scheduled time, i was on the way but stuck in traffic so I called ahead to let them know I would be 10 minutes late. They cancelled my appointment, despite the fact that I was already halfway there, and was not even THAT late. Very unhappy with customer service. I will be forced to use my groupon there but will not be coming back.
