Great customers service from the guy at the counter (1st star) plenty of parking and clean enviorment. (2nd star) Green & Red Chili was good (3rd star) price and wait time for the food (-1 star) Variety of meat to choose from (-1 star)  I'm not in to Angus beef, if they would only offer Carne Asada or Chicken, then I would be one happy hombre!
