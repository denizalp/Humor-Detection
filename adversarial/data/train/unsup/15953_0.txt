Best steak burrito and steak fries. Very fresh and and doesn't leave you feeling greasy and gross afterwards (like Roberto's). It may be a little bit more than your average taco shop but the quality of ingredients is so very apparent! Comparable to Baja Fresh in quality but better and not as expensive. The owner is very sweet and friendly. I love this and am happy that the little BBQ place is gone to be replaced but something so much better.
