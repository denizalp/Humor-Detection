How do you rectify a situation that's obviously a mistake? I'm hoping my fellow Americans can find the answer to that on November 8.\n\nI should have read up on it, but didn't. Comfortable with my knowledge of Middle Eastern cuisines and having faith in Montreal's amazing history of multiculturalism, I didn't sweat the details. I only looked briefly in the direction of the orange colored dish with Shish Taouk written as the descriptor. Had I paid enough attention, I would have realized that it's Chicken Shawarma, not Shish Taouk. I have no idea why Montrealers have allowed this error to persist: Chicken Shawarma is definitely not the same as Shish Taouk. Why do people confuse the two candidates for selection as the same? Facts matter ;)\n\nIn this case, thankfully, the stakes weren't high. The trio set me back by a mere 8CAD. And, while I didn't think much of the chicken pita, the garlic potatoes were outstanding. Highly recommended. Also, I thought the Baklava had great texture, even if it tasted average.\n\nBoustan is smack dab in the middle of tourist central, the prices are fantastic for the location, and it's a great value if you're in the area. But, it's just not destination dining. It's disappointing to see this as the first name come up in a search for Shish Taouk in Montreal. I realize now that \"they\" meant Shawarma, but just didn't know any better...
