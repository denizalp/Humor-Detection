Super hard to get in. Very small school. Not accredited, no financial aid. 19 students total Royal one of the instructors who answered the phone.  I felt kinda bad for him, he's the only staff there. He was busy, he had no time for me.  Answering phones, a class to teach, then cleaning the bathrooms...lol
