I used to go to the high school near this Chachi's, and I would often choose to get my lunch from here. The prices are a bit high, but I think you get what you pay for- the sandwiches and components are always fresh and tasty. I like the deli atmosphere, and this particular location is surprisingly not too busy around lunchtime. The staff are very efficient and nice. There's one guy who works behind the till who'll flip your change over his shoulder into his other hand before he gives it to you, I find it entertaining haha.\n\nAlthough, Chachi's advertises \"to die for\" macaroni and cheese, and too be honest it wasn't that special. Just macaroni and cheese with pepper, was what I got at least.
