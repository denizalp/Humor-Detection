Checked this place out with my grandma today because of all the good reviews I saw here on Yelp. The good thing I will say is that they give FAB massages with their pedicures! I think that's their main selling point is the 15min massage with your pedi for $25. On the down side, everything is priced as an add-on basis. So if you want a suger scrub or callous remover, it can get pricey! My nail tech was nice, but the woman who serviced my grandma was a little annoyed by her needs... a pillow for her back, picking the right color, she even rolled her eyes when she had to go to the bathroom. I rated a 3 because the massage was just that good, but I've experienced better\/friendlier service before.
