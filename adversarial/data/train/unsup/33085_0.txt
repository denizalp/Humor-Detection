The atmosphere is great - love the bubbling water light wall behind the register, the fun golden luck toad, the fake star panel in the ceiling, the glass bamboo panels, the koi tank. \n\nWe ordered:\n\n-the spider roll - it was filled with crispy fresh crab and was tightly rolled and not overly sauced. Really nice.\n\n- the panda roll - loved the variety of fish and the spicy sauces, though the amount of sauce was a bit excessive. Great flavor and would get again\n\n- the chicken & rice soup - same broth base as wonton soup, but with rice and lots of tender chicken. \n\n-wonton soup - good flavor \n\n- Pork Lo Mein - ok, nothing that stands out from others. Pork was thankfully not overly chewy.\n\nAll-in-all very solid Chinese food but a little pricier than competition in the area. Look forward to trying a few more rolls, but it's not knocking my regular place off its championship stool.
