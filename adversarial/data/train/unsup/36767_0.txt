Great place.  They have a big menu and give big portions.  More importantly, the food is good!  I actually share a meal with my husband when I go here instead of getting one thing for just myself.  Their margaritas are very good and I find myself craving them during the hot days--a great place to go when you don't feel like cooking dinner.
