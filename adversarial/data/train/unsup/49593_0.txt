As most everyone has mentioned, me and my family came here because of the \"Top Chef Masters\" influence.  We came in and were immediately seated and treated to delicious chips and salsa.  Did I mention that all of the three salsa's had a smokey flavor to them? YUM!  \n\nThe waiter we had was a bit arrogant or was trying to pull off the \"we're a high class restaurant\" vibe.  Oh well, he turned out to be a great asset and offered many suggestions.  I always appreciate when someone tells me what I should or should not order. \n\nWe also ordered the guacamole which was so good.  It came with a little salad with some sort of juice (lime). I appreciate when restaurants offer their own spin on a classic dish.  In regards to dinner, I ordered the chicken poblano enchiladas. They were amazing.  The tortillas were wrapped around the meat so tight which is cool. (I can never get my tortillas to do that at home -- amateur chef that I am).  The green sauce was great and was almost sweet but in a good way.  My one complaint is that there was so much sauce that I couldn't enjoy it without some chips.  No one had refilled our chips and looking back I should have asked for more. \n\nAll around, a great experience and a place I would come back too when I am in Vegas next.
