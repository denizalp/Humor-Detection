It's a Club! It's a Restaurant! It's a Club-aurant! I don't think I like that concept yet. When you go to a steakhouse, you are really there for the steak right? But with the lights flashing, the music bumpin', and the crowd jumpin',  I felt like getting my groove on instead of stuffing my face with red meat. I guess I'm a one-dimensional diner. I like chewing my food to the sound of Sinatra as appose to 50 Cent. \n\nAs for the steak, the Rib-eye for two feeds more like 4 people. I wish the steak came out more sizzlin'  like the beats but sadly it was cold.\n\n3 stars for steak but 4-5 stars for the bread basket. I would've enjoyed this place more if I ate the free corn bread with a Martini.
