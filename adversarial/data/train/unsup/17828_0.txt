Why is it that every coffee shop I've visited lately feels like it's attached to a prison? Seriously.\n\nI have heard LOTS about the Roasterie, so I headed over yesterday. \n\nOne word: Yikes.\n\nLindsay K. isn't kidding when she says that the place attracts an extremely alternative crowd. She's right - everyone who's there is a regular, and in my mind, I just can't figure out why.\n\nSure, the location is perfect. Right in the heart of Kensington. But the buck stops there. Inside, it's nothing to write home about. It's small, it's stuffy, it's unclean, it's old looking and it doesn't seem like it's well maintained. People are sitting, laying and resting all over the coffee shop and it's just not the kind of place that I would go to either meet up with people, or to enjoy a few solo hours to myself.\n\nI can see me spending some time there if I was being punished or if someone dared me to do it, but in a happy, pleasant world, I would just walk on by like I always have.\n\nThe atmosphere, the inside and the crowd just aren't my cup of tea. Ironic, isn't it?
