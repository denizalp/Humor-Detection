Welcome to Wendy's, or rather, no welcome at all. \n\nI had placed my order at the drive thru, and like most experienced consumers, I was sure to be as specific as possible to assure minimal confusion. She asked, I answered, nothing out of the ordinary. I paid for my food, and while doing a brief glance, there was the awkward waiting period before I left. Assured I had everything, I left without a thought in my head. \nAbout ten minutes into my drive heading home I had a feeling, and I checked the bad once more. There was no sauce, which we were both specific about when I had ordered, as well as my two cookies. This is just one of many different scenarios that I have encountered here at this Wendy's location.\nUpon my second arrival, I made my complaint at the drive thru, where I was acknowledged and told to drive to the window. When I pulled up to the window, I was asked again what my complaint was, even though I had just explained and was made to feel like I was acknowledged.\nI was only granted my sauce and my two missing cookies, yet nothing else to compensate for the inconvenience.\nThis location lacks service, awareness and consideration.\nYet the worst part about this Wendy's location, is not the expected incompetence, but the simple theme of not caring. They just do not care. We are but one customer out of a cycle of a hundred they see in a single work period. I enjoy Wendy's, but I do not enjoy their employee's disregard for others.
