I'm not sure why this place is not rated much higher because the food is top notch. You will not be disappointed with any of the burgers.  They are generous with the toppings on the burgers and fries (ask for ranch dressing for dipping- so good!) and everything was fresh and colorful.\n\nAlso they have a dog friendly patio!
