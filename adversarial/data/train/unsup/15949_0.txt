The history, the people, the license plates...\n\nI first experienced NuTowne from 1989-1991.  Imagine my surprise on returning to Phoenix in 2011 and finding NuTowne (after a drastic renovation due to a fire) remains!\n\nDaddy Ron is still here...and the rest of the staff make sure everyone feels welcome.  Sunday and the beer bust are a legend that continues and I have taken my turn as the Burger Beyotch on several occasions.  It is my chance to take part in a continuing history of the oldest gay bar in Phoenix.\n\nIf you desire a great Sunday afternoon with a beer and a burger, chicken breast or a hot dog from the grill, NuTowne is the place to go.  No one cares if you are gay or not...just be prepared for someone to grab your a$$ if it is cute.
