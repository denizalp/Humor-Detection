It is true they do their own thing with your hair. The owner is really rude someone crossed my name off the list and she accused me of just leaving but it was a matter of her being unorganized. Everyone else is great just dont deal with the owner if you dont want to deal with her rudeness. They have a woman named mary now that does eyebrows and i MUST tell you she is the best i hope she gets  her own location soon, she does such a great job and she does them great. Only reason im giving a 4 is because Mary deserves a 5
