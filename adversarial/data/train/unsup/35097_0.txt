Oh boy!  I was a little nervous to go here for the first time because I saw the reviews were a bit \"iffy\", but the restaurant is practically brand new and everyone has growing pains and adjustments to make in the few months of opening... but, with that being said....\n\nI loved this place and cannot wait to go back!!\n\nDinner for 4 on a Monday night... the parking was empty, but I valet'ed anyway...  I always wear an imaginary tiara!  \n\nThe decor was charming, glittery, and fabulous!  So much fun!   The service was so friendly! \n\n Our table ordered the hummus plate - fantastic.\n\nI had the short rib ravioli and it was delicious!!  My friends had the scallops, the melon\/feta salad with steak, and the chicken... and everyone was extremely pleased!  \n\nLike I said, I cannot wait to go back!!!
