Well friends, i'm happy to report that Tacos Sahuaro lived up to their hype! \n\nAfter reading so much about it lately, I told my husband that we HAD to go for dinner last night. And also because this hot (temperature), pregnant momma didn't want to cook. \n\nAfter you order and sit at a table, they bring you a bowl of cucumbers and limes, spicy carrots\/onions\/jalape√±os, and hot sauces. Yes, please! Cucumbers and hot sauce are now a favorite snack of mine. \n\nWe ordered tacos (of course) and I chose: pollo, carne asada, and al pastor. OH MY GOODNESS, the al pastor was my favorite. It was seasoned so well. But what I loved about their tacos is that they're so simple - tasty tortillas (i'm guessing homemade), meat, onions, and cilantro. Then, you can add hot sauce and other goodies to them if you'd  like. The flavors are so well balanced that you don't even need all the toppings (and this is coming from a sauce freak). We also ordered a side of rice and beans and their beans were amazing as well. \n\nWe will absolutely be back to this hidden gem! It is so clean and the service is friendly. If you love authentic tacos, you'll love Tacos Sahuaro.
