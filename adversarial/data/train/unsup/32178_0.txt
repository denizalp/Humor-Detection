Joe with efficient Home Pros came out to my house to give me an estimate on a new door for my patio. My wife and I weren't sure what we wanted whether we wanted to stay with the slider setup or go to a French door??? Joe was very helpful and letting us know the pros and cons of Energy Efficiency with each door. In the end we decided to go with a French door cuz we like the way it sets off our kitchen cabinets and the view of the backyard period and the ability to open both doors when the weather is nice! Joe and his staff a very polite and helped us get everything we needed we're very happy with her brand new French foor!! \n\n thank you guys very much!
