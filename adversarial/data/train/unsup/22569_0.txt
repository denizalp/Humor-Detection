This place was awesome. Went there last night with some friends and apart from a disappointing margarita, everything else was amazing. \n\nFor an appetizer we shared the grilled mushroom bruscetta. It came topped with a generous portion of freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. So good!  \n\nFor a main course I had the panko-covered shrimp and scallops. They were lightly coated in panko and grilled. Spiced perfectly and not overcooked. Served on grilled veggies. The shrimp and scallops were huge and meaty. 5 pieces were the perfect portion and very filling. My friends ordered the veal Parmesan, the steak, the chicken salad and the gnocchi.  No one had any complaints. \n\nThe service was friendly and fast and the view of the City was beautiful from our table. \n\nThe lemon cake was good but the carrot cake was better. I regret not getting the gelato instead. \n\nI have been to both locations and I prefer this one over St. Clair.  A must try!  I will definately be coming back.
