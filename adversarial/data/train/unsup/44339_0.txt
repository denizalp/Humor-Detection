With the burgeoning of burger joints around Toronto, I was excited to go here.  It has all sorts of good word of mouth...but I was disapointed and probably wouldnt go again.  \n\nOrdered a lamb burger that was pretty flavorless.  The fries were limp and pretty flavorless as well.  I don't think it was worth the ten bucks when places like Craft Burger are around.\n\nOverall, its ok if you're gonna grab a quick bite, but I wouldn't go out of the way to go there.
