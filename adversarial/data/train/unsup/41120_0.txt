What a unique cart return escalator !! This Target location in East Liberty is off the beaten path for me, but when I get a chance to shop here I take it !! \n\nThis location has always been a clean, efficient and well organized store. \n\nThe staff as always been friendly and helpful. \n\nParking has never been a problem and it's great for a rainy day, garage parking keeps everyone and everything dry. More stand alone stores should use this model. \n\nI am not a huge Starbucks fan, but I do like the ice tea. The lemonade smoothies at the stand next to Starbucks is very good, try the strawberry lemonade smoothie, very good !!!
