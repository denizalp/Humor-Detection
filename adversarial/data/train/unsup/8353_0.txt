Commissioned by BP America, it originally sat on Public Square. But the hue and cry was so loud (in case you don't get that, BP was and is a bastion of corporate greed) they donated it to the city and relocated it to 9th street. And there it sits to this day. An iconic abandonment of pretense.\n\nEnjoy.
