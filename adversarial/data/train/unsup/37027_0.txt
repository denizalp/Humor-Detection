Typical bowling alley. Not bad for the price and coupons they supply for staying at the hotel. The only issue would be with their staff. They seem uninterested and don't seem to want to be there. A smile or two would go a long way for their customers. Also lighter balls for kids would help. Our son struggled to play and eventually was exhausted halfway thru the game.
