A+ for a good place like the Village being in an Airport!\n\nI was surprised at how good the food is! I was leaving to head back to SF and decided to eat before I got on the airplane.\n\nI sat down outside as the Village has inside seats and outside tables and chairs for people who still want to play the slot machines.\n\nAs soon as I sat down my server came and passed me a menu. She asked me if I wanted something to drink and I stuck with my normal water especially after partying in Vegas!  Wooo I needed water! :) \n\nI ordered and 15 minutes later my meal was coming out. For 2 people the bill turned out to be less then $30 not bad for Vegas! Everything was SO GOOD!\n\nI would recommend coming here as it's reasonable and food is delicious!
