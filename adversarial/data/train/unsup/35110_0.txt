There was a groupon for this place, $15 for $30 worth of food.  We enjoyed the food here.  I had the Tre Funghi, which is a homemade pasta with 3 different kinds of mushroom, and my husband had the chicken and shrimp pesto.  Both were good, but if we did not have the groupon, I am not sure if the food would have warranted the price.  Most entrees are at least $15.
