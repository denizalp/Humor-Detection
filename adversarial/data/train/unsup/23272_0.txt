Excellent service & food. Expected the portions to be smaller because I used a Groupon, but they honored the voucher exactly. It did get very messy, and there was a lot of garbage in the end - but we knew what we signed up for. Only annoyance was the display of beers by the bar that we figured they had available for sale, only to find out it was simply for \"decoration.\" \n\nWould definitely return.
