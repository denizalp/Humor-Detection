I was excited to check this place out after seeing an ad in the New Times.  We went there and asked for a lemon drop.  The bartender told us \"no\" 2 times! (Yes we asked again, because we were in disbelief) When we asked her why, she sighed,  said \"fine\" as she rolled her eyes and walked away. Shocked, we turned around and walked out. VERY RUDE LADY!
