Ghostbar is one of the two clubs at The Palms. I came on a Friday night and it was practically dead which was very disappointing. Most of the people that were there were just hanging outside or at the bar, hardly anyone was dancing.\n\nThe design was okay, a long and small dance floor isn't ideal. The design of the place was tasteful but the use of space was odd. \n\nThe bathrooms were very nice and had great lighting, just like the club itself, neither space was too dark like most clubs. You can actually see people and tell if someone is attractive or not. Don't laugh. You know that's important. ;)\n\nThere is free seating outside and there is a plexy glass tile which you can stand on and see right down to the bottom of who knows how many stories. Of course I stood on it and started jumping on it which caused people to worry about my physically well being as well as my mental. It's just neat, you have to check it out if you go there. And then jump on it and watch everyone fear for your life. :)\n\nOh and they mainly played hip hop here, thought that would be helpful for the electronic fans out there. If you like electronic music head to Hakkasan. TiÃ«sto will be playing there until November 2014.
