I went for happy hour and we had dinner at the bar. I had ravioli and a house salad which was fabulous. My friend had some sort of pasta with white sauce and shrimp tempura of which she said was really good. Had some great wine at happy hour prices and it was all fantastic. We also had great service on a Tuesday eve. Can't remember her name but she was great. Will be back very soon. Looking forward to a sit down dinner which was decorated so nicely in that area. If not dinner their wkd breakfast\/brunch looked really good too. Nice to eat at a non gaming establishment.
