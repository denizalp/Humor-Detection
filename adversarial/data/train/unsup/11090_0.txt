I hired Bob and his team to install an aerial rig point in my house. I am an aerialist, and I wanted to be able to practice my art at home. When I first started looking around for a contractor to do the job, I quickly realized that most contractors would raise an eyebrow and tell me they didn't even know what I was talking about, let alone how to get it done. Bob was not like the others! Rather than shying away from the challenge of the unfamiliar, he met with me in person and we thoroughly went over my needs. He asked the hard questions, and made it clear that his upmost concern was my safety. He put a lot of thought into the mechanics of my rig point (which for safety needs to be able to support 2,500 lbs dead weight!), and devised a very safe and sturdy apparatus. I am very happy with Bob's work and with my new rig point! Also, bob and his team were incredibly nice, friendly, and clean. They swept up after themselves before they left, and bob checked in with me the next day to make sure my apparatus was working well. With Bob's permission, I am definitely going to refer my aerialist friends to him! He understands the safety needs of an aerialist, and does a fantastic job. I am so grateful to have found a contractor who not only wasn't afraid of a \"different\" type of project, but who dove in and completed the project to the highest of standards. I highly recommend using Bob for any of your contracting needs!!
