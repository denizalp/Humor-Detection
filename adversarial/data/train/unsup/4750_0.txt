I want to kidnap the chef and keep him all to myself! Being 1\/2 Armenian on my Father's side, I know Mediterranean food. I have been cooking it myself ever since my Grandma from Armenia taught me as a child. Well the afternoon we ate here the food was fantabulous! I had the lamb kabobs and my husband had the pork kabobs. Both were served on a bed of \"real\" pilaf that was so good I could have licked the plate! There was also a salad on the plate with a slight lemon dressing. It was wonderful! A pita bread finished out the plate, and for the price it couldn't be beat! Truthfully, I have never had food this good except when Grandma made it!  P.S.  Keep your hands off the chef, he's mine! :)
