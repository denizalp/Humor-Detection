It was my first time dined in at Roy's.  I was recommended by a friend long time ago and finally decided to give it a try. We got there late (20 mins later than our reservation), but it was Tuesday so we didn't have any issue.  We got seated at the Bar area, underneath a flat screen TV.  Got to be honest, We were a bit dissapointed at first but after the Olimpics on, it actually helped us to get through the night.  The bartender was our server. So, besides making drinks for the restaurant, he had to wait on us.  He explained what was good to order.  I ended up ordering the Grand prix 3 course meal and my husband order something a la carte.... :) The flow was a bit slow.  We had to wait for the appetizers (Ahi tuna poke) for about 20-25 mins, but it was ok since we had TV to watch so basically we were watching TV while waiting for our food. \nAfter the tuna poke, the salad was next (couldn't remember the name... it was something with pear on it). It was good but too much cheese. The dressing was good though.  Then, we waited for another 15 mins after we finished the salad for our entrees.  By the time, the entrees r served, I was full and needed space for the chocolate soufle. It was the highlight of this visit.  Although we had better soufle at the Morton steakhouse. After enjoying everything, we ran back to our hotel and \"deposit\" our money to the casino. It was a good experience, sufficient service, good food (not great), good ambiance, but that's just not enough to make us go there again.  Thanks for the experience Roy's.
