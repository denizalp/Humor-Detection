I got really squicked out from this place because the person who was doing my massage scraped my feet with his fingernails!!! EW!!!!!! Isn't that how bacteria gets spread? He was using his bare hands!!! What if he picked his nose before? What kind of gunk did he have under his nails? What if he broke skin?! \n\nJust thinking about it makes my hair stand up. Also, it's my opinion that anyone doing any kind of massage therapy has no business keeping long nails.\n\nThe place was kind of run down, didn't look very clean, and the massage therapists were WAY too chatty. The massage itself was okay. Plus at the end, when I gave $40 ($30 for the massage, I intended to give $5 for a tip because I know they rely on tips, even though the service really wasn't so great), they basically refused to give me any change and told me that I am obligated to provide a tip. I was going to, but not $10!\n\nNot coming back.
