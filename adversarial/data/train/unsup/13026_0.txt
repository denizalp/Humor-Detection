Subway calls their line folks \"sandwich artists.\"  If those people are considered artists, then the cooks at Primanti Bros are friggin' Picasso.  \nIf you've never sat by the grill, you should, just to see them in action.  On a busy lunch day, it's not uncommon for them to have 15 things going at once, and they keep track of what's what via...broken french fries.  I've never seen or heard them get anything wrong, either!  While I wouldn't call them chefs, as the menu at the end of the day is simple, they definitely have a solid skill set at the griddle.\n\nIf you've never been to Primaniti's, here are a few tips from a seasoned veteran.  \nTip 1:  Always get fried egg.  Always.  On everything.  \nTip 2:  Pick up a bottle of hot sauce and sploosh it on the fries...those of you complaining about bland fries definitely need to try the hot sauce technique, as it makes a definite difference.  \nTip 3: The \"cheesesteak\" sucks and is a travesty that people are encouraged to order this abomination, as compared to many other items of deliciousness on the menu. \nTip 4: I'm a  big fan of capicola (with egg) and the colossal fish.  The fish is huge, and you will feel like a fat kid if you finish it.  \nTip 5: A 23oz  \"Iron\" is only like $4.  Get one and talk like a Yinzer for a complete experience.\n\nThe Market Square location is just as good as the original in the Strip.  Oakland is meh, Southside comes up third in my book.  I haven't been to others.  If you're coming in from out of town though, any of them will fit the ill.
