Just take a look at the servers wearing the \"Got Sushi\" shirts (think \"Got Milk\") and you know that Ru San's is in the mix.  With a 6-page sushi menu and reguarly-changing specials, ordering sushi can be a nightmare for the indecisive orderer, but it's all good here.  I think there is better-quality fish in Charlotte, but the rolls here are fun and different....  Though the really tasty ones (Flying Kamikaze and Rising Sun) tend to be fried and saucy, there are a bunch of healthier rolls like the terriyaki eggplant, ceviche shrimp, and ginger-simmered tuna.  The yakitori is good, too.
