Disappointing. Mediocre food quality at best... waaaaaayyyyy under-portioned. Spent over $30 to feed a family of 5, pretty good deal right? No. Their \"kid's meals\" are like Toddler Meals. Their beans are watered down. We have been coming here every now and then for the past 3 years (it's next to Sam's Club) and I can honestly say, that this last visit will be our last. Their portions seem to be getting smaller and smaller.
