I am not very picky about most of my food. The exception to that rule is burgers.  I am picky and a bit of a snob about my burgers.  I have seen Smashburger around town for a while and I talked about trying it out, but never got around to it.  I wish i made the time sooner, i missed out by not eating here sooner.  I took my burger wingman (my son) out to lunch one day, and decided to give it a try. \n\nThe burgers were awesome, and was secretly happy when my son did not enjoy the Smash Fries because it left more for me. As i am a good father, I purchase him an order of regular fries and he very much enjoyed them.  As I am better than a 'good' father I also let him get a shake and he enjoyed that as well.  \n\nThe food was so good, that at a later date when my wife and I were in Flagstaff, AZ I took her to a Smashburger and she enjoyed the burger but unfortunately also enjoyed the Smash Fried and ate half my order.  I will get two next time.
