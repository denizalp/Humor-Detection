I first tried Gen in California and I liked it. You get a nice variety of meats at a very reasonable price. There are some appetizers that are part of the AYCE menu. Price per person depends on when you go: weekday vs weekend, lunch vs dinner. We've been here for lung during the week which is probably the best time to go because you avoid the ridiculous wait during the weekend AND it's only $15 per person.\n\nThe banchan was good. From the AYCE menu, we tried: brisket, bulgogi, garlic pork belly, signature steak, KFC, and jap chae. I liked everything especially the garlic pork belly. Yuuuum!!!\n\nThe thing I like the most about Gen is that each grill has its own vent. The smoke doesn't even get a chance to go up more than 2 inches - it gets sucked in right away so, you don't end up smelling like grilled meat!\n\nMacaron Ice Cream Sandwich - it's not part of their AYCE menu but it is available. The flavors they have include coffee, vanilla, mango, green tea, etc. They're ok. The macaron shells are very dry and hard. The ice cream in the middle is icy. Skip this and just eat all the meat!
