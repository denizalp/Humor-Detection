Went here for the All-You-Can-Eat sushi and it's generally not a bad AYCE sushi, but there are better options in Las Vegas.\n\nI walked in on a Wednesday night and was surprised that it was crowded.  Sat at the bar and it really took forever to get an order in with the chef.  You can't ask the chef to make you things either because there are 4 other customers waiting for the same.  Since it took forever for orders to be taken, my stomach had more than enough time to settle in from the first handroll and I couldn't eat much.\n\nAlso a small gripe that the chef's ?friends? came in later and he made rolls for them first.  \"hola chicas\"\n\nThe handrolls were disappointing.  Compressed rice (or hard rice?) with a sliver of yellowtail.  Probably the worst I've seen in Nevada sushi places.  The other rolls have too much sauce on them.\n\nIf I have to recommend, get the \"Seafood Salad\" and I liked \"Happy Ending\"\n\nTea cups went empty.  Went to a CVS store next door to buy water after the meal.\n\nLike I said, it's not a bad place.  Just after going to Goyemon, Jjanga, Sushi Pier... I don't see a reason to come here.
