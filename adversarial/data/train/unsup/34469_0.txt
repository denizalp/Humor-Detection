I chatted with someone on Tuesday morning, 9:30 am, and was assured that someone would call me back.  In fact this person even gave me a ticket # and an e-mail.  In the  e-mail there was was this: \"I write to you this email confirmation in order to give you the Ticket # 66xxxx and to remind you that you will be contacted on the next 24 to 48 hours.\"\nWell it is now Friday and I have not heard back.\nI contacted Lorex again today and they saw the ticket and told me that they will send the ticket to tech support.\nThey kept explaining the dynamic on purchasing the deals.\nMy issue is customer service and how I am being treated and they state they only have a few units. \nNo one seems to understand and can place the order.  All they do is argue with me and tell me how the black Friday deals work.
