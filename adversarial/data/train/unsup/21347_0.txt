I try over and over to like Kmart, but it's just not there :(\n\nI do like the sales and the merchandise that is headed out and reduced a lot! When I do go to Kmart I always walk out with something, but I don't go there for the purpose of buying anything.\n\nToday we went looking at Back Packs, found one and waited 15 minutes in line to check out. I stood there thinking is this really worth me saving $6.00? Since my daughter loved the back pack we stayed in line, but really? They had 2 registers open, the one I wasn't in had an individual on a shopping spree, so that lane was definitely out! My lane was just dog slow! I was the 3rd person in line, but each item seemed to take forever to go through. I stood there staring at the customer service area where a cashier stood just looking around bored to death!\n\nI don't think they do a good job of customer service and getting you in and out effectively. \n\nThe store needs a complete over haul and clean up. The parking lot is easy to get in and out of though.
