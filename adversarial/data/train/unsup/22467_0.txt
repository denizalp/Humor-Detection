We have been eating tacos at Sinaloas for a while and then we lost them for a bit as they moved locations which was a great move but they had me scared for a while. \n\nI'm pretty sure all they serve here is great but I personally come here for the tacos de cabeza! Yes sir\/mam and don't knock it till you've tried it!  I'm sure you can get cabeza in a burrito or quesadilla but I go for the tacos since the handmade tortillas you see being pressed out make it that much better. One thing i would recommend is to get them to go as they pack it up nicely which keeps them warm until you eat them and they include a red and green salsa.  \n\nNow don't expect tables and chairs to get comfy in while you eat but do expect to keep wanting to come back for more tacos deliciosos!
