Worse customer service ever. I get that they're busy, but for a waiter to cater another table every 5 minutes and our table every 20 mins is just complete bs. It had to tale someone to complain to get attention. \n\nWe ended up super upset after being so patient with the service. Manager helped us a good 20mins later after we asked to speak to him. He gave us 25% off and went about his day. I work in the industry too, but there was no sympathy with the manager. We were there for 2 hrs, just waiting for some service. Which, btw, we ordered the all you can eat crab. Within the 2hrs, we barely got much to order. Crabs were small, but not bad. You literally would have to order 3-4 plates to get full. So, imagine being there for the length of time we were there and had no service just waiting.
