Do you like sliders?\nYup, I do too! I admit it, as much as l enjoy fine dining, I really do have pedestrian tastes.\nYou can only eat eat so much pate and stuffed breast of duck before you need something real.\nI know sliders are everywhere these days. I live near Stax and I like it fine. \nI see sliders on the menu so many of the other places I go, but these...these are really sliders and they are really great and really just what god and nature intended when ground beef was created! \nSmall, delightful chunks of bovine goodness!\nPlus, Chicago Hamburger has some of the best chili fries around to go with the sliders, and that really makes the drive, and the poor parking at lunch and the difficulty finding a place to sit at lunch and all the rest (I actually feel like I'm in Chicago) worth the effort!\nThe regular burgers and the hot dogs are pretty good , too (bright green relish and celery salt for the dogs, so good for them), but really...sliders are the reason to go to Chicago Hamburger.
