I normally prefer chinese hot pot over japanese shabu shabu, but this place is unique.  I would say this place is hipster\/ trendy, clean, pristine, and they have anime playing on TV (Samurai Shampoo to be exact).  \n\nBroths: I got the tonkatsu broth, which includes two sauces - Goma and Ponzu.  The server added a few extra seasonings to my sauces (I can't remember everything he put in there, but I do remember chilli oil and sesame seeds).  My brother got the spicy miso broth and that was full of flavor.  I've been to other shabu shabu places, and I've never had broth like this.\n\nI ordered the Yojie's Cut dinner Sumo size (10oz of beef).  This comes with rice, veggies, and noodles.  The 10oz was super filling, but it was so good that I wanted more!  I like the presentation of the beef and veggies.  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the strawberry and bananas fondue with green tea white chocolate.  I'm not typically a fan of green tea chocolate, but I was mind blown with the flavor.  It was shared with 6 people, so it didn't go to waste.  Typically, this dessert can be shared with 2-3 people.  \n\nAlso, I had the cherry blossom hot tea.  It was interesting to see it served in a tea infuser.\n\nOverall I had a really good experience (and more so hooked) to this place.
