I found Kristin through groupon. Talk about an exceptional experience. Kristen has such an amazing talent to give you the look that is the best for your face and skin tone. I had the feather eyebrow permanent makeup procedure done. I was very comfortable during the procedure. At most it felt like she was tweezing my eyebrows. It took about an hour or so but she definitely is a perfectionist and you won't be done until she's happy with the results which is awesome! If your looking for a permanent makeup artist that you can trust then look no further ; Kristin's your girl. :)
