This Goodwill is a normal-sized Goodwill, mostly containing clothes, which my friend wanted to browse. I browsed the media section, of course.\n\nSome DVD cases were empty so I lost interest, which seems to be a recurring issue every time I go to a Goodwill. We didn't feel like buying anything else either.
