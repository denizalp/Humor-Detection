Burt say's   \"Yelp failed me on this one!\"   The reviews are good, the restaurant  is NOT.  \n\nFirst off this place is in an industrial complex.  You walk in and the furniture is outdoor lawn furniture.  The space is horrible.  It seems like they should be making nuts and bolts in this place,  not food.  Hey if you your gonna do a low rent cheapie food spot that's cool,  but the bill should reflect the savings, not the furniture.  \n\nExcellent warm greeting at the door.  Burt is hopeful at this point.  So Burt sits down, no butter.  They have \"vegetable oil whipped spread\", and when you open it looks more disgusting than it sounds.  Some yellow colored, coagulated mush that has decomposed and separated in a little puddle of water.\n\nRED FLAG - No Splenda offered.  To Burt this means they are cheap and wont carry the more costly Splenda.  Which in turn means they are also using whatever ingredients are the cheapest, not which taste the best.  \n\nThe chicken fried steak was highly recommended on Yelp.  It literally made Burt gag.  Beside being cooked in some nasty flavored oil, it was smothered in chipped beef gravy.  Burt almost spit it out.  LITERALLY   \n\nThe cinnamon french toast was also recommended.  That was good.  \n\nThe staff was super friendly and extra nice.  Burt hates to slam a place on just one visit.  But some spots are just so bad you can never go back.  Maybe everything else is wonderful.  It's hard to believe all those great reviews can be wrong. Maybe Burt just caught them at a bad moment?  I hope so.  Take this review with a grain of salt and maybe try it for yourself?
