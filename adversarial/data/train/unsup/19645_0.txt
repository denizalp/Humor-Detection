It's been awhile since I've been to Red Lobster and I'm sad to report that it is still sub par and to be skipped. Of ALL the hundreds of restaurants in Charlotte, a friend chose Red Lobster for her birthday dinner. So there I was at RL. I ordered the lobster tacos with sweet potatoes and a Caesar salad for my side. The Caesar salad was basic. Given that this is a seafood restaurant, where are the anchovies. Some cracked pepper would've helped. That being said, it was an average appetizer caesar. \n\nThe real disappointment came in the entree. My lobster tacos were TERRIBLE. I thought that the order wasn't ours because the lobster looked like a few pieces of fried shrimp. Then to bit in and not taste lobster, just overwhelming salty sauce was such a let down. The sauce overpowered the little bit of lobster that was there. I ended up getting a fork and eating the lobster before the other taco filling to hope to taste some lobster. And mind you, there was very little lobster. NOTHING like the fresh chunks you see in the picture. FALSE ADVERTISING! I should write corporate.\n\nThe worst part of dinner were the whipped sweet potatoes with honey roasted pecans. It came out drowning in butter and was actually salty. I asked the waitress for the side without butter. It came out, no obvious butter on top. BUT still way too salty. The butter was just mixed not slathered on top. This let me know there are NO whole sweet potatoes in the back. Just a puree that's shipped in and heated up. Gross.\n\nService was very kind and came out to sing happy birthday to my friend. She enjoyed her meal. She had the wood grilled salmon, shrimp, and lobster. It was fine. And I suppose because it was her birthday that her happiness is what mattered. As for me I will not be returning anytime soon or this lifetime by choice.
