Another great trip here. \n\nSo far my fav dish is the pork soup dumplings. Caution they come out so hot! Add a little soy sauce, poke open, then enjoy! \n\nI had the Szechuan noodles dan Dan style with the thick noodles. Loved it and not too spicy. About a 5 on my scale. \n\nWife had the chicken noodle soup. She loved the broth and had the thin noodles. Chicken was fall off the bone tender but could use some better color. They looked a little plain but not a big deal. It's not chunks of chicken but normal chicken wings that you eat with hot sauce. But still was very good. \n\nServer was great. Fast, friendly and made some good suggestions. \n\nNo complaints here. Would have loved to sit under the umbrella on Forbes but it rained. Only has three outside tables :(\n\nSee you again soon.
