I have only found two sushi places in Pittsburgh which I consider acceptable, and this is one of them. For starters, these guys really know what they're doing. Yeah they have some American-style rolls that are just deep fried and sauced all to hell (not saying that's not delicious), but they also have a lot of really fresh, interesting menu options, and their sashimi is exquisitely fresh and delicious.\n\nOoh - they seem to have a reasonably large selection of saki too, so that's nice.\n\nIt's not a very large place, and when we stopped by for lunch it was pretty packed, so maybe plan around that - I'm not sure.  But service was fast and everybody was exceptionally friendly - nothing arrogant. I'd definitely stop in again!
