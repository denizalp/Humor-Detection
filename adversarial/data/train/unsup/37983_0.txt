We tried the lasagna and linguine.  They were both excellent and I would highly recommend them.   Topped the dinner off with vodka raspberry sorbet drink that was just right!  The waiter was very engaging and helpful.  The only issue we had was the busboy was was filling water glasses was a little sloppy.
