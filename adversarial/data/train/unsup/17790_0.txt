This place is the ultimate Las Vegas dive casino\/bar near\/on the strip.\nIf you are in your 30's and live in CA - presumably you have been coming to Vegas since you were 18 and have done it all.\nLike most that see through the Vegas scams and honestly dont care to spend 1200 on a pool cabana JUST for the day... Ellis is the spot to be at. Its right across the street from Bally's\/Flamingo\/Linq, this place is full of old Vegas deals. \nIf anything, come just to people-watch, it's priceless. The strangest mix of humanity makes for excellent entertainment.  \nCasino games are actually fun here - win or lose.\nThe food is amazing!!! after all thats what Yelp is all about. Their BBQ is ridiculously cheap and good. Pizza here is effing amazing and sold by the slice or regular. I don't really drink beer, but they do have their own brewery - also very decently priced. SHOTS ARE 7$ !!!!!! \n\nDont spend 3000$ and not even have a memorable night - come here watch people get hammered uncontrollably (due to prices) and do karaoke. You might spend 180$..\n\n\nPS - Across the street is where 2PAC got shot.\nRIP - I love you PAC
