We finally had time to try dim sum here. We came in around 2 pm on Saturday and were seated right away. As soon as we sat down we had 3 push carts by our table (all at once) offering dishes to us. I wanted to get my hot tea first but that came later. We ordered few dishes and kindly told them that was enough for now. Not 5 minutes later, we had 2 more carts pointing things out to us. Not to mention one lady placing dishes we didn't order on our table. We had to tell her 'No' firmly. Another time, we had to say 'no' like 4 times before we can get her to leave us alone to enjoy what was already table full of food. I have never experienced such pushy dim sum ladies in my life.\n\nFood wise, few dishes were lukewarm (expected given the time we arrived) but others were still steaming hot. We were also very hungry and we could've eaten anything at that point. My favorite was the egg noodles stir fried. Everything else was as expected. \n\nI would love to come back here but those ladies are a big turn off for me. Dim sum is meant to be enjoyed leisurely reading a newspaper. If I were to come back, I'd come during their peak time so that they'd be too busy to be harassing us.
