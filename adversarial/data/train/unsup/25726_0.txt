I'm still thinking about those Red Velvet Pancakes. We arrived on a Saturday morning at 9:10 AM, and the main floor was already full of seated guests. We were seated by 9:25 AM, in the upstairs seating area, which was bright, clean, with huge windows, and spacious. By the time we left at 10:30 AM, there was a line of people waiting for tables. Make sure you come early, or you'll be waiting!\n\nFirst, parking. We found free street parking just a block east on Armadale Ave (a less than 2 minute walk to the restaurant). \n\nSecond, the food. We ordered: a) a coffee (free refills), b) a tea (oolong), c) red velvet pancakes, d) a side of bacon (because, obviously), and e) huevos rancheros. Overall, a hearty, delicious meal. The huevos rancheros were average to decent - imagine gigantic nacho chips topped with minimal guacamole, and salsa, for $14. It definitely needed more guac (for the price, anyway). But... the red velvet pancakes made up for it. Fluffy, light, with the fresh scents of cocoa wafting through your nostrils, it was heavenly. We were expecting overtly sweet, dense pancakes after seeing pictures, but it was absolutely perfect. Wonderful, light, moist texture and just the right amount of sweetness. Combined with a side of crispy, fresh bacon, it was the perfect way to start off a Saturday. \n\nLastly, service was wonderful and attentive. Thanks to Calla for making our first time at their restaurant a great one, and for excellent service!\n\nFor two people, with tax and tip, we paid $48.00.
