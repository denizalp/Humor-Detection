I'm glad we made the detour to Tempe to make a stop at the Four Peaks Brewing Company. I think I have thought about the Peach Ale every day since. \n\nWe made our way over to Four Peaks and honestly I thought we were lost before I noticed the discreet little sign. When we went in, I was amazed at how huge it was. About half restaurant and half huge brewery. We decided on a table outside, there were those water misters and that sounded great to me. \n\nWe decided on two samplers and at $9.00 each, it was a great deal and we got to try everything on the menu. Although Sunbru and the Raj IPA were the notable favorites around Phoenix, I fell in love with the Peach Ale. Too bad they don't bottle it yet. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA#4PgWnlLfgNs8P8uh-Wx6hQ\n\nWe were not quite starving so we settled on an appetizer and picked the Shrimp and Goat Cheese Bruschetta. The Shrimp were large, served with fresh foccacia and garlicky tasting brushetta mix. It was amazingly good, but the goat cheese was so light and creamy it offset the spice of the bruschetta. It was almost enough for a meal. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA#95xPXeFmqYyPjnLpWdf8UQ and  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA#SWt2-wnXn9qh2tzQeD_tNQ\n\nI think this place is a must stop. The Four Peaks Brewery is a great local place that has great beer and that appetizer was amazing. I can't wait to see the Peach Ale bottled, because it's absolutely delicious and refreshing.
