OUCH....this describes my experience here.  3 star concept....3 star funky fishy decor.....1 star execution.  I can forgive a place for being a bit frantic on a Friday night but ummmmm your restaurant was just half-full.  Hmmmm.  So my fellow yelpette and I were here last Friday and immediately you notice the energy of the staff.  Frantic really doesnt seem to describe it.  Terrified seems to fit better (I know we are gorgeous and thus intimidating but please really guys.....har har...)  \n\nYes loved the $2 IceHouse but things went downhill quickly from there. The special on the chalkboard by the hostess stand was winking at me as soon as I walked in the door.  $13.95 for Red Curry Fish with rice and a side salad.  When I ordered the special from the waiter I had said I would like the curry more on the mild side and he said 'yes yes' and appeared to write that down.  So yes I was very surprised when I got a shrimp appetizer instead of what I ordered (yes it was another special listed on the board).  It wasnt as though it was supposed to be sent to another table, our waiter literally had no idea what the specials were and just decided to pick one for me?!  Thus ensued more frantic behavior from the staff.  When I did get my dinner (while my lovely dinner partner just picked politely at her plate so as to not be rude)  the dish was fine (not great) but the side salad was lost in Never Never Land....\n\nSo when he brought the check and had charged me the full amount, I politely pointed out that either he adjust the bill or bring me a side salad to go.  He did the latter.  This place is a non-repeat for me.....there are just too many other options that are fab and consistent less than a mile in any direction.  Bad Fishy!
