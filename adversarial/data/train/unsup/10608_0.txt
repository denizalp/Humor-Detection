FreshCo opened a few years back, replacing Sobeys (though, they are the same company), as FreshCo sells cheaper products. Sobeys has been in this spot for about a decade, from the beginning when this neighbourhood was build. However, probably because of the price, not enough people came to this grocery store.\n\nParking is never a problem in this mall as there are a lot of spots. Walking into FreshCo, it was definitely more dull than Sobeys. The lights were dim and white lights. The amount of fresh green produce seem to be reduced and though I tried to pick out some groceries, I couldn't because the veggies aren't great quality veggies. \n\nI liked how they separated the veggies section with the fresh meat and fish area. I didn't notice a big bakery section however, so the selection of baked goods is limited. \n\nThe rest of the supermarket is filled with dried products such as snacks, pasta, medicine, toiletries, etc.
