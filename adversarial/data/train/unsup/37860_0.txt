This was a great stop over in the airport but a bit overpriced. I went with the rest of the Yelpers and decided that the fish tacos were worth a try. They definitely don't disappoint--hot crispy battered fish with the perfect amount of fresh slaw and a quick squeeze of citrus can't go wrong. I had a cocktail, but wasn't impressed for the $14 price tag. I sat at the bar and the staff was attentive and kind. The food did take a short while to come out but I had plenty of time. If back in the airport, I'd stop for the tacos but stick to a water.
