Cupcakes are supposed to make you happy in a self-consciously naughty sort of way.    The point is to spoil yourself with a decadent treat, but still be sensible enough to have a small, decadent treat.  You are then free to make ecstatic little O faces, in hopes that Mr. Big will see how sensual you really are. \n\nHow sad, then, to waste your splurge calories and your O face on sub-par cupcakes.\n\nThe cake part of the cupcake is really dry and tasteless, reminiscent of sawdust.  Yick.  The frosting on the chocolate cupcake is very, very good, though.  It's rich and fudgy and completely betrayed by the bad cake.\n\nMaybe we need a new decadent meme.
