We finally have a real juice bar at the Square at Dix30. This brand new spot just opened a few days ago. If you are thirsty or hungry, or just feel like having an healthy snack during your break, I would highly recommend this place. Plus, Alexa who is taking care of Crux is such an inspiring and dynamic person. \n\nThey don't offer only juice, kombucha and smoothie, but also wraps, salads and yogurts. The wrap I ordered was super healthy and tasty. I also tried two smoothies this week and they were both delicious. I love the organic coffee they use for their iced latte. \n\nSince Crux opened, I try to go everyday. It's so convenient and directly in the middle of The Square. I'm going to become a regular there and you should try it ASAP.
