I gave the guys at Johnny Walker RV every opportunity to rip me off. I took my RV in to get my water heater serviced and ready for the hard freeze. I pretended to know nothing at all about anything really. Instead of playing games and trying to make me pay for things I didn't need, they actually charged less than I had figured for even my most conservative estimates. I was late to my appointment and they still got me in the shop in a timely manner and kept me updated with phone calls throughout the entire process. I was even being sneaky and spying on their technicians discreetly from a distance and they simply do NOT mess around. I'm more pleased than I have ever been with their service center and they have earned all my future business to meet my RV needs. Thanks JWRV and my service writer Ed for striving for an unmatched level of professionalism.
