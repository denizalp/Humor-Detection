This place is great from children but even better for the mothers! The kids could run around and learn about the presidential railroad train and its only $3.00.  It was so much fun! \nThey always have the largest moveable mini toy train. This was awesome, I reverted back to a little kid with my very first train set..... great memories!\n\nThis is truly a tucked away gem in Scottsdale, you get flooded with memories that warm your heart. I'll be back here for the holidays!
