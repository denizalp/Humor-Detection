This location should be shut down. I have nothing good to say about it. Ive been there twice and no one was there during dinner time. The second time the cashier took my money with gloves on and then proceeded to make make food with the same gloves. I just left my food on the table and went elsewhere. Maybe they resold it too? I wrote Hero Burger and never got a reply. This location wont last long I hope.
