This is my favorite store, but sometimes I hate it. It is very hit or miss with good stuff. I would best describe this as a designer thrift store. You have to dig and dig for at least an hour to find the little gem that fits you perfectly. It may be tucked away in the wrong size section because someone loved it and tried to hide it. Or what appeared to be the perfect item may have indelible fouls like a huge tear in the sideseam but that's where the savings comes in if you have a tailor that can do a minor alteration for super cheap.\n\nIt's super funny when you see people being aggressive shoppers here. There is a pre-recorded automated message that comes on the loudspeaker periodically that warms aggressive shoppers that you will be asked to leave the store for the day. LOL
