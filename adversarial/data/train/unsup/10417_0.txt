4 or 5 years ago Burrito Boyz woke us up to the potential of a burrito done well.  So powerful was this awakening that I started searching for burrito references in every city I visited, including Burrito Mecca, San Francisco.  We held our own thanks to the Boyz back in those days.\n\nUnfortunately, times changed, as did the quality level of the Burritos that the Boyz had to offer.  My BPW, (Burritos per Week) average went from 3, to 0.01.  \n\nI'm happy to say having visited Chino Locos last week that the BPW is on track for a recovery this year.  Since Friday, we are on our way back up to 2, at least within the next month or so.  This could get higher over the summer months.  I had the fish burrito, with chow mein noodles, spicy.  Loved it.  The fish was delicate, and took on the flavour of the sauce it was simmered in.  Chow mein noodles were a nice change from the usual rice filling.  Spiciness was, um, spicy.  \n\nI heard while I was there that Chino Locos does a special burrito every week or two.  Last week's special was the General Tao's Chicken burrito.  If there were any more of those that day, I may well have had two burritos.  \n\nSuffice to say, the BPW is on track for a remarkable recovery this year thanks to these guys.  Great Job!
