Waited two + hours for our delivery. Called a hundred times with no answer. Finally got through and apparently you need to specify that yes you actually do want what you ordered, gave an adress and ask for the total. Otherwise you'll be waiting and waiting for nothing. Re-ordered ( God knows for what reason) and our total has gone up 3$. This place has terrible customer service.  Currently on our way to McDonald's. Never again.
