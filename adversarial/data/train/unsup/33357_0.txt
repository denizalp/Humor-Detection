Crave it!! Come from across town almost every week. Just gets better and better. Brisket so good there's no need for sauce. Mac and Cheese like homemade, greens soft and tastily seasoned. Corn bread just right.  My picky family even loved everything ordered. Staff remembers you and owner present. Great mom and pop place.
