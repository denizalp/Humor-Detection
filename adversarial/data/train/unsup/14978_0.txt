I've had lunch here a few times over the past few years and although it's always been packed, the food is delicious and authentic and the place is definitely trendy.\n\nMost recently, I had the Khao Sai braised beef for lunch at the bar. The food came very quickly and the Khao Sai is braised in a sweet coconuty sauce with garlic, spices, etc. The \"broth\" is so good I can basically drink it and that I did. It also had these crunchy things on top that beautifully decorated it and always provided a neat textural experience when eating it.\n\nThe braised beef was out of this world soft, my only gripe with it were the pieces of the beef were a little too big and I wish they cut them up smaller. All in all - this one dish made for a filling lunch! I definitely look forward to trying more things next time I'm here!
