Just wanted to reiterate how much I love Cedars deli, and that's pretty much all. Yesterday I was in grabbing a couple of falafel wraps, and there were some obnoxious gentleman in front of me who obviously had never tried Mediterranean eats before. The staff were incredibly patient, explaining what was in everything and being total champs. \n\nWhile I was ordering my two falafel wraps, the gentleman making my delicious wraps suddenly demanded, \"Who is the other one for?\" In my head, this would proceed to turn into a Pulp Fiction moment....\n\"DESCRIBE WHAT MARCELLUS WALLACE...LOOKS LIKE!\"\n*stuttering exchange involving guns occurs*\n\"DOES...HE... LOOK... LIKE... A ....BITCH?!\"\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DCrDuGyZ6FA\n\nOf course, this isn't what actually happened. I told him it was for my mom, and they wrote MOM on the other falafel which was quite cute and helpful.\n\nI enjoy all of my experiences at Cedar's Deli. The falafel is amazing, the salads taste fresh, and they prioritize customer service.
