I love this Terrible's location.....why?  Here's why:\n\nPROS\n- It's in my neighborhood & conveniently located so I can stop by for gas on my way back from most parts of the Valley.\n\n- Use of the car vacuum cleaners are FREE.\n\n- The car wash services.  It's a typical Terrible Herbst medium  sized car wash setup.\n\n- They have oil change & other minor car maintenance services.\n\nCONS\n- I can't really think of one.\n\nI come here mostly for the gas & vacuum cleaning.  I have other Terrible locations that I prefer for the oil change services.\n\nWill I return?  Yep!
