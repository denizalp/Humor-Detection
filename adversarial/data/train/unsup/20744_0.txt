E-Jo is a Korean Sul lung Tung Soup House which is boilled beef soup. The choices are what cuts of meat you want in your soup. There are some other options and the hangover soup has spicy bean paste added. The grilled meat start at $17 per plate. The soup is good and the Kimchi is excellent. But the green onion topping is very roughly cut. \n\nService is good but English is limited so you need to use the menu item numbers. Great place to get a hot piping bowl of beef soup.
