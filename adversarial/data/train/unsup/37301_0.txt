Doctor's here are good. But they make schedule for their doctors overlapped in-between patients.  No enough time in-between patients for doctor's to breath. My doctor is attending me and then ran to other patients then back to me. Another You have to wait for a long period of time to your appointment.  Not good. Their receptionists are not professional, not courteous and polite, bad customer service, fake smile. Only good if you booked another appointment and if you are Chinese, however I witnessed receptionist arguing with Chinese patient so loud...lol.\n\nDon't be deceived that they are located in Hilton you have peace of mind..  They have bad customer service.\nGo to other clinic even if it's not a nice looking building but you are taken care off professionally.
