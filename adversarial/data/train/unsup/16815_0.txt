Let's Start with the Room.  \nDON'T  I repeat DON'T purchase an expensive ticket. The Cheap Seats are just as good as the VIP Section... in Some Cases better.  You will thank me later.   Each seat is very close to the stage... now on to Eddie\n\nI was expecting to see him like on HBO or something... he had 20 Good First Minutes then the rest sound like he was bitter at life. he went about 40 Mins of this.... then the last 5 before he exited the stage was good.  \n\nMy boy needs to stop doing what ever in Life he is doing Bad and go back to being Eddie Griffin\nThe room was a dive and he smoke about a Pack and had 6 Glasses of Wine\/Champagne  \n\nI was so Glad to Leave.... \n\nBad Joke + Smokey Room on a Hot Ass Night = Negro you ain't Funny.
