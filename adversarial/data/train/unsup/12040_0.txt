Now I will say that the pizza here is good, but that won't keep me coming back. I can get good pizza at a ton of places, and get much better customer service.  \n\nWe decided to order a pizza and salad yesterday, was told it would arrive in 45 minutes. NO prob, that's reasonable. so an hour goes by and I call up to find out where my pizza's at (It's now 7 o clock, and my two little kids are starving by this point)  The rude girl that answered the phone tells me \"there's no delivery people here, so it should be there any minute. There's nobody else here\". O...kaaayyy??  So I wait another 15 minutes, and that's it. My wife calls up to cancel the order and the same rude girl puts her on hold to talk to the manager. She tells the manager \"They already called twice, I don't know what to tell them\". So the manager gets on the phone and tells my wife that the best he could do is give her 5 bucks off the next pizza. She tells him no, just cancel my order and he replies \"well I have no way of getting in touch with the delivery guy\".  Nevertheless we cancelled the order and the pizza guy never showed up. So either A ) they DID have a way to get in touch with the delivery guy and were just telling my wife that to keep the sale or B) the delivery guy went over and above, went to my favorite pizza spot in Polcenigo, Italy and my pie should arrive sometime tomorrow. Either way, I ended up having to get something else to eat last night. I truly try to support small business in the area but c'mon small business, get your ish together!!!
