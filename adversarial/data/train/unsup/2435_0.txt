Fairview hospitals birthing center is very mediocre. I have full medical insurance and they placed me in a semi private room with no shower and not even adjacent  to the nursery. Also I wanted to do 6 months of monthly payments to rid my balance and they told me that was not acceptable, they only do 3 month payment plans. I've had bad experiences with several different doctors, and the Fairview Pediatric ER misdiagnosed BOTH of my children 3 times in the past year.
