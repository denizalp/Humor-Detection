I have always loved all of their locations. I love the food and that they have a very dog friendly patio. This was our first time at this location. There was no wait and we were seated on the patio. \n\n\nI ordered the hummus and it was absolutely delicious. The only downfall was the waitress didn't remember our orders, and that's probably because she should've wrote it down.
