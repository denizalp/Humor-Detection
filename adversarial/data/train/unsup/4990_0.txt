The cheese is okay.  The service, the staff and the clientele are painful.\n\nService - The owners should put some thought into an Express checkout line.   I once waited 20 minutes - in a 4 person line-up - because everyone had to try 5 or 6 cheeses before they bought one.\n\nStaff - I like smoked Gouda.  I know it's not a 'good' cheese because its processed.  I don't care.  It tastes delicious.   When you say 'we don't sell that here', with your faces all scrunched up like a barn animal farted it makes you 1. look like a pretentious wanker and 2. shows bad customer service.   How about 'we don't carry that but if you like smoked Gouda, try ...'    \n\nClientele - Stop budding in line, stop thinking your children's screams are precious, stop standing in front of the frozen food section blocking everyone's path, and stop being ... just stop.   If one more person spends 15 minutes at the checkout hum and hawing about a cheese - keeping everyone behind them waiting -  I'm going to start throat-punching.   \n\nNo wait ... I won't.   Because I'll be going to the St. Lawrence Market for my cheese.  Where they've spent years perfecting their craft and they sell smoked Gouda.
