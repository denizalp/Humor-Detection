Little breakfast spot along the outter part of superstition springs mall. My family said they had a creative menu and being a person who loves to check out places that were different, this was a must.\n\nWe were greeted by hostess who was welcoming and very smiley. Seated fairly quickly and greeted by our server within a minute of sitting down. Service overall was pretty good, only complaint was we noticed 2 tables that were sat after us got their food before us. Granted we did have a larger party but one of the parties was also a bigger party so kinda made a few people at our table urked when they noticed that. \n\nAs for food, I agree the menu was creative. I got the avocado benedict. Healthy option for eggs Benedict, instead of an English muffin they use avocado. The pico serves inside definitely adds flavor. I would get it again. Wolfpack is confusing, they have eggs and bacon topped with a mass amount of hash browns. You gotta search underneath for the eggs and meat.
