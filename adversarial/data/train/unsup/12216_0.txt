We ran into this place on accident, and were convinced to come back for dinner by a very persistent waiter.  It's a BYO (AVV? Apportez Votre Vin? ) so we brought along a bottle and promptly embarrassed the waiter who tried to open it with a corkscrew and realized halfway through that it was a twist-off.   Shut up Montreal, you're fucking expensive and I was running out of cash.\n\nThe restaurant was nicely decorated, off the beaten path, and was constantly full of people.  We did the prix-fixe meal which was $37, and started with escargot and mussels, then a gazpacho and salad, lamb and veal sweetbreads, then for dessert we had a berry sponge cake and a chocolate mousse crepe.  Everything was fresh, delicious, and well-cooked, especially the lamb.  The dessert was clearly pulled out of a fridge moments before, but everything else was fantastic.  Highly recommended.
