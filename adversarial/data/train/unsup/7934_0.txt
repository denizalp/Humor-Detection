We recently bought a house in Gilbert that has a pool that was built by Caribbean Pools & Spas.  The pool is three years and some of the equipment has failed and is no longer working.  As a result of the failing equipment, the pool has a black mold problem that we has new home owners now have to deal with.\n\nUnfortunately, Caribbean Pools doesn't stand behind their product and when a house is sold the warranty is no longer valid, regardless of the age of the pool.  \n\nWhen I reached out and asked for help in some way, even if they could just let me know if the equipment might still be under warranty, I was told their warranty (Caribbean Pools) was now void and that they couldn't help me.   When I asked for some consideration based on the age of the pool, I was promised a callback that never happened.\n\nBased on the build quality of the pool, the quality of the equipment they use, and the poor customer service, I would recommend considering other builders if you're having a new pool built.
