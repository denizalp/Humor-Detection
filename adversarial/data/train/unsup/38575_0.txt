Met up with a friend for lunch. I had the tuna wrap. Light and refreshing. On the recommendation of Yelpers my bf had the  steak kabobs- he thought they were fantastic and hopes to recreate them at home. I may have stolen a piece of steak or three. Service was friendly, steady stream of  customers. Will return.
