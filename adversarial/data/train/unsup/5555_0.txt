This is a huge park that I pass on my way to work every morning. It's centrally located and easy to find which I like!\n\nAs previous yelpers' have mentioned there is a water park, skate, doggy, soccer sized field... you name it, it's here! Super clean... and at least during daylight\/early evening hours when *I* would be visiting seems safe enough.\n\nParks hold special meaning to me! For one I am a kid at heart that loves a good swing in the playground area. Of course playgrounds are meant for children so I'm respectful in that I will wait for an available \"seat\" when necessary.\n\nParks in general (back in CA) used to be my retreat with a special someone in my life. Sadly I have not made much use out of them while living here because I don't have anyone to really share that \"fun in the sun\" atmosphere with. It's good to know that if and when the occasion presents itself... I know where to go. :)
