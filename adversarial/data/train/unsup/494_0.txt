Aaaah yes, American Apparel... for some of you this place is a complete mystery.  You are utterly amazed as to why people would buy such \"boring\" and \"plain\" clothing...I'm here to help.  \n\nLet me clear up some questions:\n\nQuestion 1:  Why the hell is there an AA in Vegas?\n\nBecause Hipsters are everywhere...even Vegas. \n\nQuestion 2: What the hell are Hipsters? \n\nRich, counter-culture, pseudo-intellectual elitists. Their main interests are irony, drugs and sneering at the mainstream.  Here, watch the video and it should answer all your questions...  after this, all your questions about American Apparel should be cleared up.  You're welcome.  \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kAO4EVMlpwM\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nHaving said all that, their tees are all I ever wear.
