I always come back!  We all float in and out of doctors throughout our lives, usually only when we are in misery.  I can not speak highly enough of Dr. D's abilities, and his wonderful physical therapy- massouse. He is not only extremely knowledgable about approaching health, he reads his clients well. He listens to MY needs, and then listens to my body through his fingers before ever making an adjustment.  After seeing my X-rays, I know exactly what our goals are. Dr. D is seven steps of heaven ahead of the game. I highly, HIGHLY recommend your next visit to chiropractic care to come from the entire office of Platinum Medical group.  You'll be back!
