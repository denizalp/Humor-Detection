I just had surgery and am not allowed to lift, push, or pull anything over 8 pounds. So, of course I decide to make some improvements around our apartment - including a new mattress. My husband, while willing to haul the mattress to our guest room, was dreading moving it out of our place and down three flights of stairs. This is where Brandon became my hero. I reached out to a few junk removal services and Brandon gave the best deal. When I mentioned that it was just a mattress needing to go, he offered to take a few other things to make the already reasonable price more appealing. I took him up on that offer, and he was able to grab a few broken down boxes, an old vacuum, and an old chair. He emailed me to confirm I was home, and arrived when he said he would. He was incredibly professional, and personable. I highly recommend Brandon and Best Junk Removal. I will be using him again, for sure.
