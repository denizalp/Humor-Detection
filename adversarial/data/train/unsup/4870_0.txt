Heat seekers, Thai E-San and Thai food in general knows how to serve up the heat!\n\nFor Thai food, I always order a soup, some kind of noodle, Thai tea and dessert. So to start, I did share with my room mate for dinner so let that be known before I am deemed a glutton. We did the Seafood Tom Yum, Pad See Ew and Mango Sticky Rice.\n\nThe Thai tea was good, sweet and strong (I didn't sleep till 3AM).\nSeafood Tom Yum had good flavor, not MSG laden, filled with seafood (mussels, scallops, shrimp, squid) \nPad See Ew with beef, yummy flat rice noodles with strips of beef, savory and spicy!\nMango Sticky Rice was good, though the rice was a bit too wet for my liking and the portion I felt was a bit small for the price point.\n\nFor all the food, we asked for Medium heatwise and I thought it was perfect! I do like spicy food though, but there is a burn!\n\nAll in all, Thai E-San puts out solid Thai food. The owner came by to talk to us and also made sure everything was alright with the food. The food tastes pretty authentic to me!
