This was my first wine and design class and I really liked it.  I purchased 2 open gallery sessions as a Christmas Gift for my Mom.  The atmosphere was pleasant and all of out products were set up when we arrived.   We jumped right in and Eric (host) would chime in with very helpful tips.  All in all we had a great time and left with artwork we were very proud of.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a creative outlet.  I wish we had more instructor supervisin, but I think other classmates had more difficult pieces that ours.\n\n I'd add pictures but Don't see the option.
