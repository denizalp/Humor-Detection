DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!  Dr. Kevin To ruined my teeth and I'm still paying for it--4 months later. He tells all of his (adult) patients they have cavities in \"several teeth\" and that you \"need\" other expensive dental work done.  Everything was horrible.  X-rays made my mouth bleed.  Anesthetized my gums then attended to other patients for at least 45 minutes while I was \"numbing\" (when, by the time my fillings got done, I was NOT numb.)   I really, really regret going here.  I've since had 14 appointments with my former dentist and endodontist trying undo whatever Dr. To did to prevent me from being able to chew again.  Save your time, money, and health and go somewhere else!!!
