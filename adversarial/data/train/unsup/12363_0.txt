I had no idea you could host kids parties here, but that's awesome. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause it's better than the punishment that is Chuck-e whats-his-name. They have a bar and adult things to keep you busy. They also have private rooms you can rent out and they'll stream Cartoon Network on the big screen--it will make your kids literally loose their minds. \n\nI'm not sure how much the food costs, especially for a larger party in a private room, but it seems pretty standard. You know, big-chain frozen foods prettied up to look fresh. Meh. But if you go there to play games with the kids, like we did, this place is money. \n\nSpeaking of, you seem to get more for your money with their charge cards. The idea is to find the games that give you the most tickets. That way your kiddo can grab something cool from the shop when it's time to go. \n\nOverall, this isn't a place I'd seek out to spend time at with adults, but for a group of kids it seems like a great deal. And if you have a few beers, you won't feel the big-box monster eating your soul.
