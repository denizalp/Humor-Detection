We had quite the underwhelming experience here. We were here in the early evening on a Saturday. So perhaps things are better later at night? Decor is nice. Not much in terms of ambiance, though. There was only one server. They do have a happy hour.\n\nI wanted to try one of their original cocktails. There are two on the menu, two of which they couldn't make because they were out of ingredients. So I settled on the Green Zombie. Worst. Cocktail. Ever. Really, ever. I tried to drink it and just couldn't even stomach it. I literally pushed away alcohol. Yet, the world still seems to be standing and hell hasn't froze over? I'll drink bad drinks. But I couldn't handle more than a couple of sips of this one. So terrible. The bathtub jungle juice at bad frat parties is a high-end and good cocktail compared to this one I had. And the server never asked how it was or seemed to care that it went practically untouched.\n\nThere is a small food menu. We opted for the teriyaki shrimp. It took about 25 minutes for this one dish to arrive. And we got one napkin and one fork with it, even though there were two of us. It was tasty enough. And again the server never came back to check on us. Now, I would understand if it was crowded or something. But at this point, there was another table of two and another table of three, and that's it. After awhile, we finally managed to flag her down and get our check.\n\nI so wanted to like this place - it's got some good reviews. Maybe it was just a bad day and a bad bartender? But we definitely did not have a good experience here. Worst. Cocktail. Ever. EVER.
