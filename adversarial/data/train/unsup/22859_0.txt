I went to the Ghostbar while visiting Palms Casino and Resort.  I was on the guest list, so we didn't have a problem getting into the lounge. The staff was professional. Guest must wait for elevators to take you up. I thought Ghostbar had a great ambience (during my visit). The views from Ghostbar are insane! Guest gets a 360 degree of the Vegas building and lights (priceless view at night). It's a great place to take in Vegas scenery. Part of the Ghostbar is an open rooftop (great place to take a picture). The DJ\/music was average at best IMO. Drinks were average price. It's a cool place to check out while in Vegas. I enjoyed relaxing at Ghostbar. Definitely put Ghostbar on your bucket list for the insane view and ambience. I give Ghostbar a 4.5 rating.
