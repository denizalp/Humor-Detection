A couple of weeks ago I (through my mother) encountered a very unprofessional experience. As a regular, you'd expect respect and appreciation for your business (both the family and I have probably spent over a thousand dollars here throughout the years).\n\nI was accused of running out on the bill by the owner when I was not there to defend myself. Instead, my mother was spoken to by the owner in front of many people on a busy weekend.  This situation was not handled professionally imo.\n\nLa Cigogne should have:\n- waited for my return as I live in the area and I am a regular\n- not called out my mother on this\n- provided a date and time of when this supposedly happened
