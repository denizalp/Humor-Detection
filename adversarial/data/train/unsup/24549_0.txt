***THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SPA***\n\nI hadn't been to this spa for a while but wanted to get a manicure so made an appointment. It used to be called Spa Atmosphere and was quite nice. But now, it is M Spa and some other section for men only. Walking in it just seemed shabby, with a shelf of crap for sale on one side, a tray with some ugly science class erlenmeyer flasks filled with colored liquids, and a very rude bitch working at the desk who talked to me like I was there to clean her toilet.\n\nAnyway, I went into the inside part. Boy has it changed. Instead of going to this other part in your own room for your treatment, there is some common room with low quality furniture all over the place. Luckily it was empty when I was there.\n\nSo I sat at my station which was practically in the hallway, next to a generic fake plant. The nail bowl looked dirty. I sure hope they sterilize their equipment because the girl doing my nails would just pull tools from like a junk drawer. What happened to those individually wrapped sterilized sets? \n\nAs I was looking at the table, I saw old nail clippings on it. Sick!\n\nAbout the treatment itself, it sucked. I could have given myself a better manicure blindfolded with my non-dominant hand. I didn't get any cuticle oil or lotion even. I had to tell her to do a base coat. I am no esthetician but even a child knows to use a base coat under your polish. So the color coat on top was smeared on like crap all over the place with one stripe of top coat at the end.\n\nAnd the price for this monstrosity? $40. That's right. \n\nI am not ever returning to that sh*thole of a place they call a spa with heir dirty, poor quality, rude services. I would rather throw $40 off the side of a bridge than spend it there again. Then at least a homeless man could find it and have a happy moment on some cheap drugs. That is far better than any $ going to this poor excuse for a spa.\n\nEnough said.
