First time visit for this location, I had no idea that this place was located in Container Park.\nIt's actually in a good location, 2nd level over viewing the little grassy area.\nYou can definitely grab your food to go and hang out downtstairs with kids or if the day permits it enjoy your food out and about.\nI definitely used the outdoor seats while I waited for my goodies. I like that they had infused water ready for anyone to grab. With the summer approaching that is a definite plus. I also noticed that they had a very extensive drink selection and the knowledge to recommend and prepare a delicious drink or pour you a nice glass of beer.\nLet's move onto the food\nI didn't really order as much as I would like. Good thing I came with my friend, and we were able to order two items to try. The first thing that caught our eye was the waffle and chicken. It's not your typical chicken and waffle they actually amped it up with fruits!  I wasn't too sure if it would work and boy was I wrong! They paired very well and definitely had a burst of flavor, I loved the strawberries and apples with the caramel sauce and raspberry drizzle.  My meal was so good, and it was definitely enough to share since we ordered the edamame, it was so seasoned and good perfectly. I definitely couldn't stop. Hence my poor attempts of finishing my meal.\nThis place has definitely got some good dishes and the staff is super friendly. I simply have no complaints.
