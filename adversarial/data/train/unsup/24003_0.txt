A pleasant surprise!\n\nIts a perfect spot to relax and converse over a drink and an appetizer before you head out to the clubs or in our case a date night to see Rock of Ages in Vegas.\n\nWe weren't terribly hungry and the show was starting in less than an hour. If you're in the same situation you can order at the bar lounge like we did. Had some wine...shared an outstanding appetizer: Lamb meatballs in this crazy awesomesauce. The meatballs were prefect in size to hold us over until after the show. Highly recommended.\n\nAnd of course its not Vegas unless you include some Tequila in there as well. \nTwo shots please! ;-)\n\nService was excellent. I would definitely come back to eat here. I had a chance to skim the menu and the place seems to have their act together. Cant wait to come back to my favorite town!\n\nPeace\n\nP.S. Im kinda surprised by the negative reviews! But to each his\/her own...we had a great time.
