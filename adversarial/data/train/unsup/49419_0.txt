This brand new addition to the Sq Hill Asian eat scene looks great on the outside and inside too.  Clean bright and open California style kitchen where you can watch and hear the staff twist and smack the hell out of noodles.  I loved several dishes including a noodle dish with fresh minced pork and the pork slider on a long steamed bun but the dumplings where just OK and the ox tail soup and hot and sour soup was ho hum.  I do recommend this place but am not as in love as I wish I was.  Warning the eggplant though not bad was a surprise as it is served cold.  The place is clean which gets it points but with all the hoopla and the sight of fresh noodles being made and steaming baskets of dumplings I expected more.  I did like the Jasmine tea and the Sweet Bean Paste rolls for a finish.  Enjoy. FYI it is the first of a chain concept that is operating all over Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia.  We are lucky to have the first Everyday Noodle in the West open right here in Pittsburgh.  This is a venture by the owner of China Palace.
