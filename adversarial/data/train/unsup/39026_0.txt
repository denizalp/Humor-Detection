I wish I was able to frequent this place more often, because it really is a wonderful restaurant where plenty of Asian cultures and cuisines come together.  The atmosphere is like a typical casual dining restaurant with a bar, great to bring a group of friends or family to.  The Roti Canai is what I mainly come here for - it's hands-down one of my favorite appetizers ever.  And the sushi, don't even get me started.  It's both flavorful and a work of art -- major props to whoever makes it or teaches other employees to do so, because it's incredible what you're able to do.  Shame I can only visit and this place on occasion; each meal I've had here has been nothing short of satisfying.
