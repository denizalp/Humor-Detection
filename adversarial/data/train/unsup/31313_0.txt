Matt is very knowledgeable regarding trusts of all kinds.  He recently discussed Gun Trusts, as most people are probably not aware that a trust could be set up for your firearms.  He made the point that there are strict penalties for not registering certain firearms, such as fully automatic guns, cane guns, and guns with silencers.  Very informative and helpful.
