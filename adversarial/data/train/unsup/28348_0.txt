Very good burger, service is as expected if not better than average. Pricy for the burger if you build your own. I had fires with my custom burger ( premium meet) bison. And POP total was 27 with tax. So make sure your ok with the price. I will be back. Look for pics on my Pinterest boards. Trying to add a photo on Yelp is not easy.
