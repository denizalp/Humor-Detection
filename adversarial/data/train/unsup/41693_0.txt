Love this place! We always come in a group with groupons, because sushi is expensive... But it's decently priced for good sushi. The sashimi is always very fresh. I usually get the dragon roll (unagi- not as good as it could be, but still good) and always a nice piece of salmon sashimi. I can't remember what it was called, but I tried the one with mango and cream cheese and salmon... So good, but very sweet! It's nice to alternate with another roll so you're not overwhelmed with sweet sushi. I crave that one! They also have assorted plates of sushi and sashimi that's nice to get with a group. Usually we'll get that, unless we're not in a sharing mood, then the we get the rolls or something else. I can usually fill up on 2 rolls (about 20 pieces of sushi) and a piece of sashimi, which usually comes to about 20$, so not bad.  And I love their salad! Yum!\n\nMy husband doesn't eat any seafood, so he likes the teriyaki chicken, the teriyaki skewers, and the curry bowls (weird it comes with a sweet pickle, but he just picks that out) There's lots of other options for those who don't like seafood.\n\nNever very busy, service is always good. Not terrible, not superb. Just good. Parking in back is usually pretty good.
