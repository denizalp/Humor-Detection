Hipster Cornucopia Alert. Level: Red. \n\nSo I had just left dodgeball (ya heard), and me and my dodgeball team (!) made our way to the Lakeview to get brunch. There were 12 of us, so we knew we weren't getting in, but we tried.\n\nThen we just kept walking, slowly towards The Drake, and somehow ended up in the place formerly known as The Social. We should have gone to The Drake. \n\nThey were busy, and really weren't prepared. They were out of eggs, sausage and mayonnaise. What? Right. Ok. Mac and cheese and fried pickles? Cool. It was fine, but a bit bland, and the overall experience was pretty crappy. It's a big place, they should staff more servers (all ridiculously good looking grrrls, bee tee dubs, boys), and you know... buy enough effing groceries.\n\nPEPPER'S PATS HERSELF ON THE BACK: I played a sport. \n\n10\/30
