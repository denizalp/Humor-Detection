We stopped by hoping she had pre-made cakes that we could buy because we had a last minute birthday party. She was very quick to decorate it and it looked beautiful. It was fluffy and very light to the pallet. The topping was with whipped cream instead of icing which made it easier to enjoy. I will for sure be back to get cakes there.
