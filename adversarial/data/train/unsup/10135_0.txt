A newly renovated and modern looking café with a rustic and SoCal vibe with friendly Baristas. This is my go to place if I want to switch it up from the other café with the green apron. They have delicious drinks and offer a variety of food items that are much sizeable than other coffee shops. \n\nI do appreciate that they have a variety of Tea drinks and offer more innovated drinks that are offered throughout the year depending on the seasonal offering. The staff is attentive and really accommodate your preference. It's rare to come across a barista who isn't friendly. For those who need kosher food, coffee bean has more of a variety than others and a decent selection of Vegan items too. Another favorite of mine here is the Horchata coffee drinks. Overall, another cool coffee chain option for those looking for something different from the norm.\n\n2018 Yelp Review #37
