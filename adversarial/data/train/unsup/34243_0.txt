Just WOW! So easy to find, but the service is only outdone by the food! \n\nThe world famous French toast, the locally sourced sausage & the glorious omelettes made to your flavour list were truly the best way to start our day! \n\nThe line up & seats outside attest it's not just my opinion... never ending coffee, fun, smiley & efficient team members made it feel like you were at your best friends place for a meal... if your friends REALLY know how to prep a plate!!!\n\nCheck these guys out; you'll be glad you did!!!!
