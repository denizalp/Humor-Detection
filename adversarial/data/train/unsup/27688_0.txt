AMAZING!! My folks brought me here for my birthday and I must say we almost ordered everything on the menu..it was all so delicioso I wanted to go back the next day. Fried chicken, fried green tomato BLT, homemade biscuits, bone marrow and umm yea everything else. Service was excellent!! From the greeter to the waitress we were totally taken care of! A MUST TRY! Trust you will definitely be satisfied!
