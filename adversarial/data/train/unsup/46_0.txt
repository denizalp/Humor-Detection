Ooey gooey deliciousness! \n\nMy first experience of their yummy goodness was at one of the local art galleries. They had truffles, caramel sauces, and a cake in a jar. Yes, I said it, cake in a jar. It was fantastic! I didn't have room in my belly to eat dessert at the time, but once I got home, I popped it in the microwave for a few seconds (as instructed) and it came out warm and fantastic! I found myself scraping the sides of the glass and even skimming the bottom with my finger to get every last taste of its sweetness. \n\nI love how it's a locally owned business and they take pride in every creation. If you find them at a farmer's market or if they are showcasing at another gallery, pick up one of their tasty desserts and treat yourself (or skip the hunt and go directly to their online store). You deserve it and they deserve your business!
