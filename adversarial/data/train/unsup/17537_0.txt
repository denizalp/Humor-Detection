Never seen such sausage fest during a \"ladies night\". Could be because cover charge was $5. Or because the bouncer was letting everyone in and kicking nobody out. Don't get me wrong, I hate waiting in lines for hours during winter just to get into a club. I also hate being told that my shoes are not dressy enough by a bouncer who has no problem letting in a girl in her PJs. But I get why they do that. The few girls who were there were either with their S.O or with a whipped dude pretending to be their S.O to \"protect\" them.\n\nCheap pours and sticky floorsâ„¢. Sticky because people here can't handle their liquor. Broken glass everywhere. liquor spills on pool tables. I feel bad for employees who have to clean up afterwards.\n\nCleverly placed mirrors creating the illusion that the dance floor is bigger than what it really is. Super crowded with dudes. Perfect for cougars. Head upstairs if you want to dance comfortably.\n\nSo what's good about this place? Well cheap cover charge, no line up, cheap drinks, great service & AYCE sausage buffet if that's what you are into.
