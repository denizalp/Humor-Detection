One of my favorite stops on the strip. The 20.14 lunch (or whatever year you go) is really unbeatable. I know $20 sounds like an expensive lunch, but it is an absolute steal-especially on the strip where a burger and fries will put you at $20 like no one's business. For the special you get a three-course meal worthy of the fine dining tag. The mediterranean seabass is the way to go. I've been to Greece, this is as authentic as it gets us. I think they fly in some of their fish directly, so there you go. The sauce is simple, elegant, and basically perfect. Their octopus is also very excellent, as are their lamb chops and fries. Although if you're really hungry, the lamb chops are not the biggest portion. \nFor desert, the special yogurt and honey is a must try. I know yogurt and honey doesn't sound like much to get excited about. But trust me it is. The honey is specially made and it is the best honey I've ever had. This is a must try for lunch on the strip!
