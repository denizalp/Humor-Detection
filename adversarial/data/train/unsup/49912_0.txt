atmosphere was good and everything is clean, service was good. Food wise, the coconut prawn was fantastic! The steak has weird taste though, due to the sauce, and crispy dry ribs is hard to chew because it was really dry, also barely has much taste. We went during happy hour so the price was ok, but i care more about food taste than others, so probably will only visit again if theres a good deal on.
