I'll get straight to the point.\n\n-watered down margarita (not worth $10).\n-$2 charge for a very small loaf of bread. (What Italian restaurant charges for bread?!)\n-Overpriced food for small portion sizes and just ok taste.\n-server prioritized larger table.\n \nNot what we expected based off of some of the reviews. We definitely won't go here again. You be the judge, but don't say I didn't warn you.
