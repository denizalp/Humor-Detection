Fountain Hills sucks. It sucks to work in, I can't imagine living there. I work in FH in a place that is so slow we don't hire enough people to let us all just leave for lunch. So for the first time I was allowed, I pulled up my buddy Yelp and looked for ANYTHING to eat around me. The only thing that was unique was senor taco, I liked that they had a menu online so I check it out and decide from there. \n\nWhen I got there, they were quite busy, and there was a really nice guy behind the register, I was just looking for something without onions and he directed me to the red chili carnitas burrito. They have a salsa bar and I LOVE green salsas but its hard to find done the way I like it, and they have perfected. \n\nI took the burrito to go and I really enjoyed it, I thought it was gonna be like Filberto's quality but it wasn't, it wasn't gourmet either, just a good meat filled burrito.
