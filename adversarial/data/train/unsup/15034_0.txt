We got there around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and was told we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Not sure why people are complaining about waiting. They let us sit and order drinks during the wait. Pro tip: while you wait, strike up a conversation with your date instead of complaining. The food was a bit spicy which we like and the portions were very large.
