I had Green Planet design and construct my backyard which included outdoor kitchen, fire pit, rocked pool sitting wall, Zen Garden, retaining walls, and landscaping.  This install was done 8 years ago and everything is in perfect working order today - also the landscaping has grown in perfectly.  We have a beautiful outdoor living space that provides so much enjoyment for our family and friends.
