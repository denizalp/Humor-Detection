When I used to have a desk job in an office with frighteningly few snack-like amenities nearby, I would store NO FEWER than ten types of specialty dark chocolate in my top desk drawer. We used to have dark chocolate meetups in my office area, where a few of my fellow aficionados would congregate and nerd out over new varieties we'd find, constantly trying to outdo the next person. \n\nI rushed into Domino Foods on the hunt for a 70-75% dark with blueberry or raspberry bits that was already divvied up into squares. I saw a paltry selection of Lindt dark chocolate by the cash and asked the owner if there was anything else. She urged me to go further into the store, where she unveiled a monstrous shelving unit teeming with chocolate. \"I'm very sorry,\" she apologized. \"We don't have much in stock after the holiday rush. I really do apologize.\"\n\nReality: I have never seen more chocolate than what was contained on these shelves. I'm actually scared to go back and see the store fully stocked.\n\nAt least forty different brands, a spectrum of cocoa percentages for dark chocolate from 40% all the way up to 99%, and dozens of countries represented. Valrhona, Green & Blacks, Amano, Ritter Sport, Endangered Species, Ghirardelli - all the usual suspects were there. There was every sort of fruit combination imaginable, plus multiple coffee varieties, individually wrapped squares, party packs and more. It was absolutely overwhelming, but I think I've found my jam: wafer thin strips of Perugina Nero Sfoglie in 88%. Irresistibili, just like the package promises.
