Come now - It's not that bad!\n\nTonight I took my 12 y\/o who is a huge Criss Angel fan. I am not a fan. As a matter of fact - my kid watches the show in secrecy for fear I'll stop and point out his fakery. \n\nOkay that said - the show was a show. \n\nThe magic isn't great - I had to bite my tongue thruout the show.\n\nIt's a huge production. Be prepared for dancing. Lots of dancing.\n\nThe story is tongue-in-cheek and teeters on the risque side of mature content.\n\nThe \"vaudeville\" preshow was insulting. It's hard to believe anyone laughed at the comedy team's pratfalls and tired jokes. The comedy four started with disturbing distinct Chinese accents which morphed into spanish words and closed with made-up russian slang. WTF?\n\nThere was something sexy and pervy about the White Rabbit from Alice in Furland dancing with the Queen of Oz while touring Charlie's Chocolate Factory. \n\nWas it just me or was there a central Playboy bunny and Plushie fetish?\n\nPoor Criss - he first talked about Holly Madison (to which I whooped and hollared and he forgot his lines and answered me with \"She's here?\") - then he kept mixing up the names of the characters. Kaylie, Crimson, Kayla, Citronella, Chasity... too many names - can't keep it.\n\nStill - I enjoyed it. The couple next to me didn't appreciate Criss trying to \"be down with hip hop\" but that's when I shouted the most. (Haaaaaaay, go Criss, go Criss.... go-go-go-go)\n\nI'd  definitely go again. With several martinis in my tummy and a group of Girls Gone Wild. \n\nIn this economy - I admire anybody with a steady job - Good Work Criss!
