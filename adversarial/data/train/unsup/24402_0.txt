It's cheap, simple and taste pretty good.\n\n$3.99 chicken bowl with white rice and veggies. Great lunch\/dinner portions for us females. What more can you possibly ask for...especially for that price? This is a good alternative for me whenever I crave a quick and simple teriyaki chicken rice bowl. This special is good 7 days a week and you don't need a coupon or anything.\n\nThere's a Yelp check-in offer for a free order of gyoza dumplings but it's not valid on the regular sized bowls....only the large ones. Just an FYI.
