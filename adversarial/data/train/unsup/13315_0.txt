My rating is based on the dessert, because it's the most important meal of the day ;)\n\nFirst the food info. I didn't have pizza, I had house salad (bland, not great), green olives (not pitted!!! My teeth would have appreciated a heads up), the bruschetta (I was about an hour late to the party and they were mush by then), the cheesecake (sweet heaven!), cannoli (I thought they were okay, but those with me were in love). \n\nI have never been a cheesecake fan, but this place changed that :D It was soft & sweet and just amazing. I'm told that they change their cheesecake selection based on the seasons (that confused me because we only really have 2 in Az, lol). I can't wait for the strawberry cheesecake in the summer!!!\n\nThey have a small parking lot behind the pizzeria building, but there's plenty of street parking.
