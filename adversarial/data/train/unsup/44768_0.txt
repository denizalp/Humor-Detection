Update- visited for brunch and was underwhelmed by the offering. Eggs were rather greasy, service was lackluster and my friends order was botched, with little recompense from the staff. Won't return. \n\nAlthough the atmosphere (for dinner) leaves alot to be desired, the food was pretty good. Enjoyed the short ribs (house special), they were perfectly braised, fall of the bone, and served alongside mash potatoes, and some veggies. Definite repeat but probably just for brunch
