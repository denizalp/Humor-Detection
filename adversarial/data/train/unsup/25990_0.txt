Pros:\nLegit cheap dumplings. Buns available.\n\nCons:\nEverything else. Low effort.  Exceedingly generic home cooking. Ingredients thickly sliced and diced, noodle drawn in cumbersome gauges. Nothing feelings chopstick calibrated. Morsel size irreverent of optimal volume : surface ratio iterated by generations of Chinese mathematicians. DYE Square cube law? The optimist would say that's fork friendly, but the dishes are not close to restaurant quality. Imagine deciding to stay for supper at your Northern Chinese friend's house, the mom whips up a quick meal after an arduous twelve hour shift. It's totally unremarkable and you say thank you because Confucius raised you right.
