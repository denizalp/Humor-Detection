This ain't BBQ, let alone Memphis BBQ.\n\nI've been to Memphis and I ate disgusting portions of BBQ while I was there and even the crappiest of them was infinitely better than this place. At the very least they were all genuine smoke joints.\n\nLike Greg B and James K before me have stated, this is not real BBQ and certainly not anything resembling meat that's been smoked low and slow.\n\nThe pulled pork sammy was bland and simply tasted like BBQ sauce. Same thing with my side of beans. They could very well have been Heinz, straight out of the can. And, similarly, I'm sure my iced tea was a Liptons product. So sad.\n\nThere's really nothing redeeming about this place whatsoever and it was a long haul to get there from my place in East York, so a big screw you to Memphis Smoke House.
