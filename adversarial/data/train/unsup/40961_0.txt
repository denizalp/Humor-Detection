I want to like this place. The tacos descriptions sound tasty, but the tacos I've tried on my 2 trips were dry and fairly tasteless. My dining companions were also not impressed. There are better tacos at a whole lot of other places in Madison (Ohio Tavern, I'm looking at you!)\n\nOn the plus side, the drinks were great here, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. And the service was good too.
