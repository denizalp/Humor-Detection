If you insist on checking this place out, I would ONLY go with Dr,. Tony, since I have heard good things about him.  We were referred here by another dental office and ended up with Dr. CeCe.  Our initial consultation was ok.  They were extremely nervous and apprehensive about doing non-sedated appointments, so they were going to start small for the first filling.  Her first appointment was fine and went well.  What was weird is they were still pushing sedation appointments.  The second appointment and the appointment after that just steadily got worse and so did the assistants.  So many of the assistants and Dr. CeCe didn't do a consistent job of talking kids through the appointments and explaining in kids friendly terms what's happening in their mouths.  The chairs are not kid friendly, and their lighting is excessive.  They also push the laughing gas and make children use it.  I was really disappointed by how this place treats kids.  I did find out there is a lot of turnover and great vacation packages, which is why they have employees working there that really don't want to work with kids.  If you're in need of a kids dentist, I would definitely be careful which doctor you try.
