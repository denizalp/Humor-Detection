Although there is lots of fun to be had here- the atmosphere of the show does not make up for the lack of cleanliness and overall \"ICK\" factor.  I love me some dive bars, but this one was a little too subterranean.  That and please, ladies- when you are lip syncing, at least know HALF of the words to the song.  Just moving your mouth and jaw like an automaton is NOT fun or attractive.
