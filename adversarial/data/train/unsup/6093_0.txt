I had a great room that had been recently renovated. But my stay was marred by a shower that was tepid and had limited water pressure. Along with a shower that needed Geritol to give it some pep, I needed a room that was warm. I had the thermostat up to 78 and I was still a bit cold. Maybe I need the Geritol too.\n\nThe staff was great and the valet parking is handy. I think I will try the Double Tree downtown next time as this was not a home run by any means.
