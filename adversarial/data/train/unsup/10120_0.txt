This place is located on the 3rd level of the Cesar's Palace Shops.  It was a bit of a walk, but well worth it.  We were craving sushi, so we were looking at all the reviews on yelp and decided to give this place a try.  Came at about Noon on a Tuesday, so it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the following:\n\n- Salmon sashimi - the color is a bright orange and the taste was so fresh.  Definitely a very good grade of sashimi.  It's buttery and melts in your mouth. \n\n- Cucumber roll - this was very good as well.  Most of the time cucumber rolls are just ok everywhere, but this was delicious. \n\n- Spicy Tuna roll - I love spicy tuna rolls and this one was very good.  Just enough tuna and spiciness to make it a great roll.\n\n- Pork Belly Fried rice - my husband loved this and so did I.  The fried rice is already packed with flavors, but when you mix the pieces of pork belly with it, it adds an explosion in your mouth.  So delicious!\n\n- Uni pasta - this one was very disappointing. I've had uni pasta before, but this one just tasted like an alfredo sauce with pieces of uni. \n\nOverall the sushi was great.  It's a bit pricey, so be prepared, but you get what you pay for.  Good sushi doesn't come cheap.  Staff was friendly and service was fast with the exception of my uni pasta.  That one took a little bit longer then everything else, but the server did prepare me for that.  I would definitely come back here for the fresh sushi and the fried rice next time I'm in town.
