This was my first time here and I wasn't sure what to expect. \n\nThe chips they give you are pretty addicting. I'm not sure if it's because I was hungry but it was pretty delicious. \n\nI decided to get the shrimp tacos. The plate was pretty big. The tacos? They were okay, not amazing. I don't think id bother with them again. It was also pretty hard to eat. The shrimp kept coming out of the taco. I didn't even finish it because I got tired of everything falling out. \n\nI also got the white wine sangria. It was pretty great. It didn't take long to finish it. \n\nService: the staff was nice but there was an issue with the bill. We had a big group and just put our card number on the back but for some reason it didn't add up. The waitress just let us pay separately and we all put the right amount on the previous bill, so I have no clue where the extra money came from.\n\nI think I'd rather go to a cheaper better Mexican restaurant next time I want a taco.
