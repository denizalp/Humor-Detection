Fat Tommy's is one of Pittsburgh's finest treasures. I have never had a bad experience here and I doubt I ever will. It's as good as it gets for a pizza and hoagie joint.\n\nFat Tommy's is our lunchtime go-to at work for a couple of reasons:\n1. We like the staff. I mean with a slogan like, \"food with attitude\" you know you're going to have a good experience.\n2. It's fast. We normally stay about an hour but it takes no more than 15 minutes for your food. And I think 15 minutes is an exaggeration.\n3. IT'S CHEAP! The lunch special I order will get you a drink, bag of chips and a hoagie for $6.69 (tax included). Where else can you get that? If that's not enough food for you then maybe go try a buffet somewhere.\n\nIn addition to the 8 lunch specials you can order entire pizzas, pizza by the slice, an plethora of fried food for your arteries, salads and calzones.\n\nIt's kind of small inside so seating fills up quickly. They recently remodeled making it look more like a restaurant and less like your uncle Vinny's basement. The only complaint I have is there is no restroom. What if you gotta go, right? You better hold it until you get back to your office like I do. \n\nAm I sharing too much?
