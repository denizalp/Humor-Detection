I was at a store near by and decided to look around this cute little shop. I was pretty excited considering my brother's birthday is days away and it looks like a really fun shop. I am in a scooter so it took me a bit to get into the store but that was ok, I don't mind doing things myself but upon entering I was never greeted. I brushed this off because she was helping someone else. I waited ten minutes and the woman working the counter never acknowledged I was even there. I felt she could have said welcome feel free to look around and I will be with you in a moment. Maybe it was just me but I felt she was very rude and I will never be returning to this establishment. I may be disabled but I am not stupid! I know how customer service works and when you suck at it it is not worth my time to return to your place of business. I am very disappointed that such a cute shop has such a crappy person working there.
