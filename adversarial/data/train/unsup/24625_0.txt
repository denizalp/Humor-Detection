Fall Run is a hidden gem in the area. It's located off route 8 in the Shaler, probably 5-10 minutes north of Etna and 10 minutes south of Allison Park. The road off route 8 is right across from the Harley Dealership. \n\nI serioisly would have never guessed this beautiful trail to be hidden back there! There is a playground and a small ball field at the entrance which leads to the small parking area and begining of the trail. \n\nThe trail leads you along a small Creek witch cute bridges and plenty of smaller waterfalls. It is seriously so pretty!! Ultimately the trail leads you to a set of stairs and the GOREGEOUS waterfall that is about a mile back! Breathtaking!! You climb the stairs to the top, where you can look down over the waterfall. There is also a small bench up there to relax. The trail does go on for linger, still following the creek. I've never actually found the end though! \n\nThere is some damage due to recent storms -  one bridge is down, but you can easily walk on some rocks in the creek to get to the other side.
