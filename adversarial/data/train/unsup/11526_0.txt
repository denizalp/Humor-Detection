Went here Tuesday 9\/6\/16 at 9:58 and expected them to be open till 10:30 pm (as said on the website and also their front door), but the person who came to the door signaled the place was closed. I pointed out the sign and the time I read online and he said that that wasn't their hours. He basically said that everything was shut down and turned off. I assume he was working alone and didn't want to be there anymore.
