We checked on Yelp and saw this place had 4 starts and 41 reviews before we walked to this restaurant from our hotel.\n\nThere were a lot of people eating there on a Monday night at 7:50pm when we walked in the restaurant.  We were very happy that we could have \"to go\" so we did not have to eat at the restaurant because the restaurant smelled greasy.  \n\nWe ordered fried rice and a vegetable dish.  We had to prepay the food - almost $20 including taxes.  I asked how long it would take and the casher told us 10 to 15 minutes.  We went out the restaurant to get fresh air and checked out other local stores.  We came back after 15 minutes and waited for another 15 minutes before we got our food.   Our cloth, face, and hair all smelled greasy after sitting in the restaurant for 15 minutes.   \n\nThe fried rice was average.  The quality of the rice was not very good - mostly broken rice pieces.  The vegetable dish was very salty and lots of \"water\".   The portion did not look as the same size as the people who ate at the restaurant or the photos on yelp.\n\nI would compare this place as one of the greasy and old New York China Town place but without the good food.   Panda Express had better food.  I cannot compare this restaurant to other Montreal Chinese restaurant since this was our fist Chinese restaurant experience in Montreal and Canada.
