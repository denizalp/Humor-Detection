If you plan on eating at the Peppermill word of advice is COME HUNGRY! The portions are huge and reasonably priced considering the size of plates. Location is at the end of the Vegas strip by Circus Circus. They have a huge parking lot so parking is not a issue, woo hoo! Otherwise, the restaurant is pretty large and expect to wait. I think it is always busy here. When we arrived on Monday around 11:15 am we waited about 40 minutes to be seated. The nice thing about the venue is they have a bar\/lounge area where guests can wait to be called. It is filled with red suede couches and a bar. They have servers come up to you if you want to order drinks while you wait. I did notice they have happy hour everyday from 3-6 pm where a majority of their drinks are $5.50 and lower, sweet! Once we were called we were taken to the restaurant part where it was bright with ample of seating. The menu offered lots of options from breakfast, lunch, dinner and appetizers. A ton of choices which made the picking hard! However, I went with the Marco Polo Omelette and man it did not disappoint! Omelettes come with hash browns and your choice of a bagel, English muffin or toast. My omelette had this wonderful hollandaise sauce and it was so good! My plate was $14.50 and it seemed a majority of plates were around that price point. Overall, great experience and if you want a keepsake they take a free photo and print it for you. Of course they try to up sell you, but not too aggressive. It was a nice free take home photo, nice touch Peppermill!
