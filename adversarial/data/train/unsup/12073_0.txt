It has been said several times but I must say it again - the food is EXCELLENT. I'm usually a salt and pepper, please-put-more-cheese kind of girl, but at Mercatto, I didn't even notice if there were any salt and pepper shakers around! It was gooood.\n\nWe started with antipasti misti and chose artichokes + beets, prosciutto + gentile and cheese I forgot the names of. GOOOOD. Then we had oriecchette and tagliatelle. GOOOOD. We ended with chocolate lava cake; though we've had better it was GOOD nonetheless. \n\nPrice is OK considering the cuisine and the ambience. Service is nice and accommodating, too.\n\nI would have given the 5th star if only the place was a little bit more spacious (we went to the Toronto St location). The space between tables was so tight you can't help but overhear the people beside you. So that I knew the couple on our right was celebrating their anniversary (and was already planning what to do on the next one!) and the one on our left was extremely happy about their pasta. It's entertaining at the beginning (sorry!) but can get annoying and noisy after a while.\n\nAnyway, definitely can't wait to go back!
