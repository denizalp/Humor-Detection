Went on Sunday 10-25-15 around 4PM.  This Panera Bread is located in front of the Galleria Mall in Henderson.  \n\nI've loved Panera Bread since high school and I come to this location probably once a month.  Having said that, this is undeniably the shittiest Panera Bread location I've ever seen.  It is just so filthy!!!  The sidewalk outside is littered with food, pigeon poo, and cigarette butts.  The windows and doors look like they have never been cleaned.  The furniture is all beat up and the floors are icky.  I have never been in the bathroom there because I'm afraid.  I always get my food to-go from this location. \n\n$16.40 got me a meal for me and my boy.  I got the \"you-pick-two\" with a Power Kale Chicken Caesar salad and an asiago steak sandwich, and I got the boy buttered noodles with a yogurt.  My favorite part of my meal was the warm piece of baguette that comes with it.  That thing is heaven with about 10 packets of their real  butter slathered on it.  \n\nI got my food and went over to the drink area to grab twenty, er, I mean, a couple of butter packets and there was an employee there refilling the tea.  I know she saw me walk up, but she moved a giant container of tea right in front of the butter.  So I had to stand there and awkwardly wait for her to finish.  \n\nThree stars because they got my order right, the food was delicious, and I didn't get sick.  Step up your game, Panera.  You gotta clean!
