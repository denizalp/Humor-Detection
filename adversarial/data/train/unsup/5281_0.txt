With good food you can't really go wrong, and that's exactly what Yonaka serves! The service is a huge incentive to go also. The staff are extremely friendly and do their best to make you feel comfortable enabling you to fully appreciate the music, restaurant design, servers, and most importantly the food! Everything on the menu was created with great preparation and true thought to your pallet. I highly recommend this place.
