Today was my first time going to Stacy. After moving to Tempe from out of state and realizing my roots could no longer be hidden I made an appointment with Stacy after reading her yelp reviews.  Let me tell you that my experience was BETTER than I could've possibly expected. My hair feels amazing and it has never looked better. The hair Stacy helped me have was what I always wanted but never got with other stylists. I will go back every time
