After getting the raw deal with my tire change at Crappy Tire (it's on my last review), I needed new tires.\nWhat to do...what to do...go to Benz and get the crap kicked out of my wallet - like I did when I needed winter tires and rims.  OR get ripped off by some guy in a tire shop.  Hmmm...option 2 it is!  LOL!\nI was at a client's office and I mentioned that I got screwed at Crappy-T and have to spend the rest of the afternoon running around for tires.  He picks up the phone and calls the owner of the place and tells him he is sending me his way.  I guess I'm going...not expecting much.\nGot to Rennsportire and it's a single unit in a biz strip.  Stepped in and the storefront had a nice lounge and quite a cool selection of rims.\nVictor - the owner - came promptly to see me.  Introduced himself and asked if I was \"Peter.\"  With no further ado - out to my car, checked the tires, got me a price, took a deposit, and asked me to come back after my lunch meeting.\nGot back and 45mins later, new tires - mounted and balanced.  He even showed me where my tires were separating and why it was shimmying.  Nice.\nOverall a 5 star experience.  Price was more than fair.\nIf you need tires and rims, give Victor a call.  I'm heading back for my winters when seasons change.\n\nCheers!
