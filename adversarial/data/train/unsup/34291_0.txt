I liked this place but didn't love it. The decor felt exactly like a typical restaurant anywhere in Mexico. It was pretty empty on a weekday night and there was only one server working but she was great. Friendly, efficient, and she pronounced all the dishes properly which impressed me. \n\nThe food was good but lacked a bit of flavour and I didn't like that you had to pay extra for salsas. My wife had pozole which tasted pretty authentic however we would have preferred tostadas instead of totopos to have with it, and it was missing the standard garnishes of shredded lettuce, radish, and chopped onion. We even had to ask for a slice of lime (which the server graciously provided but one shouldn't have to ASK for lime when ordering pozole). I had the taquitos which were fine but bland. I would have liked to have had some fresh salsa to put on them. \n\nPerhaps I would go back if I were in the neighbourhood and Ravi Soups was closed but it wouldn't be my first choice.
