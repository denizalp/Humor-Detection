DO NOT STAY HERE... I made the mistake of coming to Vegas during CES. Big problem, as everyone was booked, and that included the Feista Hotel who normally charges 41 bucks a night and was getting 400 during that week. So I got stuck with the Desert Inn... I SLEPT WITH MY SHOES ON PEOPLE!!! This place is a complete dive, and I will sleep in a box next time. I paid 350 for the week, and I am RUNNING to the Holiday Inn in Henderson 3 days before that week is up. The place smells awful, the WiFi is a joke, the toilet is so small I have to hold my stuff out of the water, and the list goes on. RUN, don't walk to anywhere else, and consider the box before staying here.
