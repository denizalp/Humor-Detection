My HVAC finally went out and the timing was not great! I had a few companies come out and gave less than ideal quotes. One company was even rude. Then I had AZ Dukes of Air come out and Dustin was great. He explained everything to me and was not pushy. So, after checking a few more avenues I called and talked with Tonya in the office and she told me about an upcoming promotion that would save me money, but would have to wait about a month. I said OK, saving money is awesome. The day of the install there were 2 guys (forgot their names) that came and were very professional and I cant begin to say how pleased I am and just in time, as its getting hotter. Ive had it on ever since and it is so quiet, something that it wasnt previously.  I would highly recommend and plan on using in the future. Thank you to everyone that assisted in the install.
