When we arrived, we ordered a beer each and some calamari to hold us over until the Cal game started. The gal behind the bar was somewhat \"rude\" to begin with (maybe she had a bad day?). We then ordered salad and pasta for dinner with wine. She was \"perturbed\" that we were planning to share the order rather than order an entree each. The game finally started and fans for both teams were rooting\/screaming as usual and the owner came over to me and told me I was \"too loud\"---even though everyone else was cheering all the same. We even bought a beer for the guy sitting next to us (who was betting on Louisville). She wrote up our bill even though we weren't finished with the meal (nor possible ordering of dessert, etc.) and told us to leave.\nWhen we asked her why she said we had been there long enough. (???) She even threatened to black out all of the TV's (there were about half a dozen). We were absolutely dumbfounded. This is the kicker: we have frequented The Grotto for the past 4 years during spring training, tip well, and considered ourselves \"regulars\" (we became acquainted with everyone that worked there including the owner) but this gal behind the bar was new to us. Who knows the real reason--we are still scratching our heads! However, we will no longer patronize such rude service.  As 4 year patrons, we are no longer supporting their establishment.  \nWe've been discovering how Scottsdale has been booming with new eateries----from excellent sports bars with great food, service , wine menu and draft beer selections to nice linen tablecloth dining experiences.  We certainly don't need to be insulted by those at The ?Grotto anymore.
