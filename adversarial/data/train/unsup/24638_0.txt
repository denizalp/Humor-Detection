Smoke free! casino free! Hard to believe it's in Las Vegas!\n\nI've found a new favorite. Shame & hate me if you want but I'm not political nor is this review. It's just a great hotel!\n\nI love the free shuttle to Caesars & Wynn & Encore. So convenient! We even took it a time or two just to get onto the strip to walk. \n\nUpon check in the bellman immediately gathered our gear & arranged for it to be transported to our room. \n\nWhen you step into the lobby it smells fabulous. Tropical but not overly sweet. It is my favorite scent. They sell it in the gift shop in a \"stick\" style distributor. \n\nCheck in was a cinch which provided us two out of this world amazing chocolates. \n\nOn to the room, I was impressed by the size. I have lived in apartments smaller than the hotel room. Featuring a kitchenette, large bathroom & sitting area, nothing had that icky residual smoke odor you sometimes encounter in Vegas. \n\nBed was supremely comfy. AC worked & cranked. \nOnly issue with the room was the water was temperamental temperature wise, nbd but worth noting. They should also put bumpers on the glass door to the toilet & shower stall. Would make it less noisy. Room service is 24\/7 which is a luxury itself but breakfast was mediocre. Had to drop a star. It was fine but nothing special. \nThe newly renovated pool area is pretty and offers two hot tubs. It was too windy on our trip to use it but was open. \n\nBeyond that I have zero complaints regarding this hotel. Our room was meticulously cleaned & I found all of the staff very friendly. I also appreciated the security checking room keys before arriving to the elevators. \n\nGreat hotel!
