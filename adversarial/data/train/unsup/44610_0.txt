Was here for dinner last week with my son (who had just moved into the area) and my 12 year old.  As soon as I saw the menu I was concerned the little one would not like the food.  My son ordered the burger with fries...served nicely...nice portion and reasonably priced for the area at $14.  Little one wanted steak so we had the only beef option that I thought she would like to share, which was the pot roast and Yorkshire with a bit of fries.  It was tender small to average size portion served with a nice portion of very good gravy.  My daughter enjoyed it.  I ordered a soup....(Mulligatawny) it was served kind of oddly.  It was placed in what looked like a very micro mini tea pot and it was thick so it was very hard for server to poor over the fresh herbs in the bowl.  It was tasty but a very small portion for $11.  My only complaint really with the soup and meal is ... I go to many restaurants and every single one that is serving this caliber of food at this price point will always include some form of bread or crostini with butter or oil.  Especially when served at soup....I would expect a little something on the side to dip in or savour the flavour in the bowl.  It may be a small thing to offer but to me it did make a difference...so much so I opted to review so the owners can maybe consider this.\nService was very good, good selection of beers, atmosphere was very cool and music suited the ambiance.  Dessert...we had the dark chocolate pudding and the apple bread puddling....cute little baked in a cup presentation and contents very rich and satisfying.  Dinner for 2 with 2 drinks (since little one and I shared I think best to rate this way). $100 including tax.  A little expensive in my opinion but the food was good.  I could honestly just be put off because of the bread thing...lol!  It's my thing. \nGo again...yes maybe to try brunch as I heard they have a good one.
