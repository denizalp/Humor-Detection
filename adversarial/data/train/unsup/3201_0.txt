This pharmacy is terrible! They advise my boyfriend to buy a cheaper pill of plan b that it works the same and it's $5 cheaper. It didn't work at all made me sick and now I'm pregnant. All he did was ask for regular Plan B which had worked for me before and now because of the stupid ass bitches that work there I am pregnant because of a generic pill thanks a fucking lot. He described them as two Hispanic women who said I would be fine. I am not fine an they are not doctors to give suggestions out like that next time they should just give people what they ask for not some cheap bullshit they recommend.  Wish I could have 0 stars
