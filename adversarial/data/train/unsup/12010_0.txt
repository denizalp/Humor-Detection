After my really disappointing experience with Red last year, I decided to give them another shot. On par with Takumi, but only so-so in the grand scheme of things.\n\nVerdict: Way better than last time.\n\nWe started off with the hamachi. The waitress tried to sell us on the hamachi special, which had some sort of BS peach-mango salsa on top. I didn't bite. Hamachi is a dish that's supposed to harness the power of the fish (tuna) with a subtle bit of heat from the jalapeno, so I wasn't sure what they were doing putting salsa on it. Anyways, it was good! The tuna was sliced nicely and decently fresh. The only thing I can compare it to is Nobu...so it fell way short in that aspect, but it was totally nommable.\n\nWe got a few rolls, too--spicy tuna, firecracker (some fish-laden monstrosity) and a king crab roll. The firecracker, which was deep-fried, was good. I think because some of the fish in it was cooked, I was a little off-put. My brother loved it, though, so props.\n\nSpicy tuna was basic and run of the mill, and the king crab was pretty good. I like that they offer a choice of asparagus or avocado, mainly because I love asparagus and will always get it, even if it's not the norm.\n\nMajor gripe: The tomago. This is always the true measure of a good sushi chef. Red did NOT make theirs fresh. I saw the sushi \"chef\" unwrap it from plastic, make a slit in it, and stuff some rice in. That's a major no-no in my book. It should be made fresh with lots of layers and placed over rice...not served cold. Tsk tsk.\n\nRegardless, Red Sushi was good. We spent about $25\/pp with tip, which I thought (again) was pricey for what we got. This would've cost me about $40\/\/pp at Sushi Taro in DC, but I wouldn't be complaining about the price.\n\nAnyways, I'd probably go back for lunch. $$-wise, though? Eh.
