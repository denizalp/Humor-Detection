The interior is outstanding! Absolutely inviting, homey, and well designed! \n\nBut, unfortunately, I have to report that the food is mediocre. I ordered the chopped salad, and it tasted a bit sour, lack of flavor...odd in flavor. \n\nGood service, perfect ambiance, heart felt neighborhood vibe, just not my preference for a meal.
