Initially, this visit started poorly, as the waiter seemed uninterested. Not wanting this visit to continue this way, we started asking questions as though we knew nothing and needed help. Well, it worked.....the service improved as he helped my father smash open his lobster with a rock. It then continued with a free cheesecake for my birthday and he made a big deal announcing it to all. He began to engage himself with us. Good recovery Joe!!! The food rates VERY high, so overall I give this visit 4 of 5 stars. \n\nI originally wrote a scalding review and I immediately received an email from the owner of Angry Crab, demonstrating his concern. This truly impressed me and I will now revisit the Mesa location. Never looking for freebies from these reviews.........I simply enjoy excellent service which I will generously tip for.
