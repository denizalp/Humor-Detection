Firkins are multiplying like bunnies all over Toronto. If you HAVE to go to one, go to this one. It's a little out of the ways (less of a crowd) and right on the water. The view of the harbor is great as you relax on the patio during a summer day, or you can people watch as people stroll up and down the main street. Beware of wind though, last time we were there it was super windy and everything required a paperweight. The food is typical pub food, all the staples are there with no surprises. An okay selection of beer, serviceable for any patio day needs.
