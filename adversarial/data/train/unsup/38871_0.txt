After trying a few different sushi spots near the Yonge & Eg area, I can say that this is my favourite. The sushi is very fresh and the staff are friendly. My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday evening and the place was very busy. Luckily we got a seat right away but others had to wait for a table. The menu had everything you could expect from a sushi restaurant and food came quickly. \n\nIf you're looking for a new sushi joint I would recommend giving this spot a try!
