Got the Groupon deal for my 2 boys ages 11 and 14 (2 hour unlimited rides and meal for 2 for $55). Went on Saturday October 31st at 5 pm. Was expecting the place to be packed but hardly anybody was there. This makes the Groupon deal even sweeter for there was virtually no wait for anything! For the next 2 hours my boys were able to do both the Go Kart Road Course and the Sprint Kart Speedway with no wait. They even rode the Tornado Twister just for the fun of it!\n\nIm so glad I got the Groupon deal because for the regular price of a 2 hour unlimited ride wrist band was $43 a person and that's without a meal! The meal itself was a small sized one topping pizza and a choice of fountain drink. The pizza itself is a decent size and was actually pretty good.\n\nSome useful info. Business hours are Monday through Friday 11 am to 9 pm. Saturday and Sunday 10 am to 9 pm. Open everyday except for Christmas. You can reserve tables to have birthday parties, corporate events, and whatever other gathering you choose. Be careful in hanging around outside observing your kids for the smell of engine exhaust can get pretty bad sometimes. I would suggest not to get the unlimited ride wristband if the place is packed for waiting in long lines basically negates your maximum riding time.\n \nIn closing, I think that this is a decent place to take your kids especially the times they are not busy.\n\nYelp 2015 Review #75\n573 overall
