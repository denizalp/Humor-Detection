I have eaten here a few times. Most recently I ate here with my family of 10 for Father's Day. I made our reservations online which was quick and easy, as well as easy to edit. We had a nice large table table\/booth. The ambience was nice. The parking lot can and has been a challenge. We were all disappointed to find out from the waitress that the restaurant was our of their Pork Porterhouse (a 14oz pork porterhouse, marinated in olive oil, garlic, rosemary and peppercorn. Stuffed with bacon and gouda cheese then topped with gouda cheese sauce. Served with mash and spicy corn) and ribs signature entrees were sold out. I always order their chicken Parmesan which is always tasty (a little pricey for the portion size). My family all enjoyed their meals as well. They also had a $6 Bloody Mary special which was a good deal considering it was 32 oz with a beef stick, string cheese, and various vegetables!
