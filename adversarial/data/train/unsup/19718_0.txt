This was our first visit to The Nosh, and we really enjoyed it. \n\nI had a breakfast sandwich that consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, and cheddar cheese on a garlic bagel. They put a lot of bacon on the sandwich. It wasn't as crispy as I prefer, but I still enjoyed it. I also had an iced coffee, which was pretty good.\n\nThe people in front of us in line seemed to have several questions, which made our wait a bit long but it also gave us a chance to really study the menu and choose which bagels we wanted so we knew exactly what we would be ordering once it was our turn. \n\nThe food took a bit longer than I would have liked, but it was a busy Saturday mid-morning, so it wasn't a big deal.
