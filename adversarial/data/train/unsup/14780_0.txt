Very impressive condo\/hotel.  The rooms are spacious and elegant.  Would I buy one to live in or as an investment?  No.....\n\nWould I recommend friends to stay here in lieu of a regular hotel room....hell yeah!\n\nI've had several friends stay here and they found great deals on Hotels.com and other online travel booking sites.  The beds are nice, the kitchenette is convenient, and some of the views are spectacular.  The view of the Cosmopolitan\/Bellagio\/Planet Hollywood is the best view I've seen in the building.\n\nIt's next door to Aria, so there's no casino in the building....you have to walk to Aria for that action.  There's also a separate valet parking area to access the hotel.\n\nWe've had drinks in the lobby bar several times.....it's a laid back bar where you can meet colleagues for business or friends for casual conversation.  Good times.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
