Fiiiiiiiiiive Starrrrrrrrrrrs, alllllllllll the wayyyyyyy UP! \nThis is my absolute favorite PHO place in Henderson, NV. Wow, I'm still dreaming about the deliciousness served in each of these deep white soup bowls. I can't stop raging to everyone I know 'bout how yummy the broth is here at Pho King! Pho broth is everything, pho broth is life after a night of partying. Pho is the only thing that brings me back to life after a night of raging and no sleep. I can't believe I've never had Pho King before, but I'm so glad I came in last Sunday, I can't wait to return for seconds, thirds, fourths...you catch my drift! \n\nI ordered the \"pick 3 combo\" Pho which was $9.95; for my meat options I chose the fatty brisket, rare beef and brisket! The ratio of meat to noodles is pretty good, I'd say 60% meat, 40% noodles and a ton of delicious broth! I can confirm that before I added anything to the broth, it already had such a rich taste...you can tell they boiled beef bones because the amount of oil, and it wasn't too salty- it was perfect! The food here is legit, I highly recommend this to all my friends! \n\n*only downfall was that when we arrived, we were told there was a 20 minute wait. Within 5 minutes of waiting two tables cleared out, but the servers didn't clear them right away so the tables stayed dirty for almost minutes. It annoyed me as I stood there slightly hungover screaming for Pho in my belly. The server dudes ended up cleaning the table - but then it took them forever to take our order. Whatever. \n\nEnd of the day, Pho King's flavorful food is what will keep me coming. The service tho, meh- their trying so that's all that matters. \n\nI can't wait to visit Pho King again, maybe I'll go tomorrow *wink
