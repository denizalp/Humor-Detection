This is the only burger place that wont let you add ANYTHING on your burger.  It def was NOT worth the price and the canned chilli on the fries looked like cat food and lacked real chilli flavor.  The service was horrible, we never got any refills or asked how the food was and our plates were only cleared because thats the only way we could sign the tab.  I guess for mall food its okay but anyone who scores this place a 5 obviously has never had a great burger.  If its something you can easily duplicate at home with no cooking skills then its def not worth $9 at a restaurant.
