Be careful with what you sign. They lied and said no cancellation fee and after telling them I wanted to cancel they continued to bill my credit card. Now I have a letter from an attorney charging me almost $200. Have them print copies out of contract before you sign anything so you can read it first. The manager is a witch. They are full of crap on what they tell you what your are signing. Go elsewhere, they are thieves
