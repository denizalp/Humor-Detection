Hands down the best candy store we've ever been to!!  First visit for me and my 12 year old son and we LOVED it!!  The store was very clean and organized with such a wide selection.  Some candies I haven't seen since I was a child like candy button and wax bottles.  My son was excited about the candy blox and candy sticks.  It was nice to be able to choose a small or large quantity of most items.  Will definitely visit again!!
