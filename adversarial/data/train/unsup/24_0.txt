Oh man guys. \n\nSo you're looking for a place to stay near Pearson International Airport? Look no further. The Woodbine Hotel & Suites- emphasis on the Suites- is really quite good. I sound like I'm being a smart ass, but I really mean it. \n\nHow did I end up here? Well, a long lost friend came to town to snuggle and make me laugh, and we decided a hotel was in order and we rolled the dice near the airport. I'm so glad we did. \n\nThe sign outside is hideous, and does not do this place justice. The rooms themselves are just as nice as any Delta I've ever been in. They all have a little fridge and a microwave and a well equipped 4 piece bathroom. The decor is minimalist, the flat screen is mounted and the wifi is really fast. \n\nPEPPER PROPS: To Hotwire, for getting us this sweet room for under $50\/night. Fitty dolla holla! \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: Why does the window in our room look into a conference room and into other rooms? Blackout curtain time.
