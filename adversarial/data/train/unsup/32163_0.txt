Home of the Ass Kickin' hot sauce brand. This is a great stop with your kids because they have donkeys and horses in the front to look at and plenty of antique farm equipment. They also have a factory store that you can go in and try samples of the products before you buy them. It is a fun little gift shop and my kids enjoyed it!
