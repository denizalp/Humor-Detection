Boo, just boo.\n\nI have called them DOZENS of times about my slow service. The latest time was after hours and I got \"Summer\" who had substandard English skills and did nothing but tell me about 6 times to restart my router. Then, I ask for her ID number and some identifying information and she says her name is \"Chris.\" \n\nSo, I am like wait a second.... and then she says her real name is Chris, Summer is her \"fake\" name.\n\nI don't know what is going on here, but WTF!?! I wish they had FIOS or something else in my area!!! GRRRRR.
