They don't even deserve 1 star. This business is shady and no one should do business with them. I called at 5pm last night to inquire about Internet prices. I was quoted a great price and ordered service. I was told it would be installed at 5:30pm the following day. After speaking with a few people who said horrible things about Century Link I changed my mind. I called 3 times to cancel the install but was put on long holds. I ended up going to the store right after work to cancel and was told that the installation was already done and that if I get a bill I'll have to call to see if the cancelation fee could be waived. I'm so furious with this company and want to warn all consumers to stay away from Century Link! They are bad business and liars!
