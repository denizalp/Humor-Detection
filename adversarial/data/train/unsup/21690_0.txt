I was a victim of that Waterdog large party massacre. 18 people took taxis from the Wynn... When we arrived the restaurant was 1\/2 empty and the manager decided to split up the group. He was a triple threat - a total liar, bad attitude and worse breath. When I told him I would Yelp about our experience - he said don't threaten me.\n\nNo threats here - there are too many good restaurants in Vegas, save your money and your taxi fare...
