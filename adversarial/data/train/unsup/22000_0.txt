This place is a bit far for me, but worth the drive for an indoor activity for sure... especially in the hot AZ summer.  I recently took my kids (4 and 6) for a party.  (They have a small private party room that worked out well for the time before and after climbing!)\n\nWe all climbed and enjoyed!  I felt the staff were friendly and the facility was safe... we even watched a safety video before getting out there.\n\nIn addition to climbing of all levels, AZ on the Rocks offers yoga and several other activities.\n\nThe parking situation is not great, but a little more exercise never hurt anyone. They have vending machines and allow outdoor food, but plan ahead for your own snacks or meals if you're heading here for more than a few hours.\n\nLook forward to returning in the future - definitely a fun place for the entire family!
