Welcome to the neighborhood, Chipotle! \n\nMy co-workers and I have been eagerly awaiting the Grand Opening for this Chipotle, just three blocks away from our office. We have a Qdoba nearby already, but we all agree that Chipotle is much better. For the past few months, we've seen the old building get torn down, a new building go up, and one day after we all wondered what was going to be there, a sign went up that said \"Chipotle, Coming Soon\". Giddy, giddy, giddy. You can imagine our excitement since all of us are fans. But that sign was mean, because it was up for over a month without any indication as to when \"soon\" was. Come on! That is just way too long to be teased, wouldn't you say?\n\nWell, the time has finally come. November 21st is the GRAND OPENING, as the sign outside now says. \n\nI did pass by today, the day before the grand opening and the inside was curiously crowded. Turns out they were having a \"training day\" for the employees, so thanks to an invitation by the greeter outside, I strolled in for a sneak preview of my - soon to be regular lunch - steak burrito bowl, tortilla on the side, with corn, tomatoes, hot salsa, sour cream, and cheese. Optional is the guac, cuz sometimes I feel like a guac, and sometimes I don't. Or rather, sometimes I feel like spending an extra $1.80, and sometimes I just don't.\n\nYay, for Chipotle! (that rhymes even tho the spelling is completely different)\n\n(Note: I will refrain from reminding myself and everyone else that you typically run yourself about 800-900 calories on a Chipotle burrito.)
