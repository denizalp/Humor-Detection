So absolutely sick of all the fake people!! No one cares if you have that flashy bag or outfit or car or whatnot (however the cars are pretty cool.) This city is filled with fake people and walking around in public places like Fashion Square or Scottsdale Quarter kind of makes you feel like you're back in high school again -- either fit in or stick out and feel the judgement. \nNot to mention it's hot as fuck out 95% of the time and there's nothing iconic besides movie theaters here. Blah! Get me out of this sweltering pretentious city!!!
