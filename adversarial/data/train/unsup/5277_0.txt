SO GOOD. The only problem i have (unrelated to 5 guys) is the parking...wtf is going on? a) there is none. b) people can't drive. wake up, look around you, stop giving drivers licenses to sleeping women dammit!! annoying. ended up parking in the underground garage and having to go through some creepy hallway to get out to the Dragon Pearl side of the street. \n\nThe burger was WOWZA. Meat is so pink and fresh, not frozen just soooooo amazing I was super impressed. \n\nDecorations - potato sacks. everywhere. tired of standing? sit on a sack. hicks all around unite. \n\nThere are no combos. For a large drink (2.39) a bacon cheeseburger (double patty, 8.99) and a reg fries (3.99) came over $17. Pretty expensive for a burger lunch but so worth it. Trust story. \n\nGET THE CAJUN FRIES!!! They're muuuch much better than regular. However, 5 guys do know how to do it right. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, absolutely delicious.\n\nTOPPINGS ARE FREE. What? Free. That's right. They have A1 sauce, mayo, lettuce, mushroom, onions, jalapenos - you name it. put everything on it! Warning though, your burger is going to fall apart. \n\nThe cheese is something else...it was the best cheese I've ever had on a burger (aside from the gorgonzola at Big Smoke). Bacon was PLENTY too. \n\nEat free peanuts while you wait :) Free refills! Free peanuts! Free toppings! Free smiles! Did I mention it's free? Cuz it's not...hello, you're paying $17 for a double cheeseburger meal. I would do it again and again and again until they banned my insatiable ass.
