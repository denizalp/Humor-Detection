I used carpet monkeys twice. First with Joe, and the second with Isaac just two days ago. Both of them were in time, and called before they arrived. Joe did an amazing job on my living room, stairs and two bedrooms. They gave me the deal that nobody would beat. After the carpets were dry I noticed that one tiny spot from luggage wheels in my bedroom didn't go away completely. Then two days ago they told me that Joe will come but for some reason I received a call from another guy Isaac. He did his job very well, the carpet dried even faster than after Joe. But there are at least three spots that wasn't gone completely in my living room. And they are pretty visible. I texted him photos of them but received no answer. That's why I give them 4 stars because my carpet still has spots that are bothering me every time I look at them.
