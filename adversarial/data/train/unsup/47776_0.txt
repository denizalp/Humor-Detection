I specifically made an appointment prior to coming because I wanted to avoid a long wait time for walk-ins. My appointment was at 11:15 am and I ended up waiting until 12:00 to be seen. I was first seen to take my vital signs then was put back in the waiting room because they were so full. I waited another 10 minutes after before being seen by the doctor. I haven't had any poor experiences with the doctors, but the organization is terrible. The front desk call service is the WORST. I called a couple times after I left the appointment due to issues with my prescription and was put on hold for at least 5 minutes each time. The longest I was put on hold was 20 minutes and it doesn't seem like anyone is going to answer despite the wait time. The staff answers \"Please hold\" without listening to what your question is so you are forced to wait for at least 5 minutes if they even get to your call. I had a terrible experience with the phone calls today so I am writing this review. The doctor experience was decent, however.
