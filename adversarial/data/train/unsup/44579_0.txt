All my life I have had issues with my digestion and regularity which has greatly affected my health including my skin, my weight and the way I feel. About 15 years ago I was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome which only magnified the issues that I was already experiencing.  I've tried everything from fiber supplements to every laxative and cleanse on the market. I went to doctors and was put on all types of medications and even had a few colonics.  I really was searching for more of a lifestyle change and didn't want to be subjected to taking a pill for the rest of my life or have to spend thousands of dollars on holistic treatments. Some would help but I never found anything that really made enough of a difference in my health and lifestyle, then I met Sara.  Meeting her was the best thing that ever happened to me because she introduced me to Seven Point 2 shakes and greens which has changed my life. In the past 3 weeks I've dropped over 6 lbs and counting. My skin looks better, I sleep at night now (for more than 4 hours like I was used to) and have more energy than I've had in a really long time.  I'm also regular, everyday, not once a week or less like I was used to.  I can't wait to start each day with a shake.  I incorporate them with the right healthy foods and snacks and I don't feel like I'm going without or depriving myself of anything.  I love the taste and finally found my solution! Sara has also been there everytime I have a question or need healthy advice.  I would recommend her to anyone who asks and even if they don't I let everybody know about what she did that has helped me to look and feel better than ever.  Thanks Sara!!
