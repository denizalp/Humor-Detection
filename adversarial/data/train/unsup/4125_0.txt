We had a little over an hour to kill before watching a movie, so we decided to check this place out since it was right next to the theaters. There was an advertisement that said they have 25 wide screen TVs. Sunday Night Football was on, so why not?\n\nWe sat down at one of the tables and waited for a while. The service was slow and they were not very busy. One of the servers finally took our drink orders and brought us menus. The husband and I decided to share the Chili Cheese Fries with bacon, which is a part of their Featured Football Items. The portion was bigger than we thought. It looked pretty good at first. Unfortunately, the fries were kind of dry. The chili and cheese tasted very bland, and the added bacon did not make it better in any way. I'm glad we didn't spend an extra $3.00 to add chicken or pork!\n\nCool place to watch your football games, but its too bad that the food was horrible. I also think they should put a sign at the entrance saying \"Please seat yourself\" since I saw a group of customers standing around and waiting for service. \n\nI miss T.G.I. Friday's.
