Dr. Sifri, Anamika, and any other staff I've come into contact with at Smart Dental are *amazing*. Like many people, I am not a big fan of the dentist. I went to Smart Dental based on good Yelp reviews (I wish Madison used Yelp more for dentists, doctors, etc.) and I was so satisfied with my experience. I've now recommended this clinic to several family members, and everyone loves them!\nDr. Sifri recommended a good doctor for my wisdom tooth removal as well.\nNo complaints! Very happy I found this dentist in Madison.
