I actually really LIKE this place. I've been here enough times to fill out a stamp card. I can't speak for the teas but their fruit slushees & smoothies are on point! When they advertise \"real fruit\", they are not lying. Whatever flavor you choose to get, it will definitely taste just like the fruit so try to choose fruits that are in season for the best flavors.
