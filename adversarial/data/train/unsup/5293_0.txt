The jewel of Vegas chocolate has a second location in the southwest part of the valley.\nThis spot from JinJu has seating to enjoy coffee, desserts, and chocolate to your stomach's content.  We've been fans since chocolatier Jin Caldwell opened up the first site at Downtown Container Park and it's fabulous to have another one out here.  \nMy favorite item to gift is the Chocolate Emergency Kit which is a steal at $20 and offers a little bit of everything including a signature chocolate bar, pretzel sticks, peppermint bark, a chocolate turtle, chocolate-covered almonds, and Fleur de Sel caramels.  \nCome here for pastry items, too, like the delectable chocolate croissant, brookie, macarons, and cakes.  Everything looks and tastes delicious.  Treat yo'self today.
