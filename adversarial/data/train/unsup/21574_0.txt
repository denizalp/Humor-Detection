Marie was very disorganized. I had eyebrows, eyeliner and lips done. There was a significant about of pain. She didn't pay attention to what I wanted and went outside the lines of my lips and only did a lip liner when I had told her I wanted full lip color. She did offer to correct it bit at my cost, not hers. I was quite dissatisfied.
