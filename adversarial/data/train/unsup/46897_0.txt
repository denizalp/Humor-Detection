This place is extremely pricey for the food. I typically have no problem paying for high prices for food, as long as it is worth it. This place, however, was not. My veggie omelet was $16 and it was something I could have made at home. Sadly, it was one of the cheaper options, which was why I ordered it. They accommodated my party of 12 but two people had to change their shirts because they had a strict dress code. No sleeveless shirts for men and no see through clothes for women. Besides the dress code, the food was average. High prices for average food. The decor, however, was really nice. One memorable dish that a friend got was the Frosted Flakes french toast. It was sweet, but still good. Overall, I probably wouldn't come here again.
