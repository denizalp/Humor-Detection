I hate needles. Hate. No seriously, HATE. So the fact that I am big fan of this place says a lot. \n\nI don't get sick very often. However, with my job it's really easy to let yourself get run down and your body finally waves the white flag. The week before Christmas I caught a terrible cold that took me down hard for three days. Day four, I called Hydrate and made an appointment. \n\nThe facility itself doesn't feel medical-like at all. What I mean by that is it relaxing, comforting, and inviting. I told the nice girl that I had been so sick and was trying to do everything in my power to get better. She recommended the hydrate wellness drip. I got set up in a chair and comfy. Now, I will say it did take three attempts to get my IV in, but that was in no way her fault. This happens to me every time I go to have blood work done and what not. It's just hard to find a vein in my arms. She handled it well and was so sweet. She brought me a coconut water and I laid in the chair doing work on my laptop. There are several different rooms to choose from pending on what you're looking for (TV, quiet, etc). \n\nThe verdict: I was sick as hell that morning. I had an event that night I had already cancelled in my head. By early evening, I felt night and day different and actually felt okay enough to go. Granted, I was still sick for a few days after, but I could definitely tell that it helped me battle the plague and shorten the duration of it. \n\nI will definitely be back when I'm feeling run down and need an immune boost. Thank you Hydrate!
