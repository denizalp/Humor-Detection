after an eight hour drive, of sleeping and dining at fast food places, we arrived in vegas, and let's just say im not feeling like i should be dressing to impress, instead im in my jeans and a sweater ... and ready to dine here! \n\nwe were definitely under dressed. the decor made me uneasy about our choice, as we walked in, people are in classy clothes, and sipping wine. Luckily the restaurant knew they wanted our business but not for us to be seen, so we got a table in its own room, curtains from above covered our table and ourselves. hooray! i feel much better about my superficial looks. then i look at the table, and this is one of the nicest table setting i've seen. the plates are gorgeous! they are of flowers, not of bold colors, but of a neutral, pastel color, more easy on the eye, and definitely felt a little sad. \n\nthe entire theme for the courses seemed to be of bugs, where the plates were dressed to resemble a bug. some palate cleansers had leaves for ears, indicating it was bug, etc. one dish that stands out was the brioche, there were 3 little pots, and out spurted brioche! they were so delightfully fluffy, and it just melted in your mouth as you ate it. *heaven*. the food left a good impression, though i cant remember what we enjoyed, it was one of the best dinner i had, and definitely an experience that i would love to share with others!
