I wasn't even planning on visiting here tonight but something just brought me here, and it was very sad to be . There are 58 trees, the first tree I came to was of a young mother. There were pictures of her bright smiling face, and pictures with her kids and her , they all looked so happy.  I looked down and there was a poster in crayon and it said I miss you mommy with hearts on it. I lost it.  I went by myself there was nobody around which was nice because I was in my own head but I really wish I would've been with somebody that could hold me and we could hold each other, I would like to make a suggestion that if you do visit bring someone with you someone that you can lean on because that poster got to me to where I could not contain the tears my heart.  You could easily spend an hour here, looking at pictures, posters, cards, letters, well wishes etc. My heart bleeds for the families that are left with the emotional pain of losing their loved one. I never felt so close to people I never knew that passed on. I would definitely  like to go back and spend more time there.  The night time brings a certain spirituality to me it was quiet the wind was softly blowing the papers and chimes were sounding. It was beautiful and sad all at the same time. Peace & Luv
