I get better service almost anywhere for shoes, not to mention better prices and larger selection. My husband bought footwear for my toddler and it didn't fit. We were well past the return time on the receipt when we finally got around to bringing it back, brand new, in box, never worn. The employee, who may have been a manager, emphasized how long past the return policy we were coming in, and stated that he wouldn't give us any more than 12 bucks as a store credit (we paid $30). We bought my husband socks with the credit and we will NEVER be back. It never hurts to treat a customer with respect and courtesy by making an exception. That's how you keep customers coming back, instead of losing them forever. Good riddance, famous footwear. We will order from Zappos or check DSW next time!
