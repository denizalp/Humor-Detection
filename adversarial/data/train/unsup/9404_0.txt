My husband and I were looking for a second car and were having a hard time getting one through the big dealerships. Equity was our last try at getting a vehicle and I am glad we made the choice. \nOur sales man Joe was great! He told us to test drive every car we would be interested in to make sure it was something we wanted. He had a great attitude about our 8 test drives especially in the hot Arizona heat. I would recommend Equity for anyone looking for a good deal on a used car. \nAsk for Joe, you won't be disappointed!
