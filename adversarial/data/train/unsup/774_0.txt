Of all the breakfast chains, VI is always my favorite. Prompt service, pleasant waiters\/waitresses, delicious food, plus pie. Can't beat pie. \nI always get breakfast, the chicken fried steak skillet is my favorite, but the new chicken-bacon-avacado hash is superb as well! \nI've been to many different locations, and always have a great experience. If you can, ask for Beth. She's super sweet!
