They're a 3 1\/4  in my book, although a seafood fan might be more impressed.\nThere was a lot of seafood to select on Saturday for lunch, which I did not try, but saw plenty of classy customers literally carrying handfulls away from the boofay.  No kidding, there were multiple people doing it -- stacking their plate so high with crab legs that they had to hold the pile in place with their free hand draped over the top while walking back to the table.  Class like that you don't find in other cities, for sure, but the West side? Sheeeeeeet..\n\nAside from the abundant shellfish, I found a moderate assortment of chicken dishes, beef ribs, and plenty of the usuals, with the addition of a neat flour shell chicken taco thing I really enjoyed.\n\nDiscard Pile~2.5\nMcKenna Novelty Factor~3.5\nGreasy \/ Crispy Spectrum~3\nNQI * ~ big fat ZERO\n               The napkins were stupid.  They were too small and way too thin with no absorbancy and no gription at all.  I don't care how much cheaper they were for the restaurant to buy than a normal napkin, I had to go through two dozen of the little shits, making a huge pile of sticky, greasy wads on the table and plate.  With ribs and crab legs, all of the customers were using at least as many as was I.  Unless they pay less than 1\/24th the price of the same number of normal napkins, they're wasting money on those little shit napkins.  Yeah, they left me pretty pioughd.\n\n* Napkin Quality indicator\nAnother ciriteria of mine for judging a boofay or other restaurant.  Cloth or paper? What kind of paper quality and thickness? How many did it take to do the job?  \nExample of 5 star NQI = India Palace has schmancy red cloth       http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/india-palace-phoenix-3#hrid:AxhJ7bqaVGG2dlAYmYPQMA\nExample of 4 star NQI = Moto has paper naps that are near-cloth consistency        http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/moto-sushi-phoenix#hrid:MeS_qbooFUkIfp_W3wccaQ
