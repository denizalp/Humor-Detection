I normally only venture here when Albertsons is out of something I need. On this particular day it was Easter Sunday and I needed marshmallow fluff. To be fair, I was already annoyed that I had to go to a second grocery store and was in a time crunch. In true Safeway fashion they had one lane open with a long line of people waiting. Evidently an express lane or self checkouts are a foreign concept here. Anyways, when it was my turn to get checked out I got to listen to the cashier (who was like 12) tell the bagger girl what an overrated holiday Easter is. Then they proceeded to discuss how hot it is to be tied up. I think Bashas is about to become my backup grocery store...
