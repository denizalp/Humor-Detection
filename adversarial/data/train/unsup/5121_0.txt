I've been duped by LivingSocial. While I'm usually quite pleased with my \"scores\", this was not a deal. In fact, it probably would have been cheaper full price elsewhere with all the upcharges and fees. The glasses included in the deal were suitable for the likes of Sarah Palin and Jeffrey Dahmer, but I like to consider myself pretty fashionable and there was only ONE pair in the whole store I would even wear. My deal included 2 pairs, so I got something decent that I'll only wear on the couch. They were also a day late and then the girl was late to open the store on Sunday morning so my husband was sitting in the mall waiting for her. Pretty sure 11am is a little late in the day to not be to work on time. Rude. I will say that the eye doctor doing the exam was very professional and nice. That's the only plus. He should take his expertise elsewhere. This place sucked.
