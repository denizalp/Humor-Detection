Am I the only one who got a bad location and went to some crapfest on Eastern? I couldn't believe the great reviews when I saw it for myself. So I went over the info with a more careful eye and checked out the website. That's when I noticed that the address listed in my Yelp app is wrong! The place I went to is where dreams go to die. I will forever be wishing that some things could be unseen. I'm headed to downtown soon, after which I will post an update.
