Perhaps it was the heavy duty alcohol induced partying or maybe I just fell in love with the beautiful view from the 18th floor. Whatever it was, the Monte Carlo was good from all that I can remember. \n\nTwo friends stood here for two weeks. So we decided to take the after party back to the room. \n\nIt is massive, beautiful, and clean. Wish I could've experienced the pool, which looked beautiful from the top. I hear they have great pool parties. \n\nThe lobby is humongous, I felt like I walked miles just to get to the elevator. The casino was dead at the time that we rolled in. Looked like a typical casino, slots, slots, slots.\n\nThe room was spacious, bright, minimal, and clean. The beds and pillows were so comfy, just what the doctor ordered to sleep off a hangover.\n\nLoved that the windows could be opened a bit even though we were high up. Most hotels do not have windows that can be opened on higher floors. Leaving only the choice of the AC, which I am not a big fan of. Having the window open came with a price... Very loud music disturbing the peace from 7am until 9am.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time at the Monte Carlo. I would definitely visit its casino the next time I am in town.
