Went here for lunch today and I have to say I wasn't very impressed. The truffle fries were just okay and I have to the cauliflower which is a House fav is very overrated. Nothing really wrong, but definitely below expectations. We then had the BBQ bison burger which was pretty good but again not memorable. I will say the carrot slaw was really tasty and what gastro pub food is all about! The MAC was super disappointing. The flavors did not go well together at all. The cobbler had the smallest bit of ice cream and blackberries are a bit tart so we weren't impressed there either. The decor is great and well thought thru.
