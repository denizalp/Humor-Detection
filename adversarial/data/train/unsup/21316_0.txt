I went there a few weeks ago... I was disappointed that they didn't have a lot in stock in flavors for zero nicotine n 6mg nicotine... I've also noticed that their juice burns in my ego-t... Using menthol is the only way I could vape without the annoying burning taste... N I clean my tanks so my ego isn't the problem... Customer service is awesome but the product isn't... Sorry...\n\nBtw, District Vape has flavors no other vape store has... I still refer people for that reason... I hope when I go back, they have more of what I'm looking for... My son likes it so I'm good...
