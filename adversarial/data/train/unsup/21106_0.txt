I'm sorry to call out Elizabeth V. below, but you are an idiot.  Soft shell crab is exactly what it sounds like-  a soft shelled crab.  Your sandwich was supposed to have a shell on the crab.  \n\nI've been to this place twice.  The best cheese curds that I have ever tasted!  They are so crunchy, but still light and fluffy.  I don't know how they pull that off.  Amazing!  Their burgers are great.  A good lean piece of beef on a pretzel bun with blue cheese from a local farm that could be a blue medal winner!
