I visit Burger Fi about every other week for lunch.  The quality is up there.  The buns are always fresh and the variety is great.  Delicious burgers!  Today, their staff went above and beyond and I feel compelled to tell the world.  I brought only a visa gift card to pay and, even though it had a balance available, there machine wouldn't take it.  I expected to walk back to work without food but they went ahead and gave it for free!  Best burger ever!  By the way, I WILL come back tomorrow and insist on paying for it.  And I can't say that this is their policy (maybe they know I visit regularly).  Regardless, 5 stars in my book.  Thanks Burger Fi!
