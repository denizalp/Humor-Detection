Multiple jacuzzis with waterfalls and a steam room big enough to raise a small family in are a welcome sight after a hard day of giving the casino all of my money. $25 gets you a day pass if you're a guest of the hotel which is well worth the price of admission. \n\nPro tip for guests: \nGo at 7pm and you'll have the whole place to yourself. \n\nPro tip for spa management:\nThis would have been 5 stars except for the lack of face wash and face cream. I would recommend allocating the part of your budget traditionally reserved for LA Looks hair gel (sorry what woman uses hair gel today?) for some bargain bucket of Cetaphil you can put in a nice plastic bottle to make uptight women like me satisfied.
