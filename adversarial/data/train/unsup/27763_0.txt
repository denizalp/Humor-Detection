From the artistic pictures of crepes and lattes that always pop up on my Instagram newsfeed, I HAD to find out what that place was.\n\nI've been to pastel three times and left satisfied each time. It's a small caf√© at finch and young with seats outside which is perfect during summer. I recommend going there on weekdays because they have a lunch special : ( savoury or desert crepes with a latte for only around 10.99+ salad ) \n\nService is always good, and the food is even better. I don't have much places to compare Pastel to, but the crepes are made so so nicely. Flavours go amazing together and you'll never have a problem with a soggy crepe.  They have large portions and the crepes always comes with a side ( salad , ice cream (!!!) etc)\nTheir lattes are also very delicious with cute latte art on them. \n\nTry it out !
