There is nothing better than authentic Mexican cuisine.  Nothing can beat it.  It is always a nice surprise to find a place that offers what you crave at that moment.\n\nI stopped in here one day so I could basically grab and go.  This place, at least to me, that is what you should do.  You can eat inside, but it's not your typical restaurant.  There is a bar like area along the wall with stools, but if you are expecting to have a full meal here comfortably, it's not going to happen.  \n\nAfter struggling with the menu, and not in a bad way, I finally made my choice on what I wanted.  I needed a burrito.  There are plenty of different types of burritos here that you can come back everyday of the week and still have a new adventure each day.  Just to be safe I asked what the tortilla was made from...flour if you are wondering.  I went with the shredded beef burrito which, if you were wondering, is much better than a ground beef burrito.  With this you get rice and pico.  Now, just so you know, this will have corn in it.  Not a problem for some of you, but it is for me as I have an allergy to it.  I even mentioned that I had this allergy when ordering.  But I suffered through it anyway.  It was that good.  I suppose you could gauge how good it was if I was going to take the risk of having to use my epi-pen.  Would I attempt this again, absolutely, but I do not advise to others.\n\nDrinks are available in both bottled and fountain variety.
