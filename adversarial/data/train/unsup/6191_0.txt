Horrible experience. I was in the worst pain I have ever had in my eye and was treated like I was stupid for coming in because of \"pink eye\" and sent away still in pain. At one point the nurse practitioner yelled at me because i was crying and she couldn't understand me. Got eyes rolled at me and everything. The pain was making me shake and feel nauseous. Her name was Helen Hayden. It felt like she was judging me and thinking i was just looking to get pain pills. i just wanted a solution and all I got was a drop to numb my eye temporarily and a statement that i just had to live with it. Still in horrible pain i went to Urgent Care the next day. Turns out I had an abrasion across my eye and thankfully found an urgent care who was willing to look into my pain and help fix the problem.
