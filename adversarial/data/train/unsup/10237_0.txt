Let me break this down on a few factors:\n\n1) menu--BIG selection of sandwiches.  Almost too much.  They definitely have something for everyone...good luck trying to figure out which one to go with.\n\n2) food--mediocre.  The sandwhich wasn't bad but it wasn't good enough to differentiate from the other sandwhich shops. The portion was huge...so you definitely get you $ worth.  However, the overall sandwhich was lacking not.  I had the Reuben and it was drenched in 1000 dressing.  Way too much...need to wipe some off.  \n\n3) service--just ok.  Being the new shop in town you generally get over the top service initially...the good ones sustain it.\n\n4) restaurant--typical deli layout; however, if I owned the place I would have a conversation with the contractor.  Finishes didn't match, woodwork not flush, drain in the middle of the dining area?\n\nUnfortunately,  probably will stick to one of the many other options in Gilbert\/Chandler area.
