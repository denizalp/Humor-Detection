I recently bought a CPO X5 from  BMW of LV and had a terrific experience. I generally HATE the car buying process but these guys made it  really enjoyable. I did my research before I went so I knew what my trade and the BMW were worth. They gave me a great  \"no Haggle\"  deal with no pressure.Steve Broka was very friendly and gave me tons of info on my new car before I left.
