This is just your upgraded typical local bar. I really liked the fact that they have a long happy hour, 4 PM to 7 PM discounts on drinks and half off appetizers. But the best thing is the fact that they carry a large selection of beers, 250 to be exact. \nThe atmosphere is pretty laid back. They have an outside patio with games like beer pong, jenga and bags. \nFood wise you will find normal bar food. There was nothing extraordinary except for the loaded fries! You can never go wrong with that! \nI'm glad to finally see a cool bar in the summerlin area. Good prices and good atmosphere.
