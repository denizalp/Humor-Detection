If I could give this place more than five stars I would. The first time I came here I sat at the counter and asked my server, Kelli, for some unsweet tea and the sausage gray biscuits (which were fantastic). On my second trip, five weeks later, I again sat at the counter. Kelli walks up and says \"Unsweet tea again?\". When I replied \"Yes\" she asks, \"You want to try something new or go with the sausage gravy and biscuits again?\". That is absolutely crazy that she could remember an order from a single customer five weeks later, especially after only one visit. Since then I've been going with my girlfriend, so we sit at a table. Our waitress has always been Randi and she is absolutely amazing. Do yourself a favor and ask for her by name. \n     As for the food, outside of the Cincy chilli, everything I've had has been outstanding. Fresh, hot and large portions; what's not to love. To me, the food at Egg Works is pretty much the gold standard by which other breakfast places are measured. In terms of service, Egg Works is the gold standard by which ALL places are measured.
