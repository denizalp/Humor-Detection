I walked in ordered a daily special. It was pastrami day. Super hungry, I was asked if mustard, pickle, and cheese were good (so I WAS given an option). I said yes and I would like lettuce, tomato, and mayo. They said No!!! Lol\nI'm still laughing. I asked why and two employees said it's just the way the owners want it. I'm a paying customer consuming this food. I want lettuce tomato and mayo. Employee said it was their store and their recipe.  WOW, I'm insulted. But hey, there are other sandwich shops that don't mind if you put \"A1 on their steaks\". \nSUPER LAME ATITUDES.\nMoving on.....
