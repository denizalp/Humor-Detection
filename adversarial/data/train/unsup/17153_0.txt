Since there are no cracker barrels in CA, I must stop at one if I'm in an area that have them. To my surprise, AZ has an abundance of cracker barrels. This location is very clean. Our server was very friendly. I love the country store area where you can find knick knacks of all sorts. Get the hash brown casserole!
