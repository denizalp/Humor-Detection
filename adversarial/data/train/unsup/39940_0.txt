Need a last minute interesting gift? Looking for something out of the ordinary? Whether you are outfitting a room or going to a gift exchange you will find something here to satisfy. It's kind of a warehouse type shopping experience, no fancy displays or pressure point personnel, just shelves and shelves of interesting stuff. Sometimes awesome prices; sometimes average. I just got a couple of hammered silver Moscow Mule mugs here for $9\/each. Also beautiful and interesting gift\/hat boxes to either give alone or put something in...all under $10. Stumped on what to get someone?  Try out this place for some inspiration!
