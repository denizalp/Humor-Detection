I love pizza!\n\nAfter reading all of the reviews, my husband and I decided to place an order for delivery today!\n\nWe ordered a large pepperoni pizza, half with sausage & pepperoni.  It was delivered within 35 minutes to our house.  (-1 star: $3 delivery fee.)\n\nThe crust was a perfect combo of chewy and sturdy and yummy.  The sauce isn't too acidic (my husband gets acid reflux like crazy) and it didn't affect him at all.\n\nWe will order from here again, b\/c they deliver good quality pizza.\n\nNow excuse me while I go inhale another piece of pizza...\n\n-UPDATE:\nSo I just updated this because after eating the pizza, you feel ok.  Then about 30 minutes later you realize you just ate the greasiest pizza ever and and you want to hurl.  I'll pass next time if someone wants me to eat Biaggio's pizza.
