Sometimes the smartest thing you can do for your stomach is give it a rest from all that buffet action In Las Vegas. That's where Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant comes into play.........\n\nLooking for something light???? May I suggest the shrimp\/pork won ton mein over here. \nUmmmmm, a very light broth, with a few won ton dumplings, Chinese choi sum, & a very thin noodle. Just the right thing to keep you going, especially since I've been up for almost two days straight (man, am I tired!).\n\nLooks like this small restaurant has a little take out \"to go\" section, and they even make their own roast pork, and roast duck.\n\nI can see that Sam Woo's has won many awards in the past. The last was a Zaget award back in year 2012.\n\nLots of parking in the strip mall, service was fast.........but when you go during off hours, it shouldn't be a problem correct?
