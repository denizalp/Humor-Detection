This is the BEST chick fil a, yes they all have great customer service but I was blown away by the staff here. They went above and beyond to help me when I came in with my baby. The staff was friendly and got me everything I needed without asking, they apologized numerous times that it took my food a little longer than normal to come out and gave me a coupon o make up for it. After a little accident in the play area they promptly brought a band aid and a little stuffed animal to make the little one feel better, and enough for all the kids around so no one was left out. I feel like you don't even get his good of customer service sometimes at a high end restaurant. \n\nMoms this is such a kids friendly location and they were even rated the cleanest for germs. So impressed by everything, can't wait to come back.
