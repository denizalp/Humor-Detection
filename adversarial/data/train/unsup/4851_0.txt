I feel pretty safe in Las Vegas and a big reason for that is LVMP, here's why:\n\n- They're pretty fast to respond.  The few times I've had to call them, they were there within minutes.\n\n- They're thorough with their reports.  They ask the right questions and make sure they get your version of the story right when you file a complaint with them.\n\n- They care about the community.  There has been many times where I've seen them advise people rather than arrest or cite them when it's a minor civil argument or misunderstanding.  They do so in a calm manner....it only gets ugly when the people involved become disrespectful.\n\nThe only complaint I have about them is that they have way too many speed traps.  I'd rather see them spend more time getting rid of the gangbangers and taggers that have come to Vegas from other cities.\n\nOverall, I think they do a great job and don't get recognized as often as they should from the community.  Thanks Metro for keeping our city safe!
