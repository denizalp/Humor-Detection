We took our daughter here for her 6th Birthday, she  asked for a fun Mexican type restaurant. Glad we picked Diego Pops, our server Skyler made our birthday girl feel special and provided great service. The food was great, variety of tacos, best chips and Brussel sprout nachos are a must try. Great energy, design and the patio was perfect even in the heat. Thank you for a great family night, we will return as our girls are now in love with Choco Tacos!
