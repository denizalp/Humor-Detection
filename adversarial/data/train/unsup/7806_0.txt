My favorite Cupcake Shop. The Kir Royale is my absolute favorite (Raspberry cupcake with champagne flavored icing.  Delicious and very original. \nThe Southern Belle is also a very good red velvet cupcake. This is my standby if I'm not sure what flavor to get someone.\n\nThe Grasshopper is pretty good - kind of like a girl scout cookie, and Strawberry lemonade is pretty self explanatory. My niece really likes it. Carrot cake cake pops were also really good. So far I haven't had a bad cupcake from here. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend contacting them to put a photo on an order of cupcakes. It's such a cute idea. We've done it a few times for a friends birthday and it always comes out really cute.
