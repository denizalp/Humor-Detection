As an out-of-towner, I really appreciated the down-to-earth atmosphere at Putter's.  My great uncle took me here and it was clear that he has been here often with the VIP treatment we received.  \n\nAnd as my uncle had mentioned months earlier, they do have fantastic wings.  You can order them \"charred,\" and they make up the wings, and then finish them off with a searing on the grill.  It makes for the most moist, and crispy outside wing that you have ever tasted.  They come in teriyaki and original buffalo, and we had two bowls of about 40 wings for the 4 of us.  \n\nTheir salads are HUGE.  From the house salad to the chef salad, they are impressive.  The clam chowder, as the soup of the day, was excellent too.\n\nThe beer and drink prices are normal here compared to the strip.  You would need a taxi or other car to get there if you are staying at the strip, but it is a nice change from the overpriced drinks and hit-or-miss food choices on the strip.\n\nSo now I can officially say Putter's is my favorite wings place in Las Vegas!
