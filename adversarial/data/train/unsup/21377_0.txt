Ordered the Bacon Burger medium with the horseradish on the side. It came well done and no horseradish. Generic ketchup that wasn't opened before given to us.\n\nBartender never came back to check if everything was ok. After getting the bill, took forever to come get my card.\n\nThe best part was the cold beer in the frosted mugs (the only reason they're getting any stars).
