This review is long over due. I have taken a couple of classes so far and this was exactly what I had in mind. The instructors are supportive something that was lacking when I tried other pilate studios. I felt a difference just after my 1st class. If you are looking for an awesome workout, I highly suggest you try Club Pilates. \n\nThe equipment is clean and wonderful and the staff is helpful!
