KOREAN. MEAT. ORGY.\n\nAs I write this, I am in a state of carnivore bliss, having stuffed myself silly with delicious korean BBQ (artfully cooked by none other than moi, if I do say so myself). I've been to a lot of Korean BBQ joints, and although Korean BBQ House lacks a little of the authenticity that your typical mom-n-pop shop might have (what? no poster with cute K-girl holding a bottle of Hite taped over the cash register?), the food and service here is right on. \n\nWe ordered the Dinner for Two ($44.99), which included generous portions of bulgogi and kalbi, along with chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops, and salmon. Of course, there was soup and the usual banchan (kimchee, bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, pickled radish and marinated tofu), rice, and fresh vegetables. It's a LOT of food. They really should call that \"Dinner For Two if You Are Really Really Motherf'ing Hungry Or Are Training To Be Competitive Eaters,\" because even despite our ravenous appetites we couldn't finish it all. Let's just say that by the time we were about 75% done, I was getting the Meat Sweats, and leave it at that. The only thing snooze-worthy was the salmon (not bad, per se, but nothing special.)\n\nThe service was stellar during my artery clog-fest. My drink was refilled promptly, and they even brought out additional banchan when our little bowls were empty. The only thing that was lacking were the number of napkins, but if you don't eat like an feral child (like I do), you should be fine. The ventilation system in this place is top notch; it's nice to eat Korean BBQ and not smell like a grill house yourself for the rest of the evening! \n\nOne tip: arrive early, this place gets crowded. We got there at around 6:30 on a Friday night; when we left at around 7:40, we noticed that tables were beginning to be in short supply. \n\nMmmmmeat. Me likey.
