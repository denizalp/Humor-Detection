Such a cozy warm welcoming little coffee shop. Not expensive at all compared to Starbucks! The espresso was a good one and the hot chocolate was a regular hot chocolate which tasted like hot chocolate! But the fun part is the little detail! Decors! Little bit of chocolate sprinkles forming hearts, floating above the foamy hot chocolate. How can you not have a smile on your face while drinking your cup??? If you're looking for fancy stuff, go elsewhere. But if you're looking for good drinks and simple snacks at a low price range, then you've come to the right place!\n\nBeware! There are not that many seats, so if you come during exam seasons, good luck!
