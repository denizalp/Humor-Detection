If you're looking for discount merchandise that feels like luxury, this store is your best bet. Yes, there are competitors, but this store always has something I love at incredible prices!\n\nThe store is clean, well stocked and always has amazing name brands. The only problem I have is that there aren't always enough in my size, but I understand why. \n\nYou can find anything in this store, and I do mean anything. From picture frames, to kitchen tools, to decorative pillows, baby clothes\/shoes, anything for your decor, rugs, lamps, you name it! It's like a mini-Macy's in this place!\n\nThe employees here, also, are fabulous. Helpful and always ask how I'm doing. I really enjoy being in stores where people actually like their job. That's becoming more rare (but not here!). The manager is also spectacular. I see him all the time when I shop here. He doesn't just sit in an office lording over everyone. If it's busy he opens up a register and stars moving the line forward. He's also always so cheerful, I love seeing him! He even offered me a discount on a sweater with a miniscule snag (that I probably did) and I didn't even ask! Nice guy!\n\nI love this store. I'm always surprised by the rotation of clothes, I can go once a week and find a ton of new things. You should stop by here, the things they have are quality!
