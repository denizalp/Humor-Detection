This store is the most wonderful consignment boutique I've ever been too.  They have amazing clothes for really good prices.  Selection varies, as the store is very small but what earns it the five stars is Nicole the owner who is extremely dedicated to her boutique and is so friendly and always fun to chat with.  She makes everyone feel like they've been good friends for a long time.  It's always a good excuse to stop by because she always has new excellent stuff coming in!!
