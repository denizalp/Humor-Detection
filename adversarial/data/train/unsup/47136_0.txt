First off, Bookmans is definitely better than Barnes And Noble, this much is for sure. But as a former Flagstaffian, the Bookmans in Phoenix is nowhere near as plentiful and varied in content matter as is the Flagstaff Location...nor does it have a cafe, which is a must for a bookstore I feel. Furthermore, the trade credit dollars given have shrunk in comparison to the rise in the price of books on the shelves anymore. I understand that this is a business needing to make money to sustain, but sometimes it feels like I am being ripped off on both ends of the spectrum. Furthermore, there are several items I have purchased and then been told, not even one month later (and upon losing the receipts so just trying to take the item back for a lesser amount in trade credit) that they are not interested in rebuying from me. I wish there was some way the Bookman stores would intertrade stock, so that the same books are not always on the shelves. I rarely find a science book that is unique to the stock on hand anymore, and only go in maybe once a month if that. I wish there were more used bookstores in the area of Bookmans, because if anything it would force them to stay more honest and competitive..versus the monopoly it holds on the surrounding area which results many times in a more lackluster brand of service and selection because it can.
