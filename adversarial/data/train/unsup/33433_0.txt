Horrible work. Left work materials and white powder inside the car and all over the door jam, carpet, and seat. Left new damage to the quarter panel and other white pasty slop on outside adjacent areas. Didn't have loaner cars as advertised. Won't be back.\n\nUpdate to the above. This shop also repainted one of our doors during this repair. The paint on that door is now starting to fade due to I guess the stress being put on it from an automatic car wash. I would think that when  a normal shop would repaint, that it would stand up to a normal automatic car wash. Also I noticed that evidently Ben has left this facility and when I went in a gentleman named Kenny was in charge. This might have something to do with the quality of the work changing at that location in my opinion.
