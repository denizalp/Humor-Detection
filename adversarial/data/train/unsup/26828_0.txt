Great experience! Just bought my first house by myself and was tight on budget yet wanted someone professional since I am by myself. There is a two hour minimum for services which is common so I decided to move as much as I could from my upstairs apartment to my house in my two door civic... Needless to say, I couldn't move much in the 8+ trips I made... I mentioned to the guys that I was tight on budget and was trying to stay within the 2 hour mark so I wanted just the furniture moved but watching how quick and careful they were, I had them move a lot more than just furniture. Definitely took a little more than the two hours but they only charged me for two. Awesome customer service and definitely made accommodations for my situation. Would recommend them to anyone in the Vegas area!
