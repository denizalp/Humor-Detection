This is my third time going there and like baseball three strikes your out. Let me explain this further. The food is good the sashimi is even great, but even if the food is great and the service lacks then you don't want to go back. \n\nSo when I went the first time and was very disappointed with the service I figured everyone deserves a second chance so we returned a second time. The second time same thing food was good service was horrible. \n\nI decided to give them one more chance since because we live in Oakville ( by the way the Vaughn location is the best go there good food and good service) same thing good food horrible service and very negligent. \n\nSo this is the last time the ever see me there. One more thing the manager there is rude and has poor manners. How can a restaurant's service be any good if the manger himself has poor customer service. I told him that our waiter left us without coming back for 12 mins yes I actually times it and he didn't even say anything when I complained to him. \n\nBottoms line they lost me as a client is rather take a drive up to Vaughan
