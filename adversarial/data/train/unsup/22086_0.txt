I am so sick of American Airlines in Cleveland. When we arrive, it is a minimum 30 minute wait for luggage. Every time. And when the bags come out, there is no priority given to Priority luggage. Now we're about to leave and some clown comes on the plane and says \"Oh sorry. We don't have any meals for you.\" Why do you charge so much for 1st class if you can only provide 2nd class service in Cleveland?
