My girlfriend and I live in southern Utah, where if you have been here or have lived here, getting a good buzz on is a struggle. \n\nBetween the both of us, if we poured out all the weak ass margaritas, watered down cocktails, martinis that are teentee and not even worth ordering, and 3.2% alcohol Bud Light we ever had here, it would be enough to overflow the Hoover Dam. *SIGH* \n\nWe love drinkin. And lucky for us, Vegas is near. \n\nWe like bein fancy, or at least pretending we are. That's why we love this place. It's real fuckin pretty. The gigantic chandelier that this 3 story bar is located in is exquisite. We stayed at casino level, to people watch.  \n\nOur waitress was also real freakin pretty, and helpful. She assisted us in picking our poisons. I did have the Verbena, which was a trip! I don't recommend swallowing that bud... it made my stomach go \"no\" and I got a strong gut! But the drink was really good. I also had that and a pink one they made with gin that had a liquor soaked berry at the bottom. My girl had 2 of those. On a scale, we were on the drunker side of buzzed when we left here. The looks on our face were similar to this...  :)\n\nWe ended up spending about 50 bucks a piece, but agreed it was worth it. Having some bonding time with good service in a pretty place with hot young people walking around, (with the exception of those in swimwear coming from the beach club, mucking up my scenery!) drinkin yummy, fancy drinks. Yeah, we'll be back. They have a lot of interesting and unique specialty drinks to try!\n\nI love the Chandelier bar because it gives you a one of a kind experience with one of a kind cocktails. Also, makes you feel like a fancy bitch. \n\nFinal tip! If you are a man, take a woman here on a date. You will get some. You're welcome.
