Cool spot tucked away on Palmer Street. They have a great beer selection, as well as wine and cocktails. They have a bunch of fun games and most are free to play. Pinball, air hockey, and skee ball are the only ones that are a low fee, $.50 for pinball and $1.00 for air hockey. All very reasonable. Makes for a great night out!
