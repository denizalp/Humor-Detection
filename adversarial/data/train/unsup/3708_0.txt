We just pulled up to the drive thru to order. The lady taking the order had a really rude tone. It really shows in her voice that she was not having it. The way she was taking the order made it seem like she wants you to tell her your whole order right away. The man at the pick up window was looking and scrolling through his phone while waiting for our payment. So. Very. Unprofessional. When giving our order he did not say thank you at all. All he said was here and then turned around and left. It seems like the workers do not care about their job at all. I know everyone at McDonald's only work their because they need money and not because they like it but hey, at least say hi and thank you to the customers. Honestly there are more people out there who would be doing a better job. But hey, at least they gave 4 sauces for 10 pc meal.
