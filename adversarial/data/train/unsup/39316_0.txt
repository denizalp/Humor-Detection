Hooray- a terrific Ethiopian restaurant close to my home.  The friendliest owner.  Get either veg or non-veg \"feast\" for a sampling of food.  The chicken that comes with the non-veg platter is delicious, so is the beef (you can choose one).  The beef has a bit of heat, the chicken dish is child-friendly.   Get the Shiro- a creamy red lentil stew.  It is luxurious.  The non-veg feast plus the shiro is enough for 3-4 people.\nGood Ethiopian food takes a little time.  Don't wait until you're starving to get there, it will take 15-20 minutes for your food to come out.
