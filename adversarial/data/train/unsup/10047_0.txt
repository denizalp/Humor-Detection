I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We came here and ordered a full meal and then ordered their featured pommie slushies and they were disgusting to put it mildly. I pretty much never send anything back but this was exceptionally horrible so I felt compelled to escalate. Long story short the waiter had to get the manager over and she refused to take the item off of our bill... Really dude? At least take it off the bill of your patrons can't drink it. I'd give this place 0 stars, hope it was worth the the $5 of overhead brew works.
