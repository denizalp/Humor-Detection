So my insurance insisted I come back here to get my bumper fixed. Everything seemed fine until i get pulled over by a cop AND HE SEARCHED MY ENTIRE CAR WITH FOUR COPS be I didn't have a front license plate. These fucking idiots fixed my car and didn't put the plate back on. It's ILLEGAL not to have a front plate. I called back they said they'd call me back. Nope. Called back the next day and they just pretty much said we don't have it (where the fuck did it go??) and you can go buy another one.\n\nGreat customer service.
