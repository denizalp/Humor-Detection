My friend and I wanted to do a quick brunch before leaving Vegas and came across this creperie. A little tucked away but so cute and fits well into the Paris theme. \n\nSo this place serves some of the best crepes I have ever tried! I had the roasted chicken crepe (ask for extra pesto ) and my friend got the breakfast crepe. Mine was cooked perfectly! There were so many different flavor a going on and the pesto added the perfect touch to this already rich crepe. My friends crepe was OK (why she kept stealing mine hehe) \n\nI would've given this place five stars except service was not good. The lady at the register seemed irritated and was not polite. I think maybe eating one of these delicious sweet crepes may help her.
