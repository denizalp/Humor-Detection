When insurance required us to go to cvs this location was right near the vue making it very close to us. Walking there was terrible as you had to pass homeless people panhandling you and they would hang outside asking for money outside the store. The store should have really called police to enforce the city ordinance which profits them from panhandling so close to businesses, ATM machines or restaurants entrances. They did take away the picnic table so they may have been less inclined to stick around too long. Still, felt unsafe walking and utilized the drive through, keeping windows rolled up when waiting.
