There is some terrific value to be had at the newest neighborhood Japanese restaurant!  They do a good job covering all the izakaya bases and I was pleasantly surprised.  \n\nRight off the bat, order the yakitori before deciding on the rest of the meal.  They take a bit of time and the skewers arrive at the table kind of haphazardly.  Standouts were bacon scallop with salt ($2.50), pork belly with sauce ($2.25) and chicken skin with salt ($2.25), the latter not being for everyone (or anyone else at the table), but damn good. \n\nAlthough they offer many popular LV AYCE type sushi rolls, the best bet would be the \"Sashimi Combo\", which features 18 pretty thick cuts at $29.95 (tuna, salmon, tuna tataki, octopus, scallop and yellowtail) or if it's just two people, share the \"Chirashi Don\" with 12 pieces of sashimi on sushi rice.  Both of these beat the heck out of anything with imitation crab or spicy fish.    \n         \nThe \"Hamachi Kama\" was my favorite item of the night.  At only $8.95, it was everything I had hoped for with a delightfully crisp outer skin and juicy, meaty center.  This should be ordered pretty soon as well since there is limited supply of these per day.  They did run out of \"Salmon Kama\", but more than made up for it with stellar pieces of grilled salmon belly instead.\n\nLunch specials and ramen look interesting and will be items I'll definitely try soon.  I also can't wait until they get a liquor license for a more complete meal.  \n\n3.7721839472674763 stars!
