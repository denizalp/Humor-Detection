We brought some out of town guests for lunch on New Years day.  When our waitress came to our table my husband started to ask if they had a nutrition guide for their kids menu.  Before he could finish she curtly said \"No\". He politely finished his sentence, explaining that our 7 year was diabetic and we needed the information to calculate her insulin.  She then said, just as rudely \"still no, do you want to place your drink orders?\" We did stay, but only because we brought people and we felt bad.  The service did not improve and it took a very long time to receive our food even though the restaurant was not busy.  I'm sorry, I don't care how good your food is.  It does not make up for poor customer service.
