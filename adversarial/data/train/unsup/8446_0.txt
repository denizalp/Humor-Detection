The Buffet inside Wynn is an amazing selection for vegetarian or anyone with a diet restriction. When you enter, you can advise your host of your restriction. \n\nChef Stephen walked us through the buffet and went through each of the dishes. The Buffet also offered imitation beef tacos for lunch, so always ask!\n\nThe lunch menu isn't as fancy as others with their selection, but the quality is there. I love the new interior; so open and bright! Service is great with the exception of the sassy taco cook. Overall, I am a fan and would definitley come back!
