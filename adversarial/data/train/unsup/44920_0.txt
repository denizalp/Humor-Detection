This place was awesome!! I have been looking for a good pad tai place for awhile & have found it!! I ordered the traditional pad tai dish with chicken, shrimp, scallions and peanuts.  It was delicious and not too spicy! I also ordered jasmine rice, which I have had before elsewhere and have loved, but the jasmine rice didn't have much taste at this particular restaurant.  I couldn't taste the jasmine.\nI went with a friend and we ordered plum wine, which was very sweet & tasty! It was a nice compliment to the pad tai dish.  Overall, this was a wonderful dinner experience, and I will most definitely return!!
