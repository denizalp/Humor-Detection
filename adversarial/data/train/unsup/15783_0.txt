\"This place is so under-rated.\"  These are the exact words from my 14 years old niece.  \n\nToppings serves American pub style pizzas. We ordered take out of a large Canadian pizza, regular crust, and one pound of chicken wings to feed two teenagers and two adults.  We enjoyed the pizza very much.  The dough was just right: not too thick or thin.  The texture was slightly chewy and the rim was crusty.  It tasted good, too.  The toppings were all over to about 1cm from the rim.  The pizza sauce was delicious, so was the bacon.  The chicken wings didn't look so good, yet they tasted great.  There were 10 wings in a pound, so the portion was good.\n\nThough not \"authentic\" Italian style, the pizza was good for what it intended to be.  One large pizza and one pound of wings was a good portion for 4 people.  The total bill with tax was $30.
