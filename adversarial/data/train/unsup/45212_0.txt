I was in there on a Sunday afternoon. There was no one in there, but this won't affect my rating. I think this place deserves more customers. It would help if the decor was more creative... It lacks a bit of character or something.  But the food is good and the staff person was super nice. It was fun to be on the patio, although a bit busy for me (it's on St-Denis...). I had a Brussels waffle with salty caramel on top with a macchiato. The waffle was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, delicious. The price was very decent.  I plan to go back to try the Liege waffles and the crepes.
