PARENTS BEWARE:  A week ago, after I posted my review of Sky High, Nick H. sent me a private message that said all of his friends work there. He told me to F-off multiple times, called me every name in the book multiple times, and told me I should sodomize myself with a bully club and slit my own wrists.  I don't know how old Nick is, but in his review, he indicates that has children of his own, which is an even scarier thought.  We had a terrible experience and people should be able to express their views freely without being threatened.  That's the point of Yelp.  At any rate, as a parent, I sure would not want my children--or anyone else I know--hanging out in a place with such unstable people.  Good to know. Poor Nick.
