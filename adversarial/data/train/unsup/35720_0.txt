Clean efficient friendly accurate service with clear explanations, set expectations, and honesty all around. It was so easy and the doctor and hygienist Carolyn are phenomenal. It took me 10 years to start going to the dentist and I don't think twice about canceling my appts here. My teeth feel great! This place is top notch and effortless- all I have to do is smile!
