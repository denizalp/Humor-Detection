Decided to try this place when Partner was craving something spicy for dinner. I had only ever had Tibetan cuisine once before, at another restaurant on the same strip, and had loved it. This place was amazing: small enough to be cozy, but not hipsterish enough to be crowded. You can actually hear your conversation partner(s)! \n\nThe hot \"sauce\" (more of a spice mix) on the table was dead serious. Partner said it was \"like voting for Obama and getting Al Sharpton.\" Definitely wait for your drink to arrive before tasting it.\n\nI had the crispy cauliflower (a must-try) and veggie momos (delish with sriracha and soy sauce). Partner got something with beef in it, which he loved; however there is a plethora of vegetarian options at this place.\n\nPartner finished with some Tibetan tea, made with butter. He loved it, but I wasn't interested.\n\nService here was polite and prompt. I'd certainly go again, and bring a friend.\n\nOnly caveat is that there is a shrine to the Dalai Lama in one corner, which would make me hesitant to bring a super-religious person here.  That being said, I will certainly come back.
