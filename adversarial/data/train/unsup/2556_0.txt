Inspire courts is nothing but an elite facility in the state of Arizona. There is nothing but high quality work done in that gym. Along with that, there are plenty of courts to use and the events are always highly organized. They have a concession stand that supplies plenty of snacks and drinks for there all day tournaments. Its a real positive game changer for future athletes, if you haven't already visited this facility I highly recommend it.
