The worst website I've ever encountered. They don't charge you all at once and will send you threatening email to get more money back indicating it was not a fine print but it will charge you after you purchase your tickets months later! DONT FALL FOR THIS SCAM  SITE!!!!! Even if kayak refer you to that site, just don't go there. It's a scam. They threaten to blacklist you on flight list and report you for credit report. I felt so uncomfortable, even if the amount they're asking for is very little (28 cad), it's the principle that I am sticking by. It's just upsetting. I will never use this website nor kayak. I'd rather pay more for other sites for a peace of mind.
