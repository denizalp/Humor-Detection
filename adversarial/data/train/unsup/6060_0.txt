To me this is the best sushi place on the Eastside of las vegas.  More important when I have a sushi craving it's not far from where I live.  Upon entering, the employees are there to greet you and as you leave it's almost like they are greeting you again as weird as it sounds.  One thing I love about this location is that it's open until 11 pm.  It's definitely not fast food but It's made and cooked pretty quick.  \n\nI love going here at night because of the ambience and the atmosphere.  It's dark but not too dark and it's perfect for casual conversation.  I love the teriyaki chicken with salad.  Nice healthy meal  I've been during the all you can eat sushi and left stuffed.  Service is very fast even if it's busy.  I can honestly say I haven't nada bad experience there and love going when I can carve out the time.
