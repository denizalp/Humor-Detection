Nice theater here in Phoenix...got to see, \"Bad Times at the El Royale.\" Good movie so you should see the movie.  \n\nTheater has reclining, reserved seating with plenty room so you don't bug your neighbor but close enough to hold hands with your girl .  \n\nPlenty snacks for purchase and adult beverages are available aswell.  There is a seating area near the bar for about 20 people  (including bar area). You can hangout there before\/after your movie.\n\nEverything was clean and customer service really good with employees greeting you when you leave theater.  Oh, almost forgot, if you save your drink cups and popcorn bags, you can refill the same for discount on your next visit.\n\nI will see movie here again next time in Phoenix.
