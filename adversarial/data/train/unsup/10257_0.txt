I want to shove your fishliciousness in my face.  You are delectable.\n\nSome friends brought me here for the first time and I thought I'd never meet the AYCE $29.95 volume for the price, but I was totally wrong.  It's worth it, too. Everything on the menu is included, so you linger with friends, order as your'e ready for it and stuff yourself until you grow gills.\n\nI've been 3 times now, twice with the original friends who brought me and then I brought my BFF from out of town, who also loved it.  \n\nMy faves: Lemon Roll (FOREVER!), Jala Jala roll and Yebinsu. I also love the Super White Tuna. And the salmon belly, when they have it.\n\nBasically, everything is awesome. Beware the 9-1-1 roll unless you have an iron-clad palette. Your taste buds will both love and hate you. \n\nThe service is great, the patrons friendly (and mostly japanese, which told me right away that this place was going to be good) and their matcha iced green tea will keep you up for 4 days. Drink lots, kids.\n\nI already want to go again. Can we go again?
