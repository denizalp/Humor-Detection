the enterence fee is now $24 per person. It isnt at all what I expected. Dull and boring. I could have taken the kids to Kidsport on dixie and got better value for my money and its cheaper!!!\n\nOn the website thwy make you think the food is made here like at the Science Center but its not. It's prepacked food that you would find at a gas station. At least the gas station is cheaper priced.\n\nIf your going to come here eat a big breakfast or keep snacks on you. They dont check your bags or stop you from eating it once your inside. \n\nAnd if you do buy food here expect it to be bad tasting. \n\nOverall save your money and go to Kidsports. at least the food is made for you....
