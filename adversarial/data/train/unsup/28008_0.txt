Yes, Mandalay Bay is kind of off on it's own geographically speaking, but I loved staying here at The Hotel.   We had a very nice suite for the weekend and both thought it was great.   Down points are that much of the furniture and decor appeared to be dinged up and in need of some TLC.   Other than that, the staff is beyond helpful and all of the options in terms of restaurants, bars, and the casino are great.
