This place was great... around maybe summer 2015? But after that it's just a giant disappointment. While staff is ALWAYS friendly, (two stars because I do appreciate a friendly staff), and the prices are very fair, the majority of the recommendations I received were unnecessary. \n\nI had been in like clock work, once every month for routine maintenance (tires, oil change, air filter, CV-boot, etc.) I had mentioned in one of the earlier appointments that my brakes were squeaking. After they looked, I was told that it wasn't anything to worry about... Well come to find out, multiple visits later, my brakes were definitely worn down.... all the way through to the point where I had to not only replace the brakes, but the rotors also- doubling the price. I would have thought they'd mentioned it the FOUR\/FIVE previous times I'd been in the shop maybe?? Instead had to pay for rotors that would have been fine if I'd been told it was indeed the brakes needing to be replaced. No, no I was quoted for needing new struts simply because they were the \"original parts,\" (which I'd been told multiple times by this location AND by the Tatum location that I \"needed\" even back in 2014) among other random services. Really? I can tell when a strut goes out, not exactly something you wouldn't notice. Of course, EVERY time I pointed out that I did NOT need new struts, the service person I spoke with would just brush it off like they were \"just putting it there for later\" ... Are you trying to bait me into this service because you don't think I know what a strut is?! \n\nI thought I'd found a gem, but instead just another shop trying to oversell me while ignoring an actual problem. So disappointed. I'm MORE than happy to pay for work actually needs to be done. Will look elsewhere to have my 2010 Corolla and her still-working, original struts taken care of.
