This place is both a dinner place, and somewhere to go for dancing and mingling on the weekend. My review is a dinner review.\n\nI came here last night (Wednesday). We started with a few drinks at the bar for their Wednesday Night Happy Hour. ($5.00 glass of wine and half price appetizers until 6:30pm). \n\nThe appetizer we ordered was delicious, brie dip served with an assortment of vegetables, fruit, bread and waffles (complete with syrup). I would highly recommend the dish. It was perfect for sharing and a very generous portion. \n\nAfter an hour of sipping wine and munching on our appetizer we moved to the dining room for dinner. The booth we were put in was right by the window and felt very private with backs that went all the way to the ceiling. \n\nBetween the two of us we ordered the Schnitzel and the Chicken Supreme and a couple glasses of wine. \n\nThe Chicken Supreme was alright. It was a big pile of mashed potatoes, a couple tiny little pieces of zucchini and a piece of chicken stuff with stuffing the same colour and consistency as the chicken itself (odd!). The menu claimed there were leeks, and maybe there were in the stuffing but I couldn't find them. Overall I was hoping for more from this dish and it ended up just tasting SALTY.\n\nThe schnitzel was very greasy, in fact it tasted like it had been thrown in a deep fryer to cook. It was served with a lettuce and a dressing that was only mediocre and new potatoes that were a bit too dry. I've eaten better schnitzel at pubs.\n\nI WOULD go back for half price appetizers and a glass of wine after work on a Wednesday. 3 stars for their happy hour. Especially in the summer on the patio.\n\nHowever, for dinner, considering you're paying $20-$30 for an entree this place gets 2 stars and I wouldn't go back given the option. The quality is more in line with restaurants that charge $12-$15 an entree.
