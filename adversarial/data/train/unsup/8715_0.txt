I was actually kinda dreading getting to 299 reviews because that meant I would have to man up and write this review... one I've been holding for four months. Well, the time has come and I can't hold it off any longer. It's time to put Sage in the books and celebrate another hundred.\n\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, Sage was one for the ages. Or is it one for the Sages? Ha!\n\nIt's interesting what you remember four months after eating at a restaurant. The little things are gone and what remains are the things you probably won't ever forget. At Sage, it was the impeccable service. It was my awesome veal cheek entree. It was the oh so tacky (and historically inaccurate) way of lighting the sugar cube for our Absinthe. And most notably, it was the ab-so-loot-ly ah-may-zing foie gras brulee appetizer. I haven't taken the time to rank them, but that delicious, delicious blend of gamey creaminess is in the top three starters of all time. It was just that good. Honestly, every bit of that meal made it a fantastic way for my wife and I to celebrate our eighth anniversary.\n\nThat's it. That's all I waited four months to say. Now go eat.
