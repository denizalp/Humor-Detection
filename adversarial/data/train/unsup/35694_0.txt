Sooo....it's in a mall food court. Probably obvious to most from the area, but I had to figure it out.\n\nThe beef shawarma is delicious and love the hot sauce and other sauces. About as good as it gets for food court food, though I feel the rice was only okay. Worth a stop if you're in this mall for sure.
