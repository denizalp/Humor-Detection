Salty Overpriced Mediocrity\n\nPardon me if this review sounds salty, but I am still trying to get the taste of salt out of my mouth. \n\nThe decor and ambiance are more reminiscent of a cougar filled nightclub than a restaurant. If you like loud Trap remixes of 80's classics, this is your place. If you have any tastebuds (music or tongue) this isn't.  A place for talking at (not with) people whilst drinking *&!#@$%! priced drinks. \n\nThe service is embarrassingly fawning. There was an error with our meal (one dish not ordered, and was rush ordered once they realized, which was when the rest of the party received theirs). The server (and FOH Manager?) removed the dish from the bill, provided a free side dish, and provided a free dessert. Overkill, but perhaps the regular clientele expects this kind of service. If so I feel sorry for, well... everyone involved.\n\nThe Steak was a chewy salty mess. The sides were the best food of the night, (apart from the parmesan fries, which were FAR TOO SALTY (see a theme) and soft). I especially liked the Brussels Sprouts. \n\nDo you have more money than taste? Then do yourself a favour and go somewhere else regardless. \n\nDo I recommend this place? \nno
