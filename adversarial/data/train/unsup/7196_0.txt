Came in late on a Friday night. Were able to get the last order of cod they had, so went with one cod and one walleye. The cod was done really well, walleye was above average but not the best in Madison. \n\nThe owner was behind the bar frying the fish. Was awesome getting to see him in action, hand breading every piece and frying it up to a perfect golden brown. \n\nIf you love fish at a dive bar, this is your place. IF you are looking for more of an ambiance, go elsewhere. \n\nGood, solid food with no frills.
