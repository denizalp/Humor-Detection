Love this place!! \nEvery time I'm anywhere close to this part of town, I have to make a stop and pick up a loaf of fresh bread.. okay, who am I kidding - I have to pick up two loaves at least! One has to be either the simple white or wheat bread, and the other - is always a surprise!! Their sweet breads are just as delicious as the savory ones. My favorites so far have been the spinach-cheese, and salsa-jalapeno ones. They are very generous with their in-store samples - giving you an opportunity to try and fall in love with their creative flavors before committing. They have a good variety of sandwiches as well. I like their vegetarian sandwiches, but for me - their breads are what get me in to the bakery! With all the bad press that bread has been getting lately around the un-natural ingredients etc. etc. , I had almost given up eating bread until I stumbled upon Great Harvest. And now, I've resumed my love-love relationship with bread! I feel good knowing that I'm eating bread that was baked fresh, with good ingredients, and the right way.
