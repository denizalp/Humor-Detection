This is a new Starbucks near the Federal building on Grant Street.   It has many of the amenities of other Starbucks and it is efficiently run.  The positives include a very friendly staff that recognize repeat customers.  The line move smoothly.  The store could have more premium seating, though the chairs they do have are quite plush.  They have wireless and convenient bench seating but it is a little cramped in peak hours.
