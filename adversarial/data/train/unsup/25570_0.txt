My kids and I stopped in for a late lunch. This was our first visit. With only a few customers there, the staff was willing to take the time to answer my question and offer suggestions. We got 3 single cheeseburgers, a hot dog, and a bucket of fries. Our total was $30. We are fans of 5 guys and this place doesn't quite measure up. I might try again, but next tme I will get something else. The fries were good, the burger just mediocre.
