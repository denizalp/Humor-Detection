My family loves this place but I've had a couple of bad experiences. It's either really good or really bad. The garlic salad is amazing and their onion soup is out of this world. Their crepes can go both ways (and I only order nutella\/chocolate banana so that says A LOT). \n\nOnce went in and they were out of bananas, strawberries, and shrimp. So I ordered nutella\/chocolate apple instead of my usual which was very disappointing. I opened up my heated apple and chocolate crepe and found a SAUSAGE link inside. Quite disgusting, really.\n\nMy sister usually orders their shrimp plate, but since they were out - literally went next door for sushi as everything else she wanted was out of stock. \n\nExpect the worst or the best, it's really a toss up!
