Reminds me of Cheesecake Factory, only a more luxurious version. This place is HUGE and extends far into the back. The menu is equally extensive with just about anything you could want ranging from basic salads, sandwiches and burgers to breakfast foods to Asian fusion items to insanely large desserts.  \n\nWe dropped by at an off time (2:30PM) but the place was still very full and busy. We had an early dinner planned so we opted to share a few appetizers and had drinks. We shared the spring rolls, crab cakes and strawberry shortcake dessert. Note: even though it says \"spring\" rolls these are more like egg rolls and deep fried. The inside is kind of a mushy texture so it wasn't obvious that it was chicken and shrimp. The crab cakes were surprisingly good, with each (two per order) a good size and filled with a generous amount of real crab. Mustard-y sauce was a great tangy complement. Strawberry shortcake was huge with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle and topped with whipped cream and strawberries. Very sweet and decadent but not the most amazing in terms of quality of shortbread. Drinks were solid and the drink menu offers everything from wines to different kinds of bellinis to bloody Mary's and more!\n\nOverall solid option and great for variety but nothing amazing.
