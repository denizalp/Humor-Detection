I've been coming here for years,  seeing Dr. Burton.  The office and my doctor are very caring and always helpful.  I've had other psychiatrist and they just rush you through their office. As if you're just a number,  no care for you.  But Dr.Burton always takes his time with me.  If I could give more stars I would. I highly recommend this office.
