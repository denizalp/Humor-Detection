This location is a pain in the ass......I went into this location on Friday 08\/21\/2015 and purchased an Italian BMT that's 6.75 plus tax (7.31).......after checking my bank statement on Saturday 08\/22\/2015 the cashier actually charged me 73.10......I've been calling and have been given the run around every time I call......The unprofessional manager Tammy told me she doesn't have the authority to authorize my refund......she told me she has to call the credit card company which I don't understand because you aren't the credit card holder so there's nothing the credit card company can do for you......my thing is there is no sense of urgency at this location the manager could care less about what's going on and she doesn't care about assisting me.......
