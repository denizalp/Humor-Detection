Oh my goodness, I haven't been here in years! I used to live right down the street but have since moved. I popped in here for lunch with a friend and we both had the most amazing salads! Not to mention, the service was so friendly! \n\nIm totally spacing the name of the salad but it had mixed greens, incredible marinated chicken, goat cheese, red peppers, avocado, cucumbers and a tasty vinaigrette. It was HUGE and so hearty + filling which is hard to find in a salad these days! I'll absolutely be back for this dream in a salad bowl! I also ordered their lavender green tea to wash it down, yes please! \n\nThanks for a tasty lunch, Merci! I'll most definitely be back for another meal soon!
