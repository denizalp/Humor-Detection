Apparently this place opened 8 months ago. WHERE HAVE I BEEN? I have never noticed Wanda's until the other day when I was running - ducking a rainstorm. In the middle of my concentrated running, I was interrupted mid-step by the most alluring aroma, the scent of freshly-baked-something. I needed to get whatever it was in my mouth PRONTO! \n\nBack tracking our steps, Marie B. and I finally discovered what our taste buds were craving all along. FRESHLY BAKED BELGIAN WAFFLES! (IT'S ABOUT FRIGGIN TIME!) \n\nEven though I was mad full from my Salad King dinner and yes, this place is as big as a walk-in closet, there was no way I wasn't going to try some kind of waffle - no matter how small it needed to be. I ordered the chocolate dipped waffle and saved it for home time. \n\nI regret not bringing more home. The chocolate was a tad sweet, but good quality chocolate was indeed used. However, the next time I attend a potluck, I'm bringing a bunch of Wanda's naked Belgian Waffles to the party. Everyone is gonna think I'm a savior!
