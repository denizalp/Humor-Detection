For our last night in Vegas, we decided to go see Kaskade for \"Summer Lovin\" at Marquee! Marquee is located in the absolutely gorgeous Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino. Everything about this hotel is fabulous and just screams Vegas!\n\nWe met a promoter a couple nights before and he got us on the guestlist (thanks Danny!) and we had no problems getting in. Definitely get on a guestlist because this place was super crowded around 10-10:30! \n\nMarquee has multiple floors with different rooms and music but we stayed on the main floor for Kaskade. It's such a beautiful club and a very close second to my favorite, XS. The pool area is amazing at night! There are tons of cabanas and VIP tables outside as well as inside. Drink prices were pretty standard however I didn't drink too much because once you left the main DJ area, it was hard to get back in since it was so crowded. \n\nThe one thing I didn't like about Marquee was the stairs! WHY are there so many!?! My 5-inch heels could not handle it but thankfully I brought some TOMS to give my feet a break. Ladies, do yourself a favor and wear flats, sandals, or wedges...your feet will thank you later, trust me! \n\nOverall, we had a great last night in Vegas at Marquee! I wish we had a chance to go to their pool party, but I guess that means we'll just have to make another trip ;) Marquee is definitely a must if you are in Vegas!
