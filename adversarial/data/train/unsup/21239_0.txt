I've been here a few times with my mom, brother, and her husband. My family is full of skinny people but we go here bc my stepdad us a cheapskate. The variety is really good and there's fresh veggies. I never went to a buffet before coming to Phoenix so I guess this one is not so bad. \n\nThe thing is, there's a ton if huge, gigantic people who go here to load up. I find that disturbing. But I'm assuming they like to frequent buffets.
