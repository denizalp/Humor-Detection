We needed a car with great gas milage to go to San Diego in. I called them adn they had a good deal for a weeeknd. $25 a day. I asked if I could pick it up around 7am, well no... they do not get in until 8 and had to shuffle a ton of cars around. He would call around 9am. \n\nNo call around 9 but I called back at 10... they would send someone over to pick us up. The girl almost killed us 2 times on the 3 mile ride back to the depot. LOL\n\nThey run the #s ask for a credit card, I hand them my debit, they say..um we need a credit card or we will need a utility bill and a 2 pay check stubs or something... I was WTF no one told me that. I do not use credit cards for anything. (I am in the Financial Services) They are the devil. LOL\n\nI was pissed, and they saw that... They offered to \"still rent\" to me if I could provide refrences. LOL \n\nWe left Phx around 11:20 headed to SD. \n\nThey neglected to tell me that they were closed on Sunday, the day of return and I had to take time off Monday to get the car back to them again. (She almost got me killed again)\n\nCheck out was smooth, the car was nice....blah bla... and no they do not sell burgers. :)
