Ask any of my friends what my most common complaint about Toronto is and they'll say \"Kat's always whining about how she can never find anywhere that's NOT a bar to hang out at after hours, and that all the good cafes close at the absurd hour of 7pm.\" And also \"There aren't enough hot, left-handed, blond-eyebrowed Aquarian men in this city.\"\n\nSeriously, I'm always looking for places to wile away the evening hours, a place that's the equivalent of Rockaberry or Kilo in Montreal, who both specialize in dessert-y things and hot beverages. It's the Eastern European in me surfacing (we love our post-dinner dessert\/coffee time).\n\nFuture Bakery fits the bill. Although I dearly miss the Bloor West Village location (it's since been replaced by a mediocre restaurant called Sharkey's that never lived up to the popularity of Futures), it's been closed for about 10 years now so I should reallllly build a bridge and get over it. \n\nThe cakes at Future Bakery are ooh la la and more. Each cake is nearly a foot in height and looks almost too decadent to eat. It's really, really hard to decide which cake to buy (you can buy by the slice for about $5, or a whole cake for $40). So my suggestion is to just go back every day until you've tried 'em all, which is sort of what I've been doing this past week. I've had the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake, the Oreo Cheesecake, the Truffle Cheesecake and the Chocolate & Banana Cake. Holy pupshit. Incredible. The chai latte isn't bad, either.\n\nThis is a great place to hang out after a show, on a date, while studying (might need headphones though, it gets a bit noisy) or to generally hang out over coffee in a fun environment. Their patio seems to have been shut down this summer. I'm not too sure what happened but there's a petition going around to re-open it.\n\nIt's cash or credit only -- no debit.\n\nSIDENOTE: I know the name of this place is \"Future\", but does that mean their website has to follow suit? When you visit the site you're redirected to a subfolder called \"future\" that says \"Coming Soon\". It reminds me of the halcyon days of animated \"Under Construction\" gifs that never, ever turned into anything, where \"Coming Soon\" equalled \"Coming Never.\"
