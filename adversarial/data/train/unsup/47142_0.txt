Pizza is a hard category to one up in because there are so many options but..yum! Humble Pie is a great pizzeria that offers fun and different options to help change things up from the usual. If you want a good example, I recently tried the fig and prosciutto pizza. It was amazing and cooked so well! A great choice whether youre in the mood to sit inside or outside and the staff is always incredibly friendly from hostess to server.
