Well, when i was told where we were eating, i was kind of worried, didnt sound like my cup-o-tea.  But i figured, \"hey, its burgers, should be fun.\"  \n\nWhen we walked in, there was only one table, with two guys at it and the waitress wanted to put us right next to them, at a lil table against the wall.  But as some of us know, \"you dont put RLB in the corner,\" and im a lil claustrophobic, so she moved us to a bigger table and off the wall.\n\nThe waitress seemed to be new, maybe just had the training wheels taken off, but she was very polite and was able to answer our questions.\n\nI went with what has been dubbed \"their plain burger.\"  I thought that the meat had a great flavor to it, but what threw it off was the sweet bun that it was on.\n\nThe salt & pepper garlic fries were GREAT!!!  They even through in jalepenos(which one snuck up on me.)\n\nAll in all, it was a good experience.  3 may be a lil low to many of yall, but our taste buds and what we like, will always be different.
