I've had my fair share of drunken late night trips to this particular location, but even in a sober mindset, I give this place 4 stars. The workers are friendly (as friendly as a 40+ something year old can be while working in a fast food joint) and one time the nice lady working the drive thru gave me a free fruitista freeze. The food is always good (in terms of Taco Bell standards) and they've never messed up my order EXCEPT on one occasion......\n\nThe gentleman working the drive thru failed to put a fork in the bag for my cheesy fiesta potatoes!!!!!!!! Of course I realized this after the fact, when 10 cars were still waiting for their food.... driving through again wasn't too appealing of an option.\n\nTaco Bell almost got 5 stars out of me, but I had to give a 1\/2 star deduction for the forkless cheesy fiesta potatoes incident and another 1\/2 star deduction for the loud fat ratchets that swarm this place on Friday-Saturday nights.
