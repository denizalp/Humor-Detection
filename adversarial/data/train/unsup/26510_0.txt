I was having a problem with a pair of glasses I got a while back from here and Sassy Glasses went above and beyond to fix it. They have a lifetime customer now, and not just because of their service but also because of their amazing selection of unique glasses. Some are very unique but I think anyone could find something at this shop. When they have a sale the value is beyond compare. They even have vintage. I originally went because I couldn't find cat eye glasses anywhere else. I will continue to go because I have never had a better eyeglass shopping experience in three states over 20 years..
