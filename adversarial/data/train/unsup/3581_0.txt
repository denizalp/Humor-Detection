Hard to review Amelie's. It's so awesome, unique, good for CLT, comfy, all around kick ass, that I gotta go after the nits. Which are:\n\nTable immediately inside the door so that would-be lunchers break left and right, confused, and have to spend a sec asking \"are you in line?\" \n\nMore than occasional space cadet order takers\n\nPrice inflexibility (adding things to, say, a lunch tartine can run you upwards of 2 bucks, if they let you do it at all)\n\nBut, I never leave here having spent less than $10, and my theory is that there's some sort of weird hypnosis that gorgeous case of pastries triggers. All the color and perfect chocolate swirls, perhaps... anyways, when I come to, I've got not only my coffee and sammich but also a baguette, cup of soup and tart tucked under my arm (well, in a box, anyway).\n\nTake it from an NYC pastry hunter - prices on tarts, cream puffs, macaroons, etc. are reasonable, darlings. A perfect eclair is an extensive and laborious process.\n\nThe vegan soup is deeelish, as are their other choices (seems there's always a veg or vegan option, so yay!).\n\nAnd 24hrs? Quelle bonne id√©e!
