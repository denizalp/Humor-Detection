The employees at this jack n the box are amazing... they are always cheerful and they ask how you are doing and are always super nice. You can tell they are trying to make people feel good while they wait for their food. The prices are decent and the food is always yummy for fast food. I don't think I have ever gotten a wrong order from them and I go here often for lunch on the weekdays. the jr bacon cheese burger on the dollar menu is sooooooo good and just a dollar :)
