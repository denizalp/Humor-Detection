One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. Given the location (Shamrock and Eastway), it would be easy to completely bypass or disregard this place. But in my opinion, it's one of the Queen City's gems.\n\nI usually get my order to go, but it's always a real treat when I do get to eat there. The staff is friendly. The service is top notch. Don't know what you want? Tell your server what you like. He\/she will help you order. If you're even a semi regular, they remember what you want... even down to the beverage. And I can promise you that your drink will never go empty. Someone is always there ready to fill your glass... sometimes after your first sip!\n\nI love pho, or as I call it comfort in a bowl. My standard order is Pho Bo Vien (rice noodle soup with meatballs), spring rolls, and fresh summer rolls. Now you see why I often opt to pick it up... so no one can judge me on the amount of food I consume.\n\nLang Van is great place for those engaged in a mad, passionate love affair with Vietnamese food and also for the newbies. If you're a little weary about giving Vietnamese a try... don't be!
