I don't have high expectations for the Chinese food in Las Vegas, even in Chinatown.\n My mother recommended this place.  So we stopped by to have lunch and I was facinated by the cheap price that was available in Las Vegas. Lol!\nThe food is not something to rave about but decent enough to eat and prices were really inexpensive. Serviecs is OK and lack the conceited attitude which I am impressed. No ambiance, just a plain Jane bbq restaurant. For Xmas, a \"friend\" ordered a entire roast pork. It looked sooooo good!! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/AbadN65irz8uSL8z6fkoBg?select=ifwxHWilWKPkBEmMxGi_6A
