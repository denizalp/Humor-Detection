You won't find this place on google when searching for \"happy hour drinks Toronto\" or \"cheap drinks Toronto\".  Usually only people that work in the financial district know about this after work watering hole. I used to frequent this place quite often as my office was right across the street.  Now the hostess and bartender's all recognize me.  \n\nHappy hour is on Tuesdays and Thursdays which begins at 5pm.  Happy Hour Offerings: \n\n$2.75 mixed drinks\n$3.75 pints of domestic beer\n$5 glasses of wine, red or white (5oz) \n$25 for the bottle of wine, red or white  \n\nYou'll want to arrive early on Thursday since it gets packed by 5:30 pm and you'll see a lineup outside for people waiting to get in.  Once you get in it will be loud, very loud and music isn't even playing.  You'll find people standing around in their small groups yelling at each other just so that they can hear.  Getting into the bar area to order your drink could be a nightmare since people order their drinks and just stand there afterwards (I recommend ordering two drinks right at the start and if you're ordering mixed drinks, make them doubles.  Unless you're me, you will probably be waiting anywhere from 20-30 minutes for a bartender to come to you.  If you don't know how to slip into tight space and box out, you better learn or you're going to have a bad time.  \n\nI usually get here just before 5pm and more often than not be able to grab the couches with my crew.  Then I proceed to find Chandra who is awesome as she's my go to bartender and order a bottle of red wine so I don't have to bother with the crowd at the bar.  There are two floors with a bar on each to get drinks.  Crowd here is mostly young professionals in suit and tie or business casual.\n\nTips:\n\nTuesdays are a lot less busier than Thursdays\nComplimentary coat and bag check on Tuesdays, $1 for each item on Thursdays\nWould not recommend coming here for Dinner on Thursdays as it'll be loud\nI recommend getting the Frites ($6) to share, comes with garlic aioli\nStand by the stairs on a Thursday and you'll see some drunk girls in stiletto's slip and fall down the stairs from time to time, Cheers!
