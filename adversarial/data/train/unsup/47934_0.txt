ONO-LICIOUS!!\n\nThis is a fun restaurant... fun people and a fun menu!\n\nWhen you enter... the staff welcomes with a loud... ALOHAAAA!\nAnd when you depart... they all yell.... MAAHAALLO!\n\nThere was 5 in our party.... We hung out for a couple hours visiting and eating our way through the menu.  It seemed like the whole staff stopped by our table at one time or another to chat ....see how we were doing or drop off a dish or accept our order or refill our drinks.  \n\nWe ordered a couple tapas at a time.... and they came out pretty quick... Note... they have a lot of Sushi on the menu... but there is so much more than just sushi... and everything is quite tasty!\n\nFigure on ordering 3-4 per person for a meal... I think we actually ordered like 6 per person because we had 2 pages to our receipt... with drinks and tax... note... we had a couple drinks each... our bill came to about $45\/pp... so it's not a cheap place... but it is a fun place with fun dishes and fun people. (definitely more reasonable if you're not consuming alcohol)\n\nBy the way.... their cocktails are awesome!  My new favorite drink is their Lychee Saketini.  This one is dangerous... not too sweet and oh so smooth Tropical-y Yumminess.\n\nLike I said.... we ate our way through the menu.... I think we got through about 1\/2 the menu.... our favorites...\n\nI can't remember everything we ate.... it was a lot.... here are a few notables:\n\nEggplant Fries.... you do have to like Eggplant... these were crispy on the outside... soft on the inside.\n\nWagyu Sliders.... juicy... meaty.... melt in your mouth goodness.... and the mushrooms are a nice touch.  The buns are soft and not overpowering.... it's just there so you have something to hold the burger from goo-ing all over your hands.\n\nPork Belly and Asparagus.... So Freakin' Good!  Next time... I'm not sharing.  I'm getting a bowl of rice and enjoying this as a full on entree all to myself.  The pork belly was firm and not overly fatty... the aspargus was cooked but not soggy.\n\nWe will be back... in fact... I see there's a Groupon available ... I'm buying it right after I hit 'post'.  :)
