The hours today (Sunday) said they were open until 3pm. I arrived around 2:15 and parked out front of the entrance. Before I could even get out of my car, 3 waitresses came out and yelled at my girlfriend that they closed at 2. I clearly saw people that had just been seated. I would have been fine with them being closed at 2 (even though yelp said 3) if they hadn't been so rude in the way they told us. This will be my last time coming here and I'll be sure to pass my experience along to others.
