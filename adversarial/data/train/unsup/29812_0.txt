I don't even think they deserve one star honestly. I took my brand new wheels to have the tires removed so I could get the rims powder coated. When I picked them up my rims were destroyed and they didn't even want to give me my money back let alone offer to repair or replace them. Needless to say I would never recommend this place because I was treated horribly for them damaging my belongings. They should have bent over backwards to make things right.
