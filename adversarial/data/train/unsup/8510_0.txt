This place's tang soo yuk (sweet and sour pork) sauce is literally store bought pineapple jam poured onto a plate of fried pork with canned fruits on the side. The waiter got one of our order wrong and acted like he didn't understand us, and so we ended up just eating what we had. Even though this experience was somewhat disappointing, the food seemed authentic and the store owner was very nice.
