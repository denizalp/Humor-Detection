|| Must Try: Tacos and Sliders\n\n|| Rating: (8\/10) Food, (11\/10) Service, (8\/10) Value, (9\/10) Ambience, (9\/10) Presentation, (10\/10) Cleanliness\n\n|| My Experience:  \n \nFirst off, this place is hands down the best service I've ever had at any establishment. The manager Mike was extremely helpful accommodating our large party over the phone and, moreover, remembered us and helped facilitate our party when we arrived. Extremely friendly service and care for their customers. That alone would make me come back again. \n\nThis place us great for groups. The appetizer size is good for about two individuals and the mains are a hefty portion. We had the steak and frites, which were great, but the appetizers of tacos and sliders were the highlight of the meal. \n\nI would highly recommend this for a large celebration or gathering! Had a great time and will be a returning costumer without a doubt!
