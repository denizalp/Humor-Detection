If you like overpriced, mediocre food that takes an inordinately long time to get to your table and is delivered by ill-informed wait staff with lousy attitudes, this place is one of the best.\n\nThe giant TV screen playing Korean music videos was an irritating atmosphere choice.\n\nPerhaps it's good Korean food, I don't know.  If people who rave about this place so much like Korean food that much, I think they should save up their money and learn to cook it themselves before patronizing this place.  $44 + tip for 2 people...  I could've gotten better food at a takeout place from people with less attitude.\n\nUnless money and things like customer service aren't important to you at all, don't go.
