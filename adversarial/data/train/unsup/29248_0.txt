Prime location, clean decor and great service. Expensive for chinese food, but on par with the food prices in the financial district.\n\nThe food was very well presented, and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. Especially the panfried shrimp and pork dumplings - I was delighted to bite into a whole shrimp in the dumpling (on top of the pork), rather than diced up shrimp mixed in with the pork.\n\nThe lunch special is a pretty good deal as it comes with a spring roll and salad. The sweet and sour pork was okay, maybe a bit too saucy. The spring roll was awesome. \n\nOverall, a good dining experience!
