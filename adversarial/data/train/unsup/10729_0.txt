Great place for drunk munchies or whenever you are craving late night Mexican food. But it's not really the go to place for Mexican food in general. I came here once for breakfast burrito and the whole burrito smelled like oil. And it's really not quality food. \nI'm not hating though because when it's 3am on a weekend night and you want some fried Mexican food, this place delivers (not literally)
