Horrible customer service from the owners Kris and Randy. They are very quick to take your money but don't expect to see it ever again they are very shady about \"return policy\". Extremely unorganized with orders and orders are always missing a few items or wrong. Don't waste your time or money. Lots of other really great print shops in henderson\/Las Vegas area.
