We were staying at PH and came to this pool. There was a group of like 8 of us, it was great.  Like another reviewer said, it's a good pool to get drunk at. hahaha\n\nThere was a DJ and while it' snot one of the dayclubs\/pool parties in Vegas, it was still ALOT of fun. the pool can get crowded at times and you see the murky water full of sunblock.  But that's nothing alcohol consumption can't make you forget. haha
