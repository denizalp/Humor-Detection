We ordered two drinks and two sandwiches. I really like that they offer Almond Milk, but dislike that it is an additional $1 extra. (That is outrageous!) \nI ordered the Green Card (Turkey, guacamole & minus the bacon for me), and the bf ordered The Very Charming Pig (Ham, Swiss, Cream Cheese and Bacon) I ordered mine with no bread and he ordered his on Focaccia. His Focaccia had an upcharge vs the ciabatta, which would have probably been fine, if it wasn't for mine being the same price as normal without either bread. I get a little frustrated at these restaurants up charging for every thing, just because they know people prefer it. \n\nI'm sure we'll be back to try it again, but probably just the coffee side. Neither of us was overly enthusiastic about the food. \n\nAlthough I do like that they are open 24\/7. I even noticed they were open on Christmas. Although I felt bad for the girl holding a sign out to inform everyone they were open Christmas morning.
