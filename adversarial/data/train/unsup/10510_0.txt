Food- Main courses were small which I understand is the concept, but for the price the food didn't exceed the price. It wasn't good enough for the expensive prices. The desserts were absolutely amazing and the presentation was great! \n\nService- The service was good and they were attentive. \n\nAmbiance- The restaurant is very nicely decorated and ambiance is good. It's a very quiet place and do not recommend for families. It's a good spot for a date if you're looking to spend $$$$! \n\nOverall it was just ok. It's definitely an experience but the food isn't blow your hair back besides the dessert.
