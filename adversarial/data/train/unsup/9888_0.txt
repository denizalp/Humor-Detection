Rooftop came here on a Saturday night and it wasn't packed at all. The Rio is just barely off the strip, but it felt like a ghost town compared to other clubs in the surrounding casinos. We were on the guest list so we got in for free.  \n\n*The view of the strip is pretty cool at night with all the bright lights and vegas skyline. You just gotta squeeze in between people hogging up the little corners outside for a good picture. \n\n*There's not much of a dress code here, except you can't wear hats. I only overheard security telling a guy to take his hat off because it wasn't allowed.  \n*Only 1 elevator was working so you do have to wait a couple minutes for it to go up the 52nd floor from the casino floor at the 4th. \n\n*Drinks are a little overpriced, but it's Vegas. So it's expected. A small AMF was $17.00 My dumbo ears were working again, because I overheard a few gentlemen not liking their drinks because it was too sweet, which I agreed. Shortly leaving the bar to the walk around, I witnessed a couple of girls shoving each other back and forth before security came and broke it up. We head outside and there's another mini fight between 2 guys and a girl. People, we are too old to be fighting at clubs. \n\n*Music was ok. Sounds like it was 90s hip hop and a few random EDM hits. \n\nNot sure if this club or hotel is my kind of fun I want to spend in Vegas. I would like to see Tyson Beckford perform one of these days, but that may be the only reason I come back here.
