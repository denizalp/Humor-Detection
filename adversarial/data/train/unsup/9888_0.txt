Aesthetically this is a nice dealership...but I don't like the way they do business.  They say, \"We don't discount prices.\"  But then a salesperson said to me, \"But since I think you're a nice person I'll give you $1,000 off.\"  \n\nRiiiiiiiiight...don't insult my intelligence.  I'm happy to take my business to another Audi dealership who will put together a better deal and isn't so arrogant.
