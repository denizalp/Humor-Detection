I don't know if we went on an off not but ...UGH!!! The men were walking around in basketball shorts, what...why?? They did not have customs, routines, no flips, no flippin the women around. I guess I'm used to the guys back home that perform. Some of the kids were so full of them selves you didn't want to even look. \nIf you want to spend $30 to laugh, this is it!!
