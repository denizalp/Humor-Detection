I have done yoga before but have resisted doing any kind of hot yoga due to people telling me about smelly studios and stinky feet.\nMy girlfriend insisted I try Sumits yoga and I am so glad I did. The studio is super clean and smells great! (And if the music is too loud then you're too old!!!) I have now done 5 classes on the groupon and I already know I will renew and keep coming.\nI lift weights 3-5 days a week and doing hot yoga has helped my workouts and I feel more relaxed and focused in my every day life. The instructors are super nice and helpful ( especially Jami) and I always feel welcome even though I'm still falling over and grunting in class.\nIf you've never tried yoga this is the place to do it . Thanks Sumits , thanks Jami!!!
