Poor North Shore. I want so badly for it to be awesome... including this place. But I left feeling just okay about it. Actually totally loved the Turkey burger I ordered. After I fixed what I had noted to the server to leave off...\n\nWanted to make it even better with some extra BBQ sauce, but after asking, and waiting... and waiting some more, it finally came! I also waited a while for refills. Just not the best service.\n\nThe side salad was pretty boring. Iceberg lettuce with unripe tomatoes and a few pieces of onion. I'd opt to just not serve tomatoes this time of year and replace it with something else, but I'm being nitpicky. \n\nWe also ordered the s'mores cheesecake, as it was free from the Yelp check-in! I was super pumped, as I love both s'mores and cheesecake. The marshmallows on top were toasted perfection, and while the cake was good, it seemed like it was missing something. Not rich and cheesy enough, maybe? Crust was awesome though! \n\nMuch hipper inside than I imagined from the name. I definitely wouldn't be opposed to stopping in here before a game.
