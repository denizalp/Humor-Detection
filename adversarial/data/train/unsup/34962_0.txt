This was prob my fav meal while in Montreal.  The food was amazing, even though the menu was small.  We both had nachos and the black beans were incredible which were served on the size.  We sat at a great table near the window (fun people watching) and service was perfect.  The music was great as well.  If I lived in Montreal, I would be here all the time.  Laid back, relaxing atmosphere in a fun antiquey district for shopping.
