This is the French patisserie of Cleveland and the coquette of French patisseries. Yes they are flirting with you. Coquette is unique in that it's intensely beautiful and contains some refreshing wittiness (most likely inspired by Shane Culey, Owner and Cheerman of the Bored) to break up the stark class of a typical French patisserie. It has less of the classic, fine French patisserie style and more of a rugged French patisserie style. Which is nice, actually.\n\nThey also excel in food quality. The Maple Bourbon macaron was easily the second-best macaron I've ever placed on my tongue. The texture was perfect which would make it worth it with no flavor at all; but the maple and bourbon taste combination made it more than divine. \n\nThey have some drinks too. I guess. I'm only assuming that the bottles and the menu weren't only decorations. I have a macaron eating habit, but not a wine drinking habit so I didn't try any. \n\nI thought about spending my $7 on a Bonita Apple Bomb but decided instead to go to Piccadillys next door and spend it on a couple spoonfuls of ice cream. On to that review...
