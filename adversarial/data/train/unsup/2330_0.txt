First rule of a good Chinese restaurant: \nThere must be chinese customers.\nSecond Rule of a good chinese restaurant:\nThe chinese in the restaurant must be eating (not just waiting on tables) and speaking in languages you (presumably average Americans) don't understand.\nThird Rule of a good Chinese restaurant:\nNo fortune cookies!\n\nThus I arrive at Wonton Gourmet and BBQ with my usual dose of skepticism. Though there were no Roast Duck or Char Siew hanging near the window, I was instantly transported to my happy place when I walked in.\n\nPlastered on the walls were photos of the food they serve, including dishes, I've not seen since I stepped on the plane in Asia to return to the US. The menu is extensive. It's a mainly cantonese cuisine type of place. So a lot of items with roots from Hong Kong. Such as Wonton soup with egg noodles, Beef Chow HoFun (and yes Ho is fun VERY fun).\n\nThe wonton soup with egg noodle is VERY authentic. The dumpling is filled with meats and not wrap. The veggie amount is the same as any you would get while dining in Asia. There were five wontons and the clear soup is as real and tasty as any in Hong Kong, Singapore or China(s). \n\nThe House Pot Stickers are good. Presumably, these dumplings are a house recipe. The dipping sauce is somewhat Americanized but taste good. The Pot Stickers sauce I'm used to is just black vinegar and ginger.\n\nThe Beef Chow HoFun....well, yum! It's a standard item in Cantonese eateries all over Asia and it's nice to find one so similar. I've always like my food hot (spicy hot!) so I add the table hot sauce to it....and it just doesn't get anymore authentic then this.\n\nThe tea is a MUST TRY!  Hot or cold, basically it's your regular black tea made real strong with a healthy dose of evaporated milk to taste. If you are having the tea hot, don't forget to add sugar (available on the table) to your liking (I didn't see artificial sweeteners and didn't bother to ask)\n\nThe wait staff is a pleasant crew and spoke decent English. They accommodated my children and were helpful when asked.\n\nIf you are looking for an authentic chinese dining experience, look no further! Because at the end of your meal, you get only the check. NO fortune cookies!! \n\n\n\n\n\nThough my 3  year-old did ask \"where's the cookie?\" OMG what have I done to my kids?!
