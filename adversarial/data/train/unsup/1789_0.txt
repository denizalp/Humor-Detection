Most folks would comment that Tacos El Compita 3 is... How can I say this politely?....\n\nA little \"Hole In The Wall'-ish? But before you knock it, you must try it. I randomly stopped by after class one day, maybe five months ago or so. It's nestled into a mini strip mall, barely bigger than the corner it is situated on. \n\nIf you are zipping down Trop... Or blink, you might miss it. It's quite a bit easier to see at night, when you can see the lights on.\n\nBut anyway, I stopped in just to see if these little places are as good as people say. You know, the whole myth about the little random places being better than bigger ones or chains.\n\nIt seems as if the rumors are true! This place is awesome! You get loads of meat piled into your taco, no skimping at all. They have all the meats, even pastor. I had a Mulita the other day and it was fantastic. You can also get soda water out of their fill-it-yourself soda machine.\n\nThe prices are fair, and I have always received the most courteous service as well. If you are in the area, stop in and see what I'm talking about.
