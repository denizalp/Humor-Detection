I'm a new member of this gym and I'm really happy with this place. The owner is a great guy, I was impressed with his customer service. It really shows that he cares about his customers and quality of experience his gym offers. If you are thinking about joining a smaller gym there are a few perks that I know you will enjoy. \n\nThe equipment is really high quality, I didn't know what I was missing. The machines work really smoothly. There is plenty of space to warm up with some body weight exercises. Lots of equipment and free weights. The squat rack is nice. \n\nThe gym is very clean, supposedly the cleanest in Vegas and I can't disagree. The ownership and the people who work here are helpful and friendly. I personally don't have to wait to use any of the equipment which is definitely a plus. \n\nSupport the little guy and come here if you live close by. The price maybe a little more expensive but it's worth it. You'll feel good about being part of a smaller gym community and supporting a local business.
