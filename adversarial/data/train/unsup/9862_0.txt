After reading the reviews for Chili Man, I knew I had to make it a stop while in Charlotte for the weekend. I ordered two dogs, the Frito Pie and the Life Changer. The man who runs this stand is incredibly friendly and seems to want to create an experience for his guests and not just push them through as I've experienced at other stands. If you are in line at a hot dog stand for 15+ minutes and people are not getting out of line there is a reason for that. \n\nHe quickly worked on my order as we chatted about Yelp and local restaurants. Food was bagged up I grabbed my soda and found a nearby bench.\n\nAs I opened my mouthwatering deliciousness that sat before me, I couldn't wait to try it. I started with the Frito Pie. Simply amazing!! Followed by The Life Changer, and I do think I saved the best for last. The life changer is a perfect combo on flavors that just work perfectly together. \n\nIf I have time on this trip I'll definitely be back for more!!
