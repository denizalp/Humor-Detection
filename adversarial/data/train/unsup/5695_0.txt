Oh exciting; I get to be first to review at the new location! \nSo if you never saw the old location, sucks for you. This location has some damn charm, let me tell you. Once you get inside, it's no longer a bar anymore with gaming like it used to be; it's now a classy-ass tasting room. It has tons on tap, no smoking, and a merch section now! I am particularly partial the gorgeous artsy glass on both the exterior and interior, the branded tables, and the smooth new bar. Also, no bar is complete without purse hooks, which they have. \nThe bathrooms here are exquisite. Call me biased, and I don't care, I may be since I've been coming for years, but this location is STUNNING.\nTake a peek in the back too; pristine. Also there is nothing quite like sipping on a beer around sunset whilst checking out a city landmark across the street. You'll have to come here to find out what it is, I'm not going to give it away! \nPS: if we're going to talk about favorite beers...Hop Ride is my go-to, Jackelope if I wanna get tossed, and for seasonals, Dutch is my fav with Belgian yeast and Red Ryder is my fav \"once a year\". Huzzah, and stay thirsty, my friends.
