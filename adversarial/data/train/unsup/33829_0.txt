I shop here all the time but recently I haven't had that great service I'm used to. It actually doesn't make it enjoyable to shop there. The staff is wonderful except for one lady that seems to now run the show and is very outspoken. \nIt's painful to pay for things when you can't get a smile or a simple thank you. This was my go to place. Sad.
