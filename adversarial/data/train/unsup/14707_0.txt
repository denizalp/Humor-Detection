The Kennywood Krucible Part 3:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mwZcl9sttyY\n\nWith a dose of dramamine in my bloodstream, I decided to challenge that which severely tapped my constitution during my previous Kennywood ordeal: The Cosmic Chaos.\n\nMenacing alien dwarves creep about the ride, taunting you, egging you on, hoping that you'll wreck your equilibrium by riding the giant spinning top. On a horseshoe-shaped track that took me 50 feet in the air, the ride attempting to victimize me through a virulently violent vertigo, forcing me to gaze upon a 360 degree view of this most perilous park: A Saucerful of Sinister. \n\nFortunately, my stomach was unfazed. Shaking off my remaining dizziness, the Steel Phantom's extraterrestrial blackguards scurried away as I charged past them and towards my next foe.
