I've never had a bad experience at a Wells Fargo branch.  This location is no exception.  The cashier I was dealing with was fast, efficient, and friendly.  She even suggested a few of their financial products that I might be interested in......I passed, but it was the thought that counts.\n\nAlthough I'm in the area often, I didn't notice this location until recently.  Since I'm in the area 4-5x a week, I'm sure this will be a regular spot for me.\n\nOverall, a solid visit to the bank.  Return Factor - 80%.
