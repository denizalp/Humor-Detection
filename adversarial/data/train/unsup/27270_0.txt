I came here for lunch with a friend and the food was pretty good! The kefta kabob plate was a little dry but the rice and side salad was good. They have a pink tzatziki sauce that comes with it... they should bottle it and sell it on stores! We had to wait about 15 minutes which is a little longer than most to-go spots in the area but they were busy so I'll give them that! Overall good experience!
