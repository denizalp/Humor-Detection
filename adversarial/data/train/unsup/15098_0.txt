I've been hungry for some decent Chinese food for quite a  while.  I noticed China Harvest had a coupon that came in the mail.  Today I decided to drive over and see if it was any good..  I've been there about 8 years ago and wanted to give it another chance.  Stupid me.  \n\nWhen I walked in they had me pay right away.  Now I know why, people probably either left without paying or refused to pay.  I should have walked out.\n\nThe place seemed clean and the waitress was good at cleaning off the tables.\n\nSo I started filling my plate and sat down.  Orange chicken was just OK, not good but OK.  The jalapeno chicken was horrible, very tough to chew like rubber.  I was very disappointed since I really only will eat a few things from Chinese places. \n\n Next plate.  I tried the honey ribs, again tough as rubber.  The honey chicken was OK but not great.  The crispy wings weren't very good,  I'm a wing guy so another disappointment.  The diet Coke was mixed very wrong.  It tasted like pure chemicals, mixed way to strong.  No way I was going to try the water\n\nNext plate.  Since I was still starving I decided to try some fries. Who could screw up fries. They were actually very good so I had to fill up on fries.  I did try the sweet and sour chicken but the sauce was either very bland or watered down.\n\nOn the way home I started feeling like I almost had to pull over and stick my head out the window.  I should have known better!\n\n Next time I want Chinese food I'm going to Panda Express.  I know it's good but a little expensive.  I will never eat there again nor go to any other Chinese food place here in Phx.  Finding a good one is just too tough.
