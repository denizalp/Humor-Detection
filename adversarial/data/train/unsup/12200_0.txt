What's a dream menu? Simple: it's the halo-covered menu of your dreams. \n\nIn your dreams, dishes have one awesome ingredient topped with another awesome ingredient, topped with cheese, topped with bacon, drizzled with maple syrup and served with fries and gravy and more bacon and more cheese. In your dreams food is carby, it's fatty, it hits all the pleasure zones, and it's delicious six ways from Sunday.\n\nThe teeny-tiny, adorable lil diner that is Rose & Sons (formerly People's Food) has a dreamy, dream-like menu that I will henceforth be dreaming about....and they deliver on those high expectations, BIG TIME.\n\nWe finally made it here for brunch on Sunday (2:30pm lol) and I ordered a dish that contained the following: expertly made, slightly crispy on the outside yet moist on the inside \"brie cornbread\", covered in maple syrup, topped with a melt-in-your-mouth slice of fatty beef brisket, topped with a fried egg, and drizzled with chili sauce. This dish gave me an all-over body high not unlike a hash brownie (k not really but still)....it was freaking ah may zing. The Punch cocktail, made with white wine, red lillet, seltzer and bits of rhubarb at the bottom was also fantastic.\n\nAlways, always follow your dreams :)
