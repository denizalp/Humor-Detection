I have never written a review, especially a bad one but I feel people must be warned.I have given Partelll Pharmacy several chances, ya know, thinking maybe it was just a bad day the first time but it wasn't. They NEVER get my prescription right, it takes at least a week to fill then they say they will notify me when it is ready.....they never do, they have no clue what is going on. People there are too lazy to actually look for something and apparently think our time does not matter. The manager seems to be full of excuses and doesn't seem to care about this business. I honestly believe in giving places a chance but this place has reached its limit and no one seems to care. I can't believe they are still in business treating their customers this way and obviously not training their employees properly. FIND A DIFFERENT PHARAMCY BECAUSE THIS ONE WILL JUST CAUSE A HUGE AMOUNT OF STRESS.
