I visited this mom and pop Greek restaurant in my sister's Phoenix neighborhood when I was there in March.  Set in a nondescript strip mall, it was hard to know what to expect, but upon entering we were first struck by the sparkling clean dining room and then by the delicious Mediterranean cooking aromas.  The food was absolutely delicious:  tender and flavorful gyro meat, fresh salad ingredients, tasty dressing, crispy-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside fries, and soft pita bread.  It was all cooked to order, so we did not mind waiting in the least.\n\nWe also noticed the menu included American classics like hot dogs and grilled cheese.  This is a great option for Greek food lovers who eat out with others who aren't crazy about trying something different.\n\nWe liked the food so much that we went back a second time during my 5-day visit.  With all of the food choices in Phoenix, this really says something!
