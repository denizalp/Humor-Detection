I was experiencing sharp pain in my right eye and the white of my eye looked as if it were bleeding.  This was very scary.  I did a google search and called all around Las Vegas but there was no one who could help me on a Saturday and there were no hospitals with an ophthalmologist on call. This was not good!  I came across this office, read the reviews, called,  received the after hours answering service and a Dr. was paged.  That is when I spoke with Dr. Langford who said he was willing to open up his office so that he can examine me.  Very well mannered and friendly, he examined me, gave me something for the pain and assured me that I would be okay. I also have a follow up appointment in a couple of days. I highly recommend him for anyone looking for an eye care professional.  I cannot thank him enough for treating me on an emergency basis and easing my anxiety.
