I was very excited to eat here but was extremely disappointed.  The food was nothing special (Korean tacos, meatballs and calamari),  the menu seemed confused with a bit of an identity crisis.  \n\nThe service was subpar, we were forgotten about despite sitting at the bar in view of the staff. A group sitting next to us also seemed to have an issue with their seating and it was embarrassing watching how the staff handled the situation.\n\nCocktails were below average.\n\nFood, service, vibe all below average.
