Love this place. Such a cute location - an old house w wooden floors and a fireplace. Lots of urban art. It gets really busy around noon, but if you take a later lunch, it's perfect. They play awesome music. I think it's geared to a younger crowd but good for anyone really. Definitely has the hipster touch, but it's not overwhelming. Food is suuuper yummy. I usually stick with the hot sandwiches. The BLT is TO. DIE. FOR. The North Beach is also very good. If you're looking for very attentive service, you're looking at the wrong place, but if you're looking for a nice place to chat w friends and not be bothered by someone refilling your water glass every thirty seconds, then this is a great choice.
