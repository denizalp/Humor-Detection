Purchased my dog there last year. I never wanted to fund a corporation that deals with puppy mills but I saw a puppy who needed a loving home with an actual bed instead of a plastic matt and I gave him exactly that. Luckily he is happy and healthy unlike the millions of other stories I have read. But I advise you to do your research before hand. I unfortunately did mine afterwards. My puppy came from QD kennels owners Herman and Bonnie Shindler. \n\nQD or Quad Dam KENNELS now a class b dog broker owned and operated by Herman and Bonnie Schindler. \n\nAbout Class B Dealers\nClass B dealers are licensed by the USDA to purchase and sell \"random source\" animals to medical research. B Dealers obtain animals for resale from other B dealers, shelters and from persons who have bred and raised the animals themselves.\nB dealers routinely violate the law by acquiring animals from fraudulent sources and abusing and neglecting them. These animals are often stolen pets, strays or animals obtained under false pretenses through \"free to good home\" ads. It is virtually impossible to know the true history of an animal acquired by a Class B dealer. Each time a Class B dealer sells an animal to a research lab, a strong possibility exists that he or she is a lost or stolen family pet.\nLast Chance for animals has fought for more than three decades to end the B dealer industry via extensive undercover investigations and legal cases.\n\nÂ \n\n\nThese individuals have a litany of past offenses from early 2000 to 2010 when their \"concentration camp\" mettoville kennels and another one called \"Teachers Pets\" in mexico missouri was shut down by the usda for over 36 pages of nasty violations. They were reportedly put out of businesses and their breeding stock auctioned off ..but they instead got subsequently licensed to be class b dealers. These folks are buying puppies from a variety of unsavory sources including possibly unlicensed breeders and definitely mill breeding operations. They are also authorized to pull puppies and adult dogs from shelters and resell to testing and research labs as well as commercial pet stores like puppy in the window and petland etc..Google them if you don't believe me it will make you very sad. The other distributor used is CCC KENNELS -CONRAD'S CUDDLY CANINES owned by Lori and Curt Conrad. This equally disgusting class b broker is the DAUGHTER of Herman and Bonnie Schindler and also based in Missouri. Both sets are clearly listed on the Humane societys dirty dozen list of worst possible offenders going back years. No wonder they keep changing there business names! These are the monsters and I don't use that lightly... \n\nThese sales associates at Petland preach to you about how they are qualified certified breeders, only the best....YEAH RIGHT. Look at your paper work closely. My puppy was not only from QD Kennels but breed by a random \"hobbyist\" named Sophie Stevens. I cannot find her or her license to breed any where online or in my paper work they gave from the store. \n\nIf Sophie Stevens is a certified breeder she and her license would be able to be found online easily!\n\nAlso AKC  (American Kennel Club) more strict \nand APRI (American Pet Registry) are totally different.\nAPRI registered dogs have a lack of rules\nNo restrictions against how many times dogs are breed, if dogs are tested before being breed and so on which can lead to congenital defects and poor health.\n\nI called QD kennels myself and a man picked up and I asked if they work closely with Sophie Stevens and he couldn't even tell me who that was and they don't have anyone of that name working for them.\n\nI was pissed!\n\nI called the next day and I didn't get an answer I left TWO voicemails, very polite ones at that just wanting to know my breeders information and a little more about QD Kennels.\n\nNo answer. No return call.\n\n\nTalk about shady.
