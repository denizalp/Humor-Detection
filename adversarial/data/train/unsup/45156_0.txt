If you haven't read fellow yelper Seth Y's review please do so immediately. Ok, now where was I? If you haven't seen this show yet fear not, you are only missing one of the best Cirque shows in Vegas. As many others pointed out this show would be about 100 times more entertaining with a bit of  ::ear muffs kids:: recreation drug use ::ok, we're good::\n\nCoincidentally I was sober when I saw this show and I still thought it was fucking amazing. The Beatles music in surround sound was fantastic and the acrobatics and lights added to the overall enjoyment of the show. What the hell are you waiting for?
