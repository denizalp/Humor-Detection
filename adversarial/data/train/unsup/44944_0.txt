Terrible food, terrible service. They actually rounded up all our items on our bill and added a service charge they couldn't tell us about when the other couple we dined with inquired about it. Their exact words were \"service charge is service charge\". \n\nOur order:\nBorscht soup $4.95\nCabbage rolls $14.95\nBeef trip soup $4.50\nMeat pierogis $8.00\n\nOur bill:\nBorscht soup $5\nCabbage rolls $15\nBeef trip soup $5\nMeat pierogis $8.00\nTotal : $32+ 13% tax + service charge = $40\n\nMy bf paid the bill before we even looked it over so they received $46.\n\nEat at your own risk, food is extremely bland and covered with butter (the tripe soup had a huge buttery film at the top and the pierogis were swimming in butter) and they'll put bogus charges on your final bill.
