I was very sad being a local and receiving the lack of service I received. We ordered at 12:50, never received our food until 1:50 and that was only after we asked about our food. Our server NEVER came to our table in that hour, not one time to check on us. When I tracked him down and asked him for our checks - he brought our checks and we said how disappointed we were. He shrugged his shoulders and said \"well we are busy\" We had to take our food as take out, very disappointed. Also disappointed that management also blew us off.
