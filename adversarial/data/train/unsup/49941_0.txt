I am sure this place has potential, but my one experience made the employees seem apathetic and uncaring. \n\nLocation: Near the Whole Foods in north Scottsdale. The woman in front of us in line was sporting all Louis Vuitton and heavy duty makeup. It's the place to be. \n\nSelection: Tons and tons of running shoes. There were treadmills where staff members could assess one's running gait and determine the best shoe.   \n\nService:  Lame.  There were at least five employees. One employee helped this woman and her child with a return for over 20 minutes. I had about four things to purchase.  There were other employees in the store, who could have easily assisted me.  The store lost about $50 worth of sales.   Numerous other employees could have come to help me make my purchase. \n\nI don't know that I would return here. The experience with this one time made me think that they are not interested in helping customers.
