In the twenty years I've been introducing dining padawans to Ethiopian food, I've come to the conclusion your first Ethiopian experience should be style over substance. Hear me out. For a cuisine that, from the get go, seems like a cruel punchline to a cruel joke on the order of a waitress calling your order of \"just water\" the Bobby Sands[1] Blue plate special to the actual appearance (piles of goop) to the method for consumption (eating piles of goop with your hands and an odd pancake substance that triples as your bread, your utensils, and your plate) ... well ... you can see there are more than a few hurdles you need to over come, especially with your \"but I just like to eat lasagna and not the lasagna they make at Francos because they put green peppers in it I don't know why they do that because they say well you can't taste it and I'm like then why put those green peppers in there so can't we just drive across town and have lasagna at Trevi's where I know they don't put green peppers in their sauce?\" friends.\n\nAnd, seriously, if your French Canadian grandmother slapped some of this stuff down in front of you in a green plastic bowl with some toasted Wonder Bread, you wouldn't touch the stuff. \n\nSo. Presentation is key. Detroit's Greektown had the perfect Ethiopian place The Blue Nile. Alas, like money, the Catholic church, and the middle class, The Blue Nile has fled Detroit for the burbs (http:\/\/www.bluenilemi.com\/bluenile\/7\/content.htm). No more jumping the tunnel bus and then the people mover to Trapper's Alley for a friend's first intro to great Ethiopian slop in a clean, pristine environment. And the women's washroom was legendary. Having boy parts, I never did get a look but every woman I ever took came back stunned and babbling. I could never get a clear explanation.\n\nToronto's best starter Ethiopian restaurant, for me, has been Ethiopian House http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/ethiopian-house-restaurant-toronto . Good central location, nicely appointed inside. The food I know is no comparison to the more decor-challenged places in the Bloor\/Ossington area. But like I say, get them comfy and then get them to Bloor\/Ossington for another foray.\n\nI decided to break my usual pattern with my coworker \"Chris\", his GF, and CUTE! Chinese Girl. \"Chris\" had a really rough week at work (sucks when your dad is the boss) and I promised him I'd buy him Ethiopian food on Friday. \"Chris\" despite his tender years is a pretty good foodie. I wasn't so sure about CUTE! Chinese Girl as she's never, ever, ever enjoyed any restaurant I've ever suggested but she might be homeless in a couple weeks and needs my couch and condo locker as a Plan B so she knew she had no leverage in this matter.  \"Chris\" gf was staying meatless this Good Friday and she seemed game.\n\nThe stars were aligning nicely.\n\nBased on Yelp research, Nazareth (a town historians aren't even sure existed at the time Jesus was supposed to be born there) Nazareth seemed like a good choice. Honestly, check out that photo of the veggie platter. That's presentation right there. \n\nI have to say, the Ossington Ethiopian district has stepped up their game since the 1990s. There were some pretty dingy places (although the food was always top notch). I remember one joint where a couple car seats (yes car seats)  were arranged around a mesob. Not a first date restaurant by anyone's stretch.\n\nDecor wise Nazareth also knocks it out of the park. Flavor wise. OMFG. I also like the napkin and wet nap bar. \n\nNazareth is a small and busy place. Be prepared to wait a long time for a table. Be prepared to wait a long time for your food. Getting a table can be a little unclear and chaotic. But after you take your seats, they know their stuff. Although getting the bill can be another odd wait. People are hovering nearby waiting for your table. You don't want to be one of THOSE diners that seem to linger over long at the table. Trying to be considerate, I asked for the bill right after my dining companions issued their final groans of \"full... so good\". Yes, even CUTE! Chinese Girl pronounced it the best food she's ever had in Toronto (with me). However, it took about another 15 minutes before the waitress managed to get the bill to the table. \n\n_________\n\n[1] http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bobby_Sands
