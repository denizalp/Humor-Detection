We really enjoy their food. The meat is moist and flavorful, plus they have a wide variety of sides. There's 3 BBQ sauce options: regular, sweet and spicy. We usually get all 3 and alternate which one we want for each bite, or I mix them to make my own flavor. \n\nService is usually pretty fast. The downside is that sometimes they have problems ringing up the order of someone ahead of you.  This last trip we had to wait while they figured out some a Dine n Dash order, by the time they had it figured out, our meat was stone cold.
