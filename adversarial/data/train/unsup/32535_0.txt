I have walked past this place a billion times and finally stopped in the other day. Now I have a \"go-to\" chinese food place! Everything I've ordered has been good. The portions are a good size and I always have leftovers. Service is quick and friendly. I haven't dined in and the dining room seems a little.. well good for a quick meal. Overall, it's cheap, quick, and delicious.. just the way I like it! :)
