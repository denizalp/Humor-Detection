Elote ice cream. That's corn flavored ice cream. I'm in love. It takes me back to Thailand where I had my first taste of corn ice dream and have yet to come across it again here in the US. The ice cream here did not disappoint. Creamy, rich and a nice flavor.\n\nThere are a ton of novel flavors to try and they let you sample as many as you'd like. Zapote negro was a flavor I had to google as it was a fruit I was unfamiliar with. The shop is tiny and a bit dingy but serves it's purpose. The clientele is authentically Hispanic. Great find for a unique treat.
