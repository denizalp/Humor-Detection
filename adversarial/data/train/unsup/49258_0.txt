Everything is so clean.  I'm not usually a fan of open air shopping,but there's a quite a bit of covering for inclement weather days.  Lots of shops my family and I like.  Friendly customer service at pretty much all the stores.  Parking can be a pain at times, but I don't generally like shopping with the crowds so no biggie.  \nThe only thing I don't like is the popcorn stand.  It really smells awful.  But hey!  There's a Starbucks too :)
