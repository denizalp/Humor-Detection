Don't come here on a low self-esteem day, cause you'll leave feeling ugly. All of the baristas (male and female) are gorgeous in addition to being friendly and able to make a stellar cappuccino ($2.25).\n\nThey sell Tea In The Sahara looseleaf tea here (one of the only places I've seen it - the other Dark Horse certainly doesn't), and 100 Mysteries is among my most favourite teas ever. $11.50 for a box of it if you prefer to make it at home. This tea managed to make me a coconut lover 4Life and I usually hate it (see also: Bounty bars).\n\nAs others have mentioned, the decor is beautiful. Dark leather TULLSTA chairs, lots of distressed wood and stiff backed swivel seats at a huge communal table where everyone reads the newspaper and works away on their laptops (except when they're Spanish exchange students, like tonight). Don't forget to look up (I only recently did) - the ceiling is covered in chandeliers and beautiful silver tin-leafed tiling. \n\nI would gladly dole out five stars if Dark Horse had more reasonable hours. 7pm close is too early for such a beautiful cafe in a bustling neighbourhood...I wanna hang out here late at night! There's always Prohibition next door...
