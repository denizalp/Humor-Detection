It is great sadness that I update my review.  I stopped in yesterday to pick up some shrimp for a pasta dish.  The place, which is normally clean, stunk terribly of rotten fish.  That should have been my warning to turn about-face and shop elsewhere, but I have always had luck here, so I went against my better judgment.  \n\nI was sold a pound of shrimp which were already bagged for $11.  On route home, I noticed that they were a bit smelly, but when I arrived at home and opened that plastic bag, I nearly gagged.  They instantly stunk up my kitchen!  Nasty!!!\n\nSo I called Bill's to ask what's up with the rotten shrimp they are selling and no one picked up the phone.  I left a message with my number, and no one called back.  That's really really bad customer service.\n\nI am afraid I revoke my perfect score and recommendation.
