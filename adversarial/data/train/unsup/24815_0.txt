This used to be my go-to pizza place back when I lived west side. Though on occasion we get pizza from there on our way to Surprise to visit by bff and its still just as awesome as I remember it. \n\nSeriously, this is not pizza for the faint of heart. Super thick, inverted topping pizza that's so tasty and so filling we dubbed it \"gut bomb\" since one slice will pretty much do you. Yes, the pizzas are that huge and dense! \n\nBeware though, the location is definitely iffy, so watch your back. However some places are worth the risk.
