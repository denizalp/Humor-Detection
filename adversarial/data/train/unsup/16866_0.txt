I make my yearly trip out to vegas for our fantasy football draft.  We usually stay at the mandalay, but I always get cheap if not free rooms at the luxor (which is within walking distance internally to Mandalay)....so we always end up walking past this burger bar.  \n\nBut ever since we saw it, we visit it every year.  We should be making our annual trip soon...but figured I would review it so I can update it later with my Kobe experience.\n\nI usually get the American Classic $12.75\nRidgefield farm beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion, on sesame bun and that thing is delicious.  \n\nOr you can make your own and add topings as you wish.  This burger really hits the spot right before or during the draft.  Sometimes there is a wait as it is pretty popular.\n\nI will have to revisit and update on how it tastes compared to the burger places I've been to in so cali....and I will try the kobe this year.
