Really cute shop at the intersection in Chinatown. Right when you step into the store, you will see the donut showcase right away. My friend and I came here just after closing time, not knowing the hours and right when we opened the door, one of them said that we were closed. But the same person asked us if we were just here to buy donuts and we said yes so they allowed is to do so. That was really nice of them to do that even though there were done with customers for the day. I do frequent this location for donuts when I don't feel like having donuts from Tim's. I stick with the original glazed as it comes with enough coating and it doesn't taste as sweet as the other donuts.
