For some reason, I find it totally unreasonable to pay over $20 for any kind of roasted chicken at a restaurant.  I guess when you can just buy a whole roasted chicken at the supermarket for $7 or so...its just ridiculous to spend any more for that.  No one remembers the best chicken they ever had anyways.\n\nBUT...most people can remember the best steak.  This was not the best steak I ever had but still pretty good.  I was surprised the 1st review gave it 2 stars but then I looked at what they had ordered (salmon and chicken) and I understand why.  Beef is the specialty here.  Its like someone ordering salmon at Peter Luger's or something.  I had the porterhouse, wife had the filet.  Nice place.  I remember the bread being pretty good too.  I always enjoy the Lake Las Vegas area.  Its such a nice getaway for a day or 2.
