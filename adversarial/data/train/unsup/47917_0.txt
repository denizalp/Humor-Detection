LOVE this theater! I only go during the week for $5 shows, so I cannot attest to the admission prices on the weekend. Personally I like avoiding the weekend crowds so you couldn't pay me to go on a Friday or Saturday, but to each his own. The theater has always been clean and the seats are very comfortable. Employees are friendly and helpful. Yes, the concessions are a little high but I don't know of a theater that isn't. Bottom line is that I always have a pleasant, relaxing time when I go here and it's my favorite in the area.
