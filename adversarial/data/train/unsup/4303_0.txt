Today I called to find out why my lug nut key was never given back to me after getting my tires rotated there. The sales manager refused to listen to me and to give me his name after asking three times at which point he hung up on me. The operator refused to give me his name. My friend called 20 minutes later to get his name and the operator even spelled the name out. \n\nTodd Mesenburg\n\nI spoke to the general manager Dan Archer who said the key is not his problem and that I lost it. It is going to cost me over $400 to have them broken and new ones applied.  \n\nPoor post purchase customer care.  A bunch of 8==D's
