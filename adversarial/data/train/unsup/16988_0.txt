24 hours of all you can eat meals for $50?   GREAT!  So so so not.\n\nEven the most high end hotels participating in this deal serve essentially the same foods with a few differences. (I went to Imperial Palace, Harrahs, and Paris)\n\nThis is also an example of where quality suffers due to quantity.  I felt forced to eat meal after meal of cafeteria food. After the new-ness of crab legs, dessert bars, and infinite selection wore off, eating at buffet of buffets seemed more like an obligation than a pleasure.\n\nBy the end I was really really sad I had to eat at one of these buffets...again... \n\nBut if you are looking for volume of sustenance at a low cost, this is the deal for you!  As someone who would rather have less, more high quality food, this made me sorta sad...
