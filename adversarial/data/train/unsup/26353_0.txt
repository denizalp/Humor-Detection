We went here for the Wicked Weed Beer dinner. It was a good crowd and although I didn't care for half of the beers the food was very good. I feel like they could've used another server as it was a large group. I was impressed that the chefs were able and willing to adjust there courses to different people's dietary needs. I will definitely go to another. The only thing I didn't like was that between courses they did not exchange the silverware. I feel like they should've at least gave you a new fork for dessert. Also extra napkins were never offered or delivered when requested. To be fair there was only one server taking care of 60 people. She only had help busing and delivering courses. I still feel like she did a great job as did the chefs. We had a good time and will be back again so thanks to the chefs
