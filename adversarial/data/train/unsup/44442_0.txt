I love coming to lucki thai, this is my go to spot when I'm craving comfort food after a rough day at school. There Tom Kah and there lucki thai fried rice are my favorites but occasionally I'll do the thai beef noodle soup or pad Thai. Never had a bad meal at this place , service is excellent although the restaurant is pretty small so I would suggest making a. Reservations if you are a big party.  Located next to fresh and easy by Silverado and Bermuda.
