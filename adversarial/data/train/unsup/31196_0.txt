This buffet is decent and well priced for a Vegas buffet experience. I personally enjoy Wynn, Planet Hollywood, and Rio for a really great buffet BUT the prices are not cheap. Flavors is $23.77 and if you have a club member card they will shave off $2...hey, that goes far on the penny slots! :)\n\nThey have salad, sea food (crab legs are pretty good), Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and other random American food. The desserts are okay, nothing spectacular. They have a large variety of French pastries but they are disappointing. The Creme Brulee taste more like flan, and the cheesecake is mushy. The best is their ice cream\/gelato and cotton candy bar so stick to that. \n\nI like this buffet but I don't love it and it's definitely not the best on the strip.
