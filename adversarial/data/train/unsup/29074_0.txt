My friend wanted a new car-well not new but pre-owned and I found a low mileage 2016 Honda Civic EX I had researched due to options and the overall reliability of the car. They had it at a reasonable price. A nice salesman named Rick helped me when I called and texted me his info. We arrived to look at the car. My friend had an older car and they actually gave her what I requested for it to save her the hassle of trying to sell it. I asked for a break down of the final out the door price with no extras. CJ the manager was great and straight to the point. No pressure. Burt in finance\/titles was great too and they made the process so easy. My friend loves her car. Thank you Coulter Infiniti for making the car buying experience pleasant and hassle free.
