Yes, Kawartha Lakes Dairy ice cream is delicious.  I was super happy to find out it was being sold in my neighbourhood.  \n\nHowever, the service is a little bit lacking most times I'm in there - I haven't visited once (out of 4 - 5 visits) where I didn't have to wait a couple minutes for no apparent reason.  I mean, if there's a lineup, that's one thing, but that was never really the issue.
