Sadly, this past Saturday was my last visit to this theater. My family and I frequented this establishment over the years, especially when the Monroe theater closed. We loved the location and the loyalty rewards. My Instagram account is filled with pics of my kids in front of the theater on several family outings.\n\nI work 60 hours a week. My daughter wanted to have a girl's night out. It was opening weekend for the movie we chose. By the time we used the restrooms and got concessions, the theater was packed. Yes, we could have gotten there half an hour early to get seats. However, my tight work schedule didn't allow for this as I came straight from work and my husband had to drop her off at the theater. \n\nMy complaint with the theater is that there was a staff member inside the theater along with security. Multiple couples came in after us. All of us are walking up and down the aisles to find seats together. The staff nor security made any attempt to help us locate seats. Nor did they say anything to the people holding multiple seats at a time (and there was a lot of this going on.)\n\nNeedless to say, my daughter and I had to sit on different aisles as none of the other patrons were willing to scoot down a seat so we could sit together. What we hoped to be a fun night out and quality time together ended up being a disappointment. You can't rely on people being decent these days anymore than you can count on good customer service. \n\nIt is apparent this theater, once the go to place in the area due to its location, now seems terribly outdated. My family and friends will now be taking our business to newer theaters with reclining seats you can reserve in advance. Had Stone Theaters had this option, we could have guaranteed we'd be sharing that large popcorn together.
