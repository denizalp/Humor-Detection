Kat & Cat are the best!  Today I tried a few apps instead of pizza.  The Fried Green Tomatoes are always fantastic so that was a definite!  I also ordered this delish Honey Sausage app, added a bit of red pepper flakes & viola!  Mmm!  I couldn't decide on what else to order so Kat said how about the Fried Calamari w\/ half original & half spicy.  Perfect since she knows I love spicy!  She also remembers exactly what my parents are going to order, the Tony Two Times lol.  \n\nLarge appetizer portions & a great way to try something new at a pizza place when you aren't feeling like a huge pizza.  I also like their Gorgonzola salad & Clams & linguine if you're looking for something different.
