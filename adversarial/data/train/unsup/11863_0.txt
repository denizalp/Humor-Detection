Dude if you got the time to sit and wait I highly recommend it it took a while because there's only one lady working but at the same time trust me this place is wwwwworth the wait! \n\nJust one word for me wow!!!\n\n\nI got that big ass bacon burger and let me tell you it's pretty big the cheese is unbelievable and if you need more bacon then you might as well just go eat the pig Lol \n\nThis is one of those highly recommended I mean if you're on the strip and you're reading this you should take a cab you won't regret it unless you don't like awesome American food! \n\nPeace
