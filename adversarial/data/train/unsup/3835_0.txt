I rating 5 stars to counter the hysterical person who unfairly gave a bad rating. \n\nAlthough I have not been in this store in YEARS, I have a situation where I need them. I have had 2 cats disappear, both had tags identifying that they were fixed and had info on the tags to return them to their owner (me). I just recently had to spend $150 on one of my cats who appears to have a stab mark. Initially I though it was a dog bit but the vet shaved back the hair on the wound and said it looked like a knife mark.\n\nI know my neighbor has an extremely bad temper. He beats his dogs because I can hear him clearly. He's always yelling in his house. To make a long story short, I am afraid my cats bare the brunt of his temper. I know my cats jump on his car and he absolutely hates it. I heard him say \"get the f*** off there\" and chase one of them. He looked surprised to see me quietly sitting in my chair in the front yard. So, two animals I loved and spent money a lot of money on are gone forever, and another one has a knife wound. I think it's time to start pointing some hidden cameras. \n\nTo the rude person above. THIS IS HOW THEY STAY IN BUSINESS EVERY MONTH BESIDES OCTOBER.
