I was referred to fresh cut romance and it was one of the easiest and best decisions i made last week.\n\ni needed the arrangement to be simple, elegant, chic, urban, funky, modern, fun, classy and whatever weird adjective popped into my head at the time. it needed to be small with a $40 price point. \n\nI went in that afternoon and  told the awesome girl working there those exact words along with the occassion for the flowers. i was literally only there for about 2 minutes and i could tell she just understood what ever gibberish was coming from my mouth. she 'got' me.\n\nshe said it would be ready by 5 and that i could pick it up same day. my hero. \n\nI showed up at 5 and i think it was the owner  working there now, and she said, \"are you samantha?\" wow! they keep on top of it! then she walked to the fridge and pulled out the most gorgeous chic arrangement and they stayed in the price point. they were able to read my mind and then some! \n\nexactly how a florist should be! \n\nWe chatted it up for a while and she was seriously so awesome. I will definitely be returning for all my floral needs. You can see the final product in the pictures. I brought it to dinner and everyone was like, 'wow! i had no idea there was a florist in AZ who could create something so modern!'
