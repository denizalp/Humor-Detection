I came here a little while back.  The salesman brought me 2 options for suits, and both were terrible.  He said they don't have anything that's big enough for me.  This was odd, since I'm average height, and even if I may be a little on the chubby side (especially during the cold Canadian winter), I'm by no means the largest guy to ever buy a suit.  To add insult to injury, the salesman even said that no place would have a suit for me, and that I would have to have one tailor made.  Needless to say, I was totally embarrassed.  \n\nI went instead to Harry Rosen, where they treated me like a million bucks.  The salesman was very accommodating and flattering and brought out many suit options, insisting he can do better with yet other options.  I ended up spending a good chunk of of money on a very nice and flattering designer suit.  Let me tell you, it was worth every penny.
