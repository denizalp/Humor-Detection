I bought two bikes here (both over $2500..and considering I am not old an established you'dve thought they would try and keep me as a continuing customer?). First experience was great, hence I bought the second. \n\nSecond bike, I ordered in, it took 3 times as long to get there as they promised (not their fault, but don't make promises you can't keep) \n\nThe sales guy was pompous (must've been a roadie...) and on top of that the bike did not fit well. Partially my fault, but they are suppose to be the experts. \nI was peeved and have not returned.
