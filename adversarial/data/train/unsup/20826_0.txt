i've wanted to see a cirque show for some time now and this was the first cirque show for my friend and i.. we got discount tix at one of those booths 2 hrs before the show.. our seats were first section, left side and being on the side wasn't bad.. we actually couldv'e gotten second section seats and it would've been fine bc the stage wasn't that far up.. \n\nwithin a min of starting the show i knew my friend would get bored and fall asleep.. lo and behold, i was right haha.. there's a storyline to this show but there were parts of it i just wasn't interested in.. there were a few scenes i loved though because of the bright lights and visuals.. \n\nthe show is 1.5 hr with no intermission.. which was good so my friend would be put out of their misery.. glad ka was our first show to watch together.. now, on to the next! le reve, zumanity, o..
