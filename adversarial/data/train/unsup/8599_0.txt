Writing a 4 star review only because I know I wasn't able to see everything they have to offer. My family and I came here during the Johnny appleseed festival. So they were very busy. Lots to offer here though, I assume most of it was because the festival was going on. \n\nThe biggest attraction is the slide near the top of the farm. It's labeled the world tallest slide. And it is very fun. I took my son down it twice and I've never seen him so happy. They have this long corn maze that's a joy to walk through. And the general scenery, it's gorgeous. Anyone with young children should definitely come here. If not for the scenery and slide? For the fresh produce they have.
