Amazing cookies & amazing service!\n\nI ordered 24 mixed shortbread cookies for my office online. I indicated that there's someone with a peanut allergy upon ordering. Mary personally called me to ask about the allergy and indicated that she would separate the nutty shortbreads from the others during packaging. \n\nI am located in Waterloo, even though Mary indicated that she only shipped to the GTA region on her website, she was able to make an exception for me (upon agreeing that she will not be held responsible if cookies were harmed during delivery). I expected a couple of crumbles during shipment, and I was thoroughly surprised when I received the package. It came with a fragile sticker, bubble wrap, lots of paper stuffing, and each cookie INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED in shrink wrap. Not a single cookie was harmed! Koodos to the delivery company as well, they were able to grab a hold of me, change the delivery address to my company just so I am able to receive the delivery personally instead of waving a tag around and picking it up the next day.\n\nMy office would not stop raving about how great these cookies are, people are breaking their diets for them! ;)
