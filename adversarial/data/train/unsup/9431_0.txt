SWEET SUSHI I think I may have found my spot! Stumbled upon this hidden gem located Downtown near the arts district on a Friday night. There's no signage above the spot other that a sign right on the Windows so you'd have to look for other landmarks. (Hint: it's right around the corner from the Commonwealth bar and there's a hotel sign right above)\n\nFrom the hostess who sat us down at the sushi bar to the waitress and the busser, I'd have to say all 3 were very attentive.  Our Sushi Chef's name was John and man oh man John was definitely THE MAN of the night! We sat at the bar to watch him at his craft and it was definitely an artistry (see pics posted).  We started with the Kampachi Sashimi which I have no words for. It was simply perfect and melted right in my mouth. Next was a soft shell crab hand roll topped with salmon. The salmon was like butter as you bite into a crispy soft shell crab. We had quite a bit more after these but the rest is history as I could go on and on. My advice is you have to just go there and see for yourself because everything was great!
