Decided to have my birthday dinner here because the concept of building your own dish appealed to me. \n\nIt did start off on the wrong foot. I wanted to make reservations because I had a party of 10 but every time I called there would be no answer. I finally went on the website and sent an email. Got an email back from Joshua stating everything is good to go. I get there and they had no idea of my reservations. After that I though about leaving but everyone was already on the way. The place was on the warmer side they opened the doors but it was mid July and it was about 120 degrees at 7pm.\n\nService was pretty quick and drinks came flowing and we started to loosen up. They had live music, I think his name was Keith. He was awesome. He bought me a teKILLya shot and he took song requests. The food was pretty alright. It wasn't anything amazing. I think the drinks were actually better than the actual food. And you can get a free dessert with a check in I got the creme brûlée which was probably at the bottom of my list on taste. \n\nI had a great time at this restaurant that is why I gave it 4 stars but if I had to rate it with food alone I would take a star off.
