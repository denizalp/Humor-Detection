Came to Triple 7 with a buddy from Hawaii, post-workout meal time!!\n\nWhat can be better than some food, some beer, and some sports??  Visited Triple 7 on a busy Saturday, they didn't disappoint!  Gotta love cheat day - treat yo'self!  Got me a killer sandwich & a beer:\n\n-Prime Rib & Swiss Melt ($11.99) - slow roasted, shaved prime rib, on a warm steak roll with Swiss cheese & sauteed onions, served with a side of au jus and crispy French fries\n-Black Chip Porter ($5.75 for a large 23 oz.!) - for dark beer lovers, smooth, roasted blend of 5 malts gives it flavors of coffee, dark chocolate & caramel\n\nOh man this lunch hit the spot!  The Prime Rib & Swiss Melt was on-target delicious!  Tender prime rib, melty cheese, all dipped in flavorful au jus?  Totally worth the calories!  The Black Chip Porter held its own as well, has always been my favorite beer at Triple 7!  Did you know - dark beers are great for post-workouts because the flavonoids help fight muscle soreness and fatigue?  Well now you know!\n\nWas excellent catching up with my homie from Hawaii over some food & beer.  To top it all off - that day Hawaii won the Little League World Series!  And we were able to watch it all unfold at Triple 7!
