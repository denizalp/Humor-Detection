It surprises me that the Flying Biscuit has a such a middling average rating.  It's always been one of my favorite chain restaurants, and it doesn't even feel like a chain unless you know that multiples exist.  Service is friendly and attentive... even after the last time we went, when I accidentally elbowed our waitress in the stomach.  No crying or cursing; she very graciously accepted my apology and continued on.\n\nI felt horrible and left her an extra-big tip, by the way.\n\nThe food isn't cheap, but it's not outrageously expensive, either.  You can get a breakfast with an egg dish, grits, and a biscuit for about $8.  Are people really complaining that's too expensive?  I must be eating in the wrong places, because that seems pretty dang reasonable to me.  For breakfast, I usually get either the Meggixcan Wrap, which has just the right amount of early-morning heat, or the Piedmont Omelet, which actually makes turkey bacon sound good.  Speaking of turkey, if you're going for dinner, you *must* try the turkey meatloaf.  Probably the best I've had: moist and topped with salsa... delicious.\n\nThe sides are good too.  The biscuits are lighter than the usual southern fare, but I think they're good, and the grits are indeed a creamy dream.  \n\nThe only downside to this location is that it's small.  This leads to short waits during peak hours and to elbowing waitresses in the stomach. \n\nI am sorry I elbowed you in the stomach, Flying Biscuit Waitress.
