I finally visited this facility and I had a great time. If you are a fan of American racing heritage and some modern American small-block V8s, this is a place you should definitely visit.\nIt's very interesting how you can actually order a Shelby Cobra here and take it to the DMV and have it registered as a 1965 model, due to some grandfathering laws!\nThey have tours twice a day, one at 10:30am and one at 1:30pm (except Sundays) and they are free! Not a bad way to spend 1.5 hours of your day.
