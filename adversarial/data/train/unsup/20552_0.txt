I'm kind of surprised at the low ratings here, because I thought this was an okay place to eat at. My very first time here was when they first opened, and there were tons of people waiting for seats. I would say their system for who came first isn't too great, but there was only one host and they seemed to remember who was the first one here, so it all worked out.\n\nLe Viet is a rather large pho shop, with cubbies on the side and regular tables in the middle. We got their special beef rice noodle soup ($8.95 for the regular), ($10.95 for the large). Their noodles aren't too soggy, and their portions are huge! The soup was fairly hot throughout.\n\nWe also got their Hainan Rice Chicken, ($10.50). The chicken was really smooth and juicy, the portion of the rice was large and tasty with ginger. I really enjoyed it. \n\nWe also got their drip coffee, I am not a coffee drinker at all, so I can't tell you about this option.
