I wish I could write two reviews for Dandelion Market-one for the upstairs and one for the downstairs because it was two completely different vibes.\n\nI absolutely loved the downstairs area and wish I could have stayed there all night. Open seats at the bar on a Saturday night along with a friendly bartender with some football playing is all I really need in life. It had a chill vibe, exposed brick walls and  music playing just loud enough to enjoy but you could hear another speak and just seemed like a cozy atmosphere. One of my friends I was with is pregnant and the bartender Amanda whipped up a special alcohol free concoction for her. Can I please just stay downstairs forever enjoying my Shocktop?\n\nThe answer-no. We had a large party and wanted to sit down to eat and our table was upstairs  I really wanted to love this place but the upstairs kinda killed it for me. I didn't even know there was an upstairs area but when we got there, I wanted to go into the corner and crawl into a fetal position. It was like every 25 yr old hipster in town was there and every guy seemed to have either a vintage blazer and John Edwards hair (or sometimes both--eek!)  It wasn't a place to eat, it was a bar area! They had  large booths and I was sitting on the outside and kept getting elbowed by some randoms doing shots. Server was nice but they seemed to be out of alot of stuff by 9P. I got the flatbread and house salad which were both ok but nothing to write home about. The flatbread seemed more like a mini pizza than flatbread and the salad had about seven to eight pieces of lettuce with some cranberries and dressing. I could find a better salad elsewhere for $6. I just wanted to finish my meal so I could get the hell back downstairs. \n\nI'll probably check out Dandelion again for lunch during the week or an after work drink but no way will I be venturing into hipster hell upstairs again!
