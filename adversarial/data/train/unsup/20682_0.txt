I've finally walked into this place and I love it! David's Tea has so many tea options, it's so exciting! They have black, green, white, oolong, pu'erh, roobios, herbal, and mate teas with so many interesting and unique flavours. Personally, I'm addicted to their pumpkin chai tea, it's so yummy!\n\nThis particular location is rather small and narrow. There about three tiny tables in the front, a long counter with tea samples being offered by kind and enthusiastic ladies. Behind the ladies there is an entire wall full of teas in silver canisters. The opposite wall has a display of tea-cups, strainers, tea books, tea pots and more for sale- I found these items to be a bit on the pricey side though.\n\nThe workers here try to help you find a tea that you may like. They take the canisters of tea off the walls for you to smell in order to help you make a satisfying decision. Once you've picked out your tea, they will steep it for you in a cup and you'll have the option of putting agave nectar to sweeten the tea and milk\/soy options. They don't charge for soy unlike other places. The tea is inexpensive, healthy and delicious!\n\nMy only problem is that many people are sniffing out of the tea canisters. The tea that is steeped for us is the tea that people have their mouths so close to and breathing over. I just find that a tad bit gross.\n\nOverall, a great place to get reasonably priced, good quality tea offered by helpful and friendly staff. There is something for everyone; even coffee drinkers will enjoy this place.
