Fantastic handmade Chinese noodle restaurant near the Eaton's Centre. The noodles come in 6 sizes and are the perfect texture and consistency. The soup is extremely delicious and they give you the option if you would like to add cilantro to your soup.\n\nThey have the most simple menu with just two items for the main dishes.\n\n I will 100% be back here.
