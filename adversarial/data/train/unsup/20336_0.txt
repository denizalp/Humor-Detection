There are a few things in this world that just have to be seen to be believed. There are just certain sites that words or pictures cannot do justice, for example: The Pyramids at Giza, Niagara Falls, the Grand Canyon etc. Well, we can just go ahead and add the Summerhill location of the LCBO to that list. \n\nI had heard many great things about this LCBO but nothing did it true justice. This place is simply magnificent, my own personal Mecca!  This place puts all other LCBO's to shame both in its size and vast selection. The beer selection, MY GOD THE BEER SELECTION! Their beer section is basically the size of a small liquor store in itself. They have virtually any beer my alcoholic heart desires, with a great selection of local, international and seasonal beers. For the wine drinkers they have the equivalent of a large LCBO for their wine department including a whole room of vintages and a sampling bar. In addition as one would expect the liquor selection is top notch as well. If you cannot find something at this location then it is probably not available in Ontario. \n\nI'm so in love with this place, even though I don't live anywhere close I will venture here the next time my beer fridge is empty because why go to the rest when you can go to the best. \n\nNow excuse me while I go and start a campaign to make this a UNESCO world heritage site.
