I would never go to or recommend Newport Motors. We went in to this establishment to look at grand caravans to pay cash for a car. First off the lady that was helping us at first sat on her computer tracing my cell phone on where we had been. Very rude and disgusting!!!! I told the sales person Miles what I would pay for a car and what I wanted in the car. Well he had this nosey lady bring up this van that was a piece of crap and was over what I said I was going to pay.  I looked at the van then went in to find what they wanted. I told Miles he was waisting my time!!!!! I  didn't Appreciate the noncence this used car establishment pull on people!! DON'T USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE RIDICULOUS!!!!!!
