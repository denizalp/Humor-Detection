Was meeting up with some friends for lunch and Shangri La Chinse was the place picked, it was around 2pm on a Sunday, and the place wasn't too busy and was seated right away.\n\nAfter looking at the menu we noticed that the lunch specials were daily, from 11am to 4pm, we thought that was nice because most places only have lunch specials during the week.\n\nI went with lunch special of the day, the Amazing Chicken, it came with side salad, choice of egg drop or hot & sour soup, egg roll, fried chicken wing and choice of steamed or fried rice. I went with hot & sour soup and fried rice. The amazing chicken was saut√©ed white meat with mixed veggies in a tangy sweet spicy sauce. It was good. Just need a little more heat for me.\n\nWhen we ordered our soup, our server asked us if we would like the hot chili and mustard and I said yes but it was never brought out to our table. Service was polite, but just kind of slow, like they forgot about us. \n\nEveryone enjoyed their dishes, and we liked that the lunch specials are every day and I am sure this will become a new lunch spot for us to meet up at.
