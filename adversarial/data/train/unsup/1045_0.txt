Weeeeeeeeeeeeell, here's the thing. \nWhen you walk into an Anthropologie you need to know what you're getting  into: \n1. Overpriced wares that you probably don't need.\n2. That are uber trendy.\n3. And will look very out of place in 6 months. \nIt's exactly what I was looking for, exactly why I went, but my experience was super lame. Their housewares instead of consolidated to one area as is typical in their stores is spread out. It was extremely difficult to navigate and even harder to tolerate because there wasn't anyone there to point out where I could find shower curtains. I canvased the entire store (you have to because again there are towels over here, plates over there, dishes next to blouses and napkin rings by the capri pants) and still came up short. I decided after frantically searching for 15 minutes and not able to find a single person to ask it was time to move on. \nBummer too. I really wanted an overpriced uber trendy out of style in six months shower curtain for my new bathroom.
