I have been here quite a few times now. I really love the ground beef kebob, but the wood oven really gives the pizzas a nice flavour. It is pretty busy at lunch, I personally prefer coming in the evening for a nice sit down meal. The price overall is quite reasonable. I would definitely, without a doubt, recommend the place.
