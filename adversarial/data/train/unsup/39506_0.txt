Simply one of the best brunch spots in Las Vegas.  The unlimited food is quite tasty and the bottomless champagne mixtures (mimosa, pomegranate, peach, prickly pear, watermelon, blood orange, strawberry, etc-- try them all if you can!) are very fun.  Although not a traditional breakfast food, be sure to order the BBQ sliders- delish!  Best of all, the prices aren't bad and the view over the Mandalay Bay pool \"lazy river\" is pretty nice as well.  Don't miss out on the Shark Reef either-- it's right by the restaurant and has a locals discount.
