I have been taking my daughter to classes here 3x\/week for 2 months. She loves it! I highly recommend the baby swim classes. It is amazing how much and how quickly the kids learn to be comfortable in the water.\n\nThe experience level of the instructor makes a huge difference, so if you go and don't like the classes, it is worth trying a different instructor. Our favorites are Madison and Jordan. (I haven't met all the other instructors, since not all of them teach the baby classes.)\n\nThe baby pool varies slightly in temperature from one time to another, but it is always comfortable. I'm mentioning it because I saw a review that said the water was cold, but I have not personally experienced that.
