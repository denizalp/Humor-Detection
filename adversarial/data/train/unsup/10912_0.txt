I'm revising my review after my last appointment didn't even happen because the stylist was over 45 minutes late to my appointment. I had an appointment at 11:30 in the morning, and had still not been seen by 12:15. When I inquired with the front desk about my appointment, he rudely informed me that the hair stylist had at least 20 more minutes left on her current hair cut and style and that I would have to wait. This brought the total waiting time in at over an hour, so I left. Nobody was apologetic or sympathetic in the slightest. \n\nHugely disappointing and I would give zero stars if possible. Waiting is always an issue when I've gone, and it's gotten to the point where it's not worth my time. Not to mention that the employees do not care even the tiniest amount about customer satisfaction, as they are students and don't have any long-term investment in the place. The prices are great, but if you value your time in the slightest, I would avoid this place like the plague.
