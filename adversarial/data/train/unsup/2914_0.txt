I never thought I'd see a tourist trap in Cleveland. To start, it took forever to get in (4 hours + to be exact) and it was over priced and tacky.  Luckily The East Bank of The Flats has other places to go.  \n\nThe  $13 Cheeseburger in Paradise was equivalent to the quarter pounder from McDonald's and the calamari was chewy like a plate of fried rubber o-rings.\n\nI was expecting some cool, laid back place from a Jimmy Buffet song but instead I found a Caribbean decorated version of Applebees.
