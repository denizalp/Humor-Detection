So glad I booked a room here. The price was definitely fair for being a suite on holiday weekend and also for being so close to the strip - it was a short walk, about a half a mile. It was also updated, clean, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I've been to Vegas several times now, and this was by far the biggest bang for my buck. I'll definitely be staying here in the future.
