It's crawfish season!  Lola's get their live crawfish flown in on a Thursday and is ready to be served to customers that day and Friday.  If you are lucky and there is still the supply, you can enjoy it on a Saturday, but don't gamble and just rsvp for a Friday to be safe.\n\nThat's what I did, so Earl and I dine here on a Friday.  The price per pound of crawfish is $10.99.  I ordered 2lbs for myself and Earl ordered the catfish plate with garden veggies, sweet potato fries, an gouda grits.\n\nEach lb of crawfish comes with a potato and a corn on a cob.  Since it is still the beginning of the crawfish season, they are still small in size.  So yes, it's more work to peel each one, but the meat is still sweet and full of flavor.  It got a bit salty for me so I had to eat it with a bite of potato\/corn on the cob to balance out the saltiness.  I also had the delicious sweet tea with my meal...I had to.  2lb of crawfish was enough for me.  \n\nWhile I was still finishing up my pail of crawfish, Earl ordered the Fig newton with butter pecan ice cream.  I took a bite of his dessert and I halted my consumption of crawfish to ensure I get my share of this delectable dessert.  It was so good!  It's no ordinary fig newton...it was fig newton on steroids!  But that combination with butter pecan ice cream was genius.  After we finished the dessert, I went back to finish my crawfish.\n\nIt was a delicious dinner and it satisfied my crawfish cravings.
