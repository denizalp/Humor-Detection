If you want your appliances in a timely fashion, go somewhere else!!!!\n\nThis makes over three weeks that this company has not been able to deliver and install the new washer purchased by the home warranty company. \n\nWeek 1: they said our water valve needed to be replaced, plumber repairs within 24 hours but Barlow cannot deliver for over a week. \n\nWeek 2: they arrive to deliver washer, open box and it is damaged and must order new one...One week later Barlow gets a new washer, \n\nWeek 3: can't deliver for two more days after it comes in due to their schedule; today- Day of delivery we are available for scheduled time of 1-4pm; @ 4pm no-show and called to find out delivery on way and arrive at 4:30pm, @ 4:30 told it will be 5pm; call at almost 5 pm and they say we cancelled appointment because I can't stay home at 5pm. I cancel my appointment and tell her to call delivery to head over- 10 minutes on hold and she comes back on and says they are still installing dryer over 30 minutes away so they will deliver Monday. I told her not acceptable since we haven't had a washer now for over 3 weeks. She takes my number to speak to supervisor about delivery tomorrow (4\/14\/17) and yes you guessed it- no phone call!
