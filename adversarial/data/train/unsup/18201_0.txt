Need a little bit of an adrenaline kick and the night club scene and red bull vodkas aren't quite doing it? I'd suggest the \"Driving Experience.\" Having driven some pretty fast cars in my time, I can tell you that there's nothing like the ride you'll experience in one of these nascars. My balls were in my stomach and I almost screamed like a little girl when the rubber hit the tarmac and we were going 160mph+.  I loved the experience of it! Except the part where you \"gear up\"..if you crashed into a wall at 160+, will the gear really help? (I dont mean to sound grim). Anyways, it felt short because at 3 laps and less than 1 minute each, that makes the whole experience only a few minutes! =(.I would definitely keep going back if I could afford it though...hopefully next time from the driver's seat though. =D
