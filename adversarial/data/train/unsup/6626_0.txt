Mike Sullivan there I would never go to in my life. He is the most unprofessional human being I have ever come in contact with. Along with his assistant. I made an appointment to cut out my lip filler. They then told me that they would not be able to do the day I was scheduled and switched my appointment. Which ruined my whole month because I was going out of town. I canceled my trip to have my surgery and rescheduled. They rescheduled me for a different day. Which I accepted. Then when I came in to pay they said that they wouldn't be able to work on me because I missed the original appointment that they cancelled. In fact they REFUSED to work on me. Mike Sullivan is incredibly unprofessional! I would NOT make an appointment to go see him. I urge anyone who reads this to reconsider going here. Clearly they do not care about their patients.
