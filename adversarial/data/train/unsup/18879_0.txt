6\/8\/12\n\nAll that we tried from here were simply terrific!  If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars.  :)  So, why not give five stars outright?  I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...\n\nWe came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases.  The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier.  All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items.  This gave the place a bistro feel.  I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it.  Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it.  We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast\/brunch.  I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy.  \n\nSince Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA#HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA  Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte.  I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL.  Among the boxed pastries we took to go http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw#9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw, I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws.  My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one.  They seemed very rich...  I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on.  :)\n\nAs for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw#TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw  Mom and  I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.\n\nYes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!\n\np.s.  Amelie's is open 24\/7!
