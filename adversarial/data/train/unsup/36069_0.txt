One star because I cannot award less. Our reservation was for 8:30 at Caesars.. when the shuttle was not yet there by 8:40 we called to find out where it was. We were told they were picking up passengers at Bellagio and we could walk over there to catch the bus!!! WALK UPSTAIRS, OVER A BRIDGE, DOWN STAIRS, SCHLEPPING LUGGAGE BECAUSE IT WAS MORE CONVENIENT FOR CLS?????  The insipid driver finally arrived and informed us they don't pick up at 8:30. WHAT???? She radioed dispatch and told them she just picked up 6 that were giving her a hard time, what should she do with us? REALLY???? Then she informed us there were 3 more stops along the way when there were only two empty seats left.  WHAT????  Honestly, what if anything was RIGHT about this?  When we didn't tip this horrible driver she awarded us the dirty look of the year and smirked at us muttering something vulgar under her breath and sarcastically waiving *goodbye*  In a town dependent on tourism, being nice to customers is not an OPTION.  CLS seems to be unaware of this little fact.
