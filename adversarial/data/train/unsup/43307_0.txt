I have had a great experience at Whole Body Health and really appreciate having Drs. Tim and Amanda Weeks as my chiropractors.  They are both excellent and really take their time with patients to help you correct the problems you're having.  I really love that they build nutrition and lifestyle advice into their services.  The office staff and front desk are really friendly and responsive whenever you have a question.  To top it all off, the people at the front desk were extremely helpful to me when I had questions about some of their nutritional products and went out of their way to help me.  I wish every doctors office was this amazing to go to!
