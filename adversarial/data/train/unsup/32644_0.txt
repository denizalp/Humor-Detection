I finally found someplace that serves Lebanese\/Mediterranean food here after 4 months of looking. The food was actually really good. I ordered the fattoush salad with chicken shawarma. My only real complaint regarding the food was I wish the shawarma was shredded but that's really it. The salad was on point and the rolled pita was really tasty. The service was nice, not super fantastic but it was perfect for a lunch date.
