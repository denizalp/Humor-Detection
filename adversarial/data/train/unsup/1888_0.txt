I am new to Las Vegas - off the strip. My choices are in over priced salons inside hotels, salons that are unsanitary and do HORRIBLE work. I mean a gel manicure lasting 3 days! I have been to Polished 4 times. Today I hit traffic and was 3 minutes late for a manicure and pedicure.,they did not want to give me the manicure - I told them that's what I wanted and cxl my pedi. 3 minutes late? Are you serious?? Another time I made an appt online, drove 25 min and denied. I want to love this place, but what happened to customer service and loyalty. I feel sorry for the technicians there. It's like a chop shop ran by evil people. $75 for a gel manicure and pedicure. $5.00 extra to barely remove calluses? There has to be a clean FRIENDLY place other than Polished?
