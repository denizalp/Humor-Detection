No matter what shiny new club opens in Las Vegas, you still only ever have one first...and XS is a pretty damn good first. Home is always gonna be home! It's a testament to the club that it is still standing after 6 years and counting. But every club needs to evolve, and with that I gotta update my review to take these changes into account.\n\nWe all know XS wasn't designed to be an EDM club, but they were able to convert it to an EDM club by putting the DJ booth in between where the dance floor split from inside to outside. Except Marquee and Hakkasan raised the stakes...so yeah, XS had to upgrade their game.\n\nAnd upgrade it they did! Upgraded the visual wall so that it's actually a real wall for once instead of the dinky little screens they were using. Threw up lights on the ceiling so they could use the entire ceiling as a canvass. And laser game is SUPER on point...nothing like three-way lasers crossing the dance floor.\n\nOf course let's not forget what makes this club what it is...I don't care what other club opens up after this, I can pretty much guarantee that it won't have an outside area better than XS. I really need to come here for Sunday Nightswim one day.\n\nAnywho, if you ever need to get on guest list here (even ratio most nights, sometimes 2:1, comes with drink tickets for ladies!) or awesome table deals, talk to my man Chris at (702) 722-8585. He's been my go-to guy for a while now and he is the man you want to know when it comes to Vegas!
