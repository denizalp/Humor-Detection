Some people come to Vegas for gambling, some come for shows, and then there's me that comes for food. Vegas is well known for their eateries but most known for their buffets. We decided to come here and used myVEGAS awards. We had no hassle using the rewards, just needed to go to the Mlife desk to get certificates. Prior to eating you will need to pay and tip at the cashier, then you can wait to be seated. We came on a Weds around 6 pm. Barely anyone was there however once 6:30 pm hit there was a line forming all the way outside. \n\nThere's different booths within the buffet containing a sushi booth with select sushi rolls, ahi and salmon nigiris... oh and even a caviar made to order section. There's pastas, veggies, salad, fresh seafood, a carving station (prime rib, pork, turkey), soups, and more. The seafood station had snow crab legs, shrimp cocktail, and cooked select seafood. Everything was good, not bad to say about it! Save room for dessert because there's a bunch you'll want to try. My favorite was the coffee cream pudding. It was seriously amazing and if you're a coffee drinker you'll enjoy it. The creme brûlée was really good as well. \n\nThe drinks are self served. They have the choose your own beverage station, tea, and coffee. If you want alcohol there's a bar in the middle. After reading the yelp reviews, I was a little cautious about coming here however it was overall a great buffet. Our tummies were very happy! The food was tasty and the service was fast, so overall it was a great experience!
