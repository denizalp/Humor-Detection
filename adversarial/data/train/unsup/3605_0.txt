BEST BAR IN VEGAS\n\nThis place is so swanky with some of the very best views in Vegas. You will NOT be disappointed and worth every penny we spent. Cocktails were delicious and interesting and the small plates.... same!! \n\nOur server Anthony made our experience that much better with fast service and great recommendations I really can't say enough great things about Mandarin Bar. From the moment we arrived until we left we experienced A1 service.\n\nThey also have a pop machine filled with nothing but Moet!!!!! It doesnt get much better then that!!!
