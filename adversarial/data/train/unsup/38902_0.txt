Wow!! I couldn't agree more with the previous review. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. First I brought in 3 wristwatches (2 for my daughters and 1 mine for bracelet resizing and battery replacements). It was cheap, i paid around $30+ or so for all of the services. The next day, i noticed my watch was dead and so were my kids'!  So, I tried to reset it again, hoping it will be fine..but NO!!!  So, i took the watches to another watch repair shop, and found out the batteries that the owner used were all old and expired!! What a scam!. So, i just let it be, didn't bother to complain or anything. Then couple of months later, i bought a fashion watch, so, I decided, to bring it in, for bracelet resize, i was thinking... Resizing service is fine, just bring it to a different shop for battery replacement later. While the owner was on the process of putting the links on, I started to put the extra links to my purse, and accidentally pick up a little piece of screw\/link connector that was his..Believe it or not, that owner went crazy, and started yelling at me, while his snotty partner was just watching!!! WTH?? And he did it in front of my 9 yr. old daughter! It scared the hell out of her! Really?   If that's how u do business, then forget about it!! Purely, a scammer, unprofessional and crazy!! Cheap service??? There's always a reason for that!
