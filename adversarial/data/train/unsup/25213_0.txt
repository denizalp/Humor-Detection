I was tattooed by Julia. My first big tattoo and she made me feel so comfortable and was patient with me. She reassured me and was so kind. This tattoo parlor is clean and well kept. Everyone here is so friendly! I had a good experience overall. And I'm extremely happy with my tattoo :) thank you Julia!!!!
