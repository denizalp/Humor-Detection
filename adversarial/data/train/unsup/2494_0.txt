Best hotel stay, ever. \n\n\nThis Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino is located where the Aladdin used to be up until 5 years ago. I would dub the vibe as modern Hollywood chic. \nIt's the best option on the strip in my opinion. \n\nThe rooms rock your socks off...with movie memorabilia and framed movie pics, along with a 42\" screen TV, humongous tub, marble floors granite counters and we even had a partial view of the strip...all for just $63\/night via www.priceline.com. \n\nThe desk staff were delightful, and there are so many restaurants & shops in the hotel & right outside of it, in the indoor mall. Take advantage of free wi-fi in the Starbucks next to the Extra Lounge, where you can see interviews of celebs too. \n\nTo get a taste of a little technological advancement, view your room charges right on your TV. screen. Or just revel in the quietness that comes with the drama-free guests . \n\nOne of my favorite advantages of staying at Planet Hollywood is the Express Checkout. You fill out the form in your room, wrap it around your room key cards, and slip them in the box in the lobby. You're done and ready to roll. No standing in line forever to checkout. If there are any charges left over, they'll bill you. Easy peasy. \n\n\nSo yeah, in a nutshell: Best hotel stay, ever.
