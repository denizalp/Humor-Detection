I attempted to get my haircut at roosters. I was the only person in the only person in the shop and arrived shortly after 1pm. At that time I was told they asked it I had an appointment and if I didn't they couldn't cut my hair until after 3pm without the appointment. Thus I will never go back. I would have understood if there was actually a line of people, which there was not. I was the only person waiting!
