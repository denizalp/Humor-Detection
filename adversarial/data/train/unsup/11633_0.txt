My daughter's pediatrician recommended Dr. Shin for some vision problems my little girl was having. Before going I asked the nurses and doctors I work around and multiple people told me that she is the best in the west, that people come from the surrounding states to see her. She is one of only two ophthalmologist (eye surgeons) in Vegas.        \n        So on our first visit we had to fill out a ton of paperwork, but the whole appointment ended up being five hours long. Took two hours to be brought back into the room, an hour and a half for her eyes to dilate and another hour for the doctor to actually come in to check my daughter's eyes. I understand that Dr. Shin is a busy woman and is needed in multiple places at different times which helped me keep my patients even with a crying baby. \n      After the exam, we are informed that our daughter is far sighted, needs glasses and if that doesn't work then she'll need surgery to straighten her eye that started to go on a little. They had an office inside where her head was measured for the glasses, since we had no vision insurance at the time it ended up costing a pretty penny. \n        Overall my daughter was treated with the best care possible. I honestly don't know why people would rate them 1 star because of the long wait. Dr. Shin is an on call doctor. She is usually tending to an emergency eye surgery which requires everyone to wait a long time. Stop complaining and do what's best for your children! The staff are so friendly and will put on movies for your kids if it's going to be an extended wait. I've been back here multiple times and each time was a pretty long wait. I recommend making the appointment first thing in the morning or last in the afternoon to beat the very long wait times. The end.
