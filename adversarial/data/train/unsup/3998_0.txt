Wow, some people complain a lot... it's sugar people :) It's not meant to be a \"healthy\" treat by any means. Vegan does NOT equate to healthy! So obviously... anything with sugar is bound to be sweet. \n\nI love having a Cinnaholic close to home. We actually did a run there with our running group (we have done one to the other location in the past) and everyone LOVED it! The new location is much more spacious than the one on Flamingo (which I also frequent). It's basically like Cinnabon but only better since it's a) vegan and b) there are WAY more options! \n\nI've found my favorite frosting so far to be banana. Seriously love it. The marshmallow is also good, along with the original cream cheese. Generally if I don't feel like having a lot, I opt for the baby buns - they are cheap and 2 of those little guys hit the spot!\n\nThis is great place that we are lucky to have in Centennial Hills! They are ALWAYS nice when I go in there - but having worked retail in my life... there are good days and bad days for anything. I've never had an issue there and the owner is always super friendly. If you are looking for budget-conscious cinnamon rolls... try the day old ones. They are half price ($2.75 I think!) and they are still just as good the day after they have come out of the oven :)
