Pho Da Nang is located inside the Rio. It's Vietnamese-based but they speak Chinese. Yeah. Iono. If you wanna speak Vietnamese, I don't think they'll understand :P\n\nWalked in and looked at the prices. Sign up for the M rewards and save a $1. \n\nService: They take a long time. And there was only 1 person in front of us. It took about 15 minutes for them to actually make the stuff and bring it out\/call us. \n\nSeating area: They have plenty of seats, and it's \"open\" so you can inhale all the wonderful casino smells that surround it.\n\nFood: It was alright. I got the shrimp rolls and it tasted alright. But at $8, it was so not worth it. \n\nThe pho is $13-14 if I recall and they don't have that much ingredients in there. Idk why the prices are so high.\n\ntl;dr- toodoo loo, don't return
