Have always wanted to try Beckett's table. So, I was in Phoenix enduring the 117  degree blistery, sweltering, hot day and said to myself, \"Hey! Its time to try Beckett's table\". I am happy that I did! The service was great from the hostess to the busboy to the server. Very knowledgable and informative about the menu. I had the red roasted pepper soup accompanied by the grilled cheese. The soup was phenomenal, the grilled cheese just...meh...too much bread. The stars are for the ambiance and service...the food was just kind of average. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. However, I will be back the next time that I am in Phoenix!
