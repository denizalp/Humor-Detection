Maintenance fees?? Really\n\nSo $9.95 a month would be $119.40 a year, now add your $39.99 maintenance fee now at $159.39 a year, don't forget process fee when you sign up $9.95 takes it to $169.34.\n\nSo $9.95 a month is really $14.11 a month and that's to only use a limited part of the gym, no locker, no towels, no nothing else. Add about $8 a month for additional gym areas and another fee for child care.\n\nWhy don't they call it what it is $14.11 a month for limited access, or more if you want additional features, pool classes etc.. It is very disingenuous to suggest that anyone is really paying $9.95 a month. Or even better; say it's 1cent a month with a $169.22 maintenance fee.\n\nEnough about the bait and switch tactics, on to the experience, first they use a third party call center for billing, and a different number third party service for customer service kind of a pain when they both refer you back to the gym for questions.\n\nThe gym, well you get what you pay for a very limited gym with limited equipment, if it's not busy than not so bad. They definitely have an enormous amount of wasted space. \n\nChild care: bare bones child care with a McDonald's type jungle gym, has a small tv\/movie room, should be sufficient for most to have their kids for a short time. The main concern here is that 2-12 year olds are together, that has the potential for a disastrous situation. That is a much too large age gap.\n\nBathroom\/locker rooms: basic no frills\n\nPool: have not used\n\nIn conclusion if you can stomach a once of year maintenance fee that you pay so that you have the privilege to then pay them again monthly then it's not terrible. Also be ok with no customer support and not much assistance.
