UPDATE:\nMy last experience was AMAZING. I returned for a wash right after the dust storm yesterday. They were under staffed and were only able to offer the basic wash and no inside cleaning. I can understand that, things happen. I came back the following day to do the inside. They charged my an additional $10 for what looked like a vacuum. My dashboard wasn't cleaned, middle console, not even a vacuum on my seats. So I ended up at Walmart to get my own cleaning kit. Such a waste of money. I won't be returning. \n\n\n\nPrevious review: \nI drove from Dallas to Las Vegas and my car really needed some love. I came to Alamo and got the pet care wash and after getting the outside cleaned when Cody H. was checking out my windshield and immediately noticed three small cracks from rocks. He got me on the phone with my insurance and took care of everything! He's awesome, I won't be going anywhere else!
