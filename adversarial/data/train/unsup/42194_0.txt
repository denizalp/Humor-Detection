This place is wonderful. The staff is super friendly and extremely talented. I love my SNS manicures! The salon is clean and very welcoming. Several of the technicians have done my nails and I have always been very pleased. A super shout out to Kiki for my unbelievable Charlie Brown Christmas nails and Lee for an amazing set of ombre nails. Leo runs a fantastic shop!
