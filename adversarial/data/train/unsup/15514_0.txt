Main Points:\n-Casual venue, good for groups\n-Draught beer counts as a side!\n-Fresh tasting comfort food\n\nReview:\nWhat used to be Iguana Mack's is now Social Box, an American comfort food restaurant with great food and big hearts (they will be donating monthly to local causes around Chandler).  They offer reasonable prices, with appetizers, salads, sandwiches, wood-fired pizzas, and misc. entrees ranging from $7-$16.  Sandwiches come with one side (of which, a 12oz draught beer is an option) and their misc. entrees come with two.  They had about 10 beers on tap, and I was pleased to see Papago's Orange Blossom Beer and Firestone Union Jack IPA amongst the selection.  \n\nWe tasted the Queso Burger, Corned Beef Reuben, and Green Chili Chicken soup-of-the-day. The burger was juicy and delicious, it tasted like there were minced onions and spices in the patties, and the Reuben was just right .  The soup was peppery and full of flavor, very satisfying.  A carafe of water with chilled glasses was placed at the table when we got there and was filled diligently throughout our lunch, which speaks on their great service as well. \n\nOverall, yummy choice if you're looking to satisfy your comfort food craving!
