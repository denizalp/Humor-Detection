Service was great. Savannah was top shelf.\n\nChicken fried steak was butchered poorly and had a tendon in the middle of the cut.\n\nSides of chili were a miss. The pieces of meat were cut poorly and were chewy. The cheese was excessive and gluey. \n\nSkip the burger. Sear was actually more like burned. Well done and not by request.\n\nHouse marg is a great deal and didn't disappoint. I have a nice buzz.\n\nWorth another try. Going to go with my tried and true pulled pork.
