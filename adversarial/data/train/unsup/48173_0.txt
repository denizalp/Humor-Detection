On  Saturday, April 25th, my wife and I had dinner at El Chorro.  We had the Chateaubriand for two.  It was excellent, and the service was as well, other than it took a very long time to get our food.  This was due to the fact that, unfortunately, the power in the kitchen went out during our dinner.  On top of the delay in receiving our meal, we did not get dessert.  While many patrons that night were not charged for their meals, we paid for ours in full and left a generous tip.  We were told at the reception desk upon leaving that El Chorro would contact us about dessert.  No one did.  Finally my wife called the restaurant on October 1st and spoke with the general manager, Ryan.  He needs professional development in customer service.  He displayed an uncaring attitude about the fact our experience at dinner on April 25th was less than perfect.  He even told my wife that he didn't know what she expected him to do about the fact we did not get dessert, since the power outage was out of El Chorro's control.  Finally Ryan relented and said he would send us a gift card for our dessert.  It arrived - $10.  Really?  Each dessert probably costs $10.  So he sent us a gift card for one dessert.  The better approach would have been to actually care that a customer had a less than satisfactory experience, or at least act like you cared.  Maybe even discount the dinner we already paid for, or offer a free return dining experience at El Chorro.  But no, Ryan had attitude during the entire conversation and then sent us one (1) $10 gift card.  That's how he took care of the fact we got no dessert after paying over $200 for dinner.  Again, sign up for the next seminar on customer service that you can, Ryan.
