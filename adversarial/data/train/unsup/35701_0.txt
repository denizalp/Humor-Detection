I find myself become a regular here simply for a sweet pick me up. I like their butter cream donuts and cupcakes. Tip let the cupcakes warm up to room temp so that the buttercream frosting softens up. The sugar cut out cookies are delicious too.  Also don't expect donuts on Saturday, either they don't make them or they sell out super fast.
