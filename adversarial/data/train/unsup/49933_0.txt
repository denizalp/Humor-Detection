Everyone had stomach issues that night and the next morning. Maybe the worst thai place we've been to. We thought it was a fancy place, it looked clean but my water had rice and other white stuff flakes on the bottom. They cooked their food so slow, we waited for our food to come out for an hour and a half ( we timed it). They don't really check on you to see how you're doing. Their prices for their food are double than the other thai places, and their portions are half which were way too small for the prices. There were 6 of us and every single one of us had stomach issues and really bad watery output! Oh and also we got charged 20% tip. Never going back! Worst experience ever!
