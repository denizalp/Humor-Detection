Went with some girlfriends to go see I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change down at the Fountain Hills Theater for a girls afternoon out.   \n\nIt was my 1st time at the theater and I have to say I like it a lot! It's a small intimate theater, but it just means you're more engaged with the show.  \n\nThe seats are on the small side, so if you have long legs, you might be a little uncomfortable, but I was up in the front and didn't have to worry about that issue. \n\nI really don't think there is a bad seat in the place, the show was great, we had a great time and I look forward to catching more shows at Fountain Hills Theater.
