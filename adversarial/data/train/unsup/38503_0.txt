Looking for a late night snack on the strip we dropped in at Wolfgang.  Its setting was great for people watching.  The service was friendly and just a tad slow but it was getting busier. We had no wait to be seated and saw a line beginning to form. I ordered  their wings.  They were hot and tasty  not sure if worth the cost. For about 8 wings (or rather half wing pieces) and a cup of coffee the bill was $23 and$27 with tip.
