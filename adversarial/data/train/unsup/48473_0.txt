We love this store.  Recently had a package of chicken mislabeled by the butcher as veal.  Needless to say the cost difference was huge but didn't notice it until we got home.  Called the store and Brittany asked us to bring it back and she would make it right.  My wife returned it and Michael apologized for the trouble and gave us our money back as well as a gift card.  \n\nAwesome store, awesome people.  It's not just the quality of the food we enjoy, but the quality of the people.  Keep up the great work.
