Had the lobster tater-tots, they were pretty good but nothing amazing; nice way to start. The cedar plank salmon was, however, exceptional. It was very well done, came out on a plank of cedar with embers still glowing. It was hot, flavorful, moist, just really well done. Service was nice, ambiance was nice. If I'm near by, I'll go again !
