Sapori on friday night was just amazing, music room was swinging with live blues music. We started off with fried calamari and fried mozzarella which was yummy as hell. We all had different martinis and each one was really great. For dinner we had the Pesto crusted salmon, potatoe crusted walleye, Lobster ravioli and scallops. Everything was perfect and reminded me of my trip to the Amafi coast last summer. We we're pretty full but with our espresso we all shared the homemade brownie with sea salt. You will see us again very soon.
