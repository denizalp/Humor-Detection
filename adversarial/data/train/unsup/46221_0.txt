Everybody loves Showmarssssssss... and it shows. The commercial is now stuck in your head. Oops. My bad.\n\nNow that this is my neighborhood 'Mars (why yes, I did just give Showmars a nickname), I get a little sad every time I come here. Why? Because it doesn't have Alex. He's my favorite worker at the Freedom Drive location.\n\nI love the Grilled Chicken Santorini. Tzatziki sauce makes everything better. I'm also a big fan of the Greek Grilled Chicken Salad. Not sure how healthy it is if you eat the entire bowl, though. You have to eat the bowl. It's a must. \n\nSHOWMARS ALSO HAS THE GOOD ICE. You know what I'm talking about. I think it's about time I make a \"Good Ice List\" on here. When I become president, I will make all restaurants carry the good ice. GOOD ICE FOR EVERYONE!
