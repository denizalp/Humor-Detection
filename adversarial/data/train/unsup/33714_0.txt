Very Happy I did business here.\nThis review is long overdue, but what this company\/location does is very rare in the buy-here\/pay-here business.  \nI purchased an '04 Jeep Liberty in Nov. of 2011.  Before I signed on the line, Lou invited me back to his office and told me about how the whole thing works and why he does what he does.  And even then I thought \"Well, he could just be a very good actor.. so we'll see\".  And I did see.  The guy is for real and he does what he says he will do.\nBack then they were offering oil changes almost at cost for as long as you were making payments (not sure what they do now), and I also had a couple of minor repairs done at way below the average dealer pricing.  The record keeping was impeccable, which is also rare in the 'buy-here\/pay-here' market.  But because my work schedule is so hectic, and because I like to pay cars off as quickly as possible, I sometimes just have to call from the road to see where I stand.  I could call at any time and in a matter of seconds had my last payment, what was owed, total interest paid, etc.  And when it was all done (about 18 mos. later) They sent my title (Which is another thing you have to watch out for in this business, because sometimes it's not so easy with other dealerships) and I just kept on driving.\nI've had the car now for nearly 4 years, and put about 100k miles on it (I do a lot of business on the road) and it's still humming along, getting about 20 mpg on average, and better on long trips.\nSo now it's about time to start shopping for another car again and can tell you... if I were back in Vegas I'd happily do business here again.
