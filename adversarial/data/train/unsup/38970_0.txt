Just ordered a Maki Tray from here and was the highlight of my party! Everyone loved it! The rolls here are by far the best with very little rice, not like other AYCE restaurants. This restaurant is definitely worth trying! Eat-in may take longer than others but you just need to remember this is not a fast food restaurant! Must try if you're in the neighbourhood!
