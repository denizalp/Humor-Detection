I've had (and made) a lot of pad thai, but Hibiscus makes the best I've had by a long shot. The sauce is plentiful and the flavor can be as spicy as you like - on a scale of 1-5 I get a 3 but I may be upping this to a 4 in the near future!\n\nI was unimpressed by the sushi burrito but my husband enjoys the edamame appetizer and I usually get the summer rolls. I absolutely LOVE the teas \"Tea Forte\" that Hibiscus serves and while they are $3 and I find this ridiculous, I've looked into purchasing tea bags from Tea Forte and they are quite expensive. The lemongrass ginger is my all time favorite and I often order this instead of a cocktail. For anyone who reads my reviews, you know this is rare! (haha)\n\nI took off a star for the disappointing sushi burrito (low quantity of sushi!) and for inconsistencies when ordering take out - less sauce making it drier, less spice, overall it seemed less flavorful.
