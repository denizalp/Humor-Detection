This is one of the best airport experiences you're going to have. Compared to the herd of cows experiences offered by just about every airport in the world, this one is the COMPLETE opposite. \n\nTo start, it's always quiet, to the point I wonder how they pay the bills. It's spotless, the security check lines are a breeze, and TSA pre-check will never have a line. This makes for a seamless airport experience and a really good impression of Madison.\n\nThe gates are organized and the waiting areas are comfortable. There are a few restaurants\/convenience stores that are very Madison like, and offer offer local foods and snacks. You'll leave here with a good impression of what to expect from the city itself. All in all, it's a very Madison experience.
