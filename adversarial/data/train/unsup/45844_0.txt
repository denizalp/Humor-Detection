This place is humongous and one can easily spend half a day or more here. \nI was actually taken aback by the number of installation and sheer size of this attraction.\nLocation is just of the highway and one can easily take public transport here as well.\nThe staff at the front desk deserve a special mention as they were extremely friendly and helpful. Thanks for keeping the positive vibe going in a tough stressful front end job.\nThe Centre is divided into 6 levels with some exhibits being a permanent fixture while some keep rotating. \nI was short on time so I just breezed through a few levels. \nCurrently they have Star Trek live action show going on which is a must see for all the Trekkie's and their kids. The show was interesting and kept the little ones entertained quite a bit as there is a lot of interaction with the audience. Live long and prosper to this show!\nThe other levels are very informative and I found a lot of information to absorb in a short time period. Thankfully a lot of items are interactive and encourage you poke around with them (a word of advice bring a hand sanitizer as you will need it)  \nThere is a  huge market cafe here which served Pizza Pizza! (gulp all the advances in Science and we came up with this monstrosity for food!)  Starbucks etc. \nThere is also a tiny rain forest replete with bugs and some amazingly coloured Frogs (some are poisonous and therefore kept behind glass)\nAs a part of the rotating exhibits they had Circus and Sports. Circus had one walking on a tight rope or doing back flips on a trapeze etc. Sports had one pitching on a real baseball mound trying to get strikes among other activities.  \nAll in all a very good spot to bring the curious of mind. I didn't try the Omnimax as I am sure its very good as well. \nThere is a obligatory level dedicated to space. So what can I say but Space the final frontier! \nHighly recommended!
