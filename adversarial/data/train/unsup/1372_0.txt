We were all in the mood for Dim Sum and decided to come to Chang's cause I've been here a bunch of times and it's always been good. Parking was easy as it wasn't busy, usually it's packed and I'll tell you why in a sec. It's on Decatur just north of Tropciana. Not far behind the Home Depot. \n\nThe only reason I've giving this place 1 star is cause of the shitty customer service. Their website clearly states they do Dim Sum till 10:30pm. We came in and sat down looked over the menu for about 15 minutes while we drank our tea. We tell our server were going to do Dim Sum and he says no dim sum today because the cook left early. WTF!? That is the only reason why we came here and thier website says they serve it till 10:30pm!\n\nWhat's worse is they didn't tell us when we came in we sat there wasting our time. It crappie when this is what your known for and you don't have it. When I told the server about it and what their website says he looked at me like I was from Pluto. Won't be coming back for awhile, was quite disturbed.
