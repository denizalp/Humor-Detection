I've stayed here twice and in two different rooms (The EcoVista and Aldo Leopold), and both times I had a really fantastic time. I love that they have radiant heating (especially since I stayed there in the winter) and having vegan breakfasts is great. The proprietors are really nice and were super accommodating to my late arrival. \n\nThe reason why I chose to stay here was because of their environmental emphasis. You can tell that the proprietors were totally sincere about their  green emphasis (as opposed to doing it because it's apparently trendy now), not only because they've been around for so long but also because of the way they spoke about the property. I remember to this day that the spiral staircase in the Annex was made from salvaged wood from an old department store warehouse that had a fire. Nice!
