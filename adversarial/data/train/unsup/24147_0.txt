Why craft beer? Well, it is enjoyed everyday and is viewed by many as one of the special things in life that makes the day taste and feel a little better. \n\nI do enjoy a loud beer and Hop Knot IPA a big, broad-shouldered, hoppy beer. Made only from American malt and lots of American hops, which produce really good character. \n\nKilt lifter. This is just a nice, clean Scottish ale with mild caramel and a touch of roast. The aroma, like the flavor, is all malt. I have only been in this tap house once for lunch. I ordered one of the lunch specials and had the two beers. \n\nTap Room Tenderloin $11.5 Filet Mignon grilled to order, served on a hoagie roll topped with bleu cheese crumbles, onion straws, lettuce, tomato and roasted garlic-jalape√±o aioli.\n\nOver all an enjoyable micro- brewery with a menu that is excellent. And I will be back to rate the other fine beers or maybe just quench my thirst.\n\nIn the spirit of AZ Beer Fest.
