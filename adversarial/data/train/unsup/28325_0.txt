In all honesty this was probably the worst experience I've had at a movie theater.. and it has nothing to do with the people or location. It has everything to do with Theatre 11 and who ever was in charge of turning the lights off . The young lady to did my ticket transaction was beautiful, has a loving smile and welcoming tone. After walking to the theatre. I automatically was taken aback by the stale scent of popcorn and feet. Then I took the cleanest looking seat I could find. *ill add pictures* maybe it's just that the theatre is old but as much money as theatres make this one should be able to afford some new seats, and better ventilation. I didn't think it would be that bad, I know it's not AMC but DAMN! Anyway, the movie started and NO ONE TURNED THE LIGHTS OFF! Finally after 15 min into the movie someone decided to do their job! I love the palms and I like the theatre generally. Maybe it was just #11 but it's gonna be a while before I go there again. I would have much rather paid the extra 5$ for nicer seats.
