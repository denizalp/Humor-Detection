I came here with a group of guys from my Men's Group. We decided to meet here at 6am. Wow. Really early for me. Anyways, as I assumed nobody was here except for my friends. I thought it was a big dining area and they had a big back room that we were able to sit in. \n\nOur waiter was really good and got our drink orders as we sat down. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash Skillet. It was layered with home fries, corned beef hash, cheddar cheese, and scrambled eggs. It came with your choice of bread and I chose the English Muffin. Huge portion. It was pretty good. Thought the hash was good. Very filling. I could barely finished it but somehow managed. \n\nService was really good. I didn't expect anything else since we were the only tables that early in the morning.\n\nSo at 6am there was good service, food was okay but they do serve breakfast all day which is good. I'll be back but have to try their pancakes and French toast. This will tell me if they have good breakfast or not. Enjoy. I did.
