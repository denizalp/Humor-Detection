I went around 2pm on a Thursday due to all the other reviews on Yelp, and it was so impressive on multiple levels.\n\nFirst of all, the guys who run the place are great. Welcoming and obviously into their business, they asked how I heard about them and other suggestions now that I'd seen the place. \n\nI had the crab cake sandwich and the crabcake was amazing. Fully of chunks of crab, it was one of the best I've ever had. On the downside, the coleslaw that came with it tasted like Food Lion's deli brand or something - they'd do better making it themselves! I appreciated that they threw in some Texas Pete packets too - clutch for a Southern girl that likes spice like me!\n\nWill definitely go again!
