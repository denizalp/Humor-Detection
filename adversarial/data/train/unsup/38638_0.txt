The Wynn is super nice. The carpets are ugly, but everything is else is amazing. That's why the Terrace Pointe Cafe gets two stars. Because it was just okay. Sitting outside was a mistake. The pool view is beautiful, but the glare isn't. I had a grilled vegetable pita thing. It wasn't super good, and eating in the heat isn't enjoyable if the food isn't hella good. Oh wells.
