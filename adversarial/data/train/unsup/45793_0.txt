I'll be back. \n\nI'm now a regular at US. I've been one since a very bad visit to Lids. I asked the clerk about getting a Texans hat for a girl who was leaving the company I work for. The Lids' clerk said, \"Why the hell would want a Texans hat? They're awful!\" I spoke my mind to the misguided clerk and left. A few doors down is Uniform Sports. Bruce, the owner, took over 15 minutes to help me find the right Texans hat. I was so impressed with his knowledge and their extensive product line. He even went in depth about the materials used. When I told him the hat was for a girl with long hair, he advised me to get an adjustable hat because women with long hair like to put their pony tails through the arched opening. Who knew? Not only, Bruce knows sports thoroughly. We've talked at length. Great store, great staff, great inventory. Bruce is the Peyton Manning of Customer Service.
