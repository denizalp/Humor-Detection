Vinny (the owner) showed great customer service from the moment we walked in the door. It's a really small shop but it has a cozy and welcoming feel to it. Vinny made us feel welcomed and gave us the history of him coming to Vegas from Brooklyn (where he owned a pizza shop) and how he perfected his crust recipe to be better than before. \n\nWe ordered the Basil Pesto and meat lovers. Took an average amount of time for them to come out to the table, and when they came we were rewarded with two incredible pies. The basil pesto was the better of the two, but the star of the show was Vinny's crust which was one of the best crusts I've ever had, easily the best New York style crust I've ever had. The texture and flavour were both perfectly balanced and I kept eating until I was on the verge of purging, something I almost never do. \n\nOverall, Vinny made incredible pizza at an incredible price. This definitely will become a tradition each time I come out to Vegas, and as a pizza fanatic I'll surely have dreams about the flavourful basil pesto on that perfect crust.
