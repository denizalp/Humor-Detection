We got a Groupon hoping to go to the one in Mt. Lebanon however when we got there last Friday night it was closed for good.  Luckily I remembered they had another location and off we went to South Park.  The location was not great and the restaurant wasn't the cleanliest.  The staff was very friendly and our order came out quickly. We had a hard time spending the $20 Groupon which is a good thing as the prices were reasonable. I went with the Chicago dog and my date ordered the bacon wrapped and cheese stuffed dog. They were both good but no D's hotdogs & 6 packs. We also got a side of fries and a large dinner salad. The salad was tasty and had a nice amount of tomatoes, cucumber, onion and croutons.  The fries were very greasy and not all the way cooked.  Unfortunately, I probably will not go back.
