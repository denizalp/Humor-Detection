Came here for lunch on a tuesday. Line wait was about 35 to 40 mins. Buffet selection itself wasn't that big and nothing really stood out or made us want to get seconds of. We left not feeling satisfied or full and again, nothing made us want to stay or gorge on.\n\n If we had to pick our favorite items, it'd be the butternut squash ravioli, shrimp and pork dumplings, guava Panna cotta and oatmeal cookies. Our experience was completely underwhelming lol.
