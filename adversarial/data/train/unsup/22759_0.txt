I really wish I had a better experience -- I was pretty hungry when I stopped by around 8:15PM on a Sunday evening, and I do love French fries.\n\nThe guy behind the counter was really friendly & patient with me as I took time looking at the menu.   I ordered the large box of fries with the *vegetarian* poutine, caramelized onions, and substituted cheese sauce for the green peas that normally comes with it.  Adding a Jones Soda, & my bill was $14 something.   Jones sodas aren't cheap, but over $10 for French fries??!  Time will tell if the tourist prices can last, when the only tourist attraction is the pawn-store 150' away...\n\nI sat down & waited, and my order was ready about 7 minutes later.   There looked to be a waitperson 'working' -- female in her 20s.  For the entire 45 minutes I was there, she just stood & had some sort of in-depth, personal conversation with some customers seated at another table.  Sounded like she either works part-time at Jimmy-John's Subs, or wants to get hired there.  She was also telling them how there would be filing at the pawn store the following day, and when they're filming is about the only time the owners\/main characters from the show are ever there.  She sure wasn't working (though they weren't busy, either).  If she was supposed to be a waitress, she failed.  If she's a co-owner or something, she probably at some point should have come to my table & asked if I was doing OK, etc.\n\nWhen the order taker inside called out that my order was ready, I waited about 20 seconds to see if she was going to pick up my order & bring it to me (& she was closer than I was), but she wasn't at all concerned, and just kept talking to the other people so I hoped up & got my order -- not a big deal at all, however, not the sort of conduct most small businesses have, either.\n\nWhen I sat back down with my order, my first impressions where that it looked pretty small for the price & being labeled as a large\/complete meal, and that I sure didn't get a lot of cheese sauce -- just a very narrow squirting of it atop the fries.\n\nAgain, I was really hungry & like fries, so I was very disappointed at the both the collective & individual lack of flavor.  Very bland overall, and even just sampling the vegetarian gravy, cheese curds, fries, or caramelized onions individually showed the components just didn't have much of a flavor for some reason.   The only flavor I got was the artificial green apple flavor from my Jones Soda...\n\nA little before 9PM, the place was starting to close up.  The guy behind the counter came outside to clean & secure the ketchup dispenser, etc. meanwhile, the worthless waitress continued to just ramble-on with the couple customers at the other table. Only when they finally got up & left did she act like she had any connection to the business besides her uniform -- like I said, gotta be the owner's daughter\/wife\/girlfriend or have some other relationship that allows her to be there without truly earning her keep (sorry honey, but as they say, \"the truth hurts\").\n\nI drive by the place a couple times a week, but unfortunately, I have no reason to ever go back.    I suspect most of the business it (& the other places in the small shopping center) will get is from tourists there to see the pawn store, and that's not going to be enough in the long run. Hopefully I'm wrong.
