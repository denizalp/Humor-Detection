I always say that \"O\" is my favorite Cirque du Soleil show, but I can't help but say that this is my favorite, too.  It's just not fair to compare the two!  This show is so FUN!  We've been 3 times now, and there just isn't a bad seat in the house.  This show brings history, classic Beatles music, dance, and acrobatics like you've never seen before!  My husband and I are huge Beatles fans, so it's easier for us to love this show, but we took my parents who aren't that into the Beatles, and they absolutely LOVED it!  It's a must see!
