NY pizza fans, rejoice.  This place is serving up some mean pies - perfect crust, fresh and simple ingredients.  A great product, executed perfectly.  \n\nIt's going to be hard to get a table here on weekend nights, and that's a good thing.  I wish this opened in Ohio City, but I'll consider myself fortunate that this opened at all.  \n\n[Also, did anyone read Mitch Z's review?  He'd like a glass for his beer.  Thanks.]\n\nTIPS:\nFavorites:  Diavola, Pepperoni Pizza, and Green Pie.  Also, the Arugula Salad is very nice.  \n\nNo appetizers, one large is perfect for two people.  With an app, a small pizza is enough.
