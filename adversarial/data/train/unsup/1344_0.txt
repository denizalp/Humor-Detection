Meh.\n\nI mustve went on a crappy day bc my lady was a jerk as was the receptionist. I went and let them know I just needed one set of fingerprints for a state job I had recently acquired. She was kinda rude, and told me to fill out the little form. Total attitude though! So I went and had a seat. They had 4 machines going so the wait was minimal, which I really dont care, and it wasnt busy at all. My girl called me and did my prints, not talkative at all, then I went and had a seat.\n\nThe receptionist was another un interested person who basically said 3 words and took my money.I tried to crack a joke and she was not amused... blah!\n\nYea its centrally located and cheap, but Ive had my prints done at another place for 2$ more and the ppl actually spoke to you and didnt act like stuck up fools.\n\n16$ for one card of prints and 2$ more. Just like everyone else listed, they do photos, and all that crap.
