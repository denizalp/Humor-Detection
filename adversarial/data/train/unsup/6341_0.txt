If you have $3000 to spend at the drop of a nickel.  Then don't go to Beijing Noodle Cafe.  I would recommend instead buying a plane ticket and  flying to China and enjoying the local culinary delights there as seen on most of the travel channel food shows.\n\nBUT!  \n\nmost likely you don't.  And it will be long time before you can save up that money and really enjoy the fine cuisine and culture of the illustrious country of China.  \n\nSo!\n\nDon't be sad or disheartened by the cruel realizations of just not being rich enough to travel. Beijing Noodle Cafe brings it you and all at under $7 a bowl of steaming hand pulled deliciousness of carbs.\n\nThis place deserves five stars for bringing that experience to our city. They deserve it for actually giving a shit about the quality of their ingredients and serving the best damn wontons with homemade chili oil! \n\nWho cares if it's a lil ghetto! who cares if it's in the ghettos! who cares if the tall jackass server is an idiot and mildly offends with his inability to even make eye contact,  \n\nIf you deducted stars on those reasons you must have flown to China.\n\nNo? well, then you are an idiot. \n\nBe thankful that we can have some authenticity in this city and go eat there now!\n\nDefinitely order the wonton, pot stickers,  zha jiang mian, and beef nugget soup.  I plan on trying everything on their menu.
