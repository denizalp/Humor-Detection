Most unprofessional Midfirst Bank in Arizona. Had a discrepancy with my account and spoke with the teller manager, immediately told me there was no way her seasoned teller told me wrong information and confirmed a manager came over and also told me. I will be opening this case with corporate as it is on camera no manager ever came over or said two words to me. Do not go here is you want the professional friendly warm Midfirst customer service you are used too. I will be closing my account at then end of the month and banking elsewhere.
