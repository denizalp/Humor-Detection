While the Red Rock may be one of my favorite properties, I can't say Feast is one of my favorite buffets. It resembles almost every other Feast in the Station Casino chain, though I think the food options here might be a bit more substantial than the rest. For that reason in addition to the value, this place still gets a thumbs up from me. \n\nLike many buffets at more popular properties, Feast has taken on the concept of offering international variety through stations across its incredibly vast layout. In fact, this is the biggest Feast I've ever seen with a seemingly endless counter of options. It forces patrons to walk decent lengths to get what they want. (#1)\n\nDespite the numerous cuisines, I can't think of one that truly stands out for being outstanding. Ironically, I enjoy coming here for breakfast more than the lunch and dinner hour, but that's just me. During the weekends and holidays, the carving station is pretty impressive as is the dessert + gelato selection. Anything that requires freshly prepared stuff (omelets, pasta, shrimp, etc.) is bound to be halfway decent.\n\nAny of their American preparation is going to look something like a Thanksgiving meal (never a bad thing) and the cold foods, salad section is pretty standard. I particularly love the mini-wedge salads, they're just perfect for the bite sized salad lover. On occasion they'll feature a Mediterranean section, which is decked out in various kinds of hummus and some subpar attempts at a gyro meat.\n\nThe only thing I would remove entirely would be the Asian cuisine section. I already though the pizza was an atrocity, but the entire spectrum of Asian food from Dim Sum to Sushi to sad attempts at Canto cuisine are beyond bad. The sushi cuts are terribly done, the seasoning for most of the hot food is way off. I understand the need for this though given the Asian clientele that visit Vegas on a regular basis, but I can't imagine them loving it either. \n\nAll in all, the Feast Buffet can execute solid variety without making too much of a dent in the wallet. The lines can get fierce during prime hours, but having a Station players card with status might help with the wait, in addition to saving you a few dollars for each session. The food isn't memorable by any means, but it's far from the worst buffet in Vegas. \n\n___________\n(#1) Laugh it up, but in the Vegas buffet world, that's exercise.
