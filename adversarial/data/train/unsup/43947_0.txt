upon entrance we were greeted with positive energy. it was my first time here and the atmosphere was really nice. polite service for amazing food. the cashier took the order in a well manner and recited it back. the food came out in a timely manner and gave me time to reminisce on the tv that was playing dbz's cell game. good was good and service was amazing. a+ for the hentai on the painting by the bathroom!
