I've been using this Avella for many years. They were formerly the Apothecary Shop and changed to Avella in the past few years. Going through fertility treatments is an expensive, unpleasant process but Avella's stellar service always makes the process a little easier. Many times I could get some of the drugs at a local pharmacy but instead prefer driving the over 20 mile distance to use Avella. They do their best to work with my insurance and save as much money as possible-which isn't too much but it's something. The staff is always very courteous and professional even when they are incredibly busy. Great specialty pharmacy. They also deliver if you plan a little bit in advance!
