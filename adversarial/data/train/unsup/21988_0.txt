So we have been driving by this pizza joint that seems to be perpetually closed, yet it looks pretty interesting on the outside...especially on this particularly quiet stretch of Cave Creek Rd.  Turns out that Johnnie's is only open Thursday through Sunday.  Johnny himself mans the pizza counter, giving long hellos to everyone.  Apparently, he has been turning out pizza in this location since the 90s.  So it's a total neighbor joint with lots of kids and families dropping in.\n\nI would recommend the deluxe on thin crust...you might be tempted to go for the Joanie (slightly thicker crust) or the medium crust...but don't give in to this impulse...the crust here is perfectly crisp and quite dense, so thin is more than sufficient to satisfy the hungry beast.  Johnnie's has fresh toppings and good sauce.  But they do take 20 minutes to make the pizza to order, so phoning in your order before hand is a good idea.\n\nOh yeah, and Johnny will let you customize your pizza anyway you want...down to quarters.\n\n3 stars for the pizza plus extra star for super customization and Johnnie with his friendly greetings for all.
