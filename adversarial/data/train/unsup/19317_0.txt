If this site had a rating scale the went into the negatives, I would be able to give it a negative 3!\nAt first glance, its big, lots of options, pick your own fabric, nice sales staff.  That is the end.\nPurchased a $900 reclining sofa.  Waited 6 weeks to get it.\nOn delivery day, the delivery guys who were incompetent to say the least, did over $200 worth of damage to my house.  After calling and emailing and calling, I finally got a manager who said they would reimburse for having the damage fixed.\nDay 5, yes, I said day 5....reclining mechanism on one side snaps and doesn't work any more. There are pieces of metal underneath where something broke....DAY 5. I called and they said they would send a repair man.....on a 5 day old sofa!  Then some random guy calls from his cell phone to setup repair for 4 days later. Says he will call the night before and confirm delivery time. Never heard from him so I called and he \"forgot\".  Finally he shows up and says he has to order a part for it and another 7-10 days will pass. Then I have to sit home and wait for him AGAIN to rig a brand new $900 sofa!!!\nI would avoid buying any of their junk furniture at all costs!!!!!!!\nStill deciding if I need to get a lawyer or not.\nSTAY AWAY - STAY AWAY!
