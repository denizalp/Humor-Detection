I love this place! Coming here on a Thursday night it was packed with cute guys and girls dancing and enjoying themselves all around!\n\nThursday night is free well drinks night after you pay a $10 cover, and so the first thing I did when I arrived with my friends was get my drink on! They make them quite strong and their well quality isn't too bad as I only had a mild hangover the next day. I've heard Saturdays are good for getting your groove on as well! The whole place is a giant dance floor, some people armed with glowsticks jamming to the funky techno music others shirtless and dancing their hearts out! They are also super friendly here, and a lot of people just eased on up and danced with me and sometimes my friends! It's just a blast all around. The bartenders are super hot and actually get your drinks done quite promptly so kudos to them for that! Especially the hottie in the tank top that winked and smiled at me when I asked for 3 rum and sprites. If you're reading this mr hot bartender holler at me! ;)\n\nThis place is pretty awesome, if you haven't been you should go at least once. They have pretty funky decor with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, a fog machine, and lights going every which way. The music is just my type, mainly techno with some remixes of top 40 thrown in. I wish I had discovered this place earlier, one of the best dance spots in the QC as far as I'm concerned.
