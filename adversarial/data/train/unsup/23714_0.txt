I went to this place based on the yelp reviews- I needed a haircut and haven't really been able to find a stylist or salon that I was truly happy with. I'm currently in the process of growing out my pixie cut, and it's in the awkward stage of growing out over the ears and just isn't flattering. I could tell right away the stylist wasn't very knowledgable with shorter styles with lots of layers (lots of layers is kind of a side effect of a pixie) and she really didn't impress me. The sides and back that I wanted trimmed up are super choppy and not flattering.  I have really thick hair that is big and frizzy, and since she didn't thin it out it just made it look really fluffy. The way she styled it was adding more volume and no flat iron, so the style was almost wavy and weird and I couldn't tell how choppy the cut was until I got home and fixed the style. The people there seemed nice and maybe I would have liked my experience if my hair was more uniform, but with the results I got I won't be back.
