Growing up in Santa Barbara I've been telling every  one on the In N Out bandwagon in az about The Habit for years. Santa Barbara is home to the original one. Thank you Habit for bringing me a little piece of home to AZ. The burgers are so good, the Malts and the albacore sandwiches man. Mouths watering now. People in California don't really go to In N Out  that much. Az is way behind the times in this regard. Do yourself a favor and eat The Habit!\n\nFood: the ones in Santa Barbara are better. The burger didn't have the same char flavor and has a little on the salty side.\nEstablishment: nice looking, on par with all the other trendy burger places. Definitely like the old school walk up ones back home better.\nOverall: B+
