I've been here several times to pick up knives and multi tools came in today after 30 minute drive the sales associate at the cutlery area where the multi tools are basically told me that his inventory was more important than me making a purchase was told that he would not be done until several hours. I can't believe the cutlery Department is more concerned about doing their inventory then helping a customer \/ selling a multi-tool. Everyone else in the store was very helpful and nice per usual
