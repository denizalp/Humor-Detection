I've taken my 240 here multiple times already. I was told to go here by a few tuner car people. The location isn't close to me, so means something that I drive a hot, stripped, welded-diff car so far for service. So far I haven't been disappointed. I've come in with specs for my vehicle; they were not achievable with the current aftermarket suspension components I had at the time. instead of charging me for an alignment after they couldn't get the car to where I wanted (as other places have done) they only charged me for an alignment check. They work with me and remembered me from last visit. They're usually pretty quick, I come in without an appointment and haven't waited more than 2 hours, which is better than when I went to network, they had my car for 5 hours and did basically nothing. No crazy \"low car charge\" and curteous people. Help that they have a tech who knows about drift cars. Kudos for that.  My only star off is just the waiting area isn't the best. I figure most people just drop their cars off, however having a bar top\/counter so that you can do work off of it (like having a surface to use a computer) would be a great addition while you're waiting.
