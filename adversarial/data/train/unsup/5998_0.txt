When I first heard Juno did digital perms for $120, I would have thought it was a) a scam, or b) of such shoddy quality it would fry my hair, or c) possibly both.  \nThe reason I *didn't* think that was because a) the information came from my friend, who b) had just gotten her own digital perm there 1.5 months prior, and c) currently possessed a head full of fabulously curly and not-fried hair.\nSo yours truly went there today and indeed, came out $140 (for perm and trim, plus $20 for tip) poorer but armed with a head of fabulously curly not-fried hair courtesy of a very nice guy named Cozy (yes, Cozy).  \nAs for the miscellany: the salon is very clean, and the staff are friendly.  Keep in mind that this is a pretty big chain from Korea, so the workers there are, as far as I know, all Korean (with possibly one Chinese).  They do speak English, but if at all possible bring a Korean-speaking friend with you so there are no surprises.  They also told me today they are cash only, so either raid an ATM prior or bring your checkbook.\nConsidering how this usually runs me $300+ back at home (ah California, I have missed your food and weather but not your cost of living), so far I consider this $140 very very VERY well spent.  And assuming these curls continue to hold for the next 7.5 months, I may very well find myself holding off on my next perm until I return to the frozen plains of Illinois (for my final 3 months of school!)
