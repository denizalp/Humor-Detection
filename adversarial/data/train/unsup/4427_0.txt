The wife had purchased a Groupon for a girls trip, but that was cancelled and I convinced her to take me instead. Overal, \"Meh\" is the best way to describe this place. The clerk at the front desk seemed angry that we interrupted his \"me\" time when he had to check us in and the store cashier seemed to have vanished or been kidnaped.\n\nThe place was probably nice when it was built, but it appears they fired all of their maintenance staff several months ago. Broken shower shelf, nasty grout in shower, dirty ring around outside of bathtub, dings and dents on the walls, burn mark on couch cushion, funky smell in room and odd smelling water from the kitchen sink.\n\nThe main building at the Palms was dead and has a different clientele than I ever seen there before. Overall, I think the whole property has gone downhill and no one seems interested in fixing it. We did find a couple of cool bartenders who totally shared our views, but it was too little, too late.
