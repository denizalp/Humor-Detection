Dear Mike, \n\nAs far as your comment that everything has been taken care if is completely untrue. I left a message for you to call me on Friday which you never did. Your store manager Mike assured me that you would call me by 4pm and he also assured me that your company would get everything fixed. As of this date, I've left 2 additional messages for him and I called and asked to speak with you today and your office disconnected me twice and on the third call, they stated they would take a message and have you call me back which I have not heard from you.  So please get your facts straight prior to making a statement on the internet that is a complete lie!
