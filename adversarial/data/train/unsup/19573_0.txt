As a struggling recent college graduate who still likes to party, Vegas has to happen several times a year. I used to stay at Platinum but would always yearn for Earl's at 3AM but since it was so far, I resorted to whatever I could scavenge in the room.\n\nThe Marriott satisfies these cravings without breaking the bank, and it's pretty much on the strip. Since it's across the street from Planet Hollywood, you can walk 5 minutes to Earl's and solve your hunger problems. And since it's close to the strip, the taxi rides to all your favorite clubs are cheaper than staying at another off the strip hotel.\n\nThe rooms are very spacious and have all the amenities you would need, even offering a full kitchen for storage and cooking of all your alcohol, ramen and snacks.\n\nA 2 bedroom suite with 2 full baths, 3 beds and a pull-out sofa will only set you back about $500 for a 2 night stay. You do the math.
