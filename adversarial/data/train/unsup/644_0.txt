Damn, look at all these fancy important'e looking people.  I feel so cool just walking around in a place showered by chandeliers that engulfs a bar right at the center.  Men all suited up, women all glammed up with tight ass dresses, while I walk as if I was invisible because my attire smells of sales rack at TJ Max or Ross, but damn it I make it look good!\n\nThis place is just like how Juvenile the rapper would quote it, \"you Fancy huh\".  With Celeb sightings left and right (50 cent, Floyd Gayweather, Carrot Top, does he count?, etc), this place you know is full of Gold Diggers.  Man I couldn't get any play here cuz girls here will look what's in your pants and I'm not talking about them sizing your sausage but your wallet instead.\n\nEven the parking lot shines out with Obey mural wall paintings and lights that tell you if the spot is taken or not.  Very nice and clean hotel and 3rd floor includes popular Secret Pizza Place which serves Ny style pizzas.  At night, Marquee is no doubt the main reason youngins migrate here like a bunch of crazy wilderbeasts in unorganized lines outside of the entrance blocking walkways in that area.  They need to set up a system to make it more organized.  Shopping areas aren't as big as the Forum in Caesars, Luxor, Miracle Mile, and other shopping district in the area.  I have taken a tour though of the pools that have not yet been open and I can tell you it's the nicest setups I've seen in the strip.\n\nOverall it's a nice high end hotel that will attract all the fancies in town.  Not my type of crowd but I will not be bias on my review, so if you like to dress up in brand name, drop bills on expensive ass drinks, and floss your blings and feel important status wise in life, this place is the joint to be in! I'll stick with the scumbags and hipsters in downtown Vegas.
