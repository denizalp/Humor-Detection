As a noodle lover, I had high hopes for the Noodle Man and I love trying new places in our neighborhood. However, I was disappointed with our first experience here.\n\nThe food was good, but not good enough to justify the bad service. If the food is great, I can overlook a (very) non-attentive server, a tight seating area, long wait, etc. The Noodle Man is all of these without the great food. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not good enough to make up for bad service.\n\nWe had to wait a while and flag down multiple servers for our menus, drinks, a spoon, you name it. It was clear they had no interest in making this a pleasant experience for us :\/
