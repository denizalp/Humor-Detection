They got my order wrong. I told three people, the strawberry shortcake NOT the chocolate strawberry. I pointed at it, told them explicitly not the chocolate and at the register she said chocolate and I said, \"no I told two people not the chocolate!\" Charged me for the vanilla I wanted, I opened the box and what do you know, it was chocolate.\n\nMind you, the vanilla\/strawberry thing was the only thing not labeled and I assumed it was strawberry shortcake but apparently wasn't exactly what it was called and that's what got everybody confused and it turns out it was what it's called but I'm not the one who didn't label it.\n\nSo they got my order wrong, and the Oreo and the chocolate\/strawberry tower I got wasn't even that good. The vanilla cupcake wasn't any better. The buttercream tasted like buttercream from albertsons cupcakes.\n\nAnd mind you, this isn't a bad review just because they got my order wrong and I'm salty about it. I was hoping the cake and pastries would make up for it and they sadly didn't. You pay for the name and that's it. \n\nSprinkles has WAY better cupcakes. Which is where I went after to soothe my pain of a terrible cupcake I spent 6 dollars on, I got a 1000% better one for half the price.
