I've been in Vegas for just about a year now and have tried waxing and threading all across the city. Pink Cherry is a hidden gem. It was by far the cleanest, accurate, and best waxing in Vegas! Could not have asked for more beginning with the polite and informative ladies at the front desk, amazing waxing, to the courtesy follow up call. \n\nThank you to all the staff at Pink Cherry! Hope to continue to enjoy your services for years to come!
