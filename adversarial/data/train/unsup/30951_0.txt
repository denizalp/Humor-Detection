Do not confuse the Garden Court's buffet with some of the high end resort buffets you might find on The Strip. The Garden Court is geared towards the budget minded traveler. This point aside, it delivers a good value for the price point. There is a good variety of offerings to be found; and the food is always fresh, as the turnover is frequent. If you like Italian, you can make a full meal of Italian food. If you want to sample a little of everything, you can get Asian, Mexican, Italian, American, vegetarian, etc.\n\nMy friends and I arrived at Main Street Station on a Friday (late morning). As our rooms were not ready for check in, we decided to eat at the Garden Court Buffet as a convenience. (The mid-week price for lunch was $8.99.) The food quality, pricing, variety and convenience were sufficient enough that we decided to eat breakfast there again on Saturday morning. (Weekend pricing for breakfast champagne brunch buffet was $11.99.) I think the fact that we ate two meals, on two consecutive days, should provide some validation.
