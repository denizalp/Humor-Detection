My husband visited Crush on Saturday August 5. I ordered the skirt steak and shrimp scampi special. He ordered the 20 oz T-bone with a side of potatoes au gratin. I also ordered a caesar salad. \n\nThe caesar salad was amazing--and the pretzel croutons were warm and yummy.\n\nI enjoyed my steak and shrimp, though the shrimp were slightly under-seasoned. \n\nMy husband had a piece of plastic in his butter on his steak. We sent it back and they brought us short rib gnocchi. It was pretty tasty, but we only slightly nibbled. We ate some of his potatoes au gratin, which were very good.  It took about 15-20 min for a new steak, so we were disappointed we didn't eat dinner \"together\". \n\nWith that being said, Jeff took care of us! He comped my husband's steak and potatoes (which ended up being a nice cut and delicious) then brought us some sparkling moscato with paired cheesecakes.  OMG! This part was like, WOW! We don't even like moscato but it paired so beautifully with the cheesecakes. \n\nI also had the Barrymore rose' which was excellent!\n\nOverall, our experience ended on a good note,  and the food was good. If it wasn't for Jeff, I don't think I would have given 4 stars. And I didn't give 5, b\/c I didn't LOVE my food and my husband did have a weird piece of plastic in his food.
