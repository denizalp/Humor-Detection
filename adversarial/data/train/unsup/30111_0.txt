I decided to give it a try contrary to some bad reviews. I should have listened to the reviews or better yet should have known when I got there and saw carpet on the floor. After all Gordon Ramsey does say it's not higenic to have carpet on the floor in a restaurant. This is how it starts: Our waitress was beyond rude, when we were deciding on what to order she was rushing us and rolled her eyes, instead of saying \"I'll give you a minute and come back\" like a waitress should.  When our food came my husbands plate of shrimp and rice had no more than 4 shrimps????? and the rice was swimming in lemon. I've never seen  rice like that or should I say lemon rice pudding what it seemed like!!  Gross!  \nMy food was lukewarm the titzki sauce was not fresh. Needless to say we left hungry and went to eat somewhere else.  I wouldn't even rate it 1 star actually. So yeah I would NEVER go back let alone recommend  it.
