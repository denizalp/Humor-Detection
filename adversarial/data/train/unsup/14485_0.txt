This hotel is disappointing, but served adequate for my fun running group's Halloween '15 weekend.  I feel bad for anybody who thinks they're in for a romantic weekend at this \"boutique hotel\" -- they're going to be very disappointed.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- Rooms are beat up, although large rainfall shower was nice.\n\n- In-bedroom jacuzzi tub was dirty, rusty, and I felt at risk of an STD by just looking at it (pics coming up, of the jacuzzi, not of STDs).\n\n- Dog turds in the lawns about every 10 yards.  People, please clean up after your friends.  Rumor, please clean up after those irresponsible people.\n\n- Jet takeoffs and landings -- depending on wind direction -- overhead every couple minutes. \n\nOther stuff:\n\n- Pricing was pretty high for off-strip, about $175 a night.\n\n- Pool areas are fairly clean and well-kept.  \n\n- Staff was generally friendly, although somebody turned on the sprinklers while our band was playing outside.  Fortunately, no equipment was damaged.\n\n- Hard Rock is across the street.  One of my favorite Vegas places, the Hofbrauhaus, is across another street.  And that funky KISS tribute place, which has the indoor, glow-in-the-dark mini-golf course, is next door.\n\n- During checkout an employee was fielding a call from someone presumably calling to make a reservation.  The employee kept calling the place \"chic\" over and over.  I don't think the caller knew what the word meant.  I also don't think Rumor knows what that means.\n\n-They charge a mandatory resort fee, that standard Vegas way of extracting more cash out of you while not including it in the advertised room rate. Your mandatory resort fee gets you something other hotels won't give you:  free porn on, yep, Channel 69.  That's not just a rumor.\n\nYou could do a lot worse than Rumor in Vegas -- and yes, I'm calling out the adjacent and scary Alexis Park.  But in this price range, you can do much, much better.
