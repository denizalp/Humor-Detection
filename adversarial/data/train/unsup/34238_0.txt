Blue 32 is located right off Higley - the Hostess was friendly and informed us the bar area was open seating. \n\nThis visit was purely for a Adult Beverage before a family function, our server was hilarious when we told him reason for our visit. The beer was cold and refreshing and just what was needed prior to event. The server was swift knowing we were limited with time.  \n\nWill got back for Menu items
