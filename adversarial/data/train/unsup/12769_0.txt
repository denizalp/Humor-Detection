Unlike Barry Bonds, I have truthfully never juiced before.\nOh, that's a different type of juicing? Okay. Well I haven't done either. So I wasn't sure what to expect when I came to this place located inside Energy Cafe in Bank of America Plaza.  \n\nIt took about two seconds to realize how this place is different from Jamba Juice and Smoothie King. While the other two use fruit as well, they also add a ton of sugars and other things.\n  \nAfter I ordered (based on suggestion) the \"Oh Kale Yeah\" (Kale, Pineapple, Jalapeños, Celery, Lime and one or two other things) I could literally watch them throw the ingredients through a processor and see the juice come out one side and the scraps out the other.  \n\nThat is it!\n\nThe only thing that went into my cup was the juice from these raw fruits and vegetables.  \n\nThe taste was...interesting. It was good. Very good. But not like anything I had before. The pineapple and lime made it slightly sweet while that Kale, Celery and Jalapeños gave it a slightly earthy but palatable taste.  \n\nI'd go back occasionally because it's a bit pricy but I think they literally have the best stuff you can put in your body in an array of seemingly flavorful combinations.\nBesides juices, they also do smoothies and juice shots containing a bunch of helpful things when you are sick.
