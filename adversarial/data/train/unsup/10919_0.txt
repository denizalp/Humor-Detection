Horrendous food, good service. I've been here more than once and each order has been 100% terrible. It is not only my opinion, but my family's as well. Pass by this place! Food is too greasy. The eggs that I got in the brunch selection tasted like they were from a carton. To conclude, if Nickleback was a restaurant, it would be the Lazy Dog.
