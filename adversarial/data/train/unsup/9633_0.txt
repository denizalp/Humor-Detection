What up, Downtown?\n\nFirst of all, let's start with the location and restaurant.  Located in the downtown area and within walking distance from the Fremont Experience.  For someone that is not familiar with the area, it can easily be missed since it's literally below some apartments.  Just remember that it's at the corner of Carson & 7th.  The outside and inside brings me back home.  This establishment reminds me of the historic North Park area of San Diego where restaurants, cafes, and stores sit below apartments.  \n\nI met fellow Yelper Terri R for breakfast and we were both ready to chow down.  The menu is as simple as it gets.  No folding laminated menu, just a one page sheet.  Everything looked good, but I decided on the Smoked Salmon. Yes, fish for breakfast.  Besides, I was going to have eggs for lunch. \n\nThe Smoked Salmon is served with tomatoes, cream cheese, and rye bread.  I have to admit, this is one of the best raw salmons that I've had in a while. Seasoned just right, thinly cut, and not fishy at all.  \n\nI thought that the staff was as good as it gets.  They were attentive and kept our drinks filled.  The owner was also around making her rounds.  But what I noticed is that she was genuine and sincere with her guests.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when you're in a middle of a conversation and a waiter\/waitress interrupts you.  Our waiter was great with his timing and was around when he was needed.  Kudos Eat!!!\n\nI will definitely be back because there's still more that I need to try.  My only regret...I forgot to try their Beignets.  \n\n\nTIP:  Bring some Quarters for the parking meters outside.
