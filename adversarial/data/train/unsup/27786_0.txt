The wife and I visited this establishment this past Sunday to compare it to the one we used to go to in Forest Park Illinois. I had read here on yelp about the long lines and indeed we ran into that when we arrived about noon on Sunday. There was a 20 minute wait and i was shocked to see this place so busy do to the fact that it is right next to a Motel 6. I say that because with the obvious patrons from the Motel i would think people would not come because they would have to \"battle\" with the Motel crowd.\n\nWhen we were seated we got a very nice waitress, we already knew what we wanted so we ordered. I had the smoked turkey sausage with 2 eggs, 3 buttermilk pancakes, and hasbrowns. My wife had Pancakes with 2 eggs with chorizo sausage and hashbrowns. The FOOD is definitely the reason for the long lines people...trust me we were not disappointed at all with that. The service was outstanding as well and while it is a little more expensive than in Illinois the FOOD more than made up for it.\n\nA personal note here: i was a huge fan of The skillets this establishment  made back in Illinois which consisted of potatoes,  3 eggs, your choice of 4 kinds of meat , cheese  and,  veggies. This was definitely the best deal in the house for the money, but this pancake house did not have it on their menu. You can order all of these things however,  a la carte but it will cost you, but trust me all mixed together it is quite delicious.\n\nNow i don't know if i will go again on a weekend day, due to the lines but i will have to visit during the week to see how it looks then. Also bring CASH because unlike the location in Illinois they don't take plastic here. So i will keep you posted my friends as i plan to visit them this coming Monday, until then Eat, Drink and  Be Merry!!!!!
