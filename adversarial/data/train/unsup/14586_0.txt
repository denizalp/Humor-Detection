When this store was Marshall Field's, I was a regular shopper.  It was always clean and neat with friendly associates who were willing to go the extra mile to make you happy.  Fast forward to 2014 and Macy's.  This store is in constant disarray.  It amazes me how crammed the racks are.  It makes it difficult to walk in departments without getting hit in the arms or the back.  There selection of Men's big and tall is totally non existent.  Every department is either so jumbled with clothing that it is impossible to shop or their tables are just piled (not folded) with so much stuff that you just wanna pass it by.  Then there is the subject of their employees.  RUDE.  They could care less about how their department looks.  All they are concerned with is when is my shift over and when do I get paid.   There are many other choices that I have to shop at and I will always choose those over Macy's.
