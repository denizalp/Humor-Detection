An unusual mix of a wine\/cocktail lounge with native themed decor, and authentic southern BBQ. The $4 glasses of Merlot on Wednesday were highly drinkable, and went well with the BBQ sampler platter. The brisket was very good, tender and I'm not sure what kind of wood they use but it left a great smoke flavour. The chicken was unremarkable, but the sausage was nice and spicy with a good texture. The ribs were 70th percentile. The only irksome thing about the sample platter was that for two people it did not include any pulled pork.  It was on $32 special, so I didn't feel compelled to complain, but it's something to be aware of and isn't clear from the menu.  Notable were the sides: the creamy coleslaw was a favourite of my wife, but I missed the vinegar personally, but we both liked the tangy, firm and unusually spiced baked beans. The BBQ sauce was likewise unusual and tasty, with tamarind maybe? Overall a respectable BBQ meal with the aforementioned price specials, in an unexpected setting. The place was very quiet when we were there, so you might want to check it out sooner rather than later!
