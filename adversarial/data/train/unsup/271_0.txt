Great place.\n\nAll the staff is incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable. \n\nEven though a beer I was looking for was not in stock, I was told the delivery time and date seeing as they had a limit on it. \nYou can buy single beers for trying new stuff for $1.69 which is great! They also sell the basic home brew supplies for those who wish to make their own!\n\nMy wife ventured over in the food side, where they sell all varieties of beer and wine glasses. As well as a good stock of some hard to find items (foreign spices, hard to find cheeses)\n\nOverall love this place as it is the best place to get good craft beer in this neighborhood outside of driving downtown!
