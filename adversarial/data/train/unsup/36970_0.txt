Worst nightclub I have ever been to. We went for the Big Sean concert (5\/13\/17). \n\n1. They have no way of prioritizing paying customers, besides the fact that when you stand in line you realize 3\/4ths of the people in line are on \"the guest list\" which means when you paid $130 for you and your buddy to get in, they got in for free.\n\n2. Ride security guards. These guys deal with people left and right - I get it, but they're the worst. Absolute snobs.\n\n3. Club had to be over capacity - drinks are absurdly priced ($15 a drink) beer too! \n\n4. You can't move. Who wants to go to a club where it's so packed you can't move? \n\n5. They'll take your possessions and throw them in the bin by their metal detector where they could get stolen. \"Were not responsible for what happens to it.\" - besides the fact it was them who took it.\n\n6. Just a horrible club. We left before Big Sean came out - wasn't waiting until 2am to see him go, \"I got the moves\" and I had no where to move. \n\nFuck Drais.
