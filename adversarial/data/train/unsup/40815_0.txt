Fast Feet Shoe Repair is a small shoe repair shop in Bridlewood Mall in Scarborough. We found this shop unexpectedly and fell in love with the owner, a sweet older gentlemen who genuinely loves his job fixing shoes. He is a miracle worker on boots and heeled shoes. I trust him with my favourite shoes, and he always does a flawless job with excellent service. He is extremely affordable. I had my boots repaired (one heel was completely broken) and shined for $20 dollars.\n\nHighly recommend!!!
