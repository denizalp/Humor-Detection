Went here with a friend for lunch because I wanted to try Peruvian food and I'd figure it was finally time to check this place out because of all the positive reviews! \n\nI ended up getting the lunch special which was about $9 and it came with a dish and a small bowl of soup. I got the Aji De Gallina per the recommendation of the waitress and my friend got the Arroz con pollo. Out of the two dishes my friend and I both liked mine better. My dish reminded me of a Japanese curry dish except the sauce is bright yellow and has shredded chicken and some veggies in it. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the dish was and it made me feel good that I was able to enjoy a dish that didn't have any fried components lol. There was plenty of flavor from the sauce, a good amount of chicken meat, and the veggies were not overcooked and mushy. This is perfect comfort food that is filling and very easy to eat. \n\nIf you haven't been to this restaurant yet, I highly recommend that you come check it out! Their menu is a bit pricey, but I can understand why because the food is pretty good and the waitress said that everything is home-cooked and not pre-made. The food was so good that I am definitely going to come back and try out their other dishes. Before committing, I'd recommend coming in for their lunch special first and see if you like the food. After that, you can see if you would be willing to come back to try their signature dishes.
