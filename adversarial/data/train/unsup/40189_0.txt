My hubby made the appointment for me yesterday and I honestly didn't think my window could be repaired. I drove to the shop just knowing they would say I needed a whole new windshield but in about 30 minutes they worked their magic! (Yay me!) Unfortunately I can't remember the technicians name but his birthday is tomorrow (overheard him talking about it) so HAPPY BIRTHDAY and again, THANKS a ton!
