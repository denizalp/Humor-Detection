I'm a sucker for all things Disney. ESPECIALLY when it comes to The Lion King. One of the main reasons that I wanted to stay at Mandalay was because of this amaze-balls show.\n\nTickets were normal theater prices - $77 to $250. We got the cheap-o seats, and they were not all that bad. The huge, beautiful costumes were easy to see for everyone, and WOW, they managed to design the whole animal kingdom and then some. It was a truly jaw-dropping visual feast.\n\nThe music was equally wonderful. The classics from the Disney movie were there as well as a few extras. I particularly liked the adult Nala's solo song about leaving Pride Rock. All of the actors were clearly very well trained and very talented. \n\nI can see how kids would love this show, but honestly, this production is for anyone who wants to enjoy a great show in Vegas.
