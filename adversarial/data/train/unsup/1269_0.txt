Do not use this spa. They do not honor contracts. I had planned a wedding-related outing for 14 ladies (many out of town guests). I was told twice that the spa was reserved for our party by April Rowen over the phone. Then they cancelled my entire event via EMAIL. Their excuse was that I didn't confirm the guest list fast enough, although I responded to the email in under 48 hours. I was also accused of not paying a credit card deposit. They never asked for one at any point. Please do not support this unprofessionalism. They have put my family in a horrible position now, and I have reported them to the better business bureau as well as wbtv news.
