The first time I tried Pizza My Dear was in 2009 and I knew right away I would be going back.  For just the taste it is one of the best pizza places out there.  For value, they really blow everyone else away if you order the large pizza from 10-4.  It is only $5 and tastes great!  My wife and I get one at least every other week.
