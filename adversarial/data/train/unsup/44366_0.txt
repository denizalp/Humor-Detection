I've never eaten in a sushi place on a conveyer belt. :) It was very cool! Watching the sushi and selecting was heaps of fun! There was a lot of sushi selections and even desserts like cream puffs! It was also cute how they even had drinks on plates like Ramune. They have a lot of sushi that I haven't tried even as random as \"asparagus roll\". The fish slices (on nigiri) were decent! I'm glad that the sushi was labeled or else I would have eaten jalapeno on tempura batter haha! The price per plate was reasonable!
