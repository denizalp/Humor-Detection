It's all about execution, baby!  As an operations guy I really appreciate the execution I see at In & Out burger again and again.  Since moving to AZ I have made probably 15 total visits to In & Out burger spread over 5-6 locations.  \n\nNot once has there been the slightest mistake on my order.\n\nNot once has an employee been anything less than polite and efficient.\n\nWhile In & Out is not the greatest burger on earth it is pretty good and has been 100% consistent across locations and visits.\n\nThat's execution, baby.\n\nStark contrast to a local McDonald's where it has actually become an amusing stat for us to follow.  They have not gotten an order right for us.  Ever.
