This review is for Whitney, as my other review focused on Shaina and her amazing work. \n\nAs always, the shop was cute, classy, and clean from the front door to the restroom. The girls who work the desk are so sweet and friendly and always greet me, and when I've overlapped with other clients, by name. Everyone always takes a moment to talk to you and is genuine about it, not just making small talk or following a script. I know this because from month to month they'll remember what's going on and random events that I mention while I'm there. \n\nBut on to Whitney! She was perfect and so helpful!! I've been faithfully seeing Shaina for years and refused to let others touch my eyebrows but I had a scheduling conflict and decided to go with Whitney for my usual tint and wax. She listened to exactly what I wanted regarding the color and made me look great! I was also pretty hurt when I made the appointment and she took the time to make sure I was comfortable and actually helped me when I had issues getting off table which I appreciated so much. I'm not surprised that the quality of work was so high, I've never been disappointed when it comes to Pink Cherry! \n\nThe moral of the story is, if you want that perfect brow, any of the ladies at this shop can get it for you!
