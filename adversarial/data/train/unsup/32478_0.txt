Horrible service, there is always a line of customers and like two teller working. If you go into the bank plan on waiting in line for at least 30 minutes no matter what time of day you go in. They need to hire more tellers period. Here's an idea instead of having someone stand at the front door saying hi to everyone that walks in and ask them why they are in the bank have that person get behind the teller counter and actually help customers so they can get on with the day instead of standing there doing essentially nothing.
