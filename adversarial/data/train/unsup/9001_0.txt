If I could give them 0 stars I would !!  We stayed 3 nights and 4 days in this hotel and it sucked every night. Everything started when we walked in the room!! We asked for a non smoking well we got a smoking room !! Then we realized the tv was broken!! Also the fire detector was cover !!! We called and it took them 4 hours to fix everything and we only got an I'm sorry !!! If your are trying to get down to the casinos around noon well good luck. it took us 30 min to find an elevator that will take us down because for some stupid reason this hotel doesn't believe in stairs.
