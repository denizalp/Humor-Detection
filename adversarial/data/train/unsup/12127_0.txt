This place is CHEAP. I guess if you wanted a cheap clean up without having to book an appintment, and went in with a picture of EXACTLY what you wanted, it'd be good for that. Otherwise, if you want a different shape to your hair, or wanted a relaxing experience where you had a conversation about what you wanted with a stylist who actually listened, this is NOT the place to go.\n\nFirst off, the music here is really loud and drowns out all other sounds. The stylists seem a bit... off, like they're ON DRUGS or way too much coffee. Nice people, I just didn't feel comfortable having them cutting my hair because quite frankly they seemed to be in a different world than the one I was in. The two cuts I had there when I was younger actually weren't bad. They were just generic female cuts, nothing disastrous, but nothing that was personalized or wow-worthy either. However, since I only get my hair cut a few times a year, I'd rather spend a little more, but have a nice and relaxing experience and pay to get what I really want. \n\nAlso, although I haven't had disatrous experiences there myself, I have seen a male friend's haircut which was really really badly botched by them (he had to shave his head). That's a problem with salons that have such a high turnover rate - you never know what you're going to get.\n\nbtw, last time I went, which was a few years ago, they only took cash. Since I only had cards they made me leave my purse with them as collateral as I walked out to a nearby convenience store to take out the cash. Also, make sure you ask for how much the hair cut is going to be BEFORE the cut, as it seems randomly decided otherwise.
