Good Chinese food here. Now I'm not saying it's the best I ever had but it's quite delicious. I always order Moo Goo Gai Pan my favorite dish. It's tasty and the meat is soft. Their egg soup is just okay. Staff is friendly and they clean up after you once you are done with your food, which is actually pretty great considering its Chinese fast food. The place itself is clean unlike some other ones I've been to. Would come back here again.
