I'll come right out and say this review is based on the fact that this Walmart did not have a product I was looking for. Well, actually, they carry it, they were just out of it. But to be fair, so were the other THREE fricken Walmart's that I visited before this one. Regardless. I have very negative feelings for businesses that run out of stuff. In today's world with electronic inventory and all that, should never happen. Sure, I realize that the Mfg. could have run out and all that, but then again, if that were true, I wouldn't have been able to drive over to Walgreen s and find it. Sorry Walmart.\n2 Stars.
