So much fun to watch them make the noodles in the kitchen while you wait. I wish I'd known it was cash only before going though. Spring rolls were tasty and crispy and well worth the $2.50 and the pulled chicken dry noodle was absolutely amazing. Lots of people at the resturant did not delay service one bit.
