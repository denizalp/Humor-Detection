Came here since my friend was craving for burgers and this popped up on yelp.  I had no clue what kind of burgers they had until I stepped inside.\n\nThen I saw the pho burger so I had to try it. It's cute that it comes with a small cup of pho broth to drink or dip ur burger in.\n\nThe burger meat was yummy.  Really soft and the pho burger was the bomb.  The people who work there r nice too. \n\nGotta come back to try the rest.
