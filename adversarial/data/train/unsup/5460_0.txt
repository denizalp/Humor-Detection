Ahh, Bill's.\nNobody satisfies the \"white-man's-Chinese\" urge quite like you.\n\nOn the whole, everything is very well-prepared. \nBill's will leave you feeling full, but never gross.\n\nI am hard-pressed to find a dumpling better than Bill's. \n\nThe service, however, is really what sets Bill's apart. \nEver-attentive, ever-professional, these white-polo-and-denim-clad masters are ready to serve you at your very whim and command.\nAnd none more masterful than the great Spock himself.\n\nFor this reason (as well as the freshness of food) it is always a better choice to dine-in than carry out (or worse still, delivery).\n\nGod bless you, Bill. You have changed my life.
