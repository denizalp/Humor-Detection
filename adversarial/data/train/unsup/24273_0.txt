Holy sh*t!   *#!@!!*#???  F**K !!!! Sorry, I'm not prone to using profanity, but that's how upset I am that today was my first visit to Stinkweeds.  I have wasted countless hours surfing iTunes listening to 20 second clips of music, when I simply needed to walk into Stinkweeds and say, \"Hi, tell me about some cool music.\"  I am completely outsourcing my music shopping to the staff of this store.  Let me tell you about my first time.  I walked in the door. I am sure I looked disoriented.  I had not been inside a true record store in years.  The fact that the shelves were filled with an overwhelmingly large number of albums with unrecognizable band names amplified my disorientation.  A member of the staff approached me. \"Do you need help?\"  I hesitated, thinking to myself, I am so not cool,  I am about to be exposed.  I must have nodded in the affirmative because he quickly followed up with  \"What kind of music do you like?\"  This is the most perilous question to be asked by a record store guy. Visions of High Fidelity flashing through my mind, I mumbled, \"Uh, I don't know.\"   \"Yes, you do.  Tell me.\"  I managed to rattle off the names of a few non-mainstream bands that I actually really love.  I waited for a respond.  \"Cool.  Let me play you something.\"  He proceeded to switch the music being played in the store to his pick for me.  Within minutes I was sold.  We repeated this process until I had selected 3 absolutely amazing albums that I would have never found on my own.  After wandering around the store for a while on my own, admiring the wide selection of stellar music, I decided it was time to pay and get on with my day.  Record store guy paused a moment before ringing up my purchase.  \"Wait a second, I think we have used copies of all 3 of these albums. I'm going to save you some money.\"  Sure enough, after some searching, he returned with the promised goods.  Total price for 3 amazingly good albums?  $24 including tax.  I'm hooked.  Awesome music selection, friendly non-threatening staff (yes, I know that's redundant), lots of used CDs...  you know where to find me next weekend.
