After soaking my nails for 30 plus minutes watching people that came after me be helped, I decided to quietly go up to the front desk to pay whatever they might've wanted for soaking my nails, and leave. Unfortunately things didn't go as planned when this lovely gentleman and I use the word lovely very loosely, decided to make a scene (what I was trying to avoid) because he believed waiting 30 min for a soak was normal, sorry sir I don't! Anywho after learning it was my first time there he proceeded to tell me I can go. first and last time my friend ! Really disappointing because place was actually really cute . Such a dick ! I really wasn't trying to be nasty all I wanted was to leave.
