A bit disappointing as I thought this would be a more original place. No mugs? a latte spoiled by a horrible lid? Not the best start for me. I was looking forward to visit this place for long, but the first impression was not the best and I hardly think I would return. If you like chain crappy coffee you'll hate me, but if you crave an original expresso in your latte with that professional art....you'll understand me.
