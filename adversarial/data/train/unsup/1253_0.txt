My friend and I went to Johnny's Wife's Place II on a Tuesday about 6pm.  They have the place partitioned between the bar area and the more family friendly dining area.  I am more of a fan of sitting at the bar especially if there is a party of 2, but she preferred the dining room so we settled over there.\n\nThe place is kind of divey, but it wasn't dirty.  My friend commented that they did some remodeling since the last time she was there.  The service was nice and not slow.  They do offer craft beers but like so many places they don't include the ABV and when ordering IPA's I find this an important fact to know, especially if you are the one driving.  So as I found out later the IPA I ordered was nearly 10% ABV!  Gee I wish I knew, I had two of them...shhhhhh....\n\nThe food was ok.  But again this is not a dinner restaurant.  They serve bar food.  Wraps, app's, burgers, salads, wings.  Now these things can be good or bad or just mediocre.  I had the roasted red pepper wrap and it came with house made chips.  It wasn't bad but pretty standard.  I think this place is a good stop to watch a game, have lunch, or as stated for some typical bar grub.  I wanted to try their wings but they were \"market price\" I believe half a dozen was about $9.00, and a dozen about $16.99.  A bit pricey for a bar in Irwin.
