So the only reason this place gets 3 stars is because of the smoked wings. They really are fantastic and not your average wing. The beer selection is very good as well but the wine is something to be desired. I get that this is a brewery though so I can forgive the wine. We tried a grilled cheese that had goat cheese on it, not the worst but absolutely not the best. We also tried some regular wings and they were sub par. I had the sandwich called the 'bob and martha' and it was over cooked. The pastrami was better than the corned beef (which you had to pull just to take a bite) and the peppers were a good touch. It was so dry though that I couldn't even eat half of it. \n\nSo if you do go here do yourself a favor and get a beer, some homemade chips with sauce, and the smoked wings. Put the sauce that comes with the chips on everything. It has a pretty big kick so watch out but I could eat it off my shoe it was so good.
