Went with my daughter on the GroupOn because we wanted to splurge and go somewhere nicer than our regular strip mall nail salon. Glad I didn't pay full price. We got the $85 for 2 gel manicure and pedicure GroupOn and left $40 in tip (based on the actual price). We got a very basic pedicure - no massage or callous removal and our gel manicure is already chipped and peeling after less than 48 hours. This is especially annoying as we are headed out on vacation and don't have time to get a repair manicure before we leave town. The two nail techs were nice enough and the facility was lovely. But for the price I paid, we could have gotten the VIP treatment from the strip mall joint. I think I will stick with that next time.
