Wasn't our first choice but everything else was booked. I really enjoyed the charred octopus and mussels. For main course we had the crab duo (Alaskan King crab and crab cakes) and the market fish (forgot what kind of fish it was). The crab duo was just OK, nothing special. I had a bite of the fish and really liked it. Overall the food I thought was pretty good (would have skipped the crab duo and just gotten the fish next time). So why only 3-stars? For the service. From the time we got there service\/hospitality just wasn't right. The server didn't even off to tell us the fish selection until we asked for it. Everything felt a little rushed, like they didn't even want us there...
