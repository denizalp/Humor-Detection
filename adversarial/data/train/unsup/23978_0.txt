Food has gone downhill since they first opened.  This is a quality problem in the kitchen.\n\nService has become not-so-great.  I have eaten here several times and it feels like I'm being ignored while I stand at the entrance.  Staff will walk by and not say a word. Not even the requisite, \"Someone will be with you in a moment.\"\n\nAlso, when is this place supposed to be open.  Showed up at 7:50, they changed their hours to 8am. Waited 30 minutes for someone to unlock the door. Never came. \n\nMy guess is the owner sucks to work for, or the people who work here just suck at service. \n\nIn any case, my experiences here have been hit-or-miss, and I don't want to play \"breakfast roulette\" any more.\n\nYou have broken the circle of trust, Hometown.
