Great breakfast and brunch options. I came around 11 AM on a Saturday and it was packed. The menu offered typical brunch options but everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious. My eggs were flavorful and delivered to my table in about 10 minutes. They atmosphere was energetic and feels kind of hipster but not overly so.
