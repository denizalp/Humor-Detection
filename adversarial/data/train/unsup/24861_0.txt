I give L'Atelier 3.5 stars but when push came to shove, I downgraded to 3 because the food was not memorable.\nL'Atelier is at MGM grand and has a modern decor.  We sat at the bar and ordered small plates.\nSmall they were, not that much food at all.  Little substance.  Yes, flavorful but I was not impressed.\nWe had been drinking beer during the day so stayed with it but they only have a few choices on tap.  That was a bit sad :(\nService was good and prompt.  \nIn sum, it's fine but quite pricey for that you get in food.
