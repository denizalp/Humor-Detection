After reading all the incredible reviews about your Friday night Gourmet Dinner, I was enthusiastic about the opportunity of dining at The Buffet. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. There was nothing gourmet about this dinner. \n\nI arrived at 9:15pm and clearly paid prior to entering the buffet. I was hungry and excited to enjoy the culinary delights. The dining tables were dirty with trash all over the floor. This was quite unexpected. Furthermore, service was horrendous. My plates were never cleared promptly upon completion of my meal. I would return from the buffet line to the same set of plates, with no room to place my new plates. The buffet food options were also unacceptable. The seafood was not fresh, rather suspiciously fishy and to the point where it might have been spoiled. There were limited options as items were not replenished even though the buffet remains open until 10:30pm. The \"Kobe\" beef was tough, dry, and inedible.\n\nDon't go here, spend the same amount of money and go to Sushisamba at the Palazzo!
