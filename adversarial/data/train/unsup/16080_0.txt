I have lived here for a year now & cannot wait to move. \n\nDo not be fooled. When you are touring or checking the place out. They make it seem like this weird Pleasant-ville esque type place where everyone knows your name and they wave and are all happy and smiles. Again, do not be fooled. \n\nSure they have a nice pool, no tennis courts, and decent looking apartments. But their management is not very good. If you expect a problem to be fixed, do not expect in a timely fashion.\n\nI understand you cannot control your neighbors but they have no backbone when they need to control their tenants. My neighbor is a drug dealer who has gotten into screaming fights with people and thrown a chair down the stairs. After this whole ordeal, Crystal Cove didnt blink an eye or evict him. Apparently I was the nuisance in this case.  I told them I did not feel safe in my apartment and apparently that was of no concern to them. \n\nWe had an ant problem on the second floor. No cock roaches, so I guess thats cool.\n\nI'll update when we move out..\n\nEDIT\n\nSo we moved out. Want to know what made us move out faster?! We got ants!!! Yeah so that happened. Good news is they had an exterminator come the next morning. Bad news: they didn't fix the carpet the ripped up. That was annoying. \n\nTo recap: don't expect much. I gave it two stars because it is an alright location and there is a roof over your head. Don't expect much from management.
