I really enjoyed my time at Harlem. I had heard from a friend and read in some yelp reviews that the food is great and the vibe matches. I visited this past Saturday during my time in Toronto and must say that it was very pleasant. I made a reservation before the trip (which I probably didn't need to do because there were tables available) but I didn't mind. I'm pretty sure the space fills very quickly in the evenings when there are performances.\n\nThe food was good. I had a jerk chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. My girl had a fish sandwich and ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. We were stuffed! They had some tasty sauce in addition to the ketchup that added a different type of flavor.\n\nUnfortunately I do not remember our waitresses name but she was very kind and helpful. She also gave us the tip to park near the restaurant and walk to the subway so that we could avoid paying exorbitant fees for parking when visiting the air Canada centre. That was great because we were able to experience the subway and not have to worry about traffic leaving the arena.
