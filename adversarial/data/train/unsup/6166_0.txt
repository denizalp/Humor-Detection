GREAT place, very inexpensive, and has a Farmer's Market type of feel to it.  \n  The fruit's and vegetables are natural, so don't expect the preservatives or the other cosmetics you would find at your chain store in order to make the place bright and pretty.  This place is as down to earth as dirt! \nGreat place for anyone who is into juicing!
