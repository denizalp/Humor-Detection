I have been here twice, once for breakfast and another time pub crawling Fremont.  Both different experiences but I can mix it up if needed!\n\nOn my most recent visit, which was last night, we were pub crawling on Repeal Day, the end of prohibition. There were five of us and we saddled up to the bar where we all ordered cocktails and bar food. The atmosphere is quite alright with a mix of locals and tourists. \n\nWe ordered the fried pickles, which we shared and the $2 Tacos on Taco Tuesday special. The tacos were good for $2 tacos on Fremont street in a trendy bar. There are two choices of beef or chicken, we ordered one of each for three people.  Like I said, it was bar food nothing extravagant!\n\nThe breakfasts are very good actually. Breakfast places in Vegas are kind of weird for locals and I am sure weirder for tourists. There are wonderful places off the Strip or away from downtown Vegas but if you happen to be in the downtown area you may want to check out Park on Freemont. It is not inside a casino so you do not have to go through anxiety just to find it and then settle on a buffet. It is pretty much on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. If the weather is good there is outside seating in the front and back. The breakfasts are creative and fun, see my photos. All was yummy and to be able to sit back and chill in the morning is a pretty sweet deal from the casino or chain restaurant alternative.\n\nDon't forget to have a go on the park like teeter totter that is in the way back behind the wall. They don't call it Park on Fremont street for nothing!
