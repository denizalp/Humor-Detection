Tacos Rick-o was next up on the parade of food wagons and so it's tacos like somebody's mom made somewhere. Is it authentic? Not unless someone grew up in a taco truck, but when when someone takes over the business these will be \"the original recipes that Rick-O used to make.\" and that's close enough for now.\n6\" tortillas plus meats, cilantro, onions, radish, and cucumber slices: pollo, asada, mas pollo for less than USD $10.00 and quick too. Really he only way this gets better is if the truck is parked closer to the R&D center. Next time up we're going for a rice bowl thing or maybe a ques, saw a few walk past and I'm convinced it's a good idea.
