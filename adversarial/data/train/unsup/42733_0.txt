I stopped in around 1:30 today, and placed my order with the friendly lady at the counter.  I asked for the bento, which is not listed on the menu (thanks Yelp.) I ordered the Kahlua pork, chicken katsu, and teriyaki chicken with macaroni.  I also ordered a spam musubi on the side.\n\nThe food took about 5 minutes. And it was cooked fresh.  The musubi came out hot and wrapped to keep it moist.  It was the winner of the meal.  The rest I could do without.  \n\nThe teriyaki was akin to what you would at the mall. And the Kahlua pork was sitting in a boat of grease. I wanted to drive back to get more musubi, because the rest of the items were not to my liking. However, the spam musubi, was the best I ever had. The next time I go back, I'll order a few of them as my meal.
