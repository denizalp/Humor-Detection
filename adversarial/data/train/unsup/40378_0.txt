After a long afternoon walking around the Cleveland Zoo in 90 degree weather, our group was ready for some refreshments! We read through the list of local ice cream establishments and decided that Sweet Moses sounded most promising! We were definitely not let down. I loved everything about this place. The atmosphere, all of the yummy treats, and the overall appearance of originality! We couldn't finish our sundaes (they are massive and delicious!! Next time my husband and I will probably share) and we left on a sugar high. I have already recommended this place to other people (while we were still there even!) and I will definitely definitely be back
