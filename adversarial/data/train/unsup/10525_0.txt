Jan Rouven was Amazing!\n\nI got 5 comped tickets through my Company to see this show and to be honest was not expecting much from a show at the Clarion. Boy was I wrong!\n\nUs ladies were running behind schedule getting ready and dolled up for the night so we ended up walking in as the show was about to start.\n\nWe were seated in a booth in the back of the showroom and asked if we would be able to sit closer as we saw many open booths in the front open. No problem the Usher moved us to a booth up front and center stage! We were so close we could smell the sweat of the performer's bodies!\n\nJan Rouven is not only nice to look at and adorable with his German accent, he can really put on a show!\n\nThe magic\/illusion stunts he does are really good, we were extremely entertained with ALL of his acts.\n\nHe provides for some audience participation which is fun!\n\nHis dancer's both female and male are awesome as well!\n\nCriss Angel should come see this show and take note on what a real illusions show should be! Jan Rouven puts Criss Angel to shame and does not have a nasty cocky attitude that Criss does.\n\nAfter the show Jan came out and signed autographs, and took pictures with everyone! He is so sweet and down to earth!\n\nThis show is children friendly as well.\n\nThe music had me bumping in our booth!\n\n4 Strong stars well deserved!
