Yay! I have soft water!! When I was getting ready to move into my new house, I found out it had a soft water loop with no soft water unit. So I began my search for soft water units, I found this company online. Gave them a call, I work weird hours but they were able to stop by and evaluate everything while I was at work. \n\nThey did the install and came by to explain everything to me on a day when I was home. They even did it before I paid them. I got the best service, they were great at communicating with me and leaving me notes and instructions. Great guys and when I want to expand my water quality I am going to get their R\/O system. \n\nCheck out their website and give them a call!!
