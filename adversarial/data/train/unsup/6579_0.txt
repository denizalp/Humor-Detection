I like to think of this place like going to the cooler (temperature wise) part of HELL.  \n\nMaybe because I am guy, or because I hate shopping or because I despise long lines, but whenever I think of any Walmart, I think of one place - HELL.  \n\nWell if there was a nicer part of Hell, that say had less demons, and was less scorchingly hottt, this Walmart would be that equivalent.  I say that because, as always the prices are simply cheaper than everywhere else and its actually not impossible to get to this Walmart due to the easy in, easy out access (thats what she said - LOL).\n\nOf course parking sucks, and of course the produce is dreadful, and you already know the lines are  stupid-long all weekend EVERY weekend.  \n\nBut if you can manage to go at the right times, and one the right days, then this is the nicest of all HELLS in Charlotte.
