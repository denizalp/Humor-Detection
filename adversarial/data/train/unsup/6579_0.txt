.....why DO fools rush in?????\n\nListen, I no fool. \n\nI eloped.\n\nand Elvis walked me down the aisle.\n\nIn less than 30 minutes I was married and ready for celebrating. \n\nAnd let me tell you, I have not stopped celebrating.!! Big wedding idea was not for me, but sharing good laughs and enjoying an intimate\/memorable moment with the one person I love is. I highly recommend GWC for any Elvis fan who wants a no fuss ceremony.\n\n**thanks to all the staff who so kindly calmed my nerves while I waited and answered all my emails!!
