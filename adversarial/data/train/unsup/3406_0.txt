The unyielding devotion to this chain (which is a half step above Bubba Gump's) is quite amazing, but they truly live up to their good rep.  I had a great time here.\n\nI have family in Texas that rave about this chain, so when I when I drove by this one in Phoenix, I knew I had to check it out.  And as fate would have it, a friend decided to bring me here for happy hour.  We were on a mission to try the Category 5.  This is a blended drink which combines a house Margarita with a Hurricane.  This won't knock you out like a Hurricane, but it definately packs a punch.  What kind of punch you ask?  The one that let's you think that ordering FRIED Calamari (with artichokes), FRIED catfish (I think) and FRIED Alligator is a good idea.  \n\nYeah, I said it.  \"FRIED GATOR\".\n\nYes, it tasted like chicken, and it was delicious.  I think after a Category 5, they could have fried up the sole of a shoe and I would have liked it.  This place has great ambiance, and a good fun, festive vibe.
