I ordered take out from here through justeat.ca and it was a breeze. In my humble opinion it does not hold up to my all time favorite Thai restraunt but was pleasant and experience and I will eat here again in time.\n\nThe food was FAST and I mean less than 20 minutes from order to my front door, I was very nearly caught with my pants down. \n\nMy consisted of Coconut sticky rice, Red Duck Curry and Yellow chicken Curry. The rice was rice nothing special, the Duck curry was fairly tasty but lacking in the most important ingredient - The Duck. I was overwhlmed and disapointed by the excess of duck fat, skin and grisle; there was a distinct lack of actual meat. I realize duck is fatty beyond compare but it was deeply unsatisfying.\nThe Yellow curry was a spectacular dish wich I greedily consumed with gusto, the spice was right and the sauce blew me away .\n\nMy GF ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and despite touching her upper limit for heat was delicious.\n\nBetter than most - Look elsewhere for good duck.
