I am absolutely in love with this place! This is a new jamaican restaurant they added to the food court this year, I could not be happier. Everyday between 10-3 they have a daily lunch special and I always make it just in time to get my fix. Every time I come I order the same thing, jerk chicken, because it taste so good and never disappoints. You can tell they marinate their meat because I literally suck all the flavour out of the bone. Thank you for coming to york and I look forward to trying the rest of your menu!
