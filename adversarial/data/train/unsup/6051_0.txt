THAT BOY MIKE CRAZY\n\nIt's ya boy, X from Glendale back with another one. This time I tried this spot Crazy Mike's Wings. \n\nThe wings were fire. I've had my share of wings before but yo these wings are big. The one I'm holding in my pic looked like the chicken was on steroids or somethin'. That thing was weighing me down and I aint the smallest chicken in the coop. But either way they crispy, tasty, and definitely get my approval. I fxx with the Honey BBQ one heavy, but the crazy mike's rub is good too. BEWARE the Spicy mikes rub is HOT. That one is hotter than Megan Fox in a bikini if you know what I mean. But they got the kool aid to ease the pain a lil. \n\nThe only complaint I got is the pricing. If you order 8 wings or 12 or 24, the price per wing is the same. That makes no sense and it should be cheaper if you order more wings. Mike crazy but he got no common sense at the same time. \n\nBut you know what they say, if you like it put a wing on it. Ima put a wing on it and I'll be back for sure\n\n-X
