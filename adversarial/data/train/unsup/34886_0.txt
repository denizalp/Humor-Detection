Fresh, tasty and great service. A line at 3pm on a Monday tells you something. We liked the double double animal style, which means pickles, a thousand island type spread and grilled onions (plus mustard on the patties pre-grilling). Preferred the fries plain and NOT animal style, which means the spread, grilled onions and cheez whiz. Yum
