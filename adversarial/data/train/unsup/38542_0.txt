I ordered hot tea to go with their special Hot Stone BiBamBop ( spelling ). How awesome! It come out sizzling so be careful! It comes with a sunny side up egg too. Talk about umami flavors! It's a mom and pop shop which I love because they care about their food quality and service. This meal comes with some side pickled cucumbers and carrots with jicama and of course Kim chi. It's not as spicy as I thought it would be, but that's fine by me. A squeezee bottle of Korean hot sauce can add some heat if you like. Highly recommend this place.
