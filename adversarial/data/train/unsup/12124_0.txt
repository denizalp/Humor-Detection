A little disappointed in this place. They said they couldn't accomodate a party of 15 on the weekend. That their kitchen could not handle \"that many plates\". Also turned us down for a tasting on the weekend too. Sorry we basically handed you a $750 party and you turned us down. Gladly will take our business elsewhere!
