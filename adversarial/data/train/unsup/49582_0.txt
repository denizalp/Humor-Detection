If Walgreens is merging with Rite Aid, and sells Rite Aid products, they should either take the anti-theft devices off or let the customer return it. I watched them argue with a woman who had her receipt from their store get beat down because she wanted them to take the device off. They couldn't--so what the hell did they sell that for? It was an unpleasant thing to watch.\nWeirdly enough, I just popped in their to buy condoms, not watch someone else get fucked.
