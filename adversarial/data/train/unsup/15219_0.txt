24\/7 bar?!?! Get outta here! I'm visiting from Salt Lake City, Utah where bars close at 130am. The beautiful purple bar caught my attention and hypnotized me to walk in. I didn't get the name of the bartender, but she made a boozy concoction for me: the Stockholm Royale. It's a strawberry champagne lemon drop drink. Bubbly, tasty, and the sugary rim added just enough sweetness! I only had time for one drink before heading to the airport to fly back home. Definitely a bar you need to check out if you need to get away from the strip and before you fly home anywhere!
