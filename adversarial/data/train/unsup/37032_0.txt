After opening for dinner and changing their former name (Cleveland's), I was worried that one of my favorite breakfast spots would be no more.  Rest assured, Plaka is still putting out one of the more underrated breakfasts in town.  I usually go with a breakfast sandwhich with american fries.  Simple.  Delicious.  A little greasy.  It is the perfect meal after a late night but also won't weigh you down for the rest of the day.  Service is fast, friendly and efficient.  What more can you ask for?
