I'm pregnant so I come here. The clothing styles are outdated and yucky. Did end up buying just one dress. I do come often to buy the Basq products which I find to work wonderful.\n\nThey offer you GMO juice or water in a plastic bottle. Neither are things pregnant women should have.\n\nThe staff is always on the phone especially when you want to check out!
