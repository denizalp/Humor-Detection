Butcher shop with a restaurant.  Sauce so good you could dip your shoes in it and eat them.  Great commentary from our server who offered excellent recommendations.  Locals place.  High end outdoor mall style.  Think Santana Row in San Jose.  Better than any restaurant on the strip.  Portobello fries.  Cauliflower.  Fried spinach.  Bone marrow.  Mind has been blown.  Can only type short sentences.  Disjointed thoughts.  Can't take my mind off this place.  Will be back.  Again.  Berry shortcake.  Ice cream home made.  Whipped cream homemade.  Excellent manhattan.  Funny place.  Wise guys here.  Love them.  Want more portobello fries.  Can I get some more portobello fries?  I deserve more.  I want more.  Why can't President Trump make portobello fries available 24 hours of the day on demand?   I thought he wanted to make America great again.  Portobello fries make America great again. You ordering them will make you great again.  Right now, if you've never had them, you're merely mediocre.  Like the SLS casino.  Mediocre.  Eat them fries.  Be Bellagio great.
