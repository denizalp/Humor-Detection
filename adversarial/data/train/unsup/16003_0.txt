Overpriced, underwhelming and, on the whole, disappointing.\n\nThe interior was promising; open, playful and modern.  The service was decent but there ends the compliments.  \n\nThe meal started with ceviche which I typically love.  The serving was spartan.  I am being kind.  It was nearly non-existent.  For $14, you get less than a spoonful of mediocre fish.  Next came a shrimp dish which was heavily dressed and utterly overwhelmed rather than complimented the dish.  The shrimp themselves were limp and had the same appearance and texture as frozen Walmart shrimp resuscitated with cold water.  Price, $22. Last was the fish tacos, again, normally a favorite that fell flat.  It wasn't as terrible as the previous two offerings but were in no way inspired or memorable.\n\nI don't mind paying more for small portions IF they are exceptionally well executed.  In fact welcome it.  This restaurant is the unfortunate confluence of terrible quality, small portions with inflated pricing.  Boo.  I don't do many one star ratings but I give this one enthusiastically.
