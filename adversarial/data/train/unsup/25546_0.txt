It was alright. I couldn't day that I was happy or disappointed with my experience. The first thing I noticed was the noise. It's pretty loud in there. We sat down and right away we were served water. We got House Sampler of the beer which was awesome!  But as soon as we got that, it took awhile for our waitress to come around and actually take our order and give us our check. The menu is nicely formatted with the calorie next to the meal. The regular prices for the meals are kinda expensive. Their lunch menu is strategically placed on the last page and the prices are better. I got the Ahi Tuna salad which was great! And beer to try there is the Huckleberry IPA. Amazing.
