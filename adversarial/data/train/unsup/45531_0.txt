This is definitely a great spot to start the night before heading out to a club. The service is amazing and it server, Anthony, really took care of our group even though half of our party of 18 didn't show up. They even got the birthday girl a complementary drink and shots for everyone. It's best to bring big groups and the specialty drinks really hit the spot.
