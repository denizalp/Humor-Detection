Quaint venue, but rule of thumb for any summer events: it feels like you're cooking from the inside out. There's no AC which leaves the air feeling very stiff and heavy and neither standing downstairs nor sitting upstairs makes a difference. Sound quality isn't too shabby, but I've experienced better. The heat in the venue made it almost unbearable to attend the event, but I sweat it out (pun intended) given what we paid for the show we were at. Probably will come back, but will be mindful of the season.
