Wanted to come here since I saw them on DDD years ago.\nCame here on a Sat about 4:30PM with friends.\nI should have stuck to my plan to get a pizza and an order of the fresh mozz.\nInstead I ordered the Arribiata with the added mozz.\nIt was good, but the two of us that ordered the Arrabiata with the added mozz were disappointed in the amount of mozz you get. Mine had no perceivable amount in it so I asked and was told that they forgot and took it back to add mozz or whatever. When it came back I did not see a difference. Was a little peeved but just ate it as it was. That aside, the Arrabiata was just OK.\nThe others enjoyed their selections.\nI really like the bread\/pizza dough wedges you get. Reminded me of garlic nann.\nService was OK. Would have liked the drinks filled more often.\nIf it was busy, the service would have been considered good. But they only had three tables with customers at them and two wait staff. \nWill I go back? Yes, just to try the pizza and mozz.\nI think I just made a bad selection and did not know what to expect.\nSo three stars for now until I return and they exonerate themselves.\nHoping for a 5 star visit next time.
