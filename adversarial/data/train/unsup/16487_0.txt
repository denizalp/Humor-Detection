This is not a gastro pub. The food all tastes as if it was previously frozen. The bread was not baked recently and the fries reminded me of my grade school cafeteria fries. They had a live band playing good songs but not very well done. They have a large selection of booze so if your going to drink and look for cougars that are well past their prime, this is the place for you.
