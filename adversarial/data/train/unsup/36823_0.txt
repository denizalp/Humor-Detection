After the Yelp Elite tasting event at Koi, and a late dinner at Burgr, Diane and I walked through the Miracle Mile Shops to get to our car in the parking lot on the other side.  While doing so, a waft of pleasant fragrances entered our nostrils.  \n\nWe turned toward the smell and looked into a shop of artfully displayed colorful bath and shower soap products; then, liking what we saw, we walked in to browse.  Here a wide array of glycerin soaps cut into rectangles caught our attention, and we wound up buying a nice-sized chunk of Japanese Cherry Blossom soap that smelled just like cherry blossoms, and even had a Cherry Blossom Tree appearing within the glycerin itself.  I can also report that in the shower the pleasant fragrance endured, and the long bar of soap slid easily over the skin.\n \nThis is a shop with friendly and helpful service, to which I will likely return to purchase and sample other wares.
