This deli is where I first discovered the famed black and white cookie. My life has really never been the same since, truth be known.\n\nLast year, when I went home for Christmas, my mom took me here with a large amount of gift certificates and encouraged me to select whatever I wanted. Thus, I have tried almost everything the deli has to offer, and it's all good. Seriously. From tuna salad to bagels to pastries, Las Vegas has a really great East Coast style deli and this is it.
