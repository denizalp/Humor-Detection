Leroy Fox is famous for Southern Fried Chicken so of course it was a dinner stop in Charlotte. \n\nThere are TVs on all the walls that give a sports bar vibe which I didn't mind since the SF vs KC World Series was on! \n\nUnfortunately most of the deep fried appetizers tasted like typical sports bar food although the fried pretzels with 3 dippings were pretty good. \n\nI wasn't sure how big the fried chicken pieces would be so i ordered a \"Northern\" which includes a leg, thigh and breast. What I got was a tiny wing and a small back. Hardly any meat. The chicken was ok but I was disappointed in the meal and the waitress said I must've got someone else's order. I guess I should've said something when I got the dish but couldn't tell if it was a back or breast until I started it. Plus another person in our party received the same non-Northern.\n\nThe crispiness of chicken was good but overall I wasn't impressed with the size of the pieces. Does that 2\" wing qualify as a \"piece\"?\n\nI liked the beer selection though as they had a few local brews and they had NoDa Jam Session pale ale which was yum!
