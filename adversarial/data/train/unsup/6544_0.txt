Best Friend Chinese is one of those forgettable Chinese food joint..... One of those that I went and ate and totally forgot I have been there? And doubt I would be going back again?\n\nWe ordered a few things to share... What did we order?? \n\nBraised Beef Noodle Soup\nWonton Noodle Soup\nand More Soup\n\nEverything were a little off.... but big portion and reasonably priced.\n\nHuge Menu.. a little overwhelming...\n\nWhy we ended up with all soup?!
