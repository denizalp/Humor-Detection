Very small restaurant and hard to get a decent reservation even for a weeknight. Ended up booking almost a week in advance and had to settle with a 5:00pm dinner. Our party arrived 15 minutes late but we called in to let the hostess know. She said it was fine but to keep in mind that seating was only a 2 hour limit. The whole experience was pretty good. Food was decent. Only thing was we felt rushed. We felt as if we couldn't order another glass of wine because our seating time would be up and we'd get kicked out. Closer to 7:00 the restaurant was packed with people waiting and it was uncomfortable sitting there with everyone staring, so we paid the bill and left.
