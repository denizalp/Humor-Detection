I thought this place was a-ok for a quick lunch\n\nGrilled Cheese - not really melted but okay ratio of bread to cheese ( maybe a bit more would have been better but then again, I always think that ).  \n\nBread was soft & had it been on the grill a bit longer, it wold have been nicely toasted.  The cheese was a nondescript white variety maybe like a Monterey Jack but it was tasty\n\nWhat really paired well w\/ it was the pepper relish & tomato I added.  The relish provided just the slightest eek of spice to make it more flavorful w\/out being at all spicy\n\nLots of different chips from which to choose - you're in.  You're out.  You're sandwiched.
