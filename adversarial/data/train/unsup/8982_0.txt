There is a \"but\" coming, however, first let me say the food was delicious and the ambiance was terrific, as usual. I've been here a few times now, as well as other locations, and the food is always spot-on.  BUT, tonight I came in to celebrate my birthday, and despite telling my sushi chef and waitress...nothing, nada, zilch.  I didn't need anything comped, but something to make my experience special would have been, well, special. Instead I left feeling unimportant. Oh well.
