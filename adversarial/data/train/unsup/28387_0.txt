I had a back light out in my Jeep, not sure if it was a break light or tail light.  I called ahead of time to see if they would replace the bulb for me and I was told \"yes\".  Immediately I headed to the store.  It was the store manager, Fernando, who \"helped\" me.  When I told him my dilemma, he acted pained that he would have to go outside to look at the back of my Jeep to determine which bulb was out but, he did.  After that, he looked up the bulb I needed and while I was purchasing same, I asked if they would install it for me and the look on his face said it all.  He had ABSOLUTLY NO interest in helping me out which I could accept except for the fact that I had just called and was told they would. Also note, the store WAS NOT BUSY, besides me there was only one other customer.  I really hate asking anyone to do anything for me and this is exactly why.  Interesting that when I called, an employee said no problem but when I get there, the Manager acted like I had just asked him to overhaul my engine.  Never again!
