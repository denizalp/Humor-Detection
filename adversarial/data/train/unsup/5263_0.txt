Worst bar ever. \n\nFirst of all, I felt like I had traveled back to the 80s for Season 1 of Sex & the City where Carrie sports her white girl, triangular afro. \n\nSecondly, there were only two other people in the place. It was completely dead otherwise. Not to mention that when we walked in, the waitress\/bartender - whatever she was, looked right us and completely ignored us. In fact, she kept making eye contact with me from the back of the bar, but instead of coming over to take our drink order, she just kept on slicing those damn limes. HELLO? \n\nFinally, she comes by and says something like \"Sorry, I couldn't see you well from where I was.\" OK, but you COULD see us, right? Lame excuse for her lack of service.  \n\nThen we ask if she has a cocktail menu. She does not. Nor can she make any recommendation whatsoever. Then we figure we'll play it safe and just order wine. She tells us they only have one brand and not to order it because it sucks. So finally, I ask her what the hell the 'specialty' is and she says that she can make martinis. Fine. Give us two Lychee martinis so we can get the hell out of there, pronto.\n\nWorst martinis ever. I'm pretty sure my friend and I both grew hair on our chests after taking the first sip, though when I woke up this morning, I didn't see any. It was like drinking liquid glue. Horrible! The only reason we finished our drinks is because they overcharged us at $13 a piece. \n\nTerrible service, terrible drinks and overall, not my kind of place. Go elsewhere - there are plenty of options in the old port.
