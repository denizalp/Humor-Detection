Since my first review months ago, this place has become our weekly go-to Indian buffet! This is seriously the best Indian that I've had in the Phoenix area. Like I said in my first review, their unlimited garlic naan is amazing and they have a wonderful, clean, nice atmosphere which is not always the case for Indian restaurants. The service is IMPECCABLE. The servers are all extremely attentive and super nice. Once, I even forgot my bag in the booth and they ran out to our car and gave it to me so I wouldn't forget. \n\nWe go here about once a week because it is also so affordable. $9 for lunch or $13 for dinner, and it's all you can eat! I normally get chicken tikka masala (my favorite) and a vegetable dish. Their lamb vindaloo is also very good and my boyfriend loves their tandoori chicken. We also normally end out our meal with mango lassi. This place can get busy & we've found that our favorite time to go is right when they open at 5 and everything is fresh! I'm in Hawai'i right now and can't wait to get back to Arizona to get my weekly dose of India Oven!
