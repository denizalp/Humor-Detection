Stay away or you will be sorry!! They will take your money and make you think you have a house that is already occupied by tenants who may or may not move out and you will loose your money. They make you pay an application fee for each and everyone home you are interested in and if it falls through you will loose your money. If you like giving away money then proceed with them.
