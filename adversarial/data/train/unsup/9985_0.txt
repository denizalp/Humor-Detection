I came back again, after seeing the reviews, wondering if maybe it was just an off day the first time. Immediately upon entry, I'm told to wait a minute as he runs to the back. Which was fine, but as soon as the owner comes out, the first thing he says is, \"Did you just make that mess!?\" There was a little bit of water on the floor from cleaning my bottle. Complete accident.. then he grabs my wallet off of the sink and my keys, which I had on top of my wallet so they wouldn't scratch the metal surface, and he goes, \"No no. Take this please,\" and hands it to me. He went and got tissues, and I literally thought the guy was gonna make me clean up the floor. It was for my legs, but I felt like even though he was trying to be nice, he still was rude twice before that. Then he opens the lid sanitizer and looks at me and goes, \"You put the lids in the wrong way, they aren't supposed to be like that.\" He then decides to start treating me nicely and complimenting me when his family friends walk in. For so many reviews being positive, I'm wondering why both of my experiences were so bad. I almost walked out the second time too. I should've! You don't make the customer feel guilty for things that aren't a problem to begin with and are accidents. Then I caught him checking out my ass twice. Anything else? lol. Don't come in if you're a single lady cuz you'll get treated poorly then objectified. Your water ain't worth it. No thanks!\n\nResponse to your response: I understand that. However, what wasn't acknowledged in your response was the way I was treated. I feel the way that every situation was handled was unprofessional and degrading.
