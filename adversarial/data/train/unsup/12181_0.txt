I won't bore you with details of why it's a one star - other than - our car was broken into and the security staff blamed us - FOR PARKING THERE!\n\nMy time is more valuable than to trash them in this forum.  It's a -5 stars from us.  \n\nVisit at your own risk.\n\nPS - Management is aware of the security staff screw up.  They apologized but in no way offered to cover any damages.  An apology does not make up for \"being raped after being raped\" - a direct quote from the hotel VP.
