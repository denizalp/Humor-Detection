When in Vegas expect to spend $$$. However, this deal is honestly WORTH IT. Unlimited access to 5 buffets for 24 hrs for 49$ for total rewards members (which is free to sign up at any TR stand). I am all about cleanliness before quality of food. Here is how I would personally rate the buffets. \n\n1. RIO. don't waste your time elsewhere. Clean and quality of food is AMAZING. They serve food that the other buffets dont and the overall presentation of everything is worth the drive over. Self service of drinks which I love. Shout out to my waiter: LUIS was on Point and very welcoming. Definitely made our dining experience worth while. I hope the manager reads my yelp comment.\n\n2. Harrahs. Definitely cleaner than the rest . The chefs are very pleasant which made dinning very easy. They work so hard to maintain quality of food ON TOP OF cleaning the serving station that the other buffets lack. Self service of drinks.  Shout out to my waiter : ADRIAN. You're awesome and you need a raise for being literally the most hardest working waiter at Harrahs. Everyone else pretty much sucked. \n\n..... the other buffets I honestly don't care about after eating at Harrahs and Rio. \n\nPlanet Hollywood is also self service of drinks. However I did not find it very clean. Had to inspect 100 cups before using it. However the waitresses were on point. \n\nParis. I would recommend eating here once ...just for the venue. Very beautiful and the staff is dressed. Not self service of drinks. Servers were also on point. \n\nFlamingo. Honestly wouldn't go back. Not self service of drinks. Didn't find it very clean from the Cups to the maintenance of the floors and service counters. My waitress sucked so it also added to my negative comment here. However this venue does overlook the Habitat.
