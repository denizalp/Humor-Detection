So - I'm from Atlanta, the Home of Waffle House. It's tradition to eat here late at night after a hangover or just to hang out (back in high school). It's normal to expect long waits, foggy cups, dirty grills, Ebonics, and Auntie calling you baby. Ya know, the good ole southern hospitality.\n\nThe crew tonight really set the bar for my Waffle House experience especially at the University location. Usually, I'd prefer to eat at the location near the airport because it's cleaner and well kept. However, this night crew (Wednesday around 10:46p). They were FAST (delivered my food within 5min.), hospitable, the food was flavorful, the cups were clean - I could actually see through the cups. \n\nI'd usually order hot water to let my utensils soak one more time and I probably could've opted out - okay maybe a little to far there. My water was refilled swiftly. I'm just impressed with my experience overall! \n\nThe Day crew is slow, unorganized, lazy, and the list of all possible negatives goes on. The only thing the Day crew has going for itself is the music selection. I'm sure the next time I write a review, the feedback will be different. For now, I want to acknowledge I did not have the traditional Waffle House experience I'm accustomed to. \n\nBreakfast for Dinner has been one prefect ending to a wonderful evening! I will dream of Zzzzzs in peace.
