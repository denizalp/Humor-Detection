Cashier\/Hostess not too familiar with their menu offering. Not a good first impression nearly from the get go. Like you have an entire menu section dedicated to just chicken wings with different sauces, how can you not know?\n\nAnyway, lack of menu knowledge aside, their chicken wings are pretty bomb. I went with original and supreme. The original basically is just fried chicken wings in their house seasoning, served without any sauce.  The Supreme is fried chicken wings in their spicy Supreme sauce (has some kick that builds up over time, not one that will bring you to your knees right off the bat. Not unless you are French.)\n\nI ordered these to go and they included some diced marinated radish and a side of coleslaw (Family size order).  This snack was good and my friends and I killed it in no time.  I would come back in the future to check out the rest of the menu, especially their pizzas, or after spending time next door at their Karaoke lounge.  I think with the traditional side dishes that are typically served with your food, it would be a better value.\n\nWhile waiting for my order, I had ample time to check out the decor. The atmosphere is trendy, with street art-style decor on black walls, as if you were at some underground club in LA.  Tables were not placed too close together, which is nice.  The place was maybe 20% full at about 7:30pm on a weekday, when the parking lot outside is packed and finding an open spot to park was a minor test in patience.\n\n3 stars for now.  Will update again after I come back.
