We are just passing through on a trip from our home in Colorado to Maine. To be honest stopping for Mexican in Ohio didn't seem like a great idea but it was close to the hotel after a long day on the road. \nWhat a pleasant surprise!  \nEverything we ordered was perfectly prepared and delicious.  I would have to rate the food here better than most of what we get in Colorado. \nThe service was also excellent. If you are in the area and like Mexican food you will not go wrong eating here.
