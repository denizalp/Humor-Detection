Our Garmin lead us through a very sketchy neighborhood to get here.  We were just about to turn back when we noticed the area got a bit more hipster.  Figuring that I could beat the plaid & mustache out of anyone who tried to do anything ironic to my car, we decided to go in.\n\nSo glad we did!  This was the best Thai food I've ever had.  The seafood was tender, the peanut chicken curry was well balanced and the summer rolls were tender and delicious.\n\nA word of caution.  Order a little less spicy than you think you should.  They are judging heat by Thai standards, not by my pallid tongue.
