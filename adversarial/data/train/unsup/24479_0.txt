Parking here forget about it , It is too tough.\nThis is for a too to order I had. I came in and placed my order witht the guy working at the front desk counter.\nHe asked me first what I wanted, well....I need a menu.\nAnyway, I ordered one of the new dishes, the Prawns with noodles salad and the 2nd item was the Budda Feast Vegetabeles. Stir fried.\nIt was really a pretty quick wait only about 10 to 12 min so that was great.\nThe food was really good. I do not know if I would order the Prawn dish again ,a bit on the greasy side though very tasty. It was actually better when I heated it up again the next day.   Plus it was a bit on the high priced side $15.00 just for that item.\nThe Budda Vegs were really good as always.
