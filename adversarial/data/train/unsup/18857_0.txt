Always wanted to try Earl of Sandwich.  Found this branch in the food court at Caesars Palace.  Ordered a Chipotle Chicken sandwich.  Tasted mediocre at best.\n\nNext time I will go to Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood.  The reviews there are outstanding overall.  \n\nTo sum it up.  The sandwich was okay.  For the expensive price, the sandwich did not make the grade.  Money is best spent elsewhere.  Sorry.
