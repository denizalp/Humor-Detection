The lovely Ms. Brooks Brothers had a groupon for the price fixe menu. Concurring with Isaac E. a great meal for a great price. The steak was wonderful. The bread starter was some of the best around. Great service. Dark and intimate dining. And in the Windsor Arms enviro. What more can you ask for? Oh, there was almost a fire. Well there WAS a fire but not as big a fire as it could have been. Linen napkin tossed too closely to table candle by vacating patron = oh fuck. Fire. Luckily the eagle eyed people at the table next to the fire quickly spotted it and put it out. Hope their meals were comp'd. Because if we all had to vacate, I'm not coming back to settle up. That's for sure.
