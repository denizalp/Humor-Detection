Agree with all other posts so I'll just add this: every time I've been, the servers ask me if I'd like my bagel toasted. Definitely do not have yours toasted! (if you ask them this they will tell you as well if you ask) The bagels are so lovely and fresh as others have described, that it would be a waste to toast. If you are bringing home and freezing, that's another story.\n\nI also ordered the whitefish salad on a poppy bagel. I can't really compare it in terms of texture to other places as it was my first time having whitefish salad however I will say the flavour was delightful - smoky and salty but not too much more. \n\nAnd yes, parking is insanity there.
