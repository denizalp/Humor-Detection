One word: Ahhhhmazing! From the moment I walked in until I left the service was excellent. I came in for the Chill package (1 hour massage & 1 hour facial). I enjoyed it so much and didn't want it to end! The package included a glass of champagne which was a nice touch before the massage began and slippers to wear. The atmosphere is so calm and serene which sets the mood. The spa packages are a little pricey but you pay for what you get and it's absolutely worth it. It is definitely an upscale boutique.\n\nThe 60 minute massage was perfect and the facial was exactly what I was hoping for. She cleaned out my pores and when I left my skin was glowing! A perfect place to get someone a gift card if you're unsure what to get your significant other, mother, sister, best friend, etc. They offer a lot of services and I will definitely be returning! I want to try the eye lash tint next time I go for $25. \n\nSo happy that I came here and it is definitely 5 stars!
