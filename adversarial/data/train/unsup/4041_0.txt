NO STROLLERS ALLOWED!!! What?! Is that not the best sign ever?! No kiddies running around this casino, folks. \n\nI've stayed in practically every hotel on the strip and I must say, The Wynn and its staff impressed me. From the smooth check-in, to the smiles that greeted me all around the casino, this place exudes class. \n\nI'm not a gambler, am allergic to cigarette smoke, don't drink  and really only visit Sin City for work purposes. I'm not a happy person when I have to visit this place. However, staying at the Wynn I had plenty to do and experience outside of the normal Vegas activities.\n\nThe pool area is fantastic. Clean and the DJ is jamming all day. Snacks and food is available poolside. \n\nMy room had a gorgeous view of the golf course with floor to ceiling windows. Everything is automated in the room. Front the drapes to lighting. The bathroom is a woman's dream. Spacious and perfect lighting to put on my make up. And I watched tv while getting ready. \n\nThe gym has a ton of machines. I woke up every morning around 6 am to work out and never waited for a cardio machine or the weights. But it could be the $15 usage fee that no one wants to pay. Frees up machines quickly. \n\nI didn't visit the buffets or restaurants as my company had everything catered while I was there. However, my compliments to the chef. Making edible food in mass quantities is not an easy feat. The best dessert ever? The Cupcake Experience. Oh my goodness! Every cupcake combo imaginable. I was in a sugar coma. \n\nAll this and it's located across the street from the Fashion Show mall. If you need a last minute outfit or shoes, you're covered. \n\nThe Wynn is my new go to hotel in Vegas.
