Came here to avoid having to cook for a night... best idea ever! I ordered the 12in Big \"EZ\", which had steak, bacon and chiptole sauce.  You get to choose from a variety of ingredients to include in your sandwich.  I ended up getting so much in it that the sandwich couldn't even close! The sandwich was a bit pricey $16 or so I believe, but it tasted great so no complaints there. I'd say a 12in would be able to feed 2 ppl who eat less, but if you're coming here alone I'd suggest getting the 8in.
