Oh Tiabi. \n\n\"To Inspire and Be Inspired.\"  My visit yesterday was definitely inspirational.\n\nI came out here last month for the Yelp Coffee Cruise event, and have been trying to make it back since.  Yesterday, I was in the area for a birthday party a little early, so I popped in for coffee and a waffle.  \n\nTiabi is an adorable little coffee shop, hidden away in the strip mall near Target on Flamingo and Maryland Parkway.  Before the Coffee Cruise, I had no idea it existed, even though I frequent that area all the time. \n\nYesterday, when I stopped in,  I took a look at their drink and waffle menu, and decided on the Twilight Lavender Latte, and the Golden Waffle. \n\nService was super friendly.  The cashier was polite, and the girl who made my waffle had an infectious smile.  Tiffany, the owner, remembered me from the Cruise, and said hello after I had been seated.  We chatted for a minute, and then my waffle was ready.\n\nSo...the coffee.  \nLight.  Flavorful.  Aromatic.   Delicious.  I may have done myself a disservice in ordering the Twilight Lavender Latte on my first time back, because I may not ever want to order another drink as long as this is available.  It is SO good...I shared a sip with a friend when I arrived at the birthday party, and her whole face lit up, it is THAT delicious.  Home Run, Tiabi.  Home Run. \n\nThe waffle.  Oh, the waffle. \nThe Golden Waffle is simple.  Its a light, crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, golden, perfect waffle.  Its dusted with powdered sugar, and served with butter on the side.  There was syrup on the table, but I didn't need any, and I normally drown my waffles in syrup.  \n\nSweet.  Delicate.  Awesome.  \n\nTiabi, I'm so glad I had the time to pop by yesterday.  You've excelled at making me feel welcome, and the quality of your offerings is truly inspiring.
