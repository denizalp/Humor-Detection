I haven't have my own hotel room in... omg, I don't even remember when was the last time I have my own room?!\n\nSo I brought my lucky charm, to deter eeeviillll, and made sure I stayed up late with my coworkers so all I do when I head back to the room, is to sleep.\n\nThe room was nice and pretty good size.  I found the dead celebrity portraits a little disturbing.  There's a $10 resort fee, and they charge you to go to the exercise room.  What the _____?  Well, but then we got the $15 credit in drink, I guess that kind of offset it.\n\nThe 2:30am explosion next door at the Tropicana woke me up and I thought it was one of those 911 event and I was debating whether or not I should pack my stuff and bounce?!  But then I realized that the building would be crumbling by now if that's the case.\n\nAnyhow, I kept having nightmare afterward.  Like ghostly nightmare.  That made me miss the bf and the dogs a WHOLE LOT MORE.  Nope, i do not want to have my own room next time, thank you.
