After looking at David's Bridal and falling in love with a dress, we soon found out it was 3x out of my price range. So broken hearted I wandered across the way to Brilliant Bridal.\nI didn't expect much from such a small store but I was amazed with my service. My consultant was absolutely amazing and was even able to cheer me up after my recent heart break, and found me the dress of my dreams for only $99! \nI would highly recommend Brilliant Bridal to anyone looking for their dream dress.
