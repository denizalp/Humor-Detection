First visit tonight and probably last. Ordered tacos, quesadilla and chips with salsa. All looked like it was from the kids menu. Waited 30 minutes, which is fine since they just opened their doors, but the drive through wasn't working and they were still training their staff. \nSalsa bar would have been great if they had the supplies to take it with you, and if it was any good. Guacamole was watery with no flavor. Salsa tasted like straight lemon juice. I had my husband buy a bag of chips on the way home to eat with the bland pico. \nFilibertos is way better
