I am surprised by all of the 5 star reviews for this place.\n\nI grew up in San Diego, the birthplace of Rubios.  The original restaurant was near my father's office and I remember my first opportunity to enjoy their fresh fish tacos - which I will never forget.  \n\nI was also excited to learn that there was a Rubios near my office and of course made a trip to enjoy this childhood treat.\n\nThis location is the polar opposite of my original experience.  \n\nThe staff is not friendly or helpful\n\nThe restaurant is dirty and smells strange.\n\nAnd the food is sub-par - I received pieces of hard, inedible avocado and was told that they were \"having problems with their avocados\".  They did not offer to refund my order or provide a replacement.\n\nI will not return.
