Dr. Gawley and his entire staff are the elite in the industry.  From the moment I made my consultation appointment over the phone, I felt relaxed and assured I was making the right decision.  Dr. Gawley comes highly recommend from professional and personal friends of mine.  My first time in the office I was greeted with warm and smiling faces, everyone I came in contact with or even in passing smiled, looked me in the eyes and said \"hello\". To me this speaks volumes in the surgical industry!  The day of my procedure, I was made to feel at home; my nurse Misty made my day by making me smile, comfortable, and at ease.  My Anesthesiologist was kind and talked to me about every step that was going to take place and made sure I understood.  She took extra time to answer all of my questions in great detail, never making me feel rushed.  The evening after my procedure Dr. Gawley called me personally! That again speaks volumes! I received beautiful flowers from Dr. Gawley and his staff, what a kind gesture! Monday following my procedure, Misty called to see how I was doing and wanted to check my pain levels.  I couldn't be happier with my choice of doctor, I look amazing and Dr. Gawley has given me the self confidence I had only been dreaming of! There are a ton of plastic surgeons out there but, you would be short changing yourself if you don't visit Dr. Gawley before making your final decision.
