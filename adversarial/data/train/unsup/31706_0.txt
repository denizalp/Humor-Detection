I came here yesterday for my first time after wanting to try it out for months. The decor is too die for, so adorable! \n\nWe got seated right away, I would of preferred the patio, but since it was Valentines Day I was happy we got seated at all without a wait. Our cute and bubbly comes in to greet us and we immediately ask to order the guacamole and she apologizes and says they are out and she should mention they're also out of flour tortillas?! Um, what? Mexican restaurant that doesn't have guac... you would think that would be simple to remake. But, of course maybe they didn't think they'd as busy this weekend being Valentines day and all. \n\nThe great thing is they have happy hour all day on Sundays and the drinks were amazing and delicious and pretty and anything else you can think of. The food on the other hand was nothing spectacular. I will definitely be back to give them another try when they might be more prepared and not so busy. The place was too cute and I've heard too many great things to not try them out again.
