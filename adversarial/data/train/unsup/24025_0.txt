A couple friends reccommended The Sparklings, they said they come here very often. Since we heard great things, we decided to come to The Sparklings for an early Sunday dinner. We arrived around 5:30pm, and the restaurant was very quiet. We were the only people seated, minus someone in the bar area. However, that quickly changed as more and more people filled the restaurant creating a nice ambiance. The chandelier in the middle creates such a nice and romantic experience. They have very large tables inside and outside, perfect for showers and events! The service was great, our waiter checked on our table every so often and made sure we were all taken care of. \n\nThe dishes were fantastic! We tried two different types of gnocchi as an appetizer, red meat gnocchi and brown butter gnocchi. I personally liked the brown butter one because the gnocchi was crispier, but the red meat sauce added such a great flavor to the gnocchi. I would recommend getting both to try, as they are not large dishes. For my entree, I got Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, simple, but SO delicious. I typically eat slow, but I think I was the first one done! My dish also came with a side of buttered bread.\n\nI am so happy The Sparklings was recommended to me, and I cannot wait to try it again!
