It speaks volumes that months after my trip Stateside where I ate at more than 15 Michelin stars worth of restaurants, the two meals that linger are burritos in the Mission district in SF... and every damn thing I ate at S&D Deli. \n\nThis review then is nothing about what you can buy at the deli to bring home but ALL about the food you can eat there. Don't expect balance or elegance, anything refined or with wine, it's hearty, nourishing, uplifting simple fare here. The pierogies were good, the kielbasa so tasty... those noodles. I can't even. Butter. Just butter. \n\nIt's 7 months on that I'm finally getting down to finishing this review when I was there in April, but just reminiscing is making my mouth water.
