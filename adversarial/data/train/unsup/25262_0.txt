I was happy to discover that a second location (Ann st) opened further north closer to my home. The office isn't as fancy as the original location but just as clean with a small corner for kids to play in the waiting room. Very nice staff. I took my 4 yr old twin girls for a dental checkup. The dental assistants were great with them. One of my twins cried the entire time and refused to have her teeth cleaned but the dental assistant was so patient and calm the entire time. I really appreciated that. We saw Dr Lamb today and he was very nice and patient as well. Highly recommend this practice!
