Yesterday I took a day off to take my cousin for his assessment at the TDSB.  After a whole morning of waiting like still live statues, my aunt and I abandoned our positions and I took her to Chinatown.  Being from Hong Kong, they enjoy the usual \"Afternoon Tea\" favourites such as Lemon Tea, Hong Kong Style Tea, etcetera.  My aunt's favourite happens to be Lemon Tea.  \n\nThere aren't many Hong Kong Style cafes in the Chinatown area, but my sister somehow discovered the Hong Kong Bistro Cafe, and so we ended up here on a Tuesday afternoon around 2:30PM.\n\nWe had just finished eating lunch, so we didn't order any of the food, but they do have many \"afternoon tea\" specials starting at $3.75 for \"French\" toast that comes with a hot beverage.  Cold beverages are available for an added cost (usually about $0.50 10 $0.75).  \n\nThe Hong Kong style tea was nothing to Yelp about - pretty standard.  My aunt lamented that her Lemon Tea wasn't very good as there was a rancid acidity to it, which she attributes to not-so-fresh lemons.  \n\nThe bill came to $3.15.  We were in an air-conditioned place on a hot summer's day.  We have no complaints.\n\nOf the food that I did see being brought to other tables, the food came in heaping portions.  Will be back sometime to try the food!
