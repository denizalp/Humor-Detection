We came here after the Holidays and a few times since then.  \n\nNormally, it's a busy day of shopping followed by HH and we were very impressed by both the food and the interesting drink offerings. The food is interesting as well as outstanding.  The wait staff seems to kick it into high gear when it starts to get crowded.   A big WOW!\n\nI would highly recommend Tommy Bahama's to anyone!\n\nEnjoy!
