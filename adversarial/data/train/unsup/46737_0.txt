Horrendous administration, constantly putting hand-holding policies into effect to make this school seem more and more like a middle school. Absolutely no communication from administration. A gun was brought onto campus in 2016 and they sent a letter out to a few parents. Yet when they have an exterminator, they spam you with letter. No priorities. Dirty campus. Shitty teachers. Glad I'm gone
