As far as I've been concerned, acai bowls have been on the rage in California, but I haven't heard a peep about it here in Vegas. This place was apparently a food truck turned solid business of some sort, but it was my first time trying it and I can say it's pretty legit.\n\nWhile on the pricey side, they've got a vast selection of bowls to choose from, along with other smoothies and pressed juices. \nThe two times I've been here, I've had the \"popeye\" and some other one with raspberry and chocolate. Both were awesome, but I have an addiction to acai anyway so I guess they could of mixed it with shit and I'd still think it tastes good. \n\nThe bonus is you can get them in these gigantic freak bowls that are enough for an elephant to eat (MURIKA) so you can feed your addiction throughout the day. Like a responsible crackhead. Got the munchies? Pull out your acai bowl! About to bomb your exam? Pull out your acai bowl! Want to choke your boss\/professor? Pull out your acai bowl! Can't sleep? Pull ou... \n\nEverything is better with acai, put it in your life now. Stay in school, keep off drugs, eat your vegetables(and acai).
