Why did Philadelphia sandwich company move? I went into this big b's hangover hammered on  a sat night, noticing the joint had changed ownership (all tjhe wall dollars are gone)....decided I was already here and didn't want to walk to the old\/new Philadelphia sandwich company (which is actually a 5 minute drunk walk around the corner) so I tried the food, and it was awful...I shoulda gone with my gut and walked over to phillys, where the food and music is awesome & the crowd is always entertaining.
