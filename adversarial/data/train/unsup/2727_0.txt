The coffee is excellent, and so are the panini and croissants. 5 stars for the coffee in my book. \n\nLots of treehuggers, would-be world improvers, and the occasional stressed breasteeding middle-age mom. This is what happens to wannabe hipsters when they buy an overpriced house in Roncy only to realize the house is crappy and they can't afford to renovate anything because now they are house poor. It shows in their mood. \n\nActually, quite amusing to watch.
