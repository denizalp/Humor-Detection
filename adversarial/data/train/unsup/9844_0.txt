Well... Both myself and my friend are massage therapists..We love to try different places for reflexolgy.\nMy friend had a certificate she purchased on groupon.  Eric acted like he didn't know what it was at first.    After going over the prices with him.  We decided on 90 min. for $50.00.  Even though her groupon was for a $58.00 service. They agreed that she would owe no more for her service.   My friends therapist was Eric.  She liked her service.  Mine however was an older man that smelled bad of BO.  He did not seem to know any real massage moves.  Mostly beat the crap out of me.  In wich 2 days later I can hardley walk.  The reflex part of the massage was ok.  But worked on my left foot twice.  Rt foot only once.???  \nVery questionable things going on.  Girls walking around in only a towell.  Men also only in a towel.  Half exposing themself.  Walking around.  On our way out. passed a few naked men.  with towells over them.  VERY QUESTIONALE things going on. \n Eric pressed me to leave a good tip.  Then forgot that my friend had given him a groupon coupon.  Said he never heard of groupon.  Didn't know what it was.  Tried to shake her down for more money after she gave him a $20.00 tip.  Drama insued.  Followed us out side still trying to get more money out of us.  \nEric's licence number is not on his bussiness card.  Also no Massage license was displayed.  Should be shut down!!  \nVery Questionable place.  Do not recomend!!!
