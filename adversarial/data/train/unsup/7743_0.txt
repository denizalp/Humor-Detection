Maybe it was an \"off\" night, but I just went here with my family and the experience leaves me wondering if I'll ever go back.  The prices are rather steep for what you get, most toppings cost extra and the food really isn't all that great.  \n\nI didn't have a single \"ring\" in any of my onion rings, only small, overcooked pieces (looked nothing like the pictures others have posted).  The staff seemed bothered to help anyone and simply rushed people through the line, even though it wasn't particularly busy.  \n\nThe hotdogs were decent, but certainly nothing special.  I had a jumbo beef chili cheese dog and a pseudo-Chicago dog (everything but the sport peppers and poppy seed bun, because they don't offer them) myself.  I also tried the white and polish sausages that other family members were eating.  Truth be told, the sausages were the best of the bunch.  \n\nThe chili was a generic beef-only sauce and the liquid cheese was very plain.  The french fries arrived dry and unsalted, but not particularly crispy.  They tasted \"ok\" once they were doctored up, but these aren't the type of fries you \"crave\" later.  The shakes are very expensive for the small size you get and the chocolate shake tasted just like powdered chocolate milk, which I found disappointing.  The Loganberry shake, however, was very good.  \n\nUnfortunately, for what you end up paying for a pair of hot dogs and a soda, I can go to much nicer eateries and have a higher quality meal that actually tastes great.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, there are so many hot dog joints popping up all over the valley that it's quite easy to find somewhere better than Ted's.  The only thing they really have going for them is a recognizable name and a great location in the busy area of Tempe.  \n\nUnless you have no other choice, I recommend you save your money and get your hot dog fix somewhere else.
