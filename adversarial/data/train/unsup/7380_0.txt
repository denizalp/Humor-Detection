Went this past Friday night, was WAY packed with couples. A few single guys and a couple single women. The staff kept the crowd under control, as in making sure the couple's area remained couples only and enforced the naked room policy. The only complaint I really had was the guy dj'ing was pretty terrible. He frequently stopped popular songs midway and played tejano style music full length. I went a few years ago and it was dead, but tried it again and was glad I went back.
