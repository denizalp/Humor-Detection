Yep, this definitely scores a 5 stars on the \"AIRPORT FOOD SCALE\".  My review is solely based on eating the baked potato with pork BBQ on top.  The potato was big, hot and tasty ... they put lots of the good toppings on potato but the pork BBQ (also known as pulled pork) made the dish -- it was juicy and tender but most importantly, the pork is clean.  When I say clean, its not swimming in sauce but is just the good old pork meat done nicely.  I did pour the spicy BBQ sauce all over the potato which made it extra tasty but I greatly appreciate I get to choose that, not have it forced on me.  In short, I look forward to being at PHX again to eat this dish.
