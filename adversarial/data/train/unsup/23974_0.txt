Went here for the free show on Thursday night. It's a really nice venue. I had the pork sliders for dinner, they were just ok, nice fresh buns but the pork was lacking a little in the flavor department. Fair price of $8 for 3.\n\nThe music shows were a lot of fun. Rhyme N Rhythm was fun, got you dancing, Coco plays a mean bass guitar, and Moksha was really great. They played at least 2 1\/2 hours, great jam.\nMy legs are sore this morning from dancing all night. I really liked that the sound levels didn't blast you out of the building.Drinks were $12 for vodka\/cran. \n\nOverall a great night out....nothing like free entertainment in Vegas!
