My family recently moved across town. A good friend recommended Miranda Delivery Service. They arrived right on time. There were 4 men working our move. They were courteous and went right to work. They were very quick and handled all my furniture with care. After arriving at my new house we briefly went over where each room was and they placed (and set up) all my furniture and boxes appropriately. Everything arrived in perfect condition including my full length mirror. After the trucks were unloaded we walked the house and rearranged where some furniture was. They didn't leave until everything was where I wanted.
