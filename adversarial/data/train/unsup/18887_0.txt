Probably not itching to book at the Mirage again. \n\nThe main issue I had was the room smelled when I checked-in. The source of the smell was from the restroom- it smelled like dirty gym socks that had been placed in a juicer. I called the front desk to get this issue addressed- the phone operator seemed a bit unapologetic about this nuisance. After saying she would have someone look into the issue, an hour had passed and no one had come to the room. I called the front desk again and a different rep had an entirely different tone than the first employee- she apologized for the inconvenience and was able to waive our resort fees. Although the defogging (basically making the room smell good again) meant we had to stay out of the room for two hours, it was worth it (then again, to distract time, we ended up gambling = losing).\n\nThe response time of the TV was painfully slow. Channel surfing was at a crawl. The only other inconvenience of the weekend was the tram connecting Mirage to Treasure Island was down for a brief period and it was when we were needing it on our walk home from a long night out.\n\nA plus of the hotel is that I got a room overlooking the pool and the dolphin exhibit. those dolphins are so smart!
