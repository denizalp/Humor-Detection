Affordable prices and a top quality, motley selection of Mexican ice cream.  You came here for the ice cream, but there's actually something even better: the custom aguas frescas (think horchata) are unholy.  They have an array of homemade aguas frescas with unique flavors such as mamey.  Be sure to give those a shot while you're there.
