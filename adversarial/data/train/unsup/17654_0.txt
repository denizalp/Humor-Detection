Where's the six star?\n\nThis place is good as it can get, I've been here three times and all three times I'm met by the effervescent Brooke, who not only has a million dollar personality, she has exceptional taste in clothing. Second Story Liquor Bar, is that which reminds me of a hidden gem, the dark staircase may have there lawyers chagrin in lawsuit fear, but, for me it reminds me of going to a forbidden nightspot, mystery is often the best company and yes, the chase is better then the kill.\n\nI love sitting at the bar, and yes these are real mixologists, there not bartenders, bartenders there most difficult drink is a rum and coke, with a lime. These mixologists make the best whistle pig I've ever tasted. can't wait, I'm making myself thirsty. \n\nThere menu is as eclectic as the floor staff. I've had the shrimp taco's which were exceptional, and the burger, which surpasses In & Out Burger, and just about any other burger I have ever had. Then there are the rabbit tamales, OMG, ok double OMG they are so good. This will become or is becoming my favorite spot.
