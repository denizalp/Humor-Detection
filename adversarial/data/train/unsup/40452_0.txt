This is sort of an in between review... as there is no 2 1\/2 stars..\nThere were 5 people in our party. Three loves their meals and two hated them.\n Apparently the chicken parmesan is the bomb. Everyone loved it, and the portion was huge. Seriously it's the thing to get if you are starving or just want to heat up leftovers the next night.\n The breadsticks were fine, the water was great, the service was great. The waitress was very honest as far as prices go and all.\n The decor makeover was very impressive, it beautiful in there now and the seating is more comfortable.\n However the fancier dishes seemed to be a no no.\nAs in they can heat things up here but not... \"cook\". Artichoke pasta was and I quote \" Disgusting like wallpaper\". I ordered veal marsala and got chicken ,I didn't make a big deal out of it immediately, but then the sauce was disgusting. Cheap sugery nasty goop. By then I would have held everyone up to have them fix my order as I did have to say something once I noticed the sauce, but I just said forget it. The waitress did offer to fix the problem.   I just ended up eating some of the chicken parm from a kind relatives plate..\n The atmosphere is very nice, esp if you were going on a date etc. The service good, the food..russian roulette.
