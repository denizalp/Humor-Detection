This event was super chill and awesome!\n\nThis is actually not my first time here, so I already knew this would be great.\n\nThe snacks kept rolling and the beers were flowing. Beer-battered cheese curds were absolutely addictive! I had a little box with in my hands and all of a sudden I find myself without any more cheese curds, they literally melted in my mouth and so smoothly, that \n\nThere was also live music, and the band played some of my jams, so I was super excited. \n\nThank you to the band for being awesome. Thank you to all the staff at Bandit Brewery for taking care of us tonight. Thank you for Evelyn and Chantel for setting this one up!
