They sent me the wrong Pads for my evaporative cooler and expect me to pay to ship them back to them.  They don't sell the parts that they had online and that I ordered but they never said anything to me before shipping out the parts.  I've emailed them twice and they won't email me back.  Terrible customer service!!!  I will ;never buy from them again!
