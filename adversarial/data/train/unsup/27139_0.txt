Seems like a nice place. Food was good, not great. Had ala cartel Sushi. Wasabi roll was very good. Yellowtail tuna very good. \nSushi rice was too chewy. The regular tuna maki literally had no discernible taste! It could have been tofu. \nI will say the ginger was tremendous! \nI'd go again......I guess.
