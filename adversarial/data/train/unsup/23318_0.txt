Got a POS car?  Is it out of warranty and you are thinking of scrapping it for parts? Well, stop whatcher doin' cuz Ima 'bout to ruin... your, um... plans.\n\nTake it to TMK Auto Repairs. The T stands for Tim (the owner), the M and the K? I don't really know what they stand for. It doesn't matter.  Tim is the only thing you need to know.  I render him a benevolent auto repair god in a world of corrupt car crooks.  His establishment is considered to be the Promised Land for anyone with the exacerbation of constant car troubles.  Anyway, enough of the overdramatics.\n\nTim took a look at my 2000 GMC Jimmy and was so honest, it was like a slap in the face.  I've never been to a place where the owner helps me, then he proceeds to tell me he can fix my problem with a $4.99 part.  After he fixed it, he drove it around his 10 mile circuit to make sure everything was working properly.  He didn't try to up sell me into tune-ups or checks or better parts.  He simply fixed the problem.  Then, when I asked how much he charged for labor, he said \"I'm not going to charge you labor.  It only took me 5 minutes to fix\"...\n\nNeedless to say, I tipped him very well for his honesty and awesome work.  I just wish there were more saints like Tim.  I'm pretty sure he's going to Heaven to hang with Jesus.
