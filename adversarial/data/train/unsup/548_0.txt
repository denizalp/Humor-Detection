If you are looking for place to just crash in Vegas for a good price, Harrah's is the place. I also think the gambling atmosphere is more casual and not so intense here. The rooms are nice but I won't lie the low water pressure is hell on my hair but I think most of the places are like that since Las Vegas are conservative about water usage. I am also not sure why they don't have refrigerators anymore or coffee pots. However, there are restaurants and Starbucks right downstairs and sign up for the Total Rewards Card so that you can get points. Who really sleeps in Vegas anyway so it is a good price for somewhere you won't be very much.
