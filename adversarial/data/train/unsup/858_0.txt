The optician here was not friendly and spent a lot of time trying to \"upsell\" me on both the exam and the products.  The staff seemed too busy to greet me, though I was the only customer in the store and they failed to call me back as scheduled.  \n\nI ultimately went to a different eye doctor who said my diagnosis was incorrect and most likely was given because they would make more money off of the products they were selling me. \n\nAvoid this place if at all possible.\n\nI am not an ex-employee.  I am, however, an ex-customer.  I'm sorry you (below) disagree with my review, but that was my experience.  I provide reviews for service I like and service I don't, that's just the impression your store gave me.
