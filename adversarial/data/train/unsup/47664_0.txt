Birthday dinner with my mom at the Roy's was delightful. We enjoyed food, the outdoor seatings, and the beautiful surroundings. \n\n- Crispy Karage Calamari -  This was definitely one of the best calamari I had! It was indeed crispy, and more flavorful with the thai basil dipping sauce, yum!\n\n-Misoyaki Butterfish - This white fish was light and somewhat creamy, so soft that could just melt into your mouth.\n\n-Brown Butter seared Salmon - A bit towards to the sweet side if you are not expecting, the fish was just a little bit undercooked for my mom, but it was a good combination with warm potato salad!\n\n-Pineapple cake\/pie (?) - if you like sweet, definitely worth the wait to have this warm dessert. \n\nYay for a piece of birthday chocolate cake with a little candle :-)\n\nOur server was very attentive but somehow not so knowledgable about the food, I was expecting that she could tell us a bit more than 'this is a thai basil sauce'... One reason to take off a star was that even though we made a reservation and showed up on time, we still had to wait for about 10 mins to be seated although no one was in front of us. Also, yes, the outdoor seating was great, I wish they could have laid out the seating with some more spaces, the chairs between tables are almost hitting together...\n\nI wanna go back for some more calamari!!
