2nd time and it was a Charm! \nIt was another amazing experience at this store for me once again!  I went in a year after my first purchase as my hubby was treating me again for another pair of shoes. \n\nWe walked in to a busy store.  The gentleman there is not very friendly and you can tell he does have preference to whom he helps, but the gal and I can't remember her name was very friendly and helpful.  I tried on some Eliza Pigalle and those were so uncomfortable, I asked for the Decollete's in nude and some Bianca's to try.  She brought out both pairs at once for me to try and I took both!  \nI forgot to call my credit card company that I was leaving town, so Fraud alert was placed on my card in which she was very understanding and told me to take my time to resolve.  Took no more than 5 minutes and issue was resolved and I walked out with my 2 new pairs!   So in love!
