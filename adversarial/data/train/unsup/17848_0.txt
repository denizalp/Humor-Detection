Whoa, mama, this place is intense. You feel like you've walked into an attic of a circus hoarder's house (or something like that). All kinds of crap everywhere, very little room to move around. An absolute overkill of sights, colors, people and stuff. Not the place to go if you are afraid of dirt, crowds or cluttered spaces. Also it was extremely hot and stuffy. But it really held my attention and I found some things. I was offered lemonade when I came in but didn't drink any. There was a white haired guy who was shirtless who was selling stuf (I assume he was one of the owners). Rooms full of bizarre painting, maniquins, costumes and just junk. An unforgettable experience, to say the least.
