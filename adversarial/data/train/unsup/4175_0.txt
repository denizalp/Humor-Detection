Her new salon is amazing!!! Check out her pictures...everything is so clean as always..I would suggest for now in the beginning to call in advance for early am appts. I'm sure as a new business its gotta be hard running 24hrs with out 24 hrs of consistent business! But Elaine is amazing and will accommodate I'm sure!!!  Lets help get her there she deserves it and we deserve the best service for our money which she delivers every time. I still stand by my five stars Elaine is amazing and know that even if Elaine cannot be the one to do your nails have faith in her judgement of employees she has high standards! AND.....while your there try the new mood changing gels holy cow im easily amused and I love my nails they are sooooo fun! Shes always up to date with all the new cool styles!
