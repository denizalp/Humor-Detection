This business shoud be called CASH IN A FLASH because that was exactly what happened. While cleaning up my bedroom dresser yesterday I found a long forgotten jewelry box of old wedding rings and other odds and ends. I did not think that i could get enough to buy a Happy Meal. Since I was going to be in the area shortly why not take the junk with me and see how insulted my pile of junk was worth. \nThe greeter was very kind and offered me a wide selection of snacks and beverages. Next into the jaws of the lion. He looked them over...and offered a high price that nearly floored me . I accepted his too good to be true price...filled out the bill of sale...picked up the cash from the desk and was out the door faster than a New York moment. Total satisfaction in every aspect of transaction.  Think i'll check out my other drawers.....who knows what buried i'll find?
