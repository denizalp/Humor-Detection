Still having some time to kill before the Purim party I headed up to Margaret's fine imports teas. I saw on the door there is a 2nd location in Carnegie. When I went in I inquired about it I learned that it is open and located at 1451 Collier Ave, Carnegie. That information is always helpful for me since I live closer to that location.\n\nThey were have a 20% off special on all British teas today where you purchased boxed or loose leaf. The shop also sells candy along with some of the most beautiful teapots I had ever seen along with accessories. I asked if they sell any made up and was told no because they don't have the capacity in store to do that. However, I was welcome to smell any jar I found that might interest me. They were also featuring Irish tea and fixings in honor of St. Patrick's day.\n\nI finally decided to purchase a spiced apple chai which I understand is one of their best sellers. It comes with real apple pieces in it and sells for $3.99 per 2 ounces. There is a Yelp check in offer for 20% off Sencha loose leaf green tea. The lady at the counter told me she'd have to ask Margaret but that was no longer valid. She did however, give me instructions on how much tea to use for my cup and when I got home brewed a cup. Very good indeed.  I also bought a canister with a Japanese motif on it to store it.\n\nI am anxious to try the second location in the near future. Very pleased with both of my purchases.
