I'm glad I made it Huntersville to officially check off my first stop by Birkdale Villiage!\n\nMy first impressions were that this place stays packed! My goodness the parking lot was a bit crazy. But after finding a park and walking around I begin to realize why....this place has so much to offer! \n\nI loved that there were a good mix of stores and boutiques for you to window shop or browse and find some great deals! There's also a movie theatre and book store which add a nice touch! And if you're anything like me, the food options are a big priority and here they offer more than enough choices! I was impressed with the amount of variety they offered. And yes, there's ice cream too!  \n\nIt's the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon or a lazy Sunday just wondering around. If I'm on this side of town again I wouldn't mind stopping by here again!
