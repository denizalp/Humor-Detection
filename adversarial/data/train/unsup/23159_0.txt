I honestly love the lofts. I live in a one bedroom with wood floors and carpet in the bedroom. Maintenance is always punctual and swift to repair anything damaged. I have never once had a problem with noise...the only noise I do hear are people peeling out...but that's because my apartment in building B faces a main intersection. It is easily blocked out with a good fan.\n\nI do enjoy the community, the waterfalls, the landscaping is always taken care of..and I have a little French bulldog who also enjoys the grass areas for her daily duties.\n\nThe only complaint I have about the lofts that prevented me from giving 5 stars is the petty theft I keep seeing on other comments.\nWhy theft is a problem here when kids are CLEARLY driving BMWs and Chargers...I have no idea; but someone took the time to pick out every single Swarovski crystal off my Mercedes Benz license plate frame. \n\nObviously, it is a quality frame...so it must have taken some time to wiggle out as many crystals as they did. I feel if security better patrolled the parking areas, this probably would not have been a problem, and who ever was taking the time to pick them probably would have been seen. I'm a little annoyed that I have to park my bike on my balcony because of theft....it leaves less room to enjoy my patio. \n\nOverall as a 23 yr old female nursing student who also comes home late from urgent care shifts....I feel pretty safe coming to and from the garage up to my apartment at night. I would recommend this to other women who live alone or are concerned for safety.
