The crispy beef tacos here are really really good. Take it from someone who knows tacos. They don't skimp on the beef and they give you just the right amount of lettuce. You know how some places will bombard you with lettuce to make it look like it's this amazingly huge taco and when you bite into it, you're left thinking WTH? I'm I being punked? Not here. \n \nI should have taken pictures of my crispy beef tacos and buttered tortilla, but my hunger go the better of me and now I'm ashamed. I think I inhaled the food, I'm still unsure. I wanted to show you all just how great they look, but alas, I can't. You're going to have to try this for yourselves. Take the journey here or forever regret it.
