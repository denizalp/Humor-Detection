I would seriously give NEGATIVE stars if that were possible!!! We stayed here one night. This place is seriously gross! The carpet is literally dark brown, they don't vacuum because you can see all of the nasty debris on the carpet from the last people. There were multiple pieces of hair in the shower! Disgusting! It is quite obvious that they owner of this place has absolutely no passion or desire to keep this place in good shape. Everything is outdated, falling apart, dirty and really disgusting. The furniture in the lobby is literally torn and falling apart. It was almost 100 degrees outside and it felt like they were running the heater in the lobby and elevator. I'm sure they were just running the \"fan\" to save money on not running the air conditioner. The front desk clerk seemed annoyed that we were there, he rushed through and treated us like idiots. We didn't ask any questions just let him rush through. It was just my husband and myself but I would NEVER take my children to this awful place! I am seriously afraid they could catch something! Yes, it is that bad! Unfortunately for us, we were visiting Surprise, AZ during \"Spring Training\" and there were literally NO rooms available, so they got away with charging us $213 for this complete DUMP of a space! Awful!! Horrible, DUMP!!!! Complete rip off and they should be SHUT DOWN!!!!
