Back in Thyme stopped by my office today as part of our weekly food truck rotation.   They advertise that all their food is organic and non GMO.  I can get behind that!   \n\nA couple of our staffers had the Stuffed Avocado, which they were raving about, another staffer had the Asian Sticky Wings, which she said were really good.  One other colleague and I both had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich topped with buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles.  \n\nThe sandwich was flat out amazing.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and very tender.  It was battered instead of plain breaded, which gave it a wonderful twist, and their house pickles and cilantro paired nicely with the buffalo sauce and blue cheese.  Had a little heat to it!  I like spicy chicken sandwiches, and I loved this one.  \n\nHad the sweet potato fries on the side, which were also battered and crispy.  Quite good!  All in, I tried but wasn't able to completely finish the meal, so I feel like the portion was ample and well worth the price.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and my order came out quickly despite there being a line.  Score.  Thanks for a delicious lunch!
