Didn't your mama always tell you to never judge a book by its cover?! When my girl and I walked in, I was a little taken back but daaaaamn did we leave happy. Our server was so sweet and genuine. \n\nWe started with an order of plantains. I probably could have eaten about 3 dozen of those things! My lady had a burger, which was homemade and looked amazing. She didn't offer me a bite...which I won't hold against here...eeeeven though she had some of mine. I had to go with the chicken and waffles...that fried chicken was possibly the best I've ever had in my life. Washed it down with an \"Obama\" to drink LOL! \n\nWould definitely  come back...especially to try the Caribbean portion of their menu.
