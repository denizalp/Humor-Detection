So I crushed this food! I got the fish and chips. The fish could've been seasoned better but the tartar sauce and vinegar made it great! I've never had vinegar on fish but the waiter told me to try it and it was worth it! I usually don't like coleslaw but this coleslaw was perfectly crispy and not too vinegary. The service was fast and friendly.
