Ordered one of their egg sandwiches and it was delicious BUT the lines were just too long.  After waiting on long lines, I would like to at least be able to order a side with my egg sandwich but sides are not an option.  So, although my egg sandwich was absolutely scrumptious, I can't see myself standing on a 45 minute line again to order a small egg sandwich with no sides.
