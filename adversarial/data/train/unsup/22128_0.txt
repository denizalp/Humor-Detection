1.  Wash\n\nEvery time I wash the dog at home I wreak havoc on two different bathrooms and by the end my dog still smells like someone with B.O. who just sprayed on some cologne.  And because I have a dog instead of children, I'm way too nice - that hose water is waaaay too cold.  So I dump warm bathwater on him and his under-sides never get clean.\n\nWag n Wash provides a solution.  I mess up their place, not mine.  I use their warm-water hose to clean his underside.  Then I blow hair all over their establishment, instead of all over my bathroom.\n\nPaying someone else to wash the dog is preferred, but this is a reasonably priced alternative that works better than a home wash.\n\n2.  Food\/Accessories\n\nMy dog eats healthier than I do, so I overpay for fancy food that uses ingredients I can actually pronounce.  Wag n Wash prices are equal to or less than Petco for my Solid Gold Wolf King - and I take comfort that my payments are going to a small business and not to a large corporation majority owned by some prince from a large oil producing country.  And their acessories are great too.
