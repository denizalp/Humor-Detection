7 years ago my husband took me on our first date here! Since it has expanded a bit, but has managed to keep it's small business charm. Always dimly lit with the cute Japanese news paper looking wallpaper. Always expect a wait for their 8-10pm happy hour Monday - Friday. And you can always expect good service and food. Yup... not much has changed. I would say they have become a little less popular with more and more decent sushi options popping up near by. But we always seem to find our way back to the good 'ol Happy Hour at Yen. You can not go wrong with the Crazy Boy Roll: A Deep Fried Jalapeno, stuffed with Crab Meat, and Drizzled with Eel Sauce. And of course everyone's simple go-to Roll, the Philadelphia Roll. And I think it goes with out saying that you have to get your $5 Saki Bomb and call it a night. That's how we do it anyway. We are lucky enough that this little is in Longboarding distance from our house. So sometimes I call it a night after 2 Saki Bombs... shhh..;)
