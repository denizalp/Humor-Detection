I bought my sister's birthday cake here that was big enough to feed 70 people and let me tell you, they know how to do cakes. Everyone raved. I hate butter cream and overtly sweet frosting, so I was pleasantly surprised when they used whipped cream frosting without me having to request it. If you hate the grocery store cakes with their godawful bone dry cakes and disgusting frosting you should give El Rancho Market a try. They have a great cake book you can order out of. \n\nDon't be intimidated like most people who do not speak Spanish. I don't have that problem but my boyfriend is a gringo and he has no problem shopping here. They have even joked with me sometimes that I need to teach him. Hey, he took Spanish in high school, he should get along fine right? If you come along and eat inside in the food court there are benches inside and they make their tortillas fresh so you can sit and eat and watch them make tortillas.
