Can you sit there and say that you've never enjoyed one of the 31 flavors at Baskin Robbins? I definitely can't. In fact, I spent many afternoons during my childhood at my local Baskin Robbins enjoying flavors like Gold Medal Ribbon, Peanut Butter Chocolate, Mint Chocolate Chip and let's not forget about the season Bubble Gum flavor! That was the best because you had gum to chew once you were done with the ice cream!\n\nBut moving on from my memories to my actual experience at this local Baskin Robbins. I'm giving Baskin Robbins four stars because I know that I can walk in and order a delicious ice cream cake with an adorable decoration, whether it be a golfer, a suit with a tie, a Cars scene...you name it, they've got it! This cake is an instant conversation starter, it's the perfect cake for a party and it's delicious with every bite! You can choose any ice cream flavor, chocolate or vanilla cake and the cakes range from the smallest being around $16 to around $40 for the largest. This includes the decoration. Am I the only remaining person who makes it a point to order an ice cream cake for a special occasion? Maybe, but I hope that others order them to because I don't know what I'll do if I don't have a Baskin Robbins to purchase a cute ice cream cake from! (pictures attached!)
