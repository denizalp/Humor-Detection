Honestly the first time I saw this new restaurant, hardly anyone was inside, I was hesitant to try it. I'm so glad we did! This place is less than a year old so they were just getting started.  In my opinion they have an excellent happy hour, drink menu and great sushi. We usually get the chicken skewers, sushi, potstickers and Sangria. Their lunch deals during the week are filling, fresh and a good deal.  They offer lunch combos such as a Teriyaki Chicken, miso soup, rice, potstickers and salad...for about $8. The waitstaff has always been professional and sweet to us.  It is now part of our regular jaunts at Desert Ridge.\n\nCheck in deal: free edamame!
