I purchased 10th row tickets for a weekday show. The theater is located in the Venetian en route to the Palazzo Casino.\n\nThe play is comical at times, sexy and the music is great. If you're into music like Faithfully, Knock knock on Heaven's Door, Wanted dead or alive, Nothin' but a good time, Not going to take it and Welcome to the Jungle then you'll heart this musical. \n\nThe cast is awesome and the show was so entertaining I would definitely see it again.
