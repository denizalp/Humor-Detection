A vintage maven's dream come true. \n\nI could probably spend hours in here and that's even an understatement. There is so much treasure to behold at Deering Vintage. I've been visiting here every time I've traveled up to the Ohio City\/Tremont neighborhoods, and I've never left without picking out something adorable or precious. \n\nThe store is well-laid out with categorized racks of either sweaters, blouses, jackets or dresses. Cindy now carries a large men's clothing selection which excited my boyfriend. I saw on the men's racks on Saturday with a WWII navy uniform shirt with original ribbons attached in mint condition! That would be fantastic addition for a 1940s\/USO swing party. I do like the fact that all of the clothes are in impeccable condition and don't have that \"thrift store\" smell (not that I don't appreciate some Macklemore poppin' some tags every once and while). This vintage is set out for the swanky, quirky person in all of us.\n\nThe fact that Cindy recognizes all of her frequent guests really shows how much she loves her job and loves people who appreciate good  fashion. What a fantastic person. If I could just give Cindy 5 Stars for being completely  awesome, I totally would.
