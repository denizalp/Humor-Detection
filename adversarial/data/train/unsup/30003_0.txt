Ferraro 502 is a popular Italian restaurant in midtown Toronto. In the evenings, it is usually very crowded.\n\nWe went there for lunch and ordered the cozze seducente and the antipasto for appetizers. We had the pizza con pesci and j and j pasta special for our mains.\n\nWe enjoyed the cozze seducente and the antipasto. The mussels came in a light tomato broth.\n\nThe pizza was very good. But it was very strange to see mussels shells on a pizza. My brother also like his pasta dish.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and charming.\n\nWould we go back? Probably as there isn't that nice restaurants in that area.
