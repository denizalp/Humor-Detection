This is a cool place to hang out at when you need place to sit down and chit chat with your friends.  Their boba is great, if you wanted a meal, they offer a lot of japanese, korean dishes.  After eating a meal, you're not overly stuff where you don't have room for boba. Their boba is not always the consistent, but for the price I have to pay, and the location, I would never go anywhere else.  I come here at least once a week for boba.  Shame on me.  haha!
