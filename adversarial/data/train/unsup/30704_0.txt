Where do I start? Dolphin Pools Under Promise and over delivers and that is very very hard to find in any business. You talk about a company with integrity, If you are looking to have a pool done then look no further than Dolphin Pools. I was referred to Dolphin Pools from my neighbor who owns a pool cleaning company. He had heard great things about Dolphin Pools and in his opinion, Out of all the Pools he cleans Dolphin Pools looked more custom and he felt they build a better pool. I had 6 pool companies come out and give me a quote on having the pool I designed built. #1 Dolphin Pools, Shasta Pools, We Fix Ugly Pools, Lake Side Pools , Monster Pools and California Pools! NOW LET ME TALK ABOUT MY Salesman Dustin Parker. When he first came out he was very professional and was at my house sitting out front 15 minutes early and waited till 5 minutes before our appointment and then came to ring our doorbell. From the start we hit it off! NOT PUSHY very informative and help me make a few minor changes to my pool to help me get the most for my money. Dustin told me up front he would give me one price and wouldn't play the game of going back and forth and he also told me up front he would be the cheapest by far!!! Dustin  quote came in $4,000 cheaper than the lowest bidder out of the 5 other companies for the exact same pool after negotiating with the other companies for days. Because of Dustin Parker and Dolphin Pools my family are able to have the exact pool we desired and we are ever so grateful for Dolphin Pools finishing our pool in less than the 58 days they promised. I highly recommend Dustin Parker and Dolphin Pools, if you want a family owned Pool Company that cares about the customer.
