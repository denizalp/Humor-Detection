We got the \"Lobster Rolls\"...which was really Lobster Salad on top of warm soft bread.  Very good but also very small: Only Three 3-inch long pieces.  I loved the nice bartenders though, they totally warned me on what was small and what wasn't before ordered...they also got sliders, fladbread, and other snacks for $8...good when it comes to Vegas prices.  \n\n$8 Cocktails! Hard to find even in my native San Diego, more or less in Vegas! I highly reccommend the Bourbon Crusta and Cucumber Gimlet.  They also got domestic beers for $4.  \n\nAtmosphere is very classy, elegant, candle lit, and quiet(It was a Wednesday night).  The regular restaurant menu looks reasonable and delicious too.  I tried to get a \"Buy 1 Get 1 Free\" Cert from the Tix4Dinner.com booth, but I was too late and they sold out.  I hope to try this famous \"Lobster Pot Pie\" someday...better luck next time!  \n\nhttp:\/\/www.michaelmina.net\/restaurant.php?restaurant_id=17&action=menus
