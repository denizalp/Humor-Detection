Tired of trying to stuff your 20-lb male cat into his \"crap carrier\" for the trip to the vet only to have to do clean up before you leave the driveway, or worse yet, en route? Tired of listening to your neurotic female meow incessantly the entire way-when she's not trying to chew her way through the metal bars that is?  If so, then try a mobile vet, this one in particular.\n\nDr. Townsley is not only a fantastic doctor, he has a bedside manner like I've never seen before.  I'm not saying my cats run to the door to greet him, but they seem relatively calm with him, somewhat of a miracle.  Since moving to the Valley, I've used his services more often than I wish.  However, he is extremely knowledgeable and relatively conservative in treatment.  If he recommends an invasive treatment, I have no doubt it's because that is the best option.  His love of animals shines through, and he always acts in their best interest.\n\nExams can be done in your home or in his mobile clinic.  He can perform many services on-site, including dental work.  Otherwise, your pet will be taken back to his \"base\"  for more extensive surgeries, x-rays, etc.   \n\nYou can expect to pay an additional house call fee, but you can schedule more than one pet per visit.  I have found his services to be somewhat expensive, but I have no basis of comparison as he is the only vet in Scottsdale I have used.  You must also have the time to allow at least an hour window on either side of your appointment time.\n\nOne word of warning, he is very attentive to your needs, but you often have to leave voice mail as he is usually on a call.  If your call is not returned in a satisfactory time frame, call him back.  I recently encountered a problem with a new assistant who was taking incomplete messages it appears.  You may also want to make sure you know of a good emergency clinic for nights or weekends.
