I've been here many times over the years & we came back for my mother in law's birthday with a large group of 15. Despite our large numbers service was great. I had the salmon with veggies & rice. Very delicious. The salmon just melted in my mouth. Hubby & I shared dessert & that was delicious too! This place is amazing in every way. The decor, the service, cleanliness & quality of food. It's funny because it's in a plaza at the corner of Warden & Sheppard. Not the nicest looking of places but Remezzo is first class.
