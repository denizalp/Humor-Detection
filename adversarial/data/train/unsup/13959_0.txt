I believe its illegal to state a deal and then not uphold said deal....or wait, we are in Vegas so maybe that is legal? Whatever....THE DEAL WITH HAPPY HOUR SAYS ALL APPS 30% OFF. We ordered chips and salsa at $4 and the waiter said \"oh, those arent 30% off because they're already cheap\".\n\nTHE ONLY REASON WE ORDERED ANYTHING AT ALL WAS BECAUSE OF THE \"DEAL\"\n\nAdvertising SHOULD read: All apps EXCEPT chips and salsa! \n\nA-Holes!
