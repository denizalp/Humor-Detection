This location should have no stars,but Yelp wants  minimal of one.Not for the poor product,but for the ignorance with disability permit parking. There are 3 \"designated spots\" two with proper \"wall signage.\"One was plowed in by snow,two others had cars without permits. Asked the girls at the cash if they had the parking enforcement number,neither understood what this meant.Nor did they understand their customers  without a permit shouldn't park in those spots. \n\nThe two employees actually GIGGLED at the issue of parking in a disabled spot without a permit. \n\nOnly one spot complies with 903-2. Specific definitions,A: An off-street parking space having a width of at least 3.65 metres...\n\n\nFine of up to $5000 for parking in a disability spot without a permit in Ontario.\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.aodaalliance.org\/strong-effective-aoda\/11042011.asp
