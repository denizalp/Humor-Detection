Get here early or just be prepared to wait it out...\n\nThe line seems to be never ending at this spot, but you know that's a good thing when you're talking about a restaurant in Scottsdale where there are so many to choose from.  \n\nFood is always great, no surprises there, otherwise there wouldn't be that line.  Regular favorites like omelets and scrambles are done as you'd expect, only probably better.  \n\nAtmosphere is ok, as it's just a regular American restaurant.  It's like an upscale Denny's inside.  \n\nIf you're not in the mood for waiting, I would suggest heading elsewhere.  But if you're not in a rush and want some really good food, this is a good spot.
