generous portion of one of my favourites: apricot croissant and almond croissant, a bit on the sweet side, i will most certainly go back for the Pari Brest. On my first visit the owner gave me a croissant on the house, reminds me of the one at Kouin Amann but maybe it's because it was from the morning it was a bit dry.
