Came here to spend $50 to get 50 air miles and also use a bunch of coupons which included a $10 off a purchase of $50. Almost everything I wanted was in stock and the staff we very helpful. Cashing out took a while so I was glad that the cashier didn't mind taking her time (since almost every item I bought had a coupon). She was also very interested in knowing how on earth I had so many coupons! It was quiet funny.\n\nI also noticed that they have random amazing sales on cosmetics which is exciting =) (e.g. BOGO lip products or 25% of certain brands)
