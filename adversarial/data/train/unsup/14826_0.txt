I came to Murray Avenue Grill for my birthday brunch a few months ago, and I was impressed.  My friend and I had been hoping to go to Pamela's, but when the wait was two hours, we decided to try here out.  There was no wait on a Sunday morning around 10:30.  I've yet to try Pamela's, but I don't think I'll ever make it there since this is right across the street!\n\nHow do you start brunch on your birthday?  With a birthday mimosa, of course!  The mimosa was delicious and not terribly priced.  From there I moved to a massive breakfast burrito, covered in tomatoes.  I couldn't quite finish the whole thing, but I took it to go and ate it later.  I definitely would order it again.  My friend ordered steak and eggs, and the steaks were a really nice size for the price.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly, and I cannot wait to come back here to try out the lunch and dinner menus!
