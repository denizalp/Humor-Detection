I miss the old crepe restaurant. And this is a poor substitute. The space is open and clean, and I appreciate that. Leone is quite crowded this Saturday, whereas Waffle Bar has only two other patrons. \nThe crepe is NOT fresh. Which is a disappointment because they have crepe cooking surfaces (I sat and watched the staff unwrap our crepes from paper). We ordered the berry crepe-it was filled with fresh whole blueberries, chopped strawberries, and an odd berry syrup which was overly sweet. Our other crepe, the Nute, was cold and had unevenly distributed Nutella. Overall, a sad brunch.
