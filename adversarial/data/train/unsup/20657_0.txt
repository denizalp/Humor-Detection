I wished I shopped here more often. Not just for the goods but for the great customer service I receive anytime I here. No matter who is working.\n\nIf I need \"perfect\" gift, this is definitely a store I will come and visit. It is so easy for me to find just the greatest gift and not spend an arm and leg on it.\n\nAnd if you are into holidays, this is a great store to come for Holiday Decorations. I love their Christmas Ornaments but any holiday is worth checking out here, 4th of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, etc.\n\nThey also have great varieties of selections for home decorations too.
