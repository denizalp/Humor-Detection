This is the worst Walmart I've ever been to in terms of product selection and price.\n\nThe selection of food items makes no sense. For example they have sugar free name brand fudge pops but only great value normal fudge pops.\n\nThey have tons of 4 cheese pizzas but no single cheese frozen pizza.\n\nAlso the prices are rediculous for a Walmart. All of the food items are more expensive than what you would pay at a normal grocery store. Not to mention you have to deal with the skankbag customers that usually frequent Walmart with their 20 screaming kids.\n\nThey are also constantly screwing with the food prices. Place gives me a headache every time I go, and as a result I always end up buying less items and spending less money.\n\nAs an added note: they close the north entrance at 10pm for who knows what reason. So if you want grocery items you are forced to walk across the entire store and back again.
