We came here for lunch because of the reviews.  I am giving this place 3 stars for service.  The decor is cute and they have alcohol, not that it is most important but it is a plus! The menu was very limited, so if you're looking for options I wouldn't recommend it.  \n\nI ordered the salmon wrap and regretted it.  It is cured and the mayo used doesn't compliment the texture.  I did send it back and ordered the ham and cheese sandwich.  Warning: The ham and cheese sandwich is literally ham, cheese, and bread.  It is not warmed up, it is cold, and tastes like a 3rd grader made it.  The best part of this lunch experience was the tiramisu.  \n\nI'm writing this because it could be great, has potential, but they do need to add some things to the menu.  Possibly a new chef.  Love the concept, service was great, the food just needs some love! I'll be back!
