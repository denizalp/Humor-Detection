So glad Shake Shack has come to Vegas! Came here for lunch with a group of friends and came back again for a late night burger. My vegetarian friend said the 'Shroom Burger was one of the best burgers he's had. If you are a meat-eater, get the Shack Stack. It will not disappoint. And if you're going to order fries, make it with cheese. The frozen custard is delicious and the shakes are also a win. You pretty much can't go wrong eating here. Space is limited so you'll probably have to hover over a table to snag it.
