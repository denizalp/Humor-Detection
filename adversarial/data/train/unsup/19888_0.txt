Common Grounds is where my life took shape, from awkward teen to happening scenester. I've probably never had more fun inside the confines of four walls, and have made life long friendships with my coffee house friends from CG.  As for the environment, it's cool, funky, with ever changing artwork, and stuff.  The coffee itself is good too.. I'm a drip coffee sorta guy, and it's always done it's job.. tastes good, served HOT and wires me :)  The fluffy mixed drinks are always really original and awesome too, and there are SOO MANY CHOICES. The staff itself is an amazing group.. some of whom have worked at Common Grounds for over 11 years.. That's hard to find anywhere, especially at a coffee house. By far the coolest coffee house to hang out in, in Northeast Ohio, and in my opinion, the world. :)
