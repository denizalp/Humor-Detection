This place has great vegetarian options- we had the veggie tostadas and the black bean quesadillas. Both were full of flavor! Their chips and salsas plate was great because the salsas actually all taste substantially different from each other-- it's not some Pico de gallo and then the same thing put through a blender. Each salsa actually taste like it was made with different flavors in mind and perfectly complements all main courses. \n\nThe drinks are also presented in funky glasses and are super cool looking. \n\nMy biggest complaint unfortunately is that the service is SUPER slow, this is no place to get in n out.
