The staff here is nothing short of amazing. From the front desk to the technician, to the doctor herself, I was treated like I OWNED the hospital rather than a random customer.  The time spent with me and my pet was genuine, not hurried.  I wish I had more pets just so I could go back more often. Ok, that sounded crazy, but you get my point. I highly recommended this place.
