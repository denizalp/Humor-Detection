Had a 2 bedroom condo overlooking the pool area that we enjoyed. Condo had an unusual layout. The \"master\" bedroom had the smaller bathroom with just a shower stall that was tiny and I'm 5'2\". There were tiny things that we could overlook because honestly, we didn't spend a lot of time there. There is patio access from the master bedroom, but we couldn't open the vertical blinds because the wand was missing. The fixtures in the bathroom are old and weren't sparkling clean. The tub in the other bathroom was slow draining bc of hair (not us) . The pool and lazy river are very kid friendly. The lazy river is very small, the pool, really shallow. If you're concerned about not staying on the strip, they have a free shuttle to the Monte Carlo and back. \n\nBut the worst is the sales pitch they make to owners. My husband and I haven't been to a \"member update\" as time share owners in years. We always decline the \"free\" breakfast whenever we use our timeshare. These guys know how to work you, so please go in with a plan because they are there to sell, no matter what they say \"we're here to maximize your benefits\". We were told the pitch would last 45 minutes, but instead lasted us over 2 hours, that we were even late for check out. Like I said, my husband and I stood our ground and knew what we were in for to receive our free gift. But if your time is precious and you're busy, or you don't have thick skin, just say no. Not worth it.
