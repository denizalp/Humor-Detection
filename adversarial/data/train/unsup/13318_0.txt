They are organizational bad guys. I never ever forever recomend this car rental. Please do not use!!!! I had a bad bad experience.\nI went to AZ last year. I had a reservation at Phenix air port , but they said NO!!!! You don't have a reservation. I called 1800 and cheched everything whatever I can. But I could not rent a car from Sixt. I used Herts. Xmas season,last minits rent a car, hightend price.\nOne month later they charged fee of renting a car my master card. I did not rent a car from Sixt. But they said you had a reservation but you didn't come.You sould pay.\nThey are convinced criminal.\n\nI wrote this review yesterdat. But I can't find today. So who deleted my review??
