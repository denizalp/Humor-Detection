An excellent sushi restaurant hidden in the slot machine jungles of Red Rock, with a very large array of $8 rolls and bites you might not expect from the classiest casino this side of 95. In fact, despite all the amazing decor, the place is very affordable with friends, even when bringing on the sake and the specialty selection of delightful sushi. \n\nAll the specialty rolls have narcotics names, so when I say to try the 8-ball, maui wowie, LSD and poppy rolls, please, do so responsibly.  They can kind of be addictive.  Chase that dragon roll in moderation!\n\n I can't imagine what happy hour can do to one's diet or liver, but I only assume it's the best thing for your wallet. The service is always attentive and fast here, even on weekend visits.  The multiple sushi chefs always seem upbeat, which is always a plus when taking a bar-view seat.  A restaurant that has yet to do anything but please my group!
