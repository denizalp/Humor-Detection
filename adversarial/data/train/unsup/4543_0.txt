Went to Ichiza and the wait was over an hour on a Sunday night so decided to give this place a try since it was the sister location.  It is a different menu and style so don't go thinking it's the same as Ichiza. I always want to give a new place and Yu Yu was quiet, clean and service was great. Kushiage is good and there are plenty of varieties to try. Personally I liked the bacon covered mochi kushiage but that may not be to everyone's taste. Not heavily fried so easy on the palate and we ordered about twenty different ones. Besides kushiage, I had the chicken gizzards, pig ears, tuna with quail egg, and beef tongue. All pretty good.  When compared to the ego of Ichiza, this place is more humble and down to earth. All around a good experience and will come back again.
