Well I know chain buffet what should you expect. I did not leave hungry however less then satisfied. Apparently they have a fixed selection, always a pepperoni, cheese, ok good. But always a spinach flatbread and an Alfredo and three buffalo chicken pizzas, really?? What happened to sausage or a pizza with any kind of veggies or better a supreme( meat and veggies)
