I went here with high expectations as it had been suggested many times. First I wanted to get a wrap, and you can get salad instead of their chips. But they were unwilling make it a side Caesar salad, only \"their\" salad. I even asked to be upcharged (it's really just the difference in lettuce and dressing, not like I wanted a filet across it or anything, just a small side Caesar). Ok no dice, so I ordered the Caesar wrap. After waiting a few minutes im told \"we dont have Caesar dressing.\"  Ok, I'll get the turkey avocado wrap (which cost less but I didn't say anything about it since I'd already paid and tipped, and it wasn't that big of a difference). \n\nI take it home and first, there was an extremely disproportionate amount of avocado to the paltry amount of turkey. Then in the first half of the wrap\nI hit two bones, one which left a small crack in one of my teeth. When I called up first they just said \"well tell us next time you're here and we'll do something\" (one assuming I'll be back, and two very vague on what they'll do).  I ultimately called right back and took the remaining food and one of the large bones back (I had spit the other one in the trash).\n\nIf I could give 0 stars I would, or less.
