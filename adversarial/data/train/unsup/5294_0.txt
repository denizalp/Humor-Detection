I'm not a big fan of the concept of the Walmart Neighborhood Market - according to Walmart, it's supposed to \"woo shoppers with easier parking, less crowded aisles and quicker checkout.\" I can see how that would be appealing to someone who treats Walmart SuperCenter as the place to do their primary grocery shopping. In that case, the individual would probably welcome the opportunity to skip out on the toys, electronics, home goods, and massive lines that characterize your average Super Walmart. They would probably be thrilled with the fact that this version of Walmart maintains the low prices but downsizes the space and speeds up checkout (and for that matter, has self-checkout, which larger Walmarts do not). \n\nHowever, since I shop for groceries elsewhere (my love, Fresh and Easy, or Fry's), only get food at Walmart if I'm also there shopping for other things, and see Walmart as a place to find home goods (paper products, cat food, towels) at really low prices, the Neighborhood Market doesn't really serve my needs. When I went to this location last night to check it out on the day of its grand opening, I discovered that the selection of non-food home goods is pretty small. As an example, they only had 2-3 brands of cat food. They also didn't have hard alcohol (only wine and beer), and the deli selection looked pretty slim. \n\nTo sum it up, if you frequent larger Walmarts for food, limited house goods, and the pharmacy, you will appreciate having a downsized version of the store. If you like going to Walmart to find a really large selection of every kind of product, you will probably not find the Neighborhood Market too useful.
