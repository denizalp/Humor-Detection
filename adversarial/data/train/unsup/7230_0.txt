My Go-To for Pho in Vegas. Located on Spring Mountain (near Chinatown) where you find most of the decent Pho in this town. If you know me, you know how much i love Pho. And how I'm a pretty big Pho snob (I've tried it all). That being said, this place is pretty amazing. Robust broth, tender meat, the noodles have perfect texture and fresh-fragrant ingredients. It's the best thing on a gloomy day or any day of the week imo. \n\nI usually order the same thing every time:\n#1 Cha Gio (crispy egg rolls) served with big leafy greens not the sad wilted lettuce you'll find at other restaurants. \n#9 Pho Tai large (rare steak) usually the difference between large and small at most places isn't very noticeable but it is here. If you don't want to leave on an empty stomach, opt for the large bowl. \nAnd Hot tea - it's good for the soul and cold water is served automatically. \n\nThe Charbroiled Pork Spring Rolls, Ox-tail pho and Bun Bo Hue are all solid choices. Another notable mention is the service. Unlike most Vietnamese restaurants where you order your food, you receive your food, then never see your waiter again; Viet Noodle Bar really stands out for their service. It's one of the many reasons I keep coming back. The staff is friendly and attentive. My water glass is refilled without asking, i get extra napkins when needed, they always come back to see if you need anything else. Much appreciated.
