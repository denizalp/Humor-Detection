According to my friends in Sauga; there isn't much choice for Bubble Tea there and Bubble Republic Tea House is the one to be at.  This place is always packed mostly high-school kids which I felt out of place.  The place is nicely lit so not an ideal place to bring a date (Go 4 tea is the place for that).  Bubble Republic is super loud and the chairs are plastic and uncomfortable.  The Bubble tea and food is average but I guess beggars can't be choosers in Mississauga for Bubble tea.  I guess I am just not used to it yet as I am from Richmond Hill\/Markham where we have Bubble tea places in every corner.\n\nRating:\n\nService: 2\/5\nFood Quality: 3\/5\nComfort 1\/5\nDecor  2\/5\nValue: 4\/5\nParking: 4\/5
