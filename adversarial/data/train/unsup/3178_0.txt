On the morning of NYE 2013, I went hiking with a couple of buddies in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. As a reward for our outdoorsmanship, two of us went to grab coffee afterward. I don't know this area very well, but using the Yelp app, I found That's Amore Gelato by searching for \"coffee\".\n\nWe had a hard time finding them at first and almost went somewhere else. We stopped at Something or other Caf√© and asked if they had espresso... Nope, so we left. Begrudgingly we continued our search for That's Amore. \n\nAha! I found an address number. We were in the right shopping center but on the wrong side. That's Amore is located in the shopping center on the SE corner of Pinnacle Peak Rd and Miller Rd. It's in the Southern portion of the shopping center next to a Thai restaurant. \n\nI hope that helps you find them because this place is worth being found. I usually order espresso, but when I'm with this particular friend, he always orders his espresso with a dollop of foam on top so I generally will just have the same. This particular day when he ordered at That's Amore, the lady said, \"Okay, you want a Macchiato\". \n\nThat caught my ear but I didn't say anything. I don't think my buddy caught on at all. He didn't care what she called it, as long as he got his espresso the way he wanted it. When she presented us with the final product, it was perfect. Exactly what he orders every time. I would say it was also a little prettier than usual. The taste was very good as well. \n\nThat brings me to today. I've been thinking about how this lady corrected my friend and told him his drink was called a Macchiato. I'm used to drinking a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks and they're nothing like the drink I had on NYE. \n\nI Googled \"Macchiato\" and much to my amusement, the drink I've always consider to be a \"Macchiato\", was completely wrong. A macchiato is simply a double shot of espresso with a dollop of milk foam. The word \"macchiato\" actually means \"marked\", in Italian. The espresso is getting \"marked\" with a little bit of milk or milk foam. The drink called, \"Caramel Macchiato\" at Starbucks, is actually more of a Latte since it's mostly Milk. \n\nBOOM! I have been learned! \n\nI thought this was a great moment in my coffee knowledge history. It's the little things really, and I'm excited to have been enlightened by the lady at That's Amore Gelato. Oh yeah, that's brings me to another point. They have Gelato. Weird, right? I didn't try it on this day, but look forward to it in the future. \n\n5 Stars for increasing my Brain Power, and for becoming my new spot to grab coffee after hiking in the Preserve. \n\nIf you're interested in the article I read, Here ya go.
