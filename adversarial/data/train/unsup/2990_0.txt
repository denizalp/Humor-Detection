Quick visit to Vegas to catch my dad, who was in town for a trade show, and some reliable friends suggested Rx Boiler Room as a good spot for a cocktail and a snack. \n\nThis is a solid 3.5 spot IMHO. \n\nFive stars for service. The team was ON POINT. High fives and tips for the bar staff, who made sure water glasses were stealthily filled and all questions were answered. \n\nFour stars for food. We hit happy hour and there are some deals to be had. Oysters at $2 ea and the Moon Doggie (seafood hot dog in a nice brioche bun with great toppings) were both solid. Didn't love the buffalo oysters, and wish we'd ordered the chicken pot pie nuggets and the house guac with big ass chips! \n\nThree stars for drinks. I ordered a rye old fashioned (Rittenhouse is the well and my preference) and found that they don't default to serving this drink over a solid cube of ice. It is an option (hand cut and formed in one of those expensive Japanese molds at $3 extra!), but they didn't build the cocktail over this, so it was over diluted. In today's world, a bar with a cocktail program really needs to step it up and offer the right ice and make drinks properly if they want to command the $15-$18 price point. I was seriously disappointed. \n\nAgain, overall 3.5 stars with big plus for service and food. So go in with the right expectations.
