Sometimes, a meal is a commitment: you have to dedicate several hours after you finish eating to digest your food. This is a Craft Burger experience. When I worked nearby, I would go here a lot for lunch. The burgers are really works of art - they are home made, huge and topped just the way you like them. I usually indulged in the classic although the craft spicy (with a spicy mayo) is also very tasty. The craft blue with avocado and gorgonzola cheese is also worth a try.  The onion rings are GIGANTIC and deliciously battered. The fries are skinny, dark, mushy things that don't even deserve to sit next to these masterpieces.  They also serve chicken burgers and salads for those not wanting to destroy their arteries. \n\nEvery time I ate here, I felt like I'd eaten a brick. The burgers are so tasty, but they're a lot of food to consume. That's why it's a commitment to get a Craft burger - you'll be feeling it for the rest of the afternoon.  \n\nKeep in mind, there's usually a line out the door at lunchtime during the workweek. Although most people will have to bring their food back to the office as the seating here is minimal.
