A few things to note: \n- outdoor patio area overlooking Mandalay bay pool area\n- located right next to convention center \n- chefs from Food Network and Top Chef \n- tons of small plate options for brunch \n\nRachel K was our server and took very good care of us! The service here was incredibly fast, it was almost scary. They bring out chips and several salsas when you first arrive, but you could ask for an extra spicy one that will really make you sweat. \n\nWhen you check-in, you get complimentary corn tamales. They were ridiculously sweet and I personally would have liked them more for dessert, but I usually don't eat tamales so maybe you have to get used to the taste. \n\nI had one of the best quesadillas here. The tortilla was fresh and handmade, the cheese was perfectly melty, and the vegetables like zucchini completed the dish very well.\n\nHowever, the enchiladas were bland and overpriced, and I really expected more. Even though it comes drenched in this green sauce, I feel like they forgot to add any sort of spices, or even salt and pepper.  On top of that, it was the most expensive thing we ordered and was not filling at all. \n\nWe finished off with \"milk and cookies\". The milk is actually a rich, thick, vanilla ice cream which was amazing, but the cookies aren't traditional chocolate chip.\n\nThe service here was friendly and fast, so 5 stars for that but the food itself disappointing.
