This is the perfect example of not judging a book by it's cover! \n\nRon's doesn't look like much from the outside and, honestly, it's not fancy on the inside either, but it's good...very good, in fact. The prices are unbelievably affordable, the service is super friendly, and the restaurant is clean. Everything is cooked to order so it's served hot and fresh. \n\nJudging by the number of regulars that the staff knew by name, Ron's seems to be a local favorite....and with good reason.
