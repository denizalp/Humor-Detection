This is a very bad bakery.\n\n1. Their eclairs are enormous, which seems good. When you bite in, you realize you're not really eating an eclair. The dough is very much like plain bread, maybe a French roll. It's not the distinctive pastry dough of an actual eclair. (Just eat an eclair pretty much anywhere else if you're not sure what I mean.) It doesn't come off well -- you've basically got a loaf of bread with a bunch of custard in the middle. They don't seem to know how to make pastry dough.\n\n2. The cinnamon roll isn't sweet. I don't mean it wasn't sweet ~enough~. I mean it wasn't sweet at all. The frosting was not sweet, was apparently just a sour cream cheese. I kept trying to find any sweetness in the roll somewhere -- no luck. It was so strange and weird eating a cinnamon roll that had no sugar as an ingredient anywhere, always having this sour cream taste in your mouth. It was very similar to eating a cheap bagel with cream cheese (e.g. a Chompie's bagel -- they're not actual bagels, just rolls with holes.)\n\nI wonder if the cinnamon roll might have been some weird accident by an employee -- I can't imagine people would keep buying unsweet cinnamon rolls with nothing but cream cheese on top. The reviews seem wildly off -- this appears to be one of the worst bakeries one could possibly visit in the Phoenix area, but maybe it was an employee error.
