This place repaired a damaged area on my kitchen table.  The repair initially looked very good, but the material peeled off several months later.  I left two voice mail messages with the company, and I sent them an e-mail about what happened.  They did not respond -- they stopped all communication.\n\nBecause of the lack of communication, I would not recommend this company.
