Not impressed, cheap Mexican bar food, poor service. Told the server I had a friend on their way and ordered her a drink but server said they have to be present... hmmmm check our ARS 4.244.23 law does not state this. So stop playing lawyer and start taking care of your tables. Same comment to all other staff, pay attention instead of hanging around the end of the bar talking and hugging each other.\nTable was not clean and on the booth floor was everything from last week.\nI always tip, this one tested me out.\nI don't like to write poor reviews but this was out of line.\nI'll pass on this place next time .
