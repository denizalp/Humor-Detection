Meh. I've experienced better. \nSeating was fast. Server was great. They had coffee set out while we waited for our table, but the coffee station was messy and coffee was empty. Boo! \n\nAt breakfast, half of my breakfast came to the table cold. My eggs were warm, but my hash browns, bacon and belgian waffle were cold. I can deal with cold bacon, but as I tried to spread the butter across my \"fresh\" waffle, it just \"sat\" on top. Ewww. \n\nOur server was awesome. I was able to let her know right away that although I was ok with keeping the bacon and eggs, I really wanted a hot belgian waffle. She apologized and took it back to the kitchen, where the kitchen committed a cardinal sin... they took the same waffle I just sent back and put it in the microwave. \n\nI suspected it was the same waffle when I saw the caramel-colored brown spots on top where I tried to spread the butter previously, but just to be sure I checked the bottom. Yep; soggy from the microwave.  Ewww.  I was no longer in the mood for a belgian waffle. \n\nI would give it one star, but I appreciated my server, and I actually really like the casual decor, the patio and the restrooms.
