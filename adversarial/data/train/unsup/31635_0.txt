Won't be dining here again.  The meant is like flash frozen, and once it's cooked it's like trying to chew rubber.  The only thing really selling this place is that it's all-you-can-eat.  \n\nI'd rather go to Flat Top, same dining experience (mongolian grill) better ingredients, better food.  \n\nI'd rather get full on good food, than fill myself with bad.
