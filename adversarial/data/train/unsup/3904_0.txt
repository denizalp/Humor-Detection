Way overrated!\nWe have used in&out for our move last month. Very nice guys but frankly, that's not enough.., we were looking for professional movers to move us from our old home to our new home, and we were disappointed.\nIt started wrong when they came in about an hour late.., then they were just not very professional. Couldn't handle heavy stuff, and tried to dismantle anything they could to avoid moving heavy items (like our elliptical). They were not prepared for our move (we asked a few times before our date if they want to see our house and what needs to be moved upfront, but they kept saying they don't need to see it) and it took them too long.\nThe only positive I have to say is that they were super nice!, unfortunately this is not what we needed, we needed good movers..\n\nUpdate:\nSo the owner is claiming this is a fake review..?, so I'm attaching a picture of their truck loading our stuff in our driveway. If you zoom to the left you can see that it says In&Out (the picture was taken to send to our family when we moved, not for putting here, so it didn't capture the name properly, but it is easily seen and the owner can also recognize his license plate on the top left)
