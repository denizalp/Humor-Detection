Certo, I am an Italian food snob. But you can't just crush the decor execution and then misdeliver on the food! C'mon Prado, you're better than that.\n\nI dined on the gnocchi which was really overpriced and super bland. Granted I studied abroad in Florence and have high expectations on gnocchi but plz. True italian Gnocchi is al dente :)
