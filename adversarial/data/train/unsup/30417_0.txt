Went after a convention with a few friends.  We stayed at the Palazzo so it was convenient.  We had so many dishes family  style serving, too many to name.  Server was attentive, explained every detail of each entree, we finished with the Sushi and was pretty disappointed.  Everything else was really good.  The sushi was very bland, I would go back and skip the sushi.  The sushi should be better respect ally having the word \"sushi\" in he restaurant name.
