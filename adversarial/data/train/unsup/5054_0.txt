This has been a bookmarked place for over a year and I finally got around to trying Elements last night.  I had an early show on the Strip, so we went a 4 PM when they satarted dinner service.  I had made a reservation using their website and our table with menus was waiting when we arrived.  Our server was Mimi and she soon brought us iced teas as we studied the menu.  Bread service came quickly and there were three choices.  I did have to ask for butter.\n\nI ordered Jakarta chicken for myself and my wife ordered the vegetable pasta. We started with a bowl of tomato basil soup that was very tasty.  The tomato was very rich and had a flavor that was unlike most tomato soups.  I would go back for some more soup.\n\nOur main courses were quite nice.  They looked like small servings but that was deceiving.  The plates were quite large and somewhat deep so there appeared to be less food than there really was.  My Jakarta chicken was excellent.  Chicken with seasonal vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce with a nice tangy spiciness.  Perfect!  My wife enjoyed her vegetable pasta.  Mushrooms and yellow and green saut√©ed squash in a sun dried tomato-white wine sauce.  She didn't finish all her pasta so there was room for dessert.\n\nThe options for dessert were limited.  I opted for the carrot cake and my wife got the chocolate brownie cheesecake.  Standard desserts but very good and a nice way to end the meal.\n\nAnother Groupon successfully used and a fine meal.
