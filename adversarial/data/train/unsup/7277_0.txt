Saturday is Happy Hour day at Sam's Café. \nHappy because we hadn't been there in a while and happy because Sam's has improved since the last time we were there:)\nI say \"judge slowly\" and \"give people a second chance\" and \"a stitch in time, saves nine\" and all kinds of other inappropriate adages...but my point is that sometimes a second chance is in order.\nSam's Café had been in the rotation for a few years and then we had a couple of poor experiences there, and just didn't go back...you know how it is...there's a lot of competition for the dining dollar (it used to be \"dollars\" but the recession\/depression has hit everyone!).\nBut, this isn't about then...it's about now, so let's get up to date, shall we?\nThe Beautiful Carin and I headed for the club last Saturday to sweat off the weeks caloric build up and sweat it off we did! (you know, I think I sweat so much because I come from ice age survivor stock and here I am trying to live in the desert!).\nAnyway, after we finished our extremely grueling, yet fulfilling programs of physical exercise, got ourselves all cleaned up, (lookin' good and smellin' sweet) we were talking between ourselves (as married people often do) and trying to figure how to reward ourselves for the excellent workouts we had just finished.\nHow about a nice big lunch?\nSam's Café has Happy Hours on Saturday's and Sunday's that run from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm. \nWell, that's just inspired!\nWe tottered in and sat at the bar (I think that's going to be a defining happy hour \"move\" for us), and the barman greeted us with a warmth and enthusiasm normally reserved for long lost play cousins...a good start:)\nWe looked at the happy hour menu and they have some nice selections for really good prices.\nWe ordered roast pork sliders with a chipotle barbecue sauce, Carin's  \"go-to\" selection...grilled chicken nacho's and Sedona Spring Rolls (also served with the chipotle barbecue sauce and pico de gallo).\nWhile were waiting for the food to arrive, Sam's minions brought us more food...chips and salsa. \nNow, I don't want anyone to think Sam's is mexcian food...it's not. The whole place is more \"southwest inspired\" as opposed to \"southwest\", or \"Mexican\" or \"authentic\". \nThey have décor that looks sort of Fredrick Remington meets Javier Sordo Madaleno...nice, southwest-ish\/modern. The chairs in the dining room are, frankly, less than comfortable but they fit the décor, so, OK. Just don't complain to me when they make your butt sore after 20 minutes!\nBack to the chips and salsa...I like the flour tortilla chips that Sam's serves, as well as the blue corn and sweet potato chips and the salsa is decent as well...very tomatoey, but spicy and flavorful, but it's not Mexican...not for everybody, but we were happy:)\nThe actual food portion of our lunch came before we became completely engorged with the chips portion. Everything was very tasty. \nThe pork roast sliders were truly delightful...moist, seasoned perfectly on soft warm rolls:) (BTW, I'm reasonably certain that you can't get swine flu from eating pork roast, but I will say that the roast pork sliders \"flew\" off the plate:) . The Sedona Spring Rolls have plenty of spice and heat, and are also very nice.\nAll in all, a very solid Happy Hour offering for $18 and change (before tip).\nGo, sit at the bar (always better service and your butt will thank me), and enjoy Sam's Happy Hour!
