Worse place ever!!! The music was so loud, I couldn't hear the guy talk. I asked him several times to turn it down and he ignored me.  The other seller was on a personal call, talking about her kids not being on drugs. She also heavily wreaked of cigarettes.  Terrible if you want, all around, good customer service.
