While this place seems to have pretty good reviews, my experienced dovetailed the negative ones I've seen here, in that they simply can't communicate with customers effectively. \n\nI called this place and tried to get information about mobile detailing, but could only get some vague insights about what they offered. No pricing and no time table though, which I found odd. When it came to scheduling, I was told I had to wait for a call back from the scheduler. I figured it wouldn't be long, so I indulged them. In a nutshell, like many others have stated, there was no call back. \n\nI ended up calling them, towards the end of the day, only to find I was still \"in the queue\" for a call back from the scheduling folks. When people claimed that you needed to beg these folks for an appointment, I figured it was an exaggeration, but it turned out to be pretty accurate. Based on their poor communication and inability to even attempt scheduling an appointment for me even after multiple calls, I ended up giving my business to someone else.\n\nIf you're so busy that you can't even set up an appointment when I call you, can't call me back to set one up, and when I call a second time you still can't schedule me, that's just a piss poor way to run a business.
