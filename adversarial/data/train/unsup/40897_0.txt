Pretty rad store. I only feed my dog 5 star+ foods, and this place definitely has the best selection of top notch foods I've ever seen. Incredible variety, lots of stuff I've never seen before. I'm partial to Wellness foods, and their prices on Core bags is ~$10 less than anywhere else I've bought it from (makes you think about places that offer free food loyalty programs when they just jack up the price of the bags). Massive selection of Merrick canned foods, too. \n\nLots of great treats, chew toys and stuff in general. Always find something new and interesting to give my dog, and the prices are great. \n\nStaff is friendly and store is clean. Also looks like they donate a TON of quality food to animal shelters (saw 3-4 pallets of damaged bags waiting to be picked up last time I went), which is great to see, especially from a small business. \n\nI have no reason to go to chain stores for pet needs ever again: this place has it all...
