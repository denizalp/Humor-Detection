AMAZINGGGGGG! I called Keith and he was able to help schedule the appointment on a short notice for us. We met with Melissa (the Tech) and we asked her not to tell us what the gender is because we wanted a surprise for our gender reveal party! She told us when to open and close our eyes and it was so exciting!!! She was so friendly and luckily she was able to find it! Then we unexpectedly received 2 goodie bags one of which was baby formula! Very thoughtful and she gave us the 3D ultra sound pictures along with a CD of the pictures. Finally a Red envelope that contains the gender of our babe in which I gave to my brother to help surprise us with the \"Balloon popping\" Gender reveal party! THANK GOD we popped it and blue confetti came out! ITS A BOY!!!!! we went crazy!!! Thank you so much Miracle View Ultrasound, we will be back and send you so much referrals!!
