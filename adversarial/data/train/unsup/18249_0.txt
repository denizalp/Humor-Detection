Update:  Never again!  I always try to give this place a second, third, and fourth chance, but never again!\n\nWe went there last night and were served by Kristy.  We weren't even sitting for a minute and she pretty much demanded our ENTIRE ORDER!  Hardly looked at the menu.  The table was still dirty.  Kristy was more interested in sitting down and talking with some guy at another table, than serving customers during dinner rush.  The food was fine, but another server had to bring out the food, because she was too busy chatting it up with the guy two tables away.  She was very rude not only to us, but also was saying rude things about other tables at the drink fountains, probably loud enough for them to hear, too!  She threw the check on the table without asking if we wanted any dessert.  I like to take a piece of cheesecake home, but evidently it wasn't meant to be.\n\nHonestly, I used to think the bad service was always a one off, but not anymore.  They have been consistently rude to us every time we come in.\n\nPlus, I think they put something in the food.  I live less than a mile away, and by the time I get home, I am almost ready to shit my pants EVERY TIME I GO THERE!!!!!\n\nSo, we won't be coming here anymore.  Everyone in Moon loves this place, but I think it is terrible!  Either I'm a snob or everyone in Moon has no sense of taste!
