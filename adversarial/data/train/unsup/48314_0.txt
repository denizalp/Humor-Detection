I am officially in LOVE! We went here for my friend's birthday - just three of us - and had the best time. You pick 2-3 tapas per person and just share away. We had our server pair wine with each course, and he was spot on!!!! Pinot paired with the blackberry spinach salad and hummus, a lovely cab paired with three amazing pizzas...and the sparkling ros√© was perfectly matched with the wonderful desserts we ordered...mmmm...I almost fainted from the pure ecstasy that is their risotto.\n\nDecently priced and a great atmosphere :) we were extremely pleased.  Can't wait to come here again and again!\n\nBtdubs, Sean (spelling?), our server, was the best!! Accommodating, knowledgeable, and so nice!!!! \n\nA great dining experience!!!
