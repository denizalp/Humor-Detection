The eclectic crowd and positive vibe of this bar make it a must stop for locals and visitors.\n\nMake no mistake though, this is a gay man's country bar.  They cater to country music fans, then late night crowds when the cowboys fizzle out.  I've had a lot of people tell me, and I agree, they play the best Country music of any gay OR straight bar in town.  Usually the higher energy stuff.  If you can't handle country music, the bar is almost always high-energy dance after midnight and has after-hours till 4am Fri \/ Sat nights.  \n\nPARKING\nThe parking lot is newly paved & monitored under video surveillance 24\/7.  Security walks the parking lot at night during business hours.  In many years of going here, I've never had any problems with any of my vehicles being broken into.\n\nDRINKS \/ BARTENDERS\nThis is a drinking man's bar.  Most of the bartenders like watching people get drunk as long as they can keep it under control.  To accomplish this, the drinks are usually strong but being friendly, polite, and tipping decently usually goes a long way.  Leaving a $2 tip for $20 in shots\/drinks will surely get you a weak pour the next round.  I've found that if you're nice and respectful to the bartenders here, they will make you feel like a High-Roller.\n\nDANCE FLOOR\nThe dance floor is relatively small for a country bar this size.  That means if a line dance song comes on and you don't know the dance, the DJ will remind you to get off the dance floor so you're not in the way.  When the dance music starts, the tight dance floor makes for a fun, uninhibited evening that is even more fun if the bartenders did their job.  [wink, wink]\n\nPURSES\nThis is a semi-dive bar and can attract the usual dive-bar antics. Purses are limited to the size of a typical bank cash bag to keep people from sneaking in their own booze or anything else you shouldn't have in a bar.  The manager knows the door guy is doing his job when he doesn't see any medium\/large purses in the bar.  The door guy wants his job so it won't do you any good to argue with him.  Also, nobody wants your huge purse banging against them all night - please leave that diaper bag in Scottsdale.
