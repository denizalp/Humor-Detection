We stopped here for a quick bite to eat before playing slots. The pizza here is just OK. Nothing too special, then again I usually just get plain cheese pizza.  Besides pizza, they also have pasta and salad which looked okay.\n\nI recommend coming here for something quick and simple before catching a movie downstairs or before you sit at the poker table.
