I arrived in Phoenix a little after lunchtime last Tuesday afternoon and with a nod of approval from my mom, headed directly for FEZ. I didn't really care much what was on the menu because I mainly wanted to go to finally meet Thomas S. who has been a Yelp \"friend\" of mine and is now a FB friend as well. \n\nThe restaurant wasn't terribly busy because it was after 1, and the first thing I got a kick out of was the eclectic music mix that ran throughout the restaurant. I found myself singing along a little too much and luckily, my mom is used to that so it was no big deal. \n\nShe ordered the lamb kisra and a decaf coffee. I had the burger (without a bunch of stuff because I am picky like that) and a diet coke. The kisra was fabulous-different than anything either of us had ever had, and wonderful. My burger was good, but the kisra took the prize. \n\nService was friendly, Thomas a doll and I am really glad I had an opportunity to check this place out. Central Ave. has changed a hell of a lot since I moved back to the Bay Area 6 years ago, and with additions like this place, it has been for the better.
