Our first visit here was New Years Eve and the place was packed. For me, the whole teppanyaki experience is dated and often times overpriced. The soup( broth) and the salad are a waste of time but the rest of the meal was very good. The portions were bigger than i expected and the fried rice was tastey. We steered clear of alcohol and  seafood and the bill was reasonable at around 50 bucks with tip.\nSeafood and drinks...? You can drop a hundy.\nI'll have to see if they have a sushi happy hour. Good experience overall and the staff were on their game.
