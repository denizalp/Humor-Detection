I had some work done there before and I remembered it was a bad experience but couldn't remember why. I left my car there on a Saturday with Mike promising to call me Monday or Tuesday. I called Wednesday and was told they didn't know what was wrong yet but they would call me later in the day. It was pretty cut-and-dry from the beginning what was wrong with my car 2 more days went by without a phone call which made a total of a week finally I went down there and was told that it was done and that they had left me a voicemail which was a lie. I was also told that it wouldn't cost more than a certain amount and of course it went over that. I found them to be extremely unprofessional.
