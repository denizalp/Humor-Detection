Stopped here with a group of friends for drinks after dinner on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy, but they have plenty of tables including some low tables with couches for a more intimate vibe. \n\nThe beer selection was decent, and they also offer flights if you want to try a few different kinds. As far as other drinks they were limited on cocktails so if that's what you're looking for you might want to go elsewhere. However they did have a good variety of wines. \n\nOverall the atmosphere here is pretty chill. Nothing fancy, but a great place to chill and relax.
