The subs, cooked in an artery-clogging, greasy-spoon-style, are fantastic. These aren't Subway subs \"with 9 grams of fat or less\". They are prepared with only one thing in mind - instant gastronomic gratification - and on this front US Subs delivers. Supposedly they serve salads as well, but of you get a salad here you are really missing the point.\n\nPut the diet on hold for a few hours - consequences be damned! You won't regret it.
