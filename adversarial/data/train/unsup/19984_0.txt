This is the \"Real Deal Holyfield\" of Custom burgers period. Don't waste your time trying to decide(ie, BLT, LBS, Smashburger......RU Kidding Me???????)\n\nHe has a great selection of beers and milkshakes to go with your custom burger as well... My last Creation was the kobe burger medium rare of course, on a toasted onion bun, caramelized onions,\ncrumbled blue cheese, applewood smoked bacon and a fried egg....and as always a side of his Black Truffle Sauce to enjoy with each and every bite. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Unless you Really wanna splurge, go for his Rossini burger with Foie Gras and Black Truffles(maybe one day......)\n\nOnion rings and sweet Potato Fries make a good compliment to the bugers as well....Trust me, if you want a good burger, this is where you want to go....ALOHA!!!
