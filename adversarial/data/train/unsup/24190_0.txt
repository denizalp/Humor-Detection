Groovy concept, flawless service, nice variety, really cool drinks.\n\nGet the plum soda. It's a small glass of some plum wine that'll knock your socks off, with a splash of club soda, and an \"ume\", some sort of small Eastern plum at the bottom. There are tons of sake based beverages, beer mixed with grapefruit juice or calpico (google it, n00bs), and some cool non-alcoholic beverages.\n\nThen, there's the sushi. More than reasonable pricing for the location and decor. I was feeling awfully Arizonan that day, so I ordered the \"baja norte\" just to be brave and try a fun, albeit bastardization of sushi. Spicy yellowtail was actually spicy! Yay! It was just a *little* too salty, however. It was still a steal, and there are still a couple dozen other options if you're pretentious about experimental rolls like yours truly.\n\nApparently there's a ton of stuff here I need to try, and fortunately I can do just that without breaking the bank! Take a little detour from the light rail area and give Cherry Blossom a chance.
