We had a great time at this place - the staff was so friendly and fun to talk with. They make slices to order, with a nice variety of toppings, that made my kids happy. Husband ordered the gyros and said they were fabulous. I loved their salad dressings (Greek vinaigrette and balsamic vinaigrette) and the hummus and tzatziki were full of flavor. Although I'm not usually a fan of cannoli, their version grew on me quickly and I ended up eating the entire thing. Highly recommend this place - it's a little neighborhood gem!
