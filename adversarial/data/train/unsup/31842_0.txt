My wife and I ordered a pizza and chicken fingers. It was the worst pizza I have ever had. The dough was dry and it just didn't taste fresh. I honestly would have rather had a frozen pizza. I thought the chicken fingers would be safe since they are hard to screw up but they were very rubbery and hard to eat. I do not know if we just were unlucky or if it is always like this but I won't trying it again.
