I lived at the Met for 2 years and it has been a very positive experience. The studios are a bit different than the 1BR and 2BR. They have real hardwood floors, lofted ceilings, and new appliances. You have a huge closet and large windows as well. The Met fixed any problems I had quickly (only 1 A\/C issue in 2 years), and the studios come with a garage which is nice for storage and keeping your car out of the sun. Reasonable electric bill as well ($95\/mo average over 20 months leaving it at 85\/65 during the day pending on season). I had guests over many times. I got a pass most of the time and on less busy nights didn't even bother, never had a car get towed. Tons of street parking for $1.50\/hr til 10p outside as well. Studios also share no walls so don't have to worry about noise or being noisy.\n\nOther reviews mention pets...they don't allow dogs. The birds above parking are legit but they do their best with some spray thing. I never used the pool but it's always clean, the chairs are kinda run down. The gym is tiny. I never saw a homeless person in here, nor did I ever have to bother with one outside the area. It's downtown phoenix...there will be some around. Ignore them.\n\nI can't comment on noise in the main area. There aren't that many people under 20 living here so I can't image a huge \"dorm\" scene.
