I am surprised at all the 5 star reviews.  Café Monarch is mediocre for the expense.\n\nMy boyfriend surprised me for my 40th birthday with a dinner at Café Monarch.  We were impressed with the restaurant concept, high end, delectable fare, operated as a one-man show.  \n\nThe starter white bean soup was bland and the main meal was very, very spicy.  It took about 3 hours to get through only three courses; it was BYOB unfortunately the owner\/chef charged us a corking fee. \n\nWe were not able to choose what we wanted for dinner, we only noted any food allergies we may have had and the chef prepared surprise spicy beef dishes.\n\nWhen making the reservation, the owner\/chef\/waiter offered to make a special birthday treat and asked my boyfriend what my favorite dessert was.  He told him that \nI love cupcakes and Chef said he would make them for us.  At the end of our meal, he informed us that he had sold all of my cupcakes.  That was absolutely, positively, 100% unacceptable.\n\nI do understand why it took so long to prepare and serve the meals, but just that he sold out all of my birthday cupcakes, not even just saving one for the birthday girl, was disappointing.\n\nUnfortunately, I will not visit Café Monarch again.
