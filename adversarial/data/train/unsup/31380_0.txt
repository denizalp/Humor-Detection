Cute little spot in the Grand Canal Shoppes - authentic Indian food with great flavor, good quantity and decent price. They even have Limca, Thumbs Up, and Mazaa. Highly recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Chicken Korma, and their uttapam. They even have traditional Indian \"chai\" which we loved. \n\nTook a star away because both days we went, one of the items we wanted happened to be out\/unavailable.
