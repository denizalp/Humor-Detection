Hubby and I checked this place out a couple weeks ago and had a wonderful time! While the sever we started with wasn't great, the one that we ended with was perfectly fine. \n\nBut more importantly, we found some great food here. My favorite was definitely the BBQ at the meat station. There were ribs and brisket. The tibs were huge and both items were tender and had great flavor! I never expect to find decent quality BBQ at any buffet. But they did an awesome job! The only downside - by the time I went back for seconds, no more ribs. \n\nWhile I think the desert station would profit from scooped ice cream instead of just soft serve, there were other treats that were quite impressive. My favorite was a mini waffle bowl with a layer of Nutella covered with rich white chocolate mousse!
