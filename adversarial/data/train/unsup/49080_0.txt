I went last week and was very disappointed. The reviews were very good so I was expecting better. The service is very very slow. I had the pasta with seafood and the pasta was way undercooked. I like it al dente but this was very undercooked. All the seafood was overcooked, the shrimp was very tough and the calamari was so tough I had to put it aside.
