If you are like me and you get an overwhelming feeling of sadness every time you think about Terroni's delivering and realize that this can never be....  then this is the solution for you. \n\nWe ordered FBI last night for delivery. We ordered the Thin crust Big Pizza (they have two sizes.. Big and Bigger... If it's just two of you Big is definitely enough.. 8 slices!) with Panchetta, pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives (they were whole olives... pitted and amazing). I highly recommend getting the hot pepper dip.. (it's more of a hot pepper paste similar to Terroni's hot peppers).. Let's just say.. this was THE BEST pizza that has ever been delivered to my door. \n\nThe price is right, the man I spoke to on the phone was helpful and lovely and the pizza... I honestly can't say enough good things about it... \n\nThe only draw back to getting this place to deliver to you is if it's during a busy time, they may not be able to deliver to you depending on your location... but hey, who doesn't like a 1am pizza?
