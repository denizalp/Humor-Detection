I visited this contemporary upscale outdoor shopping mall yesterday for the first time after meeting Santa @ Scottsdale Quarter right across the street ;)  It was a perfectly cloudy day with not a wisp of wind or a drop of rain (big surprise!) which made it really nice to walk around.  Since it was Small Business Day, i looked in at the little shops (and avoided the big-names).  The grounds were clean.  The people and staff were polite.  A decent place to visit as well as entertaining your out-of-town folks\/friends during the cooler months.  I may definitely come back at another date when I get more time as there is alot more to see :)
