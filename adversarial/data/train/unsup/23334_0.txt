FOOD PORN ALERT!!!! \n\nCharlie Palmers is one of my favorites! But even more so when you can score on a great Cut of the Week menu\/price. Now top that off with the luxury of being located in the Four Seasons and impeccable service. Life is good!\n\nBeen here many times over the years. First heard about it at a local wine store by a sommelier who was praising it. So here is the deal.... Every week this upscale restaurant features it's \"Cut of the Week\" which is a changing prix fixe menu featuring an upscale salad, entree with sides, dessert and.... Can we have a drum roll please... BOTTOMLESS WINE paired for the meal. Oh it gets better! All of this is only $59. I don't think I could get dinner and drinks at Outback for this amount of money. And I'm not hating on Outback by any means! It's just not the Four Seasons.\n\nSo tonight we came for my friend's birthday. He said he wanted steak and I checked this week's menu and it looked amazing! Now I will say we ordered extra appetizers and were not disappointed. Burrata with poached pears... Amazing! Oxtail ravioli... Delish! Now for the main event... Prix fixe mennu started with this awesome fall salad consisting of greens, roasted persimmon, pomegranate and goat cheese. Next course was a juicy bone in New York with black garlic butter. Sides were pancetta potatoes and rainbow chard. Now the dessert... Warm white chocolate blondie with a pretzel crisp and stout ice cream! Lord have mercy!!!\n\nThe service was amazing as well! Most memorable was our awesome sommelier. Didn't quite catch his name. I think it was either Jaime or James. He was friendly, down to earth and helpful without making us feel dumb. \n\nSuch a great experience! I recommend often to others but I have to remember to take myself more often!!!
