Definitely my go-to Korean option. Here's the lowdown: ~\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ Quality, authentic Korean food\n+ Generous portions\n+ Fair pricing\n+ Amazing vegetarian options\n+ Complimentary barley tea (when dining in)\n+ Bottomless side dishes with certain entrees\n+ Super cute interior\n\nTHE BAD: \n- Service can be hit or miss\n(While they're always generally friendly, it can be really slow sometimes) \n\n\nI RECOMMEND:\nThe cheese corn and fried rice cakes to start. While the corn is covered in gooey, cheesy, creamy goodness, the fried rice cakes come skewered, crispy and fried to perfection. It also comes coated in a delicious savory sauce with a great kick. \n\nFor the main dish, I recommend the veggie bi bim bap topped with fish eggs. It comes sizzling hot in a stone bowl with veggies, shiitake mushroom, kimchi, and infused with sesame oil. If you want something more substantial, my boyfriend swears by the garlicky marbled beef which comes with a heaping side salad that's both delicious and addictive.\n\n\nOverall, an amazing Korean option if you're super hungry and in the area ~
