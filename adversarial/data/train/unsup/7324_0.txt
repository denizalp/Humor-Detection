Sorely disappointed in this place. I had this place bookmarked ever since moving to Vegas nine months ago. We were in the area and my friend recommended we go here so I figured I could unbookmark it from my list. We ordered the salmon tartar, agedashi tofu, sausage, chicken tender skewers, chicken and green onion skewers, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon skewers, pork belly skewers, and grilled mackerel--all of which were very disappointing. The skewers all tasted of char. I could taste the grill and that was it. The chicken meat was dry. The kitchen used the same teriyaki sauce for all the skewers and was quite stingy with it. I couldn't even moisten my dry meat with anything besides force feeding myself and washing it down with green tea. The grilled mackerel was tough and dry as well. \n\nBe sure to double check your receipt when they bring you the check. It's easy to lose track of what you ordered since small plates can easily add up. A neat trick is to count the number of plates you ordered instead of remembering the names of the plates. I'm glad I did because they tried to charge us for alcohol that we didn't order. After correcting the mistake, we asked the lady to split the bill down the middle with two cards. She couldn't even do that! Our server overcharged me! So that was her tip. She either really wanted the extra couple bucks or was just having a rough night. Sorry, but I won't be returning.
