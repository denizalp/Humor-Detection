There should be a new and kinder definition of \"butter-face\" meaning: person stuffing their face with delicious Butter Avenue macarons.\n\nAt $2.25 a pop, they aren't the cheapest way to get a dessert fix but worth it.\nI didn't want just one macaron...so, I bought myself 6 of them for $13.50.\n\nThe owners are brother and sister and they did a great job of making you feel welcome.  Unlike some other patisseries...\n\nThere were standard flavours and some fun tea ones as well such as matcha and Earl Grey.  I tried the dark chocolate, passion fruit, but the salted caramel was my favourite!\n\nEach macaron was absolutely perfect.  \nCrispy and delicate on the outside but still moist and chewy.\nThe filling was smooth and you could really taste the different flavours.\n\nNext time I'm in the area, I'll swing by... maybe after grabbing grub at Burger Priest down the street.
