Wow where do i begin?!?! Admission fee $10 drink $10 wings $7 music was basic DJ was basic this place is NOT upscale and NOT for business professional working people. Ladies You can wear t shirts leggings, tennis shoes, basketball ball shoes, flats, bedroom shoes, flip flops , shorts maxi dresses. The quality of women here is either on section 8 housing or waiting list for section 8 housing. The quality of men here is either felon or on probation type men. I did not see a single man in a custom made suit, dressy clothes, nice watch. The men wear t shirts and jean 5 times times to big and stand on the dance floor with a beer in one hand and liquor in the other. I wasted a classy outfit on coming here. I only stayed 1 hour and it was torture.  I felt out of place here. Definitely not my cup of tea.
