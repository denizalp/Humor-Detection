Donuts are big, light, and fluffy. Very good! In comparison to Krispy Kreme they're bigger. If I had to choose between the other local donut shop Dutch Donuts I would choose Cravin' Donuts every time hands down. I have yet to try there boba or coffee. I believe I paid around $9 for a dozen and that included 2 of their specialty (fancy) donuts that cost a $1 more.
