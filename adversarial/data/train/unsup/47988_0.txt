You get what you paid for haha. The lady that came in was incredibly rude--horrid HORRID attitude. She wasn't willing to listen to instructions or how we wanted things done. She also did a poor job for the most part--just did a bit of cursory dusting on some surfaces. I'd NEVER use their services again. You're better off either just doing the job yourself OR putting in more money and hiring a company with  professional and pleasant cleaners who know to treat people with respect. Dismal customer service.
