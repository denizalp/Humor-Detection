Seriously...listen to Yelp!!! I read all the reviews and still chose to order from them. I got the antipasto and a turkey sub. Which was $19 and took over an hour to deliver. The salad was basically a pile of shredded lunch meet and lettuce...I couldn't even eat it. As for the sandwich with \"fresh baked bread\" it didn't have the stuff I asked for on it. I had to add my own mustard\/mayo and they put GREEN olives on my sandwich?!?! The bread was hard and NOT fresh baked...maybe 2-3 days ago, which I for one do not consider fresh. The delivery man was seriously weird!! He rang the door bell a whole bunch of times repeatedly. Then he just like lingered and I seriously wondered for a minute if he was going to try and charge his way into my house or something. Won't be going back and I hope anyone reading this doesn't  go either!!
