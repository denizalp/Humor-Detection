It is a good range of jewellery for everyone. I love that you can see people working in the back!!!\n\nIt is all well displayed, delicate and more modern, geometric pieces, and I was thrilled with how pretty everything was.\n\nI've never been to a class, but I wanted to buy almost every necklace in that store.
