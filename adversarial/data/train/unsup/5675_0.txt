What a surprise! I was here for a night for an appointment the following day and I needed a quick place to eat that would deliver to my hotel. Donatos was recommended to me from the pamphlet in my room. A quick glance at their menu and it seemed like a typical pizzeria. But no... Upon delivery of my food, a pepperoni zinger personal pan, it looked scrumptious. The smell completely sent my olfactory system into overdrive and my stomach started speaking in grumbles. \n\nThe golden brown crust had a warm crispy outer crust with a nice soft inside. There was just enough cheese that was browned and stringy with out being too rubbery. The pepperoni had a nice crunch and had an excellent spicy flavor. The pizza sauce for this particular pizza was incredible and should be included on all their pizzas. It had an additional zing of pepper and added that necessary bite. \n\nDeliver was prompt. They said 30 minutes and it came within 25 minutes. There was no waiting on the phone for the next available person unlike other pizzerias. \n\nI want to eat here again, I just need a reason to be back in Cuyahoga Falls.
