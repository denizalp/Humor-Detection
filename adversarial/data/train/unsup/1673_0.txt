$7 for a small Styrofoam bowl of bland white mush atop rice.  Can you tell I am less than thrilled and my negativity only grows with my hunger just 2 hours after my \"meal.\"\n\nIt was another food truck Friday in down town Phoenix, the number of trucks grew since last year and Hey Joe was one the new ones to me.  From glazing at the menu the only veggie option was the Vegan Mungo for $7 so I went for it.  It came in a small white Styrofoam bowl, looking anemic, like babaganoush with a few leaves of spinach.  I was hoping for more flavor, but it was not there. The texture was like a Indian lentil dish.\n\nWhy was this $7 it should have been 3.50 at most. Sure it came from a truck with modern graphics on it, this does not mean it is instantly gold. Trucks may be trendy but so far the food quality has yet to impress me.
