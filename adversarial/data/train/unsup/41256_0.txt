Man!!! What a store!! I basically live in Vegas and I cannot believe I've never been here. This place is not an ordinary store where you can find your gear to go out camping, fishing, or whatever you're into because I felt like I was at a museum at times!! I cannot wait to bring my parents next time we visit Las Vegas. The bf and I were not able to finish looking around the first floor let alone go upstairs to the second one because we were in a rush. So next time this will be the first place we visit on our next Vegas trip!
