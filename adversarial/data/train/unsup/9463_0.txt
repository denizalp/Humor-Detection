The BF regularly orders from here when he's at work. I get leftovers when he overorders- which isn't all that often, actually. The thai jerky and the crab fried rice are consistently good options, but I especially like combining the two. The dipping sauce for the jerky is awesome! They do have a $20 minimum for delivery.
