Was intrigued by the homemade parmesan garlic chips and wanted to give them a try to use as a gauge for whether I would order anything else.  Big mistake.  For $7, all I got was a small tray of very burnt chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and garlic salt.  And I'm not talking about just a few burnt ones here and there -- I would say literally 99% of the entire order was what most customers would described as burned.  Perhaps if the amount of chips had been twice as large or the price closer to $4, I would not have felt as ripped off.  At the prices this place charges, you expect some superior quality.   \n\nAs much as I'm all for helping out the small restaurant owner, this small thing really did leave a horrible first impression.  If I had looked at the chips before I left, I would've probably sent them back, but it was a to go order and I didn't really look at them until I was half-way home.  Oh well.  Needless to say, I won't be returning.
