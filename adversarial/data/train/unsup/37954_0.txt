I highly recommend Dr. Stickland, but there is a good chance in an emergency or unexpected need to visit, you get Dr. Durig and she is awful. Her bedside manner is very bad and I want nothing to do with any encounter with her again. \n\nTheir staff gave me advice that turned out to be detrimental to my dog, and caused additional money to have to be spent at their office. Their misinformation cost me an additional $350 and my dog a lot of trauma. Dr. Durig then had an attitude with me for being upset that their staff was a direct cause of the event. \n\nI think it would be in Dr. Stickland's best interest to separate from Dr. Durig.
