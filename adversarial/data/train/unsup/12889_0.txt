You know I don't write many reviews but Thai Spa deserves one this is my second visit here I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. They live up to the hype. Clean, friendly, professional. \n\nI recommend you ask for Anna when you call for appointment. I have a rotator cuff injury which I was impressed she knew about before I told her. I actually think she made it better.
