This liquor store is tucked away behind some trees, so if you're coming down WT Harris and din't know what to look for you could drive right past it! The store isn't huge but has a good selection of anything you could want. The prices are reasonable and they do some specials once in a while on certain items for the month. The staff working here have always been friendly and helpful when needed. \n\nThe last time I went here they were doing a little bit of remodeling - not sure why - all you need is shelves (check) and liquor on said shelves (check).
