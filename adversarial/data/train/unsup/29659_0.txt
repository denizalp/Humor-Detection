Service, food and atmosphere were all on point!  I was delightfully surprised to find this gem in the SLS casino. The servers handled our group of 60 with grace and apparent ease, no small task! Their gluten-free selection was impressive, and they made sure to inform the kitchen of my needs. I was impressed with the hangar steak, roasted Brussels sprouts, and the chicken tangine (although I would question if a real tangine is used). I would definitely return next time I'm visiting LV.
