I fell in love with this place when I lived in Ohio. I am so happy there is one in Charlotte, so when I visit, I can indulge.\n\nBasically, this is the most fabulous ice cream you will ever eat.  You cannot go wrong with any of the flavors. \n\nI like to do the mini trio and go all the way!\n\nNames with words like Butter, Gooey, Sweet Cream, Goat Cheese...  and freshly made waffle cones too! \n\nThis place gives me life!  Treat Yo-self at Jeni's!
