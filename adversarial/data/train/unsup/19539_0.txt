Love the dark roast coffee they offer. Good flavor. My one complaint is that when I order my coffee hot, it's usually warm. I prefer hot over warm. I do like that they offer sugar free flavors that don't have artificial sweeteners in them. It's almost like an extract of flavor. Nice. And they offer quite a selection of flavors. Yay\nAs far as the donuts, I wouldn't know. I am hoping for a day that they offer a gluten free option. That would be nice :)
