My G. I travel leaps and bounds to get to this fine establishment. Every single time. The boy's recommendations? Lemme tell you something,\n\nGROUND. BEEF. TACOS.\n\nYour boy doesn't eat red meat much, but when it's at Border MX it's almost impossible not to. I had 3 of them lil buddaz on my plate with rice & beans accompanied by 2 chips. This experience was ludicrous.\n\nThe chips and guac belong in a tumblr blog. 50k likes on Instagram EASY. No lacking, their chips are to die for and are always finished when your boy gets involved. No contest.\n\nThe churros are that one toy you always wanted as a kid but couldn't get. I had the churros, went home and did WORK on my computer. They know what it is.\n\nAll in all, amazing place and I ain't switchin'. Pimp don't simp I'm out.\n\n- skoolbus russ
