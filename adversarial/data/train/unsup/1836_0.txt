Today, i've just had the worst macchiato i've ever had. i brought it back to the barista asking for a new one. but i was refused and asked where i had the macchiato before. the barista meant that i don't know what macchiato is and the one he made the authentic one. i drank macchiato in italy, france, portugal etc. but it doesn't matter... the macchiato i had today was really bad and the barista was very rude!!
