This place is not closed.  They are still in business.  We had them install 28 windows in our house 3 years ago and the quality of the installation has not held up.\n\nWhile they have come out at various time to address issues, there has been nagging ones that I cannot get resolved:\n\n1) They never did follow through and do a post-installation inspection\n\n2) Never removed the screws the installers put in the base of my windows and caulked the holes; this is a no-no because the screw is a channel for water run off into my wall\n\n3) I have had my bedroom windows re-caulked twice because of major cracking\/separation from the wall and am now doing it a 3rd time; in fact I have several windows with major separation\/cracking and my handy man will be doing the recaulking...inside and outside\n\n4) Never came back and rehung 2 family room windows that were not installed correctly (flush to the wall) and that have leaked twice, majorly, during heavy rainfall.  Both times the windows have had to be recaulked on the outside.  This summer I had an additional window pour water into my house, my single pane windows that were on my house for 15 years never leaked in the amount these 3 windows have\n\nThe owner, Jeff Caruso, was rude to me regarding rehanging my family room windows; he was the one who suggested that it needed to be done...he apparently did not want to do the actual work.\n\nSo steer clear of this company.  The product may be nice, but good windows are useless if the installation is poorly done.
