This review is in no way a reflection of the overall service at this place. Most of the employees are doing a great job. I under that on dollar wednesdays it can get kind of hectic thats fine. But the moby looking dude behind the bar was a completely disrespectful bartender. He told me I never tip last night and that he was going to help someone else. Then he walked away. First of all Moby, I tip every time I get a drink there and anywhere for that matter because I work in food service as well. So this review is for you, your service is horrible. Crack a smile sometime. I've never had any problems at this place, except for when I order from you.
