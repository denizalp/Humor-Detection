Let me start out by saying that I LOVE Dr. Toledo.  He is always kind, attentive and answers any questions I may have.  He has a wonderful bedside manner and I have been a patient for years.  That being said, his staff is horrendous!!!  Whether for a simple referral to a surgeon, or billing, they just cant seem to get it right.  After my hysterectomy and paying EVERYTHING I was asked to pay in full and being told by office staff that I owed nothing, I started receiving collection calls.  These calls were and about an apparently unpaid bill from his office that I had not been billed for.  After calling the office SEVERAL times and getting different responses, (including that I didn't owe the money and they would contact the collection company),  Holly told me that the charge was from 2 Years earlier and that I owed the money and they would not call collections. Holly was rude and disrespectful on the phone and treated me like an idiot. I finally ended up paying the collections company the money to get it taken care of.  SO disorganized!!!  I am sadly, no longer going to this office ONLY because of the staff's incompetence.  Dr. Toledo PLEASE hire a new staff!!!
