This place is so frightening, it's surreal.  As soon as I walked in, I had a bad feeling about it.  \n\nDownstairs, there is something of a concert venue - the night we went it was a goth  metal show.  OK.  So we went upstairs, and there was a carpeted (!!) pub with a very rough looking crowd, and it smelled like a men's hockey changeroom up there.  The bar staff were strangely badly trained - they didn't know how to pull pints, and it was horribly understaffed.  Many people were waiting for drinks.  The music from downstairs was also mixing (upstairs: rock, downstairs: metal)  The effect of the sound and smell and sight was disorienting.  \n\nThen, my friend tried to use what they thought was the bathroom upstairs.  No sirree.  As soon as they walked back there towards the beaded curtain, an old man seated at the back of the pub yelled at her saying, \"YOU!  YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED BACK THERE!  THE BATHROOM IS DOWNSTAIRS!\"  It was like there was something hiding back there - an illegal gambling ring?  A zombie?  The stolen maple syrup from Quebec?  At this rate, who knows!   Later, several others mistakenly went over there, and were similarly yelled at by the old man.  \n\nAlthough nothing unsavoury ended up happening while at the pub (other than yelling from the old man), it really left me feeling uneasy - and I will be certain to avoid it in future....!
