The most relaxing experience of my life! This is by far my favorite spa in Vegas. Here's a quick rundown of my experience:\n\n- Quick check-in at the front of the spa\n- Received a short tour of the facilities by one of the staff members\n- Changed into a bathrobe and plastic slippers, both of which are provided by Qua\n- Enjoyed tea and coffee in the Tea room while waiting for my spa treatment (the lounge chairs are EXTREMELY comfy -- I almost took a nap in there). They also have fruit, pretzels, bottled water, and fruit juices available!\n- I had the Honey\/Cinnamon Vichy treatment with a scalp massage. Oh. My God. It was so incredibly refreshing and relaxing. My skin felt soo smooth afterwards and I smelled like cinnamon for the rest of the day. \n- Relaxed in the Roman baths and heated lounge chairs\n- Dipped into the circular jacuzzi\n- Enjoyed the steam sauna\n- Dried myself off in the dry sauna\n- Relaxed in the Arctic Ice room\n- Ended the day with a shower, which features a rainfall shower head and THREE additional shower heads for your body -- This was amazing. \n- Blow-dried and straightened my hair with HOT TOOLS styling products, which are provided in the vanity area\n\nAfter spending 6 hours here, I didn't want to leave! I have been to several spas in the Vegas area as well as the East Coast, and QUA definitely takes the cake. I've never felt so pampered in my whole life. This place is definitely a treat.
