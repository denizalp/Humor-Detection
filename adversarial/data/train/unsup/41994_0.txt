The friendly staff allowed us to try a few samples before making our decision.  So many good choices on their menu it was hard to choose just one thing. But that's ok because that means we need to come back again soon!  We loved the key lime pie ice cream and mint fudge crunch!  Honestly we loved every sample we tried.  The weather was perfect and they had plenty of seating outside.  My family all agreed that this will be a place we will visit often.
