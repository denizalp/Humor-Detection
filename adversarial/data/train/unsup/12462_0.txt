This is THE PLACE !... FRESH! FRESH! FRESH! That's why we come here when we crave for sushi, sashimi and other cooked dishes.\nAll You Can Eat is our favorite choice and a great value @ 27.00!    Food is served fresh individually as you order. \nMy favorite is Grilled Salmon Collar, cooked perfectly! So is the fresh n tasty smoked whole mackerel, done right.\nOutstanding pork belly and teriyaki beef dishes too.  Delicious soups and salads compliment the dishes perfectly. \nService is above average!
