Amazing amazing amazing. I spend countless hours here while I'm on a business trip and the service is amazing the facility is amazing and they have a onsite director of instruction who gives lessons. His name is Jesse Hughes and he told me that he gives lessons and I told him I was flying out soon but thank you. He offered to look at my swing (I was struggling lol) Then gave me a a short lesson no questions asked no offer of services. Fixed my swing in minutes. If this guy does this for you Tip him! His lessons are $115.00 an hour and will come back to visit him next time. Fun weekend thank you Top Golf and thank you Jesse!
