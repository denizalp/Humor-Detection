Dealing with this hotel is absurdly annoying - I am currently planning an event there for my organization and their sales\/catering team is a nightmare. I've worked with Erinn Good (terrible with customer service and can't spell) and Karen Bannerman who is supposed to be her boss (even worse customer service and couldn't care less about the errors her staff makes) and I am completely regretting using the Westin. Overpriced with frustrating staff!
