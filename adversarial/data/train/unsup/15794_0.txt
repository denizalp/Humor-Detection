Artiste affamee is a neat place. Somehow it was everything and nothing like I was expecting. Blame all the hype on yelp and the fact I have faint memories of the space when it was used as an art gallery. Most importantly the coffee is good, and the space comfy, spacious but still cosy. It feels a lot like hanging out in an artist's lair, that happens to have an espresso bar and laundry mat within it. Which I guess is sort of the point, right? Hanging out with the starving artist?\n\nI like that the hours are extensive unlike many cafes in the area. I could see myself dropping in for an early weekend or evening weekday reading session, it has the right vibe for it with mellow music. It wasn't crowded at all on a weekend morning, which is great for early birds like myself.  As it was it was the perfect relaxing atmosphere for an hour away from my infant, sipping a coffee and reading a book uninterrupted. When I was visiting there was a father and his grade school aged son visiting, and the kid seemed to love checking out all the art on the walls, and exploring the books and crannies. No one seemed phased by him, so note to self although it may not immediately scream kid friendly its a good option when my own son is a little older.
