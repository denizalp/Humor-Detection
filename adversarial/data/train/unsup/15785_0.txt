My daughter picked this for her birthday meal. We had been to a Yelp event here in the past and have been wanting to go back and try it. Boy am I glad she picked this place. We started with the grilled artichoke for an appetizer. WOW! I had no clue how much I would love this. It has truffle oil lemon aioli and was amazing. I didn't want to share but did! For my meal, I had an italian salad with Sopressetta and added chicken. The dressing was light and refreshing and the flavor combination was amazing. I love that it was served on a board like the Charcuteri platters. \n\nOur server was great. She even showed us how eat the artichoke properly. She kept our drinks full, was attentive and answered all my questions. I loved watching the kitchen prepare all the food, and the atmosphere is great, nice and open and bright. Can't wait to go back and I am not sharing my artichoke next time!
