Mancini's has incredible bread! I've previously purchased their bread at Giant Eagle, but this was my first time to visit Mancini's actual store. When serving the knotted bread rolls that evening to friends, I kept getting asked, \"Where is this bread from?!\" \n\nI visited the store around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon and purchased the last two bags of rolls. I also noticed that a lot of other breads were sold out. Make sure to go to Mancini's before noon if you want to purchase a particular item! Though nice that they are successful enough to sell out, I do find it annoying that they are open until mid\/late afternoon but may only have a few different bread options on hand after noon. \n\nI love their products but was not impressed with the person who helped me. She asked me multiple times what I was ordering and became frustrated at me when she misunderstood what I said. Very unprofessional! Hopefully she is not indicative of their entire staff.
