We saw this newer place open a while back and gave it a shot.  It seemed like this place has too much space for what they are trying to do...it is really kind of random.  There are games thrown all around with little keep up.\n\nThe vibe is a mix between D&Bs and a scottsdale nightclub.  We hung out outside on the patio and were able to have a good time taking this place in while hanging out with our group. The beers aren't too bad, they have a nice selection and you get quite the glass.\n\nIf we stumbled in here again I wouldn't be mad, just indifferent, this place is meh.
