Weekday dinner at the Bellagio is THE BEST!  We went to the Rio and the Wynn for dinner and I have to say we REGRET not spending all our nights feasting at the Bellagio!\n\nService was prompt and friendly too!  Our waiter was fabulous!  He got us everything we needed, even a tiny little straw cup with a lid for our daughter.  Can't say that about the other casinos who gave us a HUGE 20 ounce of milk for a 2 year old.  What were they thinking?  \n\nOur waiter wasn't just nice to us.  He was kind and courteous to every table.  He even had regulars that liked him.  So that says something about the people that come here.\n\nMy favorite is the Sea Bass!  So buttery and scrumptious!  The kobe beef was good too.  Didn't even need steak sauce.  The jumbo super size cocktail shrimp are already peeled and ready to eat.  Not like the Rio.  The GIANT crab legs were already SLICED OPENED so I don't have to crack it open and go digging for meat.  They thought of everything at this buffet!  Even their BABY Potato is delicious!  I mean, it's just a potato!  But they made it taste as good as their sea bass!\n\nThe sushi was also super fresh, unlike the Wynn.  I saw people piling on the sushi so it wasn't just me that thought it was good.\n\nI can't wait to come back here again to eat their buffet!  I want to try their breakfast next time because our awesome server said they have made-to-order custom omelets!
