I wouldn't say that my experience was subpar but it wasn't as awesome as other locations\/ franchises in the Phoenix area. The Indian and 75th Baskin Robbins is in a run down neighborhood and it's outside is very rough. It's right by a family dollar and that can automatically mean bad news if it is in a bad part of town. Walking in we were greeted and once we walked up to the counter they asked us if we wanted to try anything or if we ready to order. I did not happen to catch their names but it was an older black man with a thin frame and a young white woman. I am a diabetic so sugar free is what I opt for naturally and I was kind of surprised by only having one sugar free variety (Pineapple Coconut) available.  I said , \"I just won't get anything , I'm fine.\" Then the girl offered me another flavor they had in the back called turtle-something ? And it was very delicious and considerate of her to take care of me. I believe the off putting part of the experience was when I went to pay. I was not told about a 50 cent charge to my debit card until I brought it up. I had just slid my card and accepted to pay and then I said , \" hold on can I cancel ? I didn't see the charge.\" He said , \" no it's too late.\" I walked out feel angry. A \"convenience fee\" are you kidding me ? I'm doing a convenience to you by shopping there. I went back in and the man had the audacity to offer me something else to eat and I said ,\" no just taking a picture so I remember next time.\" Yeah , remember not to come back. I'm glad we have other options in the state I moved to. It's gonna take a while or a huge craving for me to get over this greediness. I can't understand how it can so expensive for a business to have a credit\/debit machine but essentially every other business manages without passing on the cost to the customer. I included the receipt to show you that I supposedly received a small soft serve when in reality the only thing it could be is the fee.
