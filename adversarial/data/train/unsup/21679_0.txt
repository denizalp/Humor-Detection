Sapporo situates in a popular mall, unfortunately, its storefront and entrance are not visible from the busy parking lot.  I only know of its existence because its storefront faces a side street that I use to enter the mall.  I have been curious about how it has survived the disadvantage for so long.\n\nUpon entry, we were welcomed by an ambiance that signified that it was a neighborhood restaurant from older times.  We ordered a sushi set and an udon noodle stir fry.  The sushi were sufficiently fresh.  The sushi set had good fishes selection, including more expensive ingredients such as scallop and salmon roes.  The fish selection set Sapporo apart from the lower tiered sushi joints that served the same selection as the AYCE sushi places.  The udon stir fry was well-portioned.  It was a good choice for sharing.\n\nThe services were good and courteous.\n\nI like Sapporo Sushi.  It doesn't try to earn your money with decoration.  Instead, it focuses on the food quality and on providing good value on food and services.
