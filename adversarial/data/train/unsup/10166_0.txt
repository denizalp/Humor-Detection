Funny story! We were visiting Toronto and were actually intending to go to the 'other' Japanese restaurant next door but mistakenly walked into Kinto by mistake (I'm sure it happens all of the time). Upon realizing that we were in a ramen place instead of a sushi place, we opted to stay. We did not regret this decision. We even came back once more before heading home.\n\nSeriously, I think Kinto has spoiled my expectations for ramen. There are a lot of ramen places in NYC - a lot of very good ones at that. But Kinto raised the bar. The spicy pork with extra pork and egg is my go-to. Delicious and perfectly fiery without the cold spice ball that most just add on top. Also good were the regular and spicy kara-ages and the nice, cold Sapporo drafts. Yummy indeed.\n\nWe'll be sure to stop in again the next time we're in Toronto. I'm excited to try other dishes on the menu.
