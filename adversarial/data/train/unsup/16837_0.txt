A-OK pretty much sums this route up. I'd be giving it a full 5 stars but the rush hour crowd seems to have missed out on the safety-circle lesson from public school.\n \nWTF? The route seems to run frequently during rush hour so I'm not sure why you feel you have to jam onto an insanely crowded car when there's clearly one coming right behind this one. I guess I'm oblivious to the axe murderer chasing you in the financial district clause?\n\nAlso, when you primp your hair with an iron until it has lost the shape and texture of human hair and morphed into a coarse Howard Stern Halloween wig, please be considerate enough to not let it touch my bare arm or the side of my cheek. You have no idea how disturbing that feels.\n\nLike I said, aside from the rush hour crowd, it's a great route.
