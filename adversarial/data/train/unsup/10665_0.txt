I came at around 10PM with some family and my boyfriend. They apparently don't close until much later. I was shocked to find that they had only ONE item available throughout the whole menu: matcha soft serve. \n\nI ended up getting that. The soft serve itself was definitely more bitter tasting, and I guess more bold like in comparison to Tsujiri's soft serve. Tsujiri's matcha soft serve is more mild and subtle. Both are decent, just depends on the strength of matcha you prefer\n\nI was mostly disappointed that they didn't have anything to try other than the ice cream...why do you bother staying open if there's only one item available...? At least to me it doesn't make sense. But hey, what do I know, I know nothing about opening a new business.\n\nI would come back to try their other cakes and items, just to see...that is if it's still available.
