Went in for the aromatherapy line. Found my product, plus a sale candle and checked out. After checkout I saw a gift set of my products for $6 less. When I brought it to the attention of the cashier, she was less than enthused. No comment, no apology, just a refund issued to my card with a curt face. Disappointing customer service.
