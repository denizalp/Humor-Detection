Okay, what did I do wrong people?  I am going against the grain... I didn't like the pizza... Is there a secret to ordering here?\n\nI had to go El Boro with a regular pepperoni and mushroom pizza to please the masses.  Should I have ordered something else?  I admit, I do like Chicago style, deep dish the best, but I've had my share of thin crust that I've dug.  \n\nNow, everyone's really going to hate me... the pizza crust was like cardboard, the cheese was rubbery and there was hardly any sauce on it.  There, I said it.  Sorry!\n\nSo is there something else I should be getting here or did I just come on an off day?  I'm open to suggestions... this place is in my hood and rocks so many of your worlds, what's the secret!?
