Quick & Dirty:  Jimmy would be very disappointed.  Just bad, all around.\n\nLong & Wasted Away:  \n\nIn a past life I worked at a Hard Rock Cafe for a year, so I know about places like this.  They try to capitalize on tourists and nostalgia.  HRC has this down to a science, Margaritaville on the other hand is a disgrace.  \n\nFood:  It's okay.  Burgers, chicken, salads, etc.  Basically nothing memorable.  \n\nDrinks:  Overpriced, watered down, lame.\n\nAtmosphere:  Would've been cool if they had been playing Jimmy Buffet!  We got to hear Nirvana, The Squeeze, Madonna, etc.  I mean, what the hell is that crap?  \n\nService:   AWFUL!  We were there for my Brother-in-law's 40th and were rushed along like it was lunch.  Server was terrible.  \n\nThis was my first time here but my family had been here before and kept saying \"It used to be so cool.\" or \"What happened to this place?\" or \"Why does this place suck such huge elephant balls?\"  \n\nI don't know the answer to any of those questions.  So, I have to ask Jimmy.  \n\nJimmy, if you are reading this by chance, what happened?  Your name is sprayed all over the bosom of this five dollar Mexican hooker of a restaurant.  It's disgusting!  \n\nShould you go here?  Go to Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, or anyplace else if you need to go to a place like this at all.\n\nWould I go here again?  Even if they had my lost salt shaker, I'd just buy a new one elsewhere that wasn't $10!\n\nWhat a pisser,\nSam
