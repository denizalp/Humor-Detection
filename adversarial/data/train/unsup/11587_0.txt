I'm giving this restaurant a 1-star review because of the extremely poor value for the money.  My spouse and I opted for the 3-course menu ($39 pp) on a busy Friday night. It was comprised of salad, spaghetti sauce with sausage and shrimp served over grits, and a chocolate cake dessert.  We washed it all down with a bottle of cab-franc ($33).  The total bill for dinner with tip came to over $135!, and I still had to hit McDonalds on the way home because I was starving after we left.  When I complained that the dessert appeared to be simply a chocolate muffin top drowned in pomegranate sauce and inedible seeds, the manager's solution was to demand that we wait at the table while she fried a donut, which was served under a virtual snowbank of powder sugar. Everything, even the supplemental donut, tasted decidedly mediocre for the price, and the portions were so small that there was barely enough food one person served between the two of us. They didn't even put a scrap of bread on the table!  This restaurant is all about location and ambiance, not food; it's a place to \"be seen\" not to eat!
