Once again based on the reviews, I find that people are more interested in environment than the food.   The environment was very hip and somewhat retro.  The service was great.  The happy hour wine was very good.   The homemade pretzels were good. Everything else was average.  The fondue dish for instance was a 100% velveeta replica that is unbecoming of a restaurant like this and certainly not worthy of being called fondue.  \n\nThe dessert, a hot chocolate cake that they told me was a lava cake was overcooked, had no lava, was barely warm, and was covered with a mountain of standard supermarket whip cream. Denny's wouldn't serve it.  \n\nIn short, if you want a hip place to drink and hang out with friends, this place is for you.   If you are looking for great food and value that above all else, I would probably go elsewhere.
