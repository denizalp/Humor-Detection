I came to the nail spa a few months back just for a quick touch up but I was only 12 so I didn't care much at all about perfect, prestige, trendy nails, but when I came again today. I remembered this I my favorite nail salon of all time!!! Literally I went to starbucks this morning then came over to \"The Nail Spa\" right after it opened, to get my nails redone for 4th of July, and before to go have lunch with my friends'. When I got there a lady sat me down and said 15 minutes I said I just have to leave by 11:15, I needed a fill and gel color so not much time to spare. She made time for me! And sat me down and I told her everything I wanted, being pretty picky, but I researched all over Pinterest, not finding anything I wanted! She said her son SCOTT\" would be here in 15 minutes I was like ok! He got here took over for his mom, and did the most amazing Job ever!! Ok so he didn't finish at 11:15, but here the good part, I wanted so many different things done to my nails, that they should've took 3 hours, LITERALLY! I'm sorry I sound bossy but I'm not, I'm a really nice person, ask SCOTT! He wasn't done at 11:15 so I left for my lunch with friends and i said I will just come back! I did, and he was so nice! He did my nails perfectly!!!! As you can see with crime blue and fireworks it was like nothing else!!! Now here's a rant about Scott he is the most amazing nail artist! And saying that coming from me, he is really good. I've gotten my nails done at almost every place in AZ, I got it done in Spain, and on a cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea! So he is goooooddddd!!!! So there my review and have a great day and another thing, GO TO THE NAIL SPA AND GET SCOTT, and GIVE HIM A GOOD REVIEW!! Ok bye
