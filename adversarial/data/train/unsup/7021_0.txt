This is by far one of my favorite places to shop in Charlotte.  Let's get down to business, shall we.  The parking is a bit challenging, and you may lose cell signal while in the under ground parking area (just don't use your phone while parking, you need the extra concentration anyway).  The cigar shop in the parking deck area absolutely STINKS and if you are even near it, you should shut off the air conditioning in your car unless you want it to smell like an ash tray.  That is one store that just needs to be GONE!  Once you are in the mall, there is a very nice layout that keeps traffic moving with very wide wings for walking.  On some weekends, the local animal shelters will have dogs for adoption here and it is the most adorable thing ever.  I want to take all of them home, but I then realize I live in a condo not a farm.  Alas, I digress. They do a great job with vendor selection in the walkways of the mall. They aren't overly harassing and some can be quite friendly at times.  It's best that you dress very dapper here, between the Apple Store trendsetters rummaging the mall and the 16-30 year olds who are trying to find their next date at the mall, you will need to bring your A game if you want people to notice you.  The vibe is definitely a younger one. They have good seating areas, but the fabric on most of the small couch-like pieces of furniture look like they have been lived on since the mall's opening. They have strategically placed AEDs for those who may have a heart attack from shopping.  The secret entrances all over the mall make for a great \"bat cave\" experience should you decide to try some of them. My favorite is the one near Pottery Barn. \n\nHappy shopping!!
