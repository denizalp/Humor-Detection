My previous review explained my dismay about this place: \n\n* Wine that had been left opened for several days\n* Rancid olive oil on the table\n* Mediocre food\n\nThe positive things: pasta and garlic bread.\n\nEven after a disappointing visit, I decided to give them another chance with their wood-fired pizzas. \n\nToday's lesson: having a wood oven doesn't mean you know how to make good pizza! The pizza crust was thin and soggy. You can't pull a single piece out of the box without it falling apart.\n\nWhen I called, I asked if there was a delivery minimum or delivery charge. She said the delivery charge was $1.99. I assumed that meant there was no delivery minimum. I asked the total: just under $20. If there was a delivery minimum, you would assume that 1. their terrible website would display it; or 2. they would mention it on the phone--they had several chances (when I initially asked if there was one, and when I asked what the total was). She also hung up on me when I was mid-sentence. And I'm not soft-spoken either so either she heard me and didn't care or was in a rush. I was asking when I could expect it. I figure it can't be too long, and I'm sure she was in a rush so I got over it. She was probably more socially awkward than rude.\n\nThe pizza arrives pretty quickly. After paying and tipping, the guy tells me that next time there's a delivery minimum of $25 (my order came to $20). I said that I asked the woman on the phone and she didn't mention anything. He said that there is a delivery minimum and that it was on the website. I told him I looked at the website when ordering and that it wasn't there. He insisted that it was on the website. I insisted that it wasn't. He again insisted that it was, so I decided to end it there and said \"now I know for next time\" so that the argument would end. As if there would be a next time. Did that really just happen? How unprofessional.\n\nAs if you'd even know what's on your website. No one's touched that thing since 2008 (though it looks like it's more from 1998).\n\nI have provided a screenshot of their \"lovely\" delivery page that does not display that there is a delivery minimum (in case they decide to change it all of a sudden): http:\/\/cl.ly\/1k1H3Z1n270T0V2L3B42\n\nHere's the actual link: http:\/\/www.amoretrattoria.ca\/?page=delivery\n\nI will never spend a dime at their store again for the following reasons:\n* Extremely rude customer service: you don't hang up on your customer (I got over that one), you don't argue with them about a delivery minimum (especially when you're wrong).. smart to do it after I tipped him though, I wanted to take the tip back...\n* Soggy pizza that falls apart and tastes cheap. Cheap mozzerella, and if the chicken was grilled it was either done so several days ago or in a factory.\n* Really old wine if you order by the glass. so disgusting I refused to get it.\n* RANCID (no word of a lie) olive oil sitting on the table. Go ahead... Go there and taste it and tell me I'm wrong. It isn't rancid by a week or so either, try months or years.\n\nThe cons definitely outweigh the pros. There is no shortage of good Italian restaurants in the city. Even La Vecchia up the road is better.\n\nThese people deserve 1 star for having low quality food that probably won't pass a health check (e.g. rancid olive oil), several day old wine, soggy pizza that falls apart, and the worst being the rude and unprofessional customer service. \n\nColes Notes: I knew the food was mediocre from the first time around and that they were terrible in some domains (rancid olive oil, days-old wine) but I decided to give them a try anyway because they have a wood burning stove, to be disappointed yet again with their soggy pizza, and then arguing with the delivery guy..\n\n\"Amore\" means love... Based on all the Yelp reviews I wonder how successful I'd be at launching a class action suit against them for false advertising. This community definitely has no amore for Amore! \n\nI guess \"Old Wine, Rancid Olive Oil, Soggy Pizza and Bad Service Trattoria\" won't sell as well...!
