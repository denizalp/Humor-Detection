Place sucks.  I am from Chicago and I know a thing or two about great sandwich's. This place however, does not!!  They can't even make a simple French dip here.  The meat was dry and bland they had the attention span of a fly and the place was empty. I should have known. But it is a local business and I wanted to do my part.  My part has been done and I will not eat here ever again. The food is worse then subway. I mean I wanted a great sandwich but what I got was a lack luster sandwich made with bitterness and shame rather then love. And you can tell with one bite. Do yourself a favor get a sandwich down the street at sack's better food better bread and better quality meats for sure and service with a smile. Trust me on this this place is an epic failure.  Sorry but jp is bs.
