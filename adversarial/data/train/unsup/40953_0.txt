We went to Sushi samba to celebrate a birthday.  Nick, our server couldn't have been more incredible.  He knew every ingredient ineverydish.  And when we asked questions about the food, had no hesitation in answering.  He was nothing short of amazing.  He customed our menu based on food allergies some of our party had and of course had plenty of delicious options for me...the pescatarian.  If you ever get to go into the restaurant. ..ask for Nick to be your server!   And the chef. ..makes an amazing Sea Bass!!!
