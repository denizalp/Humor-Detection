We stayed here over Christmas and we had a very pleasant stay. Located in downtown Phoenix, the front desk and manager were attentive and friendly. They have a nice wine desk in the evening and we had a container of popcorn and couple sodas waiting for us when we got to our room.  There's a parking garage next to the hotel (like right next door) with an elevator to the ground level to get to the hotel. We'd definitely stay here again, we've stayed at other Kimpton Hotel's and had pleasant stays at all of them.
