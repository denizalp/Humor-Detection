Not bad at all. I am very satisfied with the end result.\n\nI went in for a color\/cut\/style. I was nervous because I am fairly new to AZ and starting over with hair is often disastrous. \n\nMy colorist\/stylist got it right! And I am amazed and still a little shocked. My husband loves it and he is - even more picky than I am.\n\nI went in to get a natural blonde color put in my hair. The foils were tightly fixed to my scalp and she brought the color up to the perfect level. To top it off, she cut my hair correctly with very little direction. \n\nThis woman says she's master at color. I got along well with her, and did not seem phony or fake at all.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n\n1.) I was not offered a beverage until the foils were in my hair.\n2.) She was also working on another client at the same time. I really, really frown upon that!\n3.) She got a bit too frank with me when I told her I was not quite satisfied with certain areas. But keep in mind I am very picky.\n4.) The salon is really small.\n\nThe price:\n\nPricey! but not too bad? I got a cut - highlight - root lifter - blow dry style & two great shampoos (the kind where they massage you) for under $250.00. \n\n...and the front desk was pleasant and very helpful! \n\nFinally! I found a colorist! \n\nMessage me if you are in desperate need of a colorist (as I was), and I will tell you more about her.\n\nI uploaded some pics - so you can judge for yourself.
