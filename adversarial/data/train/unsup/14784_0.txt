Not sure why, but I feel a bit like I'm in a fairytale land when I walk into this place :) Surely the 7 dwarfs or the mad hatter are sipping tea in one of the many nooks & cozy corners!\n\nThe loose leaf tea is great. Take a moment to open up the containers & take a nice big ol' whiff before you decide on 'the one'. The best one as of now in my opinion also doubles as aromatherapy, lol! It's black tea & coconut, yum!\n\nThe food is all made from scratch & so far I know that the Bungalow Salad, Curry Chicken sandwich & the Enlightened One sandwich are all FANTASTIC :)\n\nAdd to all of this that you are in a lovely historic home & that the owners & employees make you feel like you are a wanted & welcomed guest & it all adds up to a truly relaxing & delightful experience.\n\nP.S. they offer yoga if you want to work off your food OR make room for more ;)
