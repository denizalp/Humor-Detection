Avoid European Jewellers!!  This store has a no refund policy, but will do their best to hide it.  I purchased a nice watch for my husband's birthday and the sales rep told me that it could be returned or exchanged if he didn't want it.  They had to transfer the watch from another location, so I paid 50% of the cost upfront.  When I picked up the watch and paid the balance, they placed the final receipt in an envelope at the bottom of the bag.  At home I noticed the final receipt had \"No Refunds\" printed on the bottom, however the original receipt for the deposit did not. I returned to the store within a day or two to speak to the sales rep but she denied telling me I could return the watch.  To support my position I pointed out the inconsistency between receipts, the fact that there were no signs anywhere in the store stating their unusual policy and asked to speak to management.  Despite my calm manner, professional appearance and the fact that I had just spent a considerable sum on a nice watch - the sales rep demanded that I immediately leave the store.  I guess she didn't want other customers to overhear that they had a \"No Refund\" policy!  I spent a very stressful week trying to contact company management then the better business bureau and their supplier (the manufacturer of the watch).  Eventually I was able to exchange the watch and make it right - but what a terrible, terrible experience.  Take your business elsewhere (especially if you are buying an engagement ring, fine watch or any high priced item.)
