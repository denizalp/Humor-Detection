We've been to Table a few times now, and like it very much. This is a casual restaurant with relaxed service and a nice view of Canonsburg Lake. The food is very solid here...good selection and fresh ingredients. I've had their soup and salad combo for lunch, and sampled their flatbreads and sandwiches, and thus far everything has been very good, especially for this area, which doesn't have many good restaurants. The service tends to be a bit slow, even when there aren't alot of tables, but that's a small issue for me.
