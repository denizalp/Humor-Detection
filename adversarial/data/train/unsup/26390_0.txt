This is a great addition to the Madison restaurant choices. The ambiance is a modern industrial type that feels warm and comfortable and also has surprisingly good acoustics. There are two levels and several different areas to sit in, which gives great flexibility depending on how you feel. There's even glass garage doors and a glass roof that open up in nicer weather! The food and drink menus are as good as the space, with a solid variety of choices. The beer menu is extensive, including types for real connoisseurs. I've eaten here several times and the food quality has been consistent and, I'd say, top notch for this type of eatery. And to top it off, they throw in a few surprising menu choices that have great flavor and make their menu a little more special than you might expect to find. And yes, the staff have all been fantastic!
