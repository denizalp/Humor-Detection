I was in Paris recently, and can surely say that I'm in love with that city. CITY OF LOVE.....\nSo I decided to refresh my feelings and came to Eiffel Tower Restaurant for dinner.The atmosphere is very cozy and inviting.The view from the restaurant is outstanding. I could see the fountains of the Bellagio from my window. The sommelier gave me a good advice and I enjoyed excellent wine. The food was delicious. It was beautifully plated and served. Everything is expensive, but very much worth the price. The time spent here is priceless. \nIf you want to have a dinner to remember and enjoy your eating, this is the right place to go.\nUNFORGETTABLE!!!!!!
