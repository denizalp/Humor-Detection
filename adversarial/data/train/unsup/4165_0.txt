Vegas is known for AYCE (all you can eat) sushi joints. They are a dime a dozen so finding a decent one is always a challenge. I find that Umiya has great quality fish for the price. You can't expect strip quality fish when it come AYCE but I really enjoy the salmon belly, Yuzu hamachi, and all the yummy appetizers. If you come here, make sure to get the Seared Tuna In AJ sauce. The sauce is awesome! Also, the service is always on par. The staff is friendly and always checking us on you; something I find other places lack. Keep it up Umiya!
