Warning: This is a Debbie Downer review:\n\nI feel really guilty putting up 3 stars, because EVERYBODY LOVES Jozsa's Corner. I agree that Alex is a very genuine and welcoming Hungarian. But contrary to what most people have reviewed on the internet, I left still a little hungry. The food was good and homecooked, and I would like to learn how the cold salads were made. \n\nI thought Alex's company might cheer up my small-portioned meal, but the house was packed that night and everyone there seemed to  solicit Alex's attention and best wishes. Jozsa's Corner is like the little diamond in the rough that everyone wants to keep for themselves and call it their own and I felt a little out of place because I wasn't raving about the food and hugging Alex while I was there.
