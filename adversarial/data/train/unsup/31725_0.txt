Sunday afternoon and we were sat with in 5 minutes of checking in. Service was wonderful, everything was brought out in a timely matter. The price is average $10-$15 a plate, you can spend a little more for the chefs specials ($20+). Excellent for breakfast and lunch with a Filipino twist. Highly recommend if you are a foodie!
