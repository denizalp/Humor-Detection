This is a GREAT place to hang out, have a glass of wine and listen to live music. We love the indoor and outdoor seating. Owner and staff are super friendly and attentive. They also have beer and \"some\" mixed drinks for those who want to hang out and don't drink wine. \n\nWe haven't tried the food, as we typically come to hang with friends and have a drink.
