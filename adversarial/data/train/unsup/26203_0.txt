I was looking for Progress anti-sway bar for an 05 Scion xB. After a few days of intense internet searching and calls, it was apparent that Vivid Racing had the cheapest price and moderate delivery time. My problem was that the website wasn't working properly and it wouldn't allow me to ever finish placing an order. They kept sending emails offering free shipping because my orders kept being cut off, but what good is that if i can't place the order? I called to inform them about the issues and try to make an order over the phone.\n\nFirst, every extension from the automated menu was busy! I finally spoke to someone and they \"transferred\" me over to the proper department. I was on hold for over 20 minutes. My assumption was that it was during a lunch hour, but that wouldn't justify the lack of service to such a degree. Then, I called back and once again NO ONE answered for any of the extensions, even the guy i previously spoke with. I decided to email the company and explain the situation. Oddly enough, I got a respond within 2 minutes from someone asking to call them directly.\n\nHe did apologize for the website issues and took my order. He even had me wait for a second so that he could verify that the part was in stock rather than blindly putting the order in. This guy really tried his best to make up for the whole thing. He even honored the \"free shipping\" when i brought up the previous emails. By the way, the shipping was going to be about $20 extra... which is more than the website (estimate) had been. That being the case, i made sure i was compensated for my troubles. I got my free shipping. I wish it had been a much better experience.
