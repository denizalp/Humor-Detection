I wish I would have read reviews on this place before I made an appointment to get a pedicure. The first thing my technician asked me was if I wanted my nails clipped and I said yes. Maybe it was my fault for not being enough attention but the more I look at my feet the more I am dissatisfied with the services provided. My nails were not clipped appropriately. My right foot does not match my left foot  with the exception of the polish color. \n\nI will say this for my friend as well. We made tandem appointments and her therapist must've not been paying careful attention (since he spent the entire time talking to a lady sitting by the foot of another chair- she wasn't even receiving services), and he apparently used a scrubbing tool too aggressively. My friends flesh on the edge of her left pinky toe was left bleeding. He didn't even apologize. \n\nI could not go to sleep without writing this review. Will not go back. Will not recommend. \n\nNote: I get pedicures several times a year and manicures every few weeks.
