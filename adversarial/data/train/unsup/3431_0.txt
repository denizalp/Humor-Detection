At the risk of sharing the ABSOLUTELY BEST animal hospital and causing me to have to schedule longer waits because they are so popular, I would like to recommend this animal hospital - why?\n\n1. The staff is amazing, friendly and helpful\n2.  They are not overpriced - in fact completely reasonable\n3.  You can tell that the doctors love the animals and are here to help, not to charge ridiculous prices!\n\nI would also like to recommend them for dental issues with your pet.\n\nI took my dog to a different vet because he broke off a tooth and his face was swollen.  They wanted to charge me $800 - $1200 to remove it and seemed nervous about doing the surgery.\n\nI came here for a second opinion because of the great reviews on Yelp and they are a fraction of the cost, also clean the teeth during the process and are very comfortable with dental procedures.\n\nI can't recommend them enough!
