Dogs are unhealthy, illegal pet breeding, ADOPT DONT SHOP. \n\nI went to pet a husky, it had bad behavioral issues developing already. Puppies shouldn't bite so hard that you bleed. The dog had liquid diarrhea all over the area when we were in the private room with it.\n\nThey're making a fortune off these dogs, just adopt!!!
