Of all of the restaurants that we ate at during our stay at the Mandalay Bay this was the worst experience of them all! \n\nWe had a large group, so that might have been the problem, but it took forever to get our drinks. Some of us didn't get them at all. Then refills took forever rather they were alcoholic or non!! \n\nThe chips were good but the salsa was not. Also, trying to get salt to add to my chips was a nightmare! I asked 3 people for it! The menu was pretty expansive and had a lot of new mexican food and traditional mexican food. The table ordered nachos, quesadillas, ceviche, tortas, tacos and guacamole.  The best of all of it was the guacamole but as you can guess there was NOT enough of it for the money! I know its Vegas but if you are going to pay $10 for guacamole at least give me one whole avocados worth of dip!! \n\nThe tacos were VERY SMALL, they are more like street tacos, so if you are looking for big portions do not order this. However they were very tasty! The nachos were probably the biggest hit at the table. The crab and steak ones were tasty and plentiful, you could share these with two people. \n\nThe service was also very slow and not what you would expect at a resort like Mandalay Bay! I was very upset with the waitress by the end of the meal.
