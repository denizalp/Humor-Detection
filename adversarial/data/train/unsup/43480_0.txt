The pumpkin curry chicken is our main dish here, but the pineapple curry, any fried rice, and chicken satay are also favorites. We pick up from here pretty often and always appreciate how fast they are..10 minutes tops. This really is a very pleasant place, and I hope they continue to do well. Also, the decor a beautiful.
