This fry's started out awesome used to call it flavor town now it's bummer city.\nThe ready eat area was great used to have salmon with drizzle, fresh vegies\nCat fish fry with mac and cheese fresh looking potatoes \nUsed to come every Friday for meals for my family of 4 had no problem with the prices it was great except for then it started to  clean up by 7 o'clock so you had to rush down so I talked to the manager not sure if it was that but they stay open an extra hour, but now what's the use???\nThey suck now and so do the small store managers thinking they can run a big store what a freaking joke \nYou build this big store in the middle of a working man's area,  we don't even get off until 7 o'clock rush down here to hear oh sorry the grill closes at 7 oclock ? what a crook how hard is to throw a steak on the Barbie  while they creep along like molasses putting the stuff away , and the joy they get when they tell you they can't\nGrill anything, bullshit I thought it was about customers service you do know your turning money away right its why you opened this right ????\nNow instead of salmon it's gorden fisherman  pieces and and dried up fries \nThe prime rib is way to raw try temping it\nThe tilapia is horrible \nNo one likes the pork obviously \nTry standing back there and see how many people you are losing once again it's for the money right \nThe chicken tenders are so old they are tuff and Im sick of them because it's all you got now. \nTry talking to  the store managers totally overwhelmed I asked one if he worked here so I can get the store # 692 \nHe said he was off the other manager weeks ago \nI told him how it was failing back in that area and he garbled out some script about let me see how I can make it better \nWhat happen Darren you drop the ball.\nI told you I was going to say something \nTrust me Corp will know how much you are damaging the new bummer city \nBy the way you haven't had a working pen in the bulk isle for weeks \nTry 19th and union hills store and give someone who cares about the stores bottom line and keeping customers happy a try
