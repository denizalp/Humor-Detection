Worst pillows ever.\n\nI've often mocked the type of people who travel with their own pillow, but after one sleepless night at the Sandman, I've vowed to show more empathy. I've stayed in many many hotels in my life, and some pillows are better than others. Before this, I've always managed to make it work. The pillows at the Sandman are HUGE. They are about 8 inches tall and don't compress down. I ended up using a folded bath towel as a makeshift pillow.\n\nOtherwise, the hotel was pleasant and clean. If I had to stay here again, I'd be one of those people who arrived with her own pillow.
