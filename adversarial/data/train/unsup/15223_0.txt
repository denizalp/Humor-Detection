After watching David Chang on Munchies and Buzzfeed's Worth It series, I've been hyped to try Momofuku and Milk Bar ever since. Much respect to the chef!\n\nTo be honest though, I didn't enjoy the samples I had of birthday cake and crack pie soft serve. Those flavors were overbearingly sweet in my opinion. But the cereal milk with Frosted Flakes definitely brought me back to my childhood days - scarfing down the last few bites from a cereal bowl while watching cartoons. :\") \n\nAside from the soft serve, Milk Bar's cookies aren't bad either. I have yet to try the crack pie but if it's as sweet as the soft serve I'm going to have to pass on that one. \nBut this place is worth the visit overall, especially if you're in Vegas for vacation and want to treat yourself to something sweet!
