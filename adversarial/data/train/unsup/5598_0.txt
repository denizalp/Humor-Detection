You know how when you're really really hungry, food taste way better than it actually is because you are so relieved to finally be able to get a bite to eat? This seriously must be how this place stays in business. Plus, it's the cheapest food in the vicinity so a lot of the younger crowd who goes to Marquee comes here before and after for a relatively cheap bite.\n\nWhat is up with this pizza? There's always a line here and I always wonder how and why it happened? I had some pepperoni slices lately and they were like licking a block of salt. There was a weird aftertaste from eating this pizza that no amount of soda could wash out. I think it is too much garlic powder on the crust. The crust itself was thin and tasted like nothing. Nothing special over here.
