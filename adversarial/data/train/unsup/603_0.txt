Good authentic restaurant right on a busy stretch of other restaurants and shopping. I think it was in Chinatown but not positive. It was within walking distance of the hotel I was staying at. \nI was there on a Sunday evening donut wasn't crowded. We were seated quickly and our food was out in no time. \nDecent sized dining area with about a dozen tables or so. \nI had the Tom Yum Gum soup and the Thai Fried rice. Both were very good. Authentic for sure.
