I get the hype and the love! it's a fun club! Went here last weekend, and Sidney Samson did his set. Was impressed with the overall layout (so much room to roam and partying under the night sky was *love*), there wasn't really a dance floor perse but I guess the area closest to the dj was considered it. Anywho, I think my shout outs go to the bartenders from AZ who were so creative with their drink concoctions, it was nice to enjoy some Phoenix creativity which is something I gotta say for Phoenix bartenders they know their drinks =) Anywho, I just loved the overall vibe and my drunkenness helped make my night better, the vegas priced drinks didn't even faze me. lol. Um would I come back, yes, with more people, definitely yes! and will you be guaranteed a good time at Surrender I say HECK YES!!
