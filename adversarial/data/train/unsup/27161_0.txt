My boyfriend and I go here often for games, accessories, and just to walk around. They have a great selection of all kinds of games from then to now. The employees are very down to earth and helpful. They are very knowledgable about their merchandise and all sorts of games. I really enjoy going to this specific location and will continue to buy games here.
