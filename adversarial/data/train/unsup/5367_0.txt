I have been a patient here for two years.  I went to the Goodyear office and had Micro-fracture surgery on my right knee.  They since closed that office and I now go to the Sun City West office.   Compared to the other Orthopedic doctors office I went to the CORE is much better at running their office.  I have never had a scheduling problem like the other review stated.  My only complaint is it takes a while to get called back from the Doctor's Assistant to make appointments, and you need to keep calling to make sure they don't forget about you.   \n\nBottom Line: I would recommend the CORE Institute to anyone needing orthopedic care.
