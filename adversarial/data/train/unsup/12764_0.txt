Delicious!\n\nOh my this place was tasty. I had a beef n lamb sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was just the right size to share with my hubby. Though I think I could have finished it on my own. The meat was tender and I was really enjoying the veggies. The white sauce made this sandwich. The price was a little more than what I wanted to pay, but for this place being on the strip its a good price. Will be stopping by before the rush of people. The line got pretty long at about 5pm on sunday when we went.\nThis place is located in the Grand Bazaar outisde of the Bailys hotel and casino in the front near Las Vegas Blvd. You can valet, but we parked in the back of the hotel. Needed the walk after all the grubbing
