I've driven past this place a few hundred times since first noticing the signage from Rutherford Rd. Our regular place was closed today, likely for the long weekend. With not much for options for Greek restaurants in the area, I thought of this place. \n\nFirst off the cashier misunderstood my order, the service time was reasonable. When I got home and opened the container, first thought, the portions are small, and they didn't give us any tzatziki sauce. Ordered the chicken gyros dinner. As I mentioned already the portions were noticeably smaller than any other Greek restaurant I've been to. The chicken was dry and over cooked in spots it was even burnt. \n\nWhen I saw the gyros cooking in the spit, they were definitely of the processed variety, the chicken looked OK, but if the lamb and beef were processed I'd suspect the chicken was as well. \n\nI believe this is a chain and do things the way chain restaurants do, nothing authentic here. Don't suspect I'll be back even if our regular spot is closed again. It's definitely worth the drive to Weston and Langstaff for the authentic Greek gyros.
