The friendliest ULTA experience I've had to date. \n\nThe other locations I visit, you rarely get a greeting let alone assistance finding a product. \n\nImmediately when I walked in, a nice gentleman (wish I remembered his name, had a septum nose ring) welcomed me and asked if I needed help. \n\nWhy yes, I do - All turned around as this isn't my usual store. \n\nTook me right to the Mario Badescu products, got my eye cream, paid and was on my merry way. \n\nHope future visits to this ULTA are similar. I will never hesitate to drop in if I'm at Tempe Marketplace and need to replenish something in my beauty stash. :)
