People always say whichever Indian restaurant they frequent is the best,  but everyone I've taken to Banjara converts. It really is amazing hence the extraordinary crowd and take-out back log all weekend.\n\nJust go, don't expect to be wowed by the decor, it's all about the good food. \n\nLamb Roganjosh is the best we've had. Takeout is never disappointing.
