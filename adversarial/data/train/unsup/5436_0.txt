Definitely a five star experience at Juut Salonspa. I stopped by the other day to see if I could get a walk-in but had to make an appointment instead. I arrived and was greeted warmly and checked in. They offered water or tea but I declined. I waited for my stylist, Whitney, and she guided me back to her chair. I came at a good time because it wasn't busy. I told her what I was thinking and she was receptive and engaged with my ideas. Whitney was lovely and she kept up the right level of conversation. \n\nShe started off with a scalp and shoulder massage which was really nice. She washed my hair, cut it and styled it with the appropriate hair products and tools and I was happy with the result. I appreciate how their products are natural and that they celebrate Earth month by partnering with charities. The price was affordable (didn't hurt that I had a promotional card) and I felt it was worth my time and money to come here. I don't visit the salon often but I would come back here and try to refer friends. Great customer service and ambiance!
