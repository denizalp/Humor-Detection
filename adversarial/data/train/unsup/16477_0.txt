Wow, if you want to see an amazing variety of desert plants, enjoy a nice hike, and maybe even learn something, you can't go wrong.  \n\nThis time of year, while it's getting a little warm, the plants are in bloom, and you really get to applicate the fact that Arizona has more colors than brown.\n\nWe spent about 4 1\/2 hours walking around, which is enough time to see the entire garden, spend time where you want, and get the full experience.  I have no doubt had we stayed longer that we would have noticed even more things.\n\nThe Chihuly exhibit was amazing, well worth the need to reserve tickets.  If you haven't seen it, you should really check it out.  The photos I took don't do justice to seeing it live, and in such an incredible setting.\n\nWe did snack at the Patio Cafe, and while the menu sounded amazing, the sandwiches were all premade (nice that there was no wait) but a little lackluster.  It was fancy box lunch fair.  If DBG wasn't a non-profit, I would have been annoyed with the prices.  However, the birds really enjoyed the bread I parted with, so I think they would rate it pretty high.  Personally, I would just eat before I go next time, and not bother.\n\nThey had some great Earth Day displays in the Herb Garden, all kinds of information on sustainability and eco-friendly choices.  If you are looking to get low water usage plants in your yard, they had all the information.  I'm just not sure if that was a one time thing, or if they are there frequently.\n\nOverall, we had a great time, and I will be using the Culture Pass to go again when the weather cools off.
