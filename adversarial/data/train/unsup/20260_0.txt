My friends and I were nearby to grab lunch and decided to spend some time on Fremont Street since we are never in downtown. I came when I was young and have never been back. The street is like a citywalk in LA where you have street performers and other random acts to entertain you. There's other things you can do such as the ziplining thing that seems to have taken off because there was a line when we were there. There's also some stalls to buy things and ample smaller bars and casinos to add to the variety of things to do. Of course I feel the electric light show is the highlight of this place but they didn't show it at afternoon. I feel the nostalgic feel of Fremont Street and would probably be coming back in a few years again to see how it has changed. If you are nearby, I would take a little adventure here since there is so much to see. Parking can be annoying on downtown so think about that before coming.
