Yep - believe all the five-star reviews. I may sound like a broken record raving about the same things you've read from other reviewers, but here's my quick take:\n\n- Very AND always clean\n- The newest, highest quality machines and equipment  \n- Machines are NEVER out of order (if they are, must be very temporary)\n- No crowds, no lines, no waiting around\n- Not an intimidating atmosphere. Everyone is very respectful and carries a focused demeanor (rather than a grunty, watch-me-lift-watch-me-naenae muscle head demeanor)\n- Extremely reasonable pricing. I paid up front, which calculated to about $20\/month for a year commitment \n- No hidden schemes in the enrollment process\n- Gym owners (Shelly and Chris) are the most welcoming people you will meet, and very knowledgable in their craft\n- All staff members are always greeting you and working hard to keep the gym consistently spick and span. Thanks team!!\n\nBottom line: BEST GYM IN LAS VEGAS. I came from 24 Hour Fitness and cancelled my membership immediately after joining Yak's. This is a small, personal gym, so it doesn't have an abundance of classes (hoping they will add in the future!), swimming pool, or basketball court. BUT if you are trying to get back into the fitness game and seeking a motivational atmosphere and a new gym to devote to, you gotta come to Yak's.
