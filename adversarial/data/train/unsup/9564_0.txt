Tucked away in a large shopping plaza next to the Best Buy on Maryland Parkway Delhi Indian Cuisine originally opened its doors on January 1st 2014, and although the area around it may not be the most glamorous with vagrants roving both parking lots and nearby streets those in the neighborhood around noon would still do well to stop in for the all-you-can eat Buffet lunch.\n\nStacked against a lot of competition in Las Vegas but more than once voted Sin City's Best Indian Restaurant, the 11a-3p daily Buffet complimented by a large a la carte menu offered both day and night, guests entering Delhi Indian Cuisine will likely first be struck by the impressive size of a restaurant easily capable of accommodating more than one-hundred diners and although many may criticize Steam Tray food for one reason or another those arriving early can rest assured that everything offered is quite fresh while service is also very attentive.\n\nOffering a full bar in addition to Beer and Wine, the ability to order off the menu at lunch also not typical of most Indian Lunch Buffets, it was after checking in at the hostess stand that a seat was offered along the right wall in a plush booth, both drinks and the full menu declined before selecting Garlic Naan and walking up to gather the first of five plates of Food.\n\nPlaying soothing music without video throughout the Restaurant, a significant departure from the loud volume and flashing Bollywood of Mount Everest or Paradise India on the West Side, it was shortly after returning to the table that a puffy round of Bread with lightly blistered edges emerged from the kitchen and with the smell of Garlic quickly filling the air it would be hard to name a better version of the dish found anywhere in the city, the opening quartet of Chicken all proving very well made with the Tandoori Leg and Wing both moist with good color while the Chili Chicken brought a lot of heat, but not so much that it was unpleasant.\n\nClearly labeling Vegetarian versus Omnivorous options, a large family of visiting Indians from London soon entering and speaking loudly about how good much of Dehli's Buffet was in comparison to those back home, it was with the faint linger of Curry on the lips that a second trip was made to the lengthy Buffet, a small bowl of Goat Curry as usual made difficult to eat by splintered Bones but otherwise funky and Fragrant while the Pakora and Samosa were fairly run of the mill, thus leaving room for the tender Turmeric-heavy Cauliflower and Potatoes as well as generous cubes of Chicken Breast served in Rice perfumed with Nutmeg, Cardamom and Bay Leaf.\n\nMoving right to left and incidentally from Meat to Vegetables and Legumes, more than 50% of the buffet focused on the latter, fans of heat would do well to focus on Delhi's Navratan Korma with \"three types of Chiles\" according to the waitress while those looking for something a bit more subtle will be better off with Dal Makhani or Chana Masala, the former a fragrant Black Lentil Porridge while the later outperformed the Chicken version by being a bit thicker and a little more focused in flavor around tender Chickpeas.\n\nUsing creamy Palak Paneer as a topping to for the Naan after discovering a lack of Chutney on the Cold Bar, the Cheese about 3\/4 melted and thus a nice consistency, it was as the meal neared its end that an inquiry was made about the Gajar Halwa seen in many pictures online, the apparently \"not every day\" Buffet item nonetheless prepared special at no extra charge and served piping hot with plenty of Cardamom but not a lot of extra sweetness, that side of dessert instead left to chilled Rice Pudding with subtle Saffron notes and globes of Gulab Jamun soaked in sugary Syrup.\n\n****Offering the Buffet for just $12.99 and full a la carte menu throughout the day it would be difficult to name a more accommodating Indian Restaurant in Las Vegas than Delhi Indian Cuisine, an early arrival assuring that everything is fresh while the staff easily outperforms even the Grand Buffets of the Strip in terms of friendliness and attention to guest's needs.
