My partner and I purchased a Groupon for a couple's massage while we were in Vegas.  I need to give a shout-out to my therapist, Sandra.  She did an AMAZING job.  I told her exactly where I wanted her to spend her time, and where I didn't.  I'm fortunate to have had enough massages to know that most will nod their head as they're talking to you, but then give you the massage they give everyone else.  This was a treat, and kudos to Sandra for giving a great, memorable massage!  Request her -- you won't be disappointed.
