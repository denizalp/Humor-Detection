On my first foray here I opened with a Signature Combo Lunch of a crock of excellent French Onion Soup--clearly baked and finished off with a crown of Swiss Cheese--and an Oriental Chicken Salad with excellent Dumpling Sauce with a kick and very good lemony Oriental Dressing.    Meanwhile, on a low carb diet, Diane enjoyed a bunless Bacon Cheeseburger.\n\nService was excellent. Extra requested Dumpling Sauce and Oriental Sauce for the Chicken Salad were graciously supplied.  Our server turned out to be the bartender doing double duty; the staff seemed to be shorthanded.  On a down note I saw one flea hovering over our table after we had completed eating.\n\nThis was a nice and tasty casual lunch.
