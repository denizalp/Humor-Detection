I've been here a few times now and the experience has always been different.  The baths are fabulous and if you pick the right time not too crowded - Sat afternoon is not a good choice as seems to be bachelorette favourite and very noisy and people don't pay attention to the 'no talking' in the sauna and steam room.  Level of treatments completely depend on who you get, one girl was 20 minutes late with a different reason to the main desk when I had to ring to find out what was happening, she then had the nerve to finish 10 minutes early after a mediocre treatment.  There aren't many options for the baths in Toronto so likely to keep going back for those, but not for the treatments.
