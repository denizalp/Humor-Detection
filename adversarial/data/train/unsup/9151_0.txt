After reading a few negative reviews about this place, I decided to try it out anyway. Seemed nice enough walking in. I made my way to the counter and was directed around to the range area to rent a shooting lane. \n\nI paid $10 for a lane and $2 for a zombie target. There were no lines or anything, so I got right to work. A range officer watched me as I proceeded to bust a cap into one of the side dancers from the Thriller music video. Needless to say, that guy started having a real bad day when I got there. \n\nAll in all it was a good time. I brought my own weapon, but next time I might rent another pistol for $25 or one of those infamous ASSAULT rifles for $50. Sounds like fun to me. \n\nCost to shoot at 702...$12.00. \n\nSleeping well, knowing that I'm ready for the Zombie Apocalypse...PRICELESS!!
