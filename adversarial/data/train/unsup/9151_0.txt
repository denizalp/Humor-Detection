I moved here from LA so I know my sushi, apparently unlike the other reviewers of Goyemon. Many classmates had recommended this place but it was more than a disappointment. The eel must have been a week old. The food smelled and had zero sauce. My rolls stuck to the plate they were so dry. We got AYCE and were lost as to what to order because the food was just so bad. Literally, I've had better sushi in a mall food court. Zero stars!!!
