I like Muji for their simple men's shirts they are great quality and reasonable price. Bought some jeans here again well made and reasonably priced. The only issue I have is that they generally carry REALLY small sizes. For jeans typically they carry 29-31\" waist, and for shirts they carry up to a medium I believe. This is incredibly disappointing as I wanted to buy another pair of jeans but they did not have my size and did not seem to know when they would receive more of my size in stock. \n\nI haven't shopped here for stationary, furniture or glassware but next time I'm in-store I'll definitely check that out! Hope Muji expands across the GTA!
