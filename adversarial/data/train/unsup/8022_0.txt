I really WANT to like this place. It's got all the key elements to really be a winner. And, okay, I don't DIS-like it, but the more times I come here, the more I just can't get over their sorry excuse of a staff. \n\nThe kids behind the concessions counter are primarily who I am talking about here. No smiles, no enthusiasm, everyone appears to be just miserable! And on top of that, they move slower than molasses, which is just irritating and frustrating to the customers. \n\nThe concessions are WAY over-priced, so the least you could do is TRY and make me feel good about the money I am about to fork over. \n\nI guess I just don't get it. If you really hate your job that much, leave. And why isn't management more in-tune to this? Either way, something has got to be done because the concession stand is not being handled efficiently at all. \n\nCan't beat those loungers though, amiright!?!
