Ok, ok I know that Wildflower is a chain, but I have to say, it is a very delicious one! This location is in the neighborhood and I often stop in for an iced tea, lunch meeting (they've got wifi!!), loaf of bread for dinner, a salad for lunch, or like yesterday, a delicious breakfast sandwich on a Sunday morning! They've literally got something for everyone.\n\nTheir food is fresh, service is fast, and the options are endless. From salads, to sandwiches, to pastas, and delicious soups. One of my favorite things about Wildflower is that they change their menu often, and according to either what is 'trending' in the foodie world or seasonal items. I'm pretty sure that i've tried all of their salads at least once and am never disappointed.\n\nFor breakfast, I always get a breakfast sandwich and yesterday's corned beef, swiss, and potato pancake sandwich was TO DIE FOR. My fiance and I BOTH got it and thought that every bite was heaven. This is new to their menu (or at least i've never seen it before) and I will absolutely come back for it again! I think that it would be just as good without the bun as well. \n\nThank you for always impressing, Wildflower! I know that i'll see you again soon.
