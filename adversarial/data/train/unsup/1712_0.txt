This one was really difficult for me to rate, because when the service has no issues, it's awesome, BUT when you do have a problem, it can be a huge headache.  Having said that I used to have more problems than I do now. What kind of problems you wonder? Well, for the first year I had it, for some reason my internet would become disconnected, and I would have to call in to fix the problem. and back in the day, (and they still may ask this of you) you would call to tell them your problem and if you happen to call during their nonbusiness hours, they would ask you to email them the problem, which is not helpful when you're already pissed off that your internet doesn't work. \n\nNow having said that, when I first started up with them about 3-4 years ago, things weren't as set up as they are now. I think I mention this only because they have a long way to go in terms of customer service still.  They lack the finesse of ability to offer you anything to help make losing 2 weeks of internet service be more okay. \n\nThe last time I had a problem was in 2010, when somehow my internet stopped working, and it was not due to my modem or anything in my house, and directly with the outside connection.  The service person is from Bell. \n\nNow back to the bright side. When it does work, it's great. there is no limits thus far, it's cheap and when you sign on for a year, its even cheaper. Also when you refer a friend, they offer incentives now, to give the referrer a month free or more. \n\nThe way I see it, most internet companies are going to piss you off at some point in time. I've just opted for a cheaper frustration.\n\nThey are available in Quebec, but I believe it's major urban areas, but they do ask you to check with them to make sure service is available.  They also have higher speeds now too.
