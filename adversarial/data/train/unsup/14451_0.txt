I did high tea at the Mandarin Oriental mainly for the view.   The venue for the high tea is located on the one of the top floors of the hotel.  When you first exit the elevators, make left and its on the the right hand side.  The venue for the high tea is actually very small.  There only two tables next to the window and the rest are stationed in a \" U\" shape.  So every table can see the view but it might not be so clear. \n\nThe waitress was nice and explained everything to us.  She took really good care of us and answered all our questions. When the food came out she explained everything in detailed.  The food looked super cute and was themed to the season.  The first thing i had was the curry in a cone.  I enjoyed eating this a lot.   The Cream sandwich was good too along with the salmon with cucumber sandwich.  The scones is what i should've ate first, because it's best warm. I liked it the white cream sauce more, but they had two others for you to choose from. There was a strawberry jam and a apricot jam too.   I like the plain scone more compared to the berry one. \n\nThe desserts were super cute and cute was just what it was. I felt it was too sweet.  All the desserts where too sweet.  The snowman macaron was prob. the least sweet but only if you avoid the hat.  I felt like i was eating sugar straight from the box.  It was a complete sugar overload that I have crossed off sweets from my diet for a whole month.  \n\nGetting here was a challenge . You follow the signed but somehow we ended up at Aria and decided to just park there and walk it.  We gave up making turn after turn after turn.  The signs were so unclear!   They didn't have much of a tea selection for those who needed decaf.  I don't' like having fruits or things like lavender in my tea.  I like how it's quite here and it's a great place for a birthday with your girlfriends or your daughters. But they really need to have a less sweet dessert plate!
