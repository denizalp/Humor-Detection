I've been to another top golf in the Chicagoland area and this scottsdale location is head and shoulders better. They said before this location they turned old driving ranges into top golfs but they built this one from the ground up. Ppl go just to hangout and not even play. Wait times can be 2.5 hrs on the wkends.
