Great quality cookware and utensils, basically everything you need to make your meal the best that it can be. I love the customer service and the great knowledgeable staff always willing to help and answer any questions I have. The selection here is excellent as well and anything they don't have can be ordered. \n\nGranted, the cookware and other various items here are going to put a a nice debt in your wallet but I'm a firm believer in that you get what you pay for. I have several Le Creuset pieces that have endured the test of time and my various experiments. Definitely worth the money and time.
