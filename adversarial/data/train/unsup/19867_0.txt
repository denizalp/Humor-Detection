So when this place opened up in the commerce plaza, I seriously muttered an \"uh oh\" .. because ai xiang a few doors down will definitely suffer some damage as they serve pretty much the same thing (except without unlimited noodle refills) and they are one of my favourite authentic spots. These noodle places are all the rage and popping up errwhere these days..\n\nThe service is fast but everybody was confused.. for example, when our group ordered, they only brought over 1 or 2 noodles and didn't know to bring more until we asked (there were 6 of us. We all ordered noodles- how did this happen?) Also they seemed genuinely confused when asked anything. Strange, really. The food came out very fast though, and other than that- the orders were right.\n\nI got that big beef bone broth one, so I didn't have to mix in my own ingredients and oh man, this was some good broth. Very savoury without overly salty. It is a perfect treat on a freezing day, I can say that for sure. It also comes with a bone with some beef on it, which was really soft and yummy as well. 5\/5 on the dish. \nThe prices are above average, as many other lowkey places serve the same thing for a few bucks cheaper. For my special bone broth one, I think with tip, it was close to $18-19, which is not a cheap asian meal for one.\n\nThere is SO much hype around dagu but well deserved? Ehhh.
