Went there earlier today. Was quite looking forward to discovering a new local food place. Was quite disappointed. The decor was nice and the place looks cool. That is the only good thing about this place. \n\nOrdered the tortilla with mango to start. The chips were literally Doritos. Next, tried the pulled pork burrito. Worst burrito ever. The pulled pork was grey and dry, as if they just boiled it. Not at all how pulled pork is supposed to be. Overall, quite bland tasting. Also tried the fish tacos, which were one of the worst things I have ever tasted. As previously stated above, the taco comes with two tasteless shells that fall apart. The fish was deep-fried and battered but somehow was awful and had no flavour. How can something deep-fried be so bad? Will never return.
