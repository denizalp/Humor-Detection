First time trying this place out after hearing many friends talk it up. You get a lot of food for a great price. I ordered the veggie omelette and it came with a good portion of fruit on the side, as well as two pancakes... all for about $10. I liked how you can add protein to the pancakes. Service was good too. I think Krista was waiting on us. Thanks for the coffee Krista!
