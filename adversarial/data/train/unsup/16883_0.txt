Ketchup wasn't a great burger joint. Located in the Miracle Mile mall at the PH.The place don't have any waitress so you have to order at the counter. The western burger was very bland barley had any bbq sauce in it. My wife crunchy Dog was the opposite it was very salty . There chili cheese fries was ok but way to much beans in the chili .The only thing good was the service. Maybe cause we sat at the bar. Other then that there's way better food in this mall.
