My car makes noise when I do a sharp turn so I decide to bring to this location to check it out.\n\n4337 E Sunset Rd\nHenderson, NV 89014\n\nafter 20 min they called me and told me that my strut is broken and need to replace. it is dangerous if I drive the car like that and it will cost me over $1000.  I have no choice to fix it there because we will be on the trip next day.  \n\nI took the car home after it done and took a few test, my car still make the same noise.  I took it back and ask him to check on the sound again please... when I came back to pick my car the manager he said: my car cable and nuts loose and need to tight them up.  those are nothing relate to the previous work.  I did ask them about the noise did i?  so I just smile and don't trust him much.  \n\nNow I am driving and it is still making the same noise again.  What should I do now?  Look like he took my money and have no responsibility on their works.  I feel very bad and hope my family is safe when driving on the road  we have only one car with a tight budget.\n\nI am writing this review and hope anyone reading this before go to this location and fix your car.  Please check their work before you leave their shop. and shopping around if you really need to fix there. The best option is stay way from this location if you don't want headache and get rip off.  I know a lot people like me know nothing about car that's why we need someone we can trust like them are mechanics to help us out. but look like they just want the money with no hearts.\n\nThanks for reading.
