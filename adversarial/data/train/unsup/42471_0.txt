It was a battle between 3 and 4 stars here, 4 won by a margin!\n\nI frequented \"V.I.P\" for drinks this summer and I have always been a fan of their diverse and not too pricey beer selection I'm also a fan of the fact that all the beer come in their own glass no matter what you order. I've always found the servers to  be overly friendly (you know the type that always tries having conversations with you each time they come over) which I find annoying some(if not most)times. \n\nI like that it's a small pub and I've never found myself having to wait for a seat, and I really enjoy the coziness and the feeling that almost any seat found here is good for people viewing as well! \n\nI have been very unfortunate in coming here on Monday nights when it's garbage night and this results in the place having a good ol stink, but I give full credit to the staff here that try their level best to keep the atmosphere light while going the extra step in washing out out the street with soap water (It did help a little). \n\nIt's at a highly convenient location for me, and I appreciate it even more as it's 1\/2 pubs in the Baldwin Village area which I frequent. \n\nI've only had the appetizers here so I can't really comment too much on the food, but the appetizer (bruchcetta I believe?) was satisfactory. \n\nOne thing that always confuses me was the question of there being big enough fans of this place to actually spend money on their tshirts and other merchandise hanging by the bar!?
