An independent barcade in Tempe? Yay, right?\n\nNot quite.\n\nChicago spoiled me with legit barcades, such as Emporium and Logan Arcade. Those stellar establishments offer row after row of vintage pinball and arcade games. Endgame has a few crappy arcade cabinets, zero pinball and a bunch of consoles that basically remind me I could have just stayed home.\n\nThe layout is silly, with the gaming areas split clear across the bar, and it just looks like the execution fell far short of the concept.
