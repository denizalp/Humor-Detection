Never will have do future business with this company again. Installers came out to install the garage floor and had the nerve to urinate in the driveway. When called into the company and spoke to the manager Andrew he offered to take $250.00 off the bill and was very apologetic. Then called back and said the installer said there was a misunderstanding he was changing his pants when there was no misunderstanding when I was right on the front porch. Very unprofessional and DISGUSTING and RUDE. Got a call this morning from the sales man josh and now saying $150.00 off the bill. DONT DO BUSSINESS WITH THEM\n\nTHERE WAS NO RESOLUTION MET AT ALL. This was posted after the gentleman responded with the total BS that he posted.
