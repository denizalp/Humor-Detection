Fast food Mexican without fast food taste.  Oh wait, it's not fast food, they serve beer, so is this casual Mexcican restaurant with convenient drive through? Whatever it is, I like coming here for a quick meal.\n\nFish tacos, shrimp tacos, shrimp tostada,... Trying to think what else I ordered before... Whatever I had from here, I am pleased with the food I ordered. I am not a Mexican food expert but I eat here or another one near the Safeway in Fountain Hills just about once a month.\n\nAlways friendly and fast service. It is just so pleasant to dine there with their friendly smiles.\n\n10% off with Yelp check in. I think they also have senior discount (a person behind me was told about it but not sure the % discount).\n\nA few times a year, they support a local school by offering a senor taco day where 10% of sales goes to a local school. I always like to support business where they support local school and community. I heard this coming Friday is another senor taco day and guess where I will be for dinner :)
