Havana Room was a great setting for a Christmas party! \n\nLocated in the Tropicana, it's easy to find on their signage.  Tucked in the back corner of the casino is a beautifully decorated room.  The lovely table linens lit by the huge chandeliers gave it an elegant feel.  Bars are located at each corner with the dance floor in the center.\n\nThe bartenders were all very friendly and quick.  There wasn't any issue with lines.  The waiters were all quick to clear dirty plates and glasses.  Service was really good and much appreciated for this fun event.  \n\nThe Havana Room is a great venue and did a great job!
