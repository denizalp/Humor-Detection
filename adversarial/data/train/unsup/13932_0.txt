My second pitstop on Black Friday. Place was not packed at all.\n\nThis review is for the customer service here. This is the standard in dealing and interacting with customers. This is not the case with many retailers. So I get excited when I see this in action. \n\nLucked out with Andrew and Kevin. If you are shopping for a laptop or any computer, these are the guys you need to talk to. They are like the specialist with a wealth of knowledge and so resourceful. The dilema with which one to purchase when it comes to the intel icore i3, i5, i7 and newer generations coming out it can be so confusing when it comes to shopping for a computer.\n\nFirst spoke to Andrew, then he got Kevin who was even more knowledgable as he went to tend to another customer that was also shopping for a computer.\n\nI wanted to walk out of the store with a laptop in my possession but they did not have the specifications that I wanted. They did not get the sale, but they gave me a better understanding of CPU's and storage.\n\nAndrew mentioned there was a laptop on sale and sold the last one and was going to order it if I wanted one. I was looking for a model with 12-16 GB of RAM. They only had up to 8 GB with this particular model.\n\nExcellent customer service here.\n\nTips- Look at circular for sales. There are bargains to be had here.
