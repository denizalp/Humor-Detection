The entire museum is located in one large room and will definitely take you under an hour to move through. There were some fun interactive pieces, like printing your face on money, stepping into a stage coach for a pretend ride, and even watching how the old drive thrus used to work. However, I didn't find the people at the desk helpful at all, and never heard a peep from them, nor did I feel like I learned very much. For us, it provided a little shelter from the rain while we scoped out a lunch spot.
