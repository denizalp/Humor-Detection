We moved to the Edge of Noda in September 2015 and absolutely love it here.  Maintenance is A1 service..   Even though we have rarely had to use maintenance the times we did call they were here in 15 minutes and were so pleasant and cleaned up when they left. The office managers are so easy to work with and treat us like family.  The apartments are very roomy and fashionable.  I love our new gym and huge pool that even has handicap availability.  The dog park is great.  People keep their area nice and tidy and its great living here and did I mention FREE water!!  5  star apartments!!
