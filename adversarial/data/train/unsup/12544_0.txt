DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR TO THIS SHOP!!!\n\nHorrible. Just horrible. This shop replaced the starter switch on my jeep without my permission. I brought it in to have it checked out ONLY. I would decide later depending on the price.\n\n I had $200 to commit to fixing it at the time and they wanted $400 after they did all the work. I told them that it wasn't possible to pay the full amount so they ask for some collateral. I had no choice so used my ipod after 10min worth of questions about what generation the ipod was.\n\n As soon as I get my truck i cant turn my key back into just \"accessories on mode\" and my amp and sub dont work. In fact they cut the wire leading from my amp to the battery and removed it entirely from the battery terminal. They refused to take any responsibility and even laughed at the situation while i was explaining it.\n\nYou have a better chance of seeing a good Nicholas Cage movie as the winning lottery numbers are read on the radio and get struck by lightning as a terminator travels through time and arrives in that exact theater than getting reliable service in that shop.
