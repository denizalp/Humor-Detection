Man, oh man.  What a great place!  I first experienced Harumi while I was on jury duty.  The sushi was so nice, it actually made jury duty something to look forward to.  I forgot to write a review, even after raving about it for weeks after.  I finally made my way back to downtown again and had to have some sushi.\n\nI'm surely not the only one who turned her nose up at the thought of sushi in the desert.  Living on the coast totally spoils you for the freshest fish possible, and the idea of sushi in Phoenix honestly sort of curled my toes a bit.  But if you're that person doubting sushi in the Sonoran, really think again and give this place a try.  The lunch specials are wonderfully priced, and you will not leave disappointed (or hungry).  Service was so friendly, and the waitress was fun and delightfully sassy - loved her!  \n\nI'd come back here whenever I'm downtown.  And the next time you get that dreaded jury summons notice in the mail, before you think of how you can wiggle out of it, just think of Harumi and smile.  It will make doing your civic duty totally worthwhile!
