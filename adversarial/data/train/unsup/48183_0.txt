Stone and Vine is amazing! I first came here for a business lunch and it was excellent. Since then, I have come back (multiple times) for lunch, happy hour and dinner. I have introduced friends and family and they all love it. Now, every time I come, I get the bruschetta plank. I get the same four every time and they are always perfection; tomato basil, salami & pesto, date & goat cheese, and the fig & almond. Try them, you will not regret it. Recently, my dad ordered the special for the night, it was so incredible, he ordered another for all of us at the table to share. The most impressive part...it was very delicious without being heavy or fatty. It is not easy to have a lot of flavor without a ton of butter and salt and they accomplished this. They provide great service in a beautiful environment. Highly recommend!
