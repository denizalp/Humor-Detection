I visited this Cosi location on a Thursday around 11:30. There was a very long line when I arrived--the rush died down after 1pm. The counter staff was very friendly and appologized when she gave me the wrong change back. I ordered a smoothie and lounged around for several hours. The smoothie was just fine--nothing fancy, just made from a smoothie base. The atmosphere was very comfortable and I was able to find a outlet to plug my laptop into. Free wireless. Definitely an OK experience, but nothing out of the ordinary as far as counter lunch service goes.
