+1 for the dark, angsty, red lighting\n+1 for the beers that were on tap (I got Pyramid something-or-other)\n-1 for the bartender mistaking my order for Pyramid beer for bourbon, neat (?!?) so I guess that's a -1 for noise as well\n+1 for their food, fried and ready as a preventative measure for your next-day hangover\n+1 for lack of crowds during certain off-times (where we still had a great time)\n-1 for the clingy server who guilted us into ordering food as we were just lounging on a couch upstairs at 1 am, not really wanting to eat\n+1 for the people-watching opportunities\n+1 for feeling great about yourself for not being a hipster like most of these guys and gals.\n\nA fun place!
