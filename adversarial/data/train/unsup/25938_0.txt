Just saw the show on 9\/27\/2014. It was great from beginning to end. Do not be late as it starts on time like all Cirque du Soleil shows. But, this show is not like the rest of the Cirque shows. There aren't a lot of acrobatics or death defying stunts. There's more dancing, acting, and comedy and it flows more like a musical. The costumes, props, and sets fit the music soo well. It's very hippie 60's and the set designs I think are meant to make you feel like you're high and hallucinating. Everything is soo colorful and some of it is really weird but somehow goes with what's happening on stage. The music of course was great and was so much fun to sing along to. They have speakers built into the seat's head rest which makes the experience even better. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was my favorite. \nIt's a great show for those that want to see something a little different than what Cirque du Soleil usually does. And there isn't a bad seat in the house since it's not a huge venue like \"KA.\" Even the ones that are 'obstructed view\" were not obstructed at all.
