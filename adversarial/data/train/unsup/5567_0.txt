Thoroughly enjoyed the Valley Ho! Tori B. had a post reception and stayed here after her wedding. We drank in the bar until closing and the bartenders were awesome, quick to take orders and very friendly. \n\nI love the open layout of the bar\/dining\/patio area. We had breakfast here the next morning and the sunlight pouring in the dining area really set the mood for a sunny and beautiful day. \n\nThe food was good. I ordered the bowl of berries (blueberries, blackberries, cherries, raspberries, strawberries) and it was fresh and delicious. I was disappointed in the Croque Madame I ordered, I've had it several places (it is delicious at LGO) and it is one of my favorites. This one was not so good because it was COVERED in béchamel sauce and tasted like stale flour. Not their fault though, it stated it on the menu I just hadn't read it when ordering.\n\nThe rooms at the hotel are very spacious; I was impressed over the size of the bathrooms. The décor is very funky and the glass walls opening on to the balconies created the illusion of a lot of space. The complimentary breakfast bar included espresso and the soap and lotions (Red Flower) smelled like organic heaven.\n\nThe pool area has great cabanas and the atmosphere was different than many Scottsdale Hotels. There were a bunch of families and 20 somethings, but there weren't a lot of fake boobs\/tans ect.. \n\nThe Valley Ho provided a wonderful spot for a greet weekend. I may have to crash it again as the hot weather approaches.
