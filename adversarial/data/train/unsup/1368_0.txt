I came here on a Saturday evening w one of my gfs. Got seated at a deserted corner table in the way back which was fine bc there was a bunch of obnoxious drunks acting a fool up front anyway so yes, seat me far away from those crazies please.\n\nThe waitress came over and took our drink orders which came out fairly quickly, btw. Just as I was about to take a sip, I noticed a nice and shiny strand of HAIR sticking out of it. Oh, how lovely. Proceeded to look around for our waitress for about 20 mins or so but she was nowhere to be found. Actually had to flag down some guy who was clearing out the table next to us and told him the dilemma. He then says \"I believe you and everything but can you point it out to me bc I don't see it.\" Why of course I will. I'll also kindly floss your teeth with it, if you'd like. Like seriously? Ugh. He then goes back and finds our waitress, she asks if I want the bar to make me a new one but I declined. We dipped and went down to RA instead where service was much better, and no hair was found in my drink! \n\nI definitely liked it better when this place used to be Canteen.
