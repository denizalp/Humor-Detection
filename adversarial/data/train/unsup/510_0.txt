I try to review chains on their individual merits. How good is this version in relation to the other clones elsewhere? For TCF, however, they seem to be universally deplorable. It's criminally unhealthy, has the most gigantic and depressing menu I've ever seen in my life, and is, as culinary experiences go, utterly lamentable. I would rather go anywhere else.
