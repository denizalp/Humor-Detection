The $5 pizza.\n\nWhen I entered college, the economy crashed. Restaurants were slashing their prices to remain competitive. That's when the $5 saga began. Who were the apostrophic gladiators?\n\nJamie's Pizza\nHungry Howie's\nGus's Pizza\nLittle Caesar's\nMU Papa John's (from 2009-2010)\n\nObviously Papa John's had the best $5 pizza. However, they didn't deliver and nobody wanted to hang out at the Memorial Union! Plus, the special was during a certain time period (5-9 pm). Then they raised their prices and the entire student body fell into a deep depression.\n\nJamie's Pizza was greasy and fatty, but it was surprisingly good. Have you been scared of going outside at night? Multiply that feeling by 40 and that's how most students felt whenever they had to walk Jamie's Pizza at night.\n\nGus's Pizza! It's extremely greasy and the portions were the largest. However, the quality and taste of the pizza were never consistent.\n\nLittle Caesar's Pizza is.. Uhhh.. Yea, let's not talk about Little Caesar's.\n\nFinally, there was Hungry Howie's Pizza. They delivered with consistent delivery fees. The taste and quality of the pizza were always consistent. The wait for the pizza was always consistent. The people who would stare at you by the liquor store were always consistent.\n\nConsistency is the best word to describe Hungry Howie's Pizza. You'll always get the same bland tasting food. Some will love it and others will hate it. However, their love\/hatred for Hungry Howie's will always be consistent.
