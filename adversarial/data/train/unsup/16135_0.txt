I don't even know how to describe how I felt here. Within 2 minutes of leaving the parking garage, we all knew we had made a mistake. I know that Fremont Street provides the nostalgia of \"old Vegas,\" but it encases all the parts of the city that I can happily do without. In the 30 minutes we wandered around here, I saw more prostitutes and cracked out people than I saw in my whole 5 days on the strip. It was just flat-out awkward.\n\nI agree with the other reviewers that this is a much more low-maintenance spot to drink and gamble in Vegas, but if you're a fan of the more modern, visually pleasing and less tacky Vegas, stick to the strip.
