The Venetian and the Palazzo may be considered Siamese twins, joined at the hip via the Canyon Ranch Spa Club, but the Palazzo is technically superior: it's larger, newer, and cleaner. \n\nAnd yet...I think 75% of the time, we find ourselves staying at the Venetian. Why? Mostly because a typical day in Vegas for us means getting breakfast at Bouchon Bakery, then shopping, then lunching at the Grand Lux Cafe, then relaxing at the pool, waiting for our food to digest before squeezing in a workout and hitting a show (that's usually in or near the Venetian). Our nights usually end with a late dinner and drinks (often times at the Grand Lux again because it's open 24 hours).\n\nBouchon Bakery and Grand Lux Cafe are mere footsteps away from the room elevators. America's coolest Walgreen's is just right outside the hotel. The Canal Shoppes are in the hotel grounds and provide a good mix of fantasy window shopping and things we actually can afford (Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, etc). And if we need to hit the department stores, Fashion Show Mall is right across the street. When it comes to getting our fitness on, the Canyon Ranch Spa has an entire floor dedicated to cardio machines and a room just for weights. And finally, the hotel is right smack between Caesar's Palace and Wynn\/Encore (if you wish to go any farther south or north, respectively, though, walking may not be the best option, depending on the weather and\/or your shoes).\n\nTruthfully, the rooms in the Venetian are a bit outdated and it's not nearly as grand or as pretty as the Wynn (which in my opinion is hands down the most beautiful hotel in Vegas). But it's honestly good enough and has got everything we want whenever we are staying in Vegas. Could not ask for more!
