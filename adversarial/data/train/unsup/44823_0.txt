One of the worst coffee shop experiences I have had.\n\nI will be brief, and I will start with a positive... The space is amazing. It is really cool, and many details seemed well thought out. \n\nService and product were not great.\n\nI ordered a cappuccino, it was not good. I also bought a scone, which wasn't given to me, but instead was sold to the man behind me. They offered to give me another pastry with my drink, but they already had sold it as well to a woman a couple orders ahead of me. Long story short, no pastry, and no offer for a refund. They said they would give me a pastry next time I came in, however, I don't want to go back in. \n\nAside from the pastry and coffee, the man at the register seemed ready to go home, and the woman that was the barista was friendly but did not seem to know much about coffee. \n\nI can get over bad coffee and loss of a pastry. The main thing that takes me back to a business is the staff\/owners passion and service.\n\nMaybe one day I will try songbird again.
