I have been eating at this venerable PHX landmark since i was in wonzies... okay so that may have explained my burgeoning childhood obesity. I dont care, layer on the calories, this place reminds me of everything i love about America and Phoenix. I doubt i could feel more comfortable than sitting with a cold one, wings and a chk cheese steak (mushrooms, onions, sweet\/hot peppers and ex cheese please) watching some sports at uncle sams. I really think this place maintains an elite status as my best hoagie ever. Statement. Do yourself a favor, go, get a cheese steak, wings and maybe some pizza. Oh and the waitress which range from haggered to hot wear tiny skirts, dinner and a show baby.
