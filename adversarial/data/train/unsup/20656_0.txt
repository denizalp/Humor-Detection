VIBE\nJapanese Rockabilly. If your reaction is, \"whatever THAT is...\" than I suggest you visit this joint and see firsthand. \nDown to earth and certainly not polished, but not overly divey either. \nCozy, but not so small you're bumping into everyone.  \nI'm not a regular, but my impression is that a lot of people in the bar are. Those that come alone are friends of the bartender. Those that are down to mingle with new people sit at the bar. \n\nPINBALL\nTakes quarters. Exists. Nuff said. \n\nMUSIC.\nJuke Box also takes quarters. Limited selection offers Frank Sinatra, Wanda Jackson, The Zombies, The Platters, Sam Cooke...you get the idea. The rough thing is that sometimes it doesn't actually play your song choice. The nice thing is that, again, it's only 25cents. \nWhen the Juke Box isn't playing, it switches over to the bartender's ipod which is always excellent. \n\nLIBATIONS. \nDrinks have a Japanese focus, with Sapporo on tap and a varied list of sake-based coctails. I like the 'Sakura' quite a bit. \n\nNice patrons. Nice bartenders. \nGreat atmosphere. Great music. Great drinks.
