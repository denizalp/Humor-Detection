I was in the area and decided that I would try this place out for once. Talk about crazy coincidences a middle school classmate works here but I didn't get to tell him that I remembered him from school because he disappeared about the time I left. But yay excitement over that!\n\nI saw the $5 August deal here on Yelp, so the first thing that came out of my mouth to my wonderful waiter is that hun, I want whatever it is you have for five bucks. There was more options than just the vegetables and couscous, but I ordered it anyway since I'm on this vegetable binge of mine. And my waiter was so nice to point out that this place has wondeful brunch drink specials, I got a bloody mary (I use to start my days out with these!) for a buck! Holy heck, if I didn't have to drive afterwards, you know I would have been all over that drink special!! And the drink, in its tall and slender glass, was A LOT. I just remember thinking, I've been sipping on this for over an hour, when is it going to go down?! Alas, I finished it, most of those wonderful chips and various salsas (I absolutely loved the Chipotle one), and my veggie dish. OMP, Ticoz made me eat my carrots... and I loved it! Great tasting and very filling lunch, def will have to go here after getting out of the salon, turn it into some form of a ritual. Cuz you kno I gets hungry after gettin' my haurs did...sorry, I didn't just say that, omit omit omit!!!
