A lot of people come here for the Italian beef sandwiches. I come for the polish sausage. I did try a Italian beef with peppers and without and it is a damn good sandwich. The sandwich was dipped in au jus and the beef was tender. I liked it with the spicy peppers better. The sausages here are cooked just right. Great flavor and the grilled onions were a great addition to it. The fries didn't look appetizing when I first saw them but they taste really good! One disappointing and even laughable thing was the tamale I ordered. It's straight up microwaved!!! It was even given to me still in the plastic wrapper. Fail. It looked wrong and tasted like garbage. Good thing the Italian beef, polish sausage, and fries are worth coming back for because the tamale sure isn't.
