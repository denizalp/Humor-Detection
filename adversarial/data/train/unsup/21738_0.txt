We went here for a quick dinner and we got what we wanted. Most importantly, the air conditioning was working so the initial experience was refreshing and we were able to enjoy the difference between the outside and inside temperatures.\n\nIf you have not been to Tokyo Joe's before, all you have to do is choose what you want, mosey up to the counter and order. There are lots of choices. If you don't know what to order just have one of their speciality bowls.\n\nI ordered a poke bowl with ahi tuna and white rice. I know, I should have ordered the brown rice but I wanted white rice. The rice was light and complemented the meal well. I also had the Hawaiian sauce and a bunch of added toppings and flavor bits (ginger, wontons).\n\nThey have quite a good selection of drinks including beer. They also serve sushi and salads and other bowls.
