I hate to do this but this \"meal\" has my blood boiling. We ordered five medium rare steaks of varying cuts and the meat was completely raw. The steaks, I'm sure, have been frozen for months before being served. Inedible would've been a compliment for this meat. Overpriced and terrible. The song Hurt by Johnny Cash is requisite listening after visiting this establishment. \n\nThe service, however, was wonderful. The waitress was charming and quick.
