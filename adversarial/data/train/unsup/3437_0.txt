This Marshall's location is very clean! Even the shopping carts are clean, (unlike Home Goods at Arrowhead which has filthy carts!) The employees at this location are very nice and friendly.\n\nDecent selection and the displays are pretty tidy. Prices are pretty decent on a variety of merchandise. The parking was also plentiful.
