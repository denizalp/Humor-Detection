This place was great. I went in at around 6pm for a self watch. They gave me a lot of guidance and I really did need it. I got my German Shepard a nice hot oil treatment and a blueberry facial. his coat has never been softer. They also had, along with many other selections, Argan oil coat spray for when you're all done. They have a great variety of brushes and a few different shampoos. I kind of used a mixture of tee tree and shed control shampoo. I also bought a pretty big bottle of this stuff that you put in your dogs water to help with bad breath and dental health (I can't remember what its called) I had an over all great experience. The wash its self was $13 and the hot oil was an extra $5. totally worth it. The bottle of dog breath solution was $15 a good price for a product that works so well. I highly recommend this place.
