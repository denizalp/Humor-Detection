As Mateo said below, hands down the best outdoor market I've been to on the North American continent. Rows and rows of beautiful produce in the middle, and a fantastic array of shops & eateries rimming the square. I was bowled over.  Any and every culinary wish comes true here. One of my most exciting purchases was a bag of  \"cerises de terre\", something that I've never seen in America before, sweet, almost candy-like little berries enclosed in a brown papery-leaf shell of sorts. Not every day do you get to encounter a brand new fruit! A great time and a great amount of time was passed gawking at all the market had to offer.
