The most fascinating thing for me about this place is watching the preparation of noodles and dumplings. I always try to get the table across the glass window through which I can watch them prepare noodles and dumplings. However, there will be periodic \"thud...thud...thud...thud....\" sound when they knead the dough before stretching it to make the noodles. \n\nThe only meat I eat is chicken. So, there are not many options for me on the menu. I usually get the veggie noodles and  dumplings. Though the options are limited, I still go there for two reasons. One reason is the fresh and subtle flavours of the noodles and the delicious broth. Secondly, for the best dumplings I ever had.
