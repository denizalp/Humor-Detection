Panini can go one way or the other. AMAZING or just WHATEVER. There's a lot of mediocre paninis out there, and a part of me may have given up a bit. Gotta try the TUPS when I'm in the area, right?\n\nThe SPICY SKYLAR is THE ULTIMATE for those who love a kick and spicy foods. It was so amazingly delicious, I quickly regretted swapping my half with her grilled cheese panini with bell peppers. It was NOT even a comparison to have a sandwich full of flavor from the meats, to the mayo and butter on the bread, and the extra kick, followed by this super SIMPLE (kinda bland after eating something so flavorful) grilled cheese sandwich. Now, I'm not knocking it out. If I've never had a car, I'd be content with a civic. But if I've test driven a BMW, the Civic is gonna be plain. \n\nThis sandwich was in fact so good that I wanted to come back the next day to eat it one more time. It is VERY filling, and half is enough. \n\nMY AWARD TO BEST PANINI OF MY LIFE goes to TUPS. I would love to come back and try their tuna sandwich and the melts. MMM MM GOOOOOOOD.
