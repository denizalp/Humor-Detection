Nice atmosphere, nice try...terrible service, mediocre food. Sorry. Was expecting a higher standard of hospitality in a place like this.\n\nWe were ushered in like VIPs and then completely forgotten. We have now been sitting here for 30 minutes staring at our empty glasses and dirty plates waiting on our second course. Any expectations set by the standard of service at the door have not been met. Great job, host stand! Not so much everyone else.\n\nOh and now they just brought our first course for the second time. It just gets better and better. Our glasses are still empty. The seat numbers have been wrong, the coursing has been ass-backwards...oh god...I do this for a living and I feel like an asshole. I'm embarrassed about how upsetting this is and that is just not an emotion I should be feeling in a place of this caliber and price tag. Holy moly this is bad.
