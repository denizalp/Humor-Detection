The entire staff is extremely helpful and kind. This location is constantly updating their services with new and upgraded beds. They have everything you can imagine; Red light therapy, HotWorx, Mystic tanning, UV tanning, Slim capsule, Hydration station, teeth whitening, and so much more!! I highly recommend this location to anyone in Las Vegas.
