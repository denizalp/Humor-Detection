Macaron was great!\n\n\"Fun-fetti\" cake wasn't that flavorful. Frosting kinda tastes oily, cake wasn't super moist. Better bring your own fork if you want togo.... or eat with your hands.\n\nFancy-schmancy place with high prices, low selection and no reason to be special. Looks like they spend more time and money on the storefront than the cakes.
