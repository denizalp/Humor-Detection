Had a craving for fish tacos and we went here to try it out based on pretty good Yelp reviews. Delicious tacos and tortilla chips!!! Friendly staff there too. Good portions, the nachos plate was huge and super filling! Only lost one star because...there is no washroom there. Better come in with clean hands since you are eating with your hands!
