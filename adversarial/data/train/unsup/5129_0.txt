As a diehard BabyStacks fan, I got myself over to the new location this morning with my partner in crime, taking advantage of the Yelp deal being offered.  The second cafe is bigger than the first and there was no wait, but I'm sure that won't last long once word gets out that the new joint has arrived.  I'm happy to report that we received the same great customer service and the same delicious food.  My regular order of Cinnabun pancakes, scrambled eggs, and hash browns arrived at our table in no time at all.  Bob Marley was blasting as I savored each delicious bite--what more can a Yelping gal like me ask for except...more?  Keep it up, BabyStacks crew and mahalo!
