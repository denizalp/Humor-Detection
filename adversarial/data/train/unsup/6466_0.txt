Part 1:\nI'm glad they gave me a new Service Manager last year.  Shaun is pleasant to deal with.  My window is stuck again (3rd time in 2 years) so I called yesterday to schedule an appointment.  Got an 8am appointment and my car won't be ready until 12pm.  I was offered a ride to the office but I won't get picked up from the office back to the dealer til 3pm so I opted to wait.\n\nThey have a big-screen TV, coffee, breakfast pastries and free wi-fi here at the lounge - that's pretty much all I need to keep me sane for the 4-hour wait.  They normally give me a free car wash and I hope they do have time to wash my car despite having a lot of people here today.\n\nThey give me free BMW stuff too: mugs, water bottle, keychain.  I won't hesitate buying another BMW with this kind of service.\n\n***I gave Desert BMW Las Vegas 4 stars on my original review but after coming back to pick up my car, the experience turned sour***\n\nPart 2:\nAfter waiting 4 hours for my car, I came back and my car was ready and parked in front.  Cashier tells me the paperwork isn't ready...but why would my car be in front already if the paperwork isn't ready???  I called Shaun to see what's going on.  Crystal put me on hold for 15 minutes before I was told he was at lunch but he did say he left my key and paperwork in front with the cashier.  I went back to the cashier and she was nowhere to be found.  She came back after 5 minutes talking on her cellphone.  My paperwork was sitting on her desk the whole time!  WTF?  They need to get rid of her.  She's not pleasant to look at and gives poor customer service!
