My husband and I dined there on Valentines day. First time there and very disappointing. I ordered the sea bass, they were out of it, understandable for a holiday. So I opted for the NY steak with tiger prawn for $38. We had crab cake app, average. I ordered the lobster bisque, had no lobster in it. my husband had cesear salad,it was ok. it took a long time for the courses to come out, still understandable for a holiday. He ordered the scallops, it was good. My steak was the worst steak I've ever had. It was a fatty piece of cheap meat, with little tiny chopped up pieces of shrimp on top. If I had scooped the pieces together it would be a half dollar size. I asked the waitress doesn't this include tiger prawn? She responded its chopped up in the sauce. I thought it was a spice, didn't taste like shrimp. It was like they ran out of shrimp and used one las remaining shrimp for 3 steaks, very disappointing. Needless to say, I will never be back! $120 for a very subpar restaurant! The service was good, but the cooks need lessons on how to cook!
