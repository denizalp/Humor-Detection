Upon entering this restaurant, you might think it's a little old looking.. But fret not!\n\nThe food is fantastic, with excellent portions and even more excellent prices. The staff are friendly, helpful and are always happy to have you there. \n\nI highly recommend this spot and have been here several times with no complaints!
