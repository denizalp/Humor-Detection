Union Grill is conveniently located on South Craig, just a short walk from CMU.  However, until a friend pointed this place out, I never noticed it.\n\nMy friends suggested we come here, but the restaurant was packed on our first attempt. However, at 6:00 on a Monday night, the place was mostly deserted.  I ordered a crab cake sandwich ($12.99). The crab cake was OK, not the best and not the worst. However, they forgot the lemon sauce that was supposed to be included. This could have been an easy fix, but the waitress did not come back to check on the food.  Otherwise, the waffle fries were fine.  The meals are served on trays, which seemed a little low class for the price.\n\nAs already mentioned, the service was lackluster. The waitress we had was also negligent in that she did not offer to split the bill. Again, we made do.  Additionally, I found that the language of the menu was off putting. Both the $10 wine list and dessert menu come with the requirement of ordering an entree.  I don't mind this for the discounted wine, but it just felt a bit over the top for dessert.\n\nI wouldn't suggest Union Grill to anyone, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning either.
