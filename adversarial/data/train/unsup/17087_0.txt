First, let me just say this place is under new ownership. \nThat being said, I've noticed that the girl who normally works mornings is still there (for the most part). She's what makes visits to this place for breakfast so pleasant. She is familiar with the menu and is more than accommodating when it comes to special requests (for example, if I don't want the tortilla on a burrito, she makes it a \"burrito bowl\"). \nEvery time I come in when she isn't working and the owners are there, I always have to argue with them about how I want a breakfast burrito minus the tortilla...in a bowl. They always try to ring me up (and charge me more) for their breakfast skillet option (which is NOT the same).\nThese people wanted to come in and purchase this restaurant, but not become familiar with the offerings of the restaurant. That's why I give it 3 stars. Other than that...since the cooks are still the same, the food is still amazing.
