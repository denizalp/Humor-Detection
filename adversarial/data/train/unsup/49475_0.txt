This place is amazing. It is high quality southern style food. I took my boyfriend here (who was born and raised in the south) and even he was extremely impressed with how well done the food was. You can't go wrong with the chicken and waffles, but you definitely must get a side of their biscuits! To die for. I will be going back for sure. Also, it is expensive, but compared to a lot of places on the strip this isn't badly priced, especially for how much food you get.
