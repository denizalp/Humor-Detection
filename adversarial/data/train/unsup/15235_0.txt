So please call me, baby\nWherever you are\nIt's too cold to be out walking in the streets\nWe do crazy things when we're wounded\nEveryone's a bit insane\nI don't want you catching your death of cold\nOut walking in the rain\n\n-Tom Waits\n\nWhat I thought of when I installed and used this app.  Pretty great considering cabs in this city BLOW.  They will take you OUT of Downtown but to get one going INTO downtown takes an hour (if they show up at all)!  Free to install and it basically shows you the drivers they have on a map who use their service.  Find one near the overpriced, den of cheese-dickery hotspot your at or the one to the closest rub-and-tug you may have found yourself in at 4am.  Depends on how you wyle out.  You can link a credit card, Paypal or Google Wallet to it.  You can add a tip and pay all on app.  No cash involved.  Pretty sweet.  Prices are overall cheaper than the traditional meter running.  Flat rate, upfront. Only thing that would make it better would be if David Johansen was driving and we were all Bill Murray.  Try it out.  Dont worry Buffy, it will take you back to \"River\"!  It also goes to the East Side but who actually goes there?
