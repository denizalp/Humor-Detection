I have used this Homeowners Plumbing Supply store many times.  The owner is exceptional.  I have come in with parts that people at big chain stores have never seen and can't replace.  This guy knew in 2 seconds what it was, who manufactured it, how long ago it was being used in the valley and he gave me the correct parts.  I was in and out in a couple minutes.  This is not just a one time experience...I have had similar experiences on multiple occasions.  I highly recommend this store and the personnel in the store.
