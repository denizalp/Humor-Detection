I love this location! The staff is friendly and quick, even when the place is packed. The only thing that's not too great is the parking lot because it's shaped strange and it's rather small.\n\nThis is one of the few locations that can get my order right. I always order the Citrus Squeeze, Make it Light. Citrus Squeeze is one of the classics that's no longer posted on the menu. No one can ever seem to figure out how to make it light, but this location can!\n\nNever any issues, great staff. Highly recommend!
