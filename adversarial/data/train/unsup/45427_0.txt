I usually go to Patisserie Manon in Summerlin to get macarons but saw they opened this location which is a bit closer to me. I figured I would get some of my favorite salted caramel macarons. I was so surprised when I pulled up and saw the sign Drive Thru Now Open. My one year old had fallen asleep in the back and I hate carrying her in just to get cookies. I LIVE for drive - thru windows and I wished every business had one as it is such a hassle to wrestle my small kids out to run in somewhere for 5 minutes. Now I can get my macarons at a drive- thru. How awesome is that! Their croissants and cakes are also excellent.
