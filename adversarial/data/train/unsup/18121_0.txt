They have a truck, they sell cupcakes, the cupcakes are pretty big, and they're fairly cheap.\n\nI tried them at SN Truck Stop a few weeks back, while the 2 off the menu I wanted were not there that week, the ones I got were pretty good. \n\nIn a city full of cupcake shops, I'm shocked they are the first cupcake truck. Will I go out of my way for their cupcakes, probably not, but they're a nice touch for dessert while I'm grabbing some truck eats
