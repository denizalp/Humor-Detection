Store is awesome itself, you can almost find everything here! I mainly go her for computer parts, there's just so much parts here and the prices are decent, cheaper than Best Buy. I knock off a star because the bathrooms are always dirty and smell like a public porta-potty all the time, and a lot of the staff are just plain awkward. Not very sociable.
