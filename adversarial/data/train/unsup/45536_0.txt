We were greeted by a very friendly woman, who asked a few qualifying questions.\nShe introduced us to Nelson.\nNelson was outstanding. Young guy, very capable, and knows his RV's, having worked for one of the competitors for several years. He asked all the right questions, and mostly had the answers. My wife and I really enjoyed our experience with Nelson and look forward to completing a purchase with him.\n\nThe *only* reason that this place didn't get 5 stars, was that I walked over to the Parts dept to purchase a part. The three parts guys were debating Trump and Clinton. I stood there behind them for a good 5 mins and finally the biggest of the three says \"You look like you have a question?\" I told him I did, but before I could ask it, the fat guy behind the counter started back in on Clinton\/Trump. I stood for about 30 seconds more and walked away. George came over and says \"I'm punched out, but I'll try to help you.\" I responded that I wanted to give my money to a business that wanted my money rather than blow me off for a meaningless political debate. Fat guy waddled over and asked what I was looking for, and didn't have a clue what I was describing. I finally had to go over to one of his display units, pull out the part I needed, and show it to him. He'd \"never seen that before.\" \n\nStrange, as half the coaches in his store have the same part.\n\n\n[edit 8\/29]\nToday I received a \"Thank you\" followup email from the salesperson we'd spoken with. He not only referred to the units he'd shown us, but also had a suggestion for an upgraded unit that Blue Dog doesn't currently have in stock. Super, super impressed with this place and with this sales person in particular.
