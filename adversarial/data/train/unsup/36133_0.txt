I can't speak to the service because my husband brought me this home, but the food is really meh.  I had a southwest inspired salad with chicken and the meat was dry and over seasoned.  The salsa dressing was canned green chilis and maybe some vinegar or something.  It was not a great combo.  I still have half of it in the fridge and will most likely not be returning to it.  I even tried to bring it more to life by adding some cheese, brown rice, corn and sour cream and it was still just not good because of the dry, over seasoned chicken and not very good dresing.  If I had a lime I would have added some lime juice to tone down the bitter in the chicken seasoning.  I don't think I will return to this place.
