Beautiful store does not define the quality of a watch.  I was contemplating whether to buy a Rolex or Breitling.  I ended up buying Breitling due more casual look; within 3 months I realized this was a terrible decision.\n\nMy watch dial spring broke within first 3 months and I contacted Breitling USA to have it repaired.  WITHIN 3 MONTHS THE WATCH BROKE.  I was livid, yes.  I sent in the watch right away and received my watch back within 2-3 weeks.\n\nNow I've had watch watch repaired 1 month ago and now it stopped running so I try to make it run using my dial.  It started running again but now the watch seems it is not charging while wearing the watch.\n\nTime accuracy is another problem, I set my watch upon receiving the watch and a week later for some odd reason my watch was off 3 minutes.  I realized this when I was going to the meeting and I was late few minutes.  I then test this problen by setting time using my iPhone.  A week later, I realize the watch was off by 3 minutes.  PRECISION, ACCURACY, DURABLE, all out the window.\n\nI called PAMELA *my sales rep* at the boutique.  I mentioned about the the problem, and she says \"since you went through Breitling USA, go through them\" so after you sell the watch the responsibility or A\/S is totally out the window.  I mentioned about well known name brand being broken within 3 months is unheard of hence I want to have my watch replaced instead of keep having it shipped to repair (being without 3 weeks is also inconvenient although I do have different pairs)  PAMELA says \"I am sorry to hear that but you have to go through Breitling USA\"\n\nI was furious because of PAMELA's response.  She says \"If you look at the first repair invoice, it says there are scratches on your watch\"  I was very upset by her response, I wore the watch on special occasions such as graduation and wedding I have preserved this watch very well.  PLEASE SEE THE PIC (just took the picture while writing this)\n\nMy friend and I did plenty of research online and I can say.  Do youself a favor and go with Rolex, Paneri or if you can afford it, AP or RM.\n\nI am so disappointed with breitling.  I am.  In college, I used to think about Breitling Navi timer so much, this is a huge DISAPPOINTMENT to me.\n\nAs I have told all my friends about this problem and they were with me during my purchase.  One of my friend went with Rolex and have not had any problem at all.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY BREITLING!!!
