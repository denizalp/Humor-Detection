This course is just ok. Sure, there are some beautiful sights to see and it is amazing what Steve Wynn and the course designers did with all the elevation changes and trees, but it is WAY too expensive for some really boring golf. I can't believe Steve gets away with charging what he does. Don't get me wrong , I'm glad I played it, because it may be gone in a few years. The real estate it's built on is way too valuable to keep a golf course on. Go and try it out if you have about 5 one hundred dollar bills burning a hole in your Paul Smith or LV wallet.
