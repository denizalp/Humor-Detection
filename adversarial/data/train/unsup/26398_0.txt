We have stayed here many times, this is my last time. I will say the the room was clean.  That's the end of the good part. The service is the coffee shop is terrible. Last night it took almost two hours to get served and eat a simple meal. Remember this is NOT gourmet dining. This morning we were seated promptly then waited over 15 minutes to try to get a cup of coffee while the service people were busy talking to each other. We left with no comment from anyone. Should be no stars but the room was clean. The poor service has happened on previous visits, but it won't happen again. We will never go back. There are a lot of places that want your business, these people simply don't care.
