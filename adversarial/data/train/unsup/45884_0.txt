Had a great visit to this location.  We are platinum members in Colorado and stopped by here.  Our host Michelle was very kind and efficient to get us to a bay and playing.  She was very friendly and knowledgable!  Our server Betsy was fantastic also!  Great to talk with, suggested great beers for us to try and very attentive!  Then of course the place and games are a blast!  Food left a bit to be desired, but with Michelle and Betsy you couldn't do better!
