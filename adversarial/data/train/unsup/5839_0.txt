Nobody likes to hear that awful screeching from your breaks going out on the car...all I hear is money...leaving my wallet. \nI stopped into Brake Masters and the guys were all very helpful. They did a complimentary brake inspection. It turned out that my front brakes were completely worn out. \nI didn't have time to get them fixed that day so they gave me a printed quote and told me to come back asap. \nI returned two days later and they remembered me and my car right away. I dropped the car off and they called a few hours later saying it was ready. They honored the original price quote and actually gave me a discount. They never tried to sell me anything extra. \nThanks guys for making this a great experience.
