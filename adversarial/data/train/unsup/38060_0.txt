I came across Lola's Gelato because I was looking for the closest retailer that sold Holy Cannoli's. I called ahead to make sure they still had some before making the trip and the owner\/manager was nice enough to pipe some so they'd be ready by the time I got there. The shop is very simple and clean. I'm glad I came by because I noticed they had Ferrero Rocher gelato! When the weather is warmer I am definitely returning and going through their whole selection of gelato's. So many flavours to try!
