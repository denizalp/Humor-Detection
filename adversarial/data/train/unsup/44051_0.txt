We have always loved Olive Garden, but I will never return to this one.  It has really gone downhill over the past few years.  The drinks all tasted terrible.  The Coke did not taste right.  I paid for a frozen drink, and it was awful.  We asked for dressing on the side and got it on the salad.  We asked for a bread refill and never got it.  The marina sauce was so spicy it tasted (and looked) like salsa.  The floors were filthy.  We walked out with most of the food and drink still on the table.
