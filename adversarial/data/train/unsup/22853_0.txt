This is our 4th year in a row coming to Vegas for EDC week in June. I've stayed at a few different hotels ranging from a suite at the formerly known PH Towers, South Point Hotel, Suite at Treasure Island, Stratosphere and now Mirage. I'd have to say that without a doubt the best overall experience I've had was at the Mirage. I do think their rooms are a tiny bit over priced for the week we were there however. The hotel itself has nice amenities and we loved the pool (The do need more servers at the pools however). We tried most of the restaurants inside and the only one we did not like was the Carnegie Deli. The Carnegie Deli is a huge blemish on this hotel. They are very disorganized, slow and the foot options just don't all really make a lot of sense. We tried it last year and gave it another go this year and had almost identical bad experiences. As for the rest of the hotel the rest of the staff was always friendly and we had no problems. \n\nThe beds in this hotel are down right amazing! I think we are going to order one of their pillow and comforter sets they sell in the hotel shop. \n\nOur biggest complaint would be the night club. Each night we returned to our hotel there were always some very unsavory individuals lurking about that had just left the club. One night a man was making very inappropriate gestures at my girlfriend making her very uncomfortable. Other nights there were just people being really loud and obnoxious coming from there, making her and I both a bit uneasy. We would love to see a dance music based night club in there. \n\nGreat job Mirage, I think we will be back!
