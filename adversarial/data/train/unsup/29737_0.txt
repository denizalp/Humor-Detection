I took my BMW 760li to these guys. I had a horrible experience. Long story short, the job they did was very mediocre and unprofessional. I wish i had just kept my car the way it was. Im writing this honest review to help others to not make the same mistake i made, They wrapped the car where it wasn't supposed to be wrapped and left chrome and paint where it was supposed to be wrapped. If you have a high end car, i wouldn't recommend these guys.
